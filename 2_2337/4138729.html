			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night is never calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge roar can’t be heard from the castle. There will always be a huge fireball that rushes into the sky and turns into a black smoke. The entire castle has been reflected in the fire, in the fire, faintly visible several figures flashed on the window or tower. Occasionally a huge explosion will throw a few pieces of gravel high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of Sayi City are standing on the street, regardless of the cold of the night wind. They are holding a kitchen knife and a shovel. If Rogge fails to defeat the devil's hand, they will desperately fight the ancient demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would rather die in rebellion than fall in escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ran wildly in the castle. Suddenly, he suddenly nailed it in place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall next to it silently broke a big hole, the huge death sorcerer ghosts stick out, and it’s sticking to Rogge’s chest, in Rogge The elf has a deep nick on the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Rogge reacts a little slower, the scythe will open his chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the battle, Rogge knows, *** actually is really killing! He did not know that it was the first time that he had passed away with the god of death. Several of these dodge relied entirely on his intuition and instinct, and it was far beyond his usual ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unrelenting death slasher suddenly turned a corner without reason, and hooked to Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flashed a silver magic light shield on his left arm, which blocked the death sickle. With this force, Rogge swept back and jumped into a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of exclamation came, Rogge hit a soft body. He looked back and turned out to be an elf guardian. Her hands were tied and she was hanging on the roof. This guardian warrior has broken the armor, the spring is dying, and a pair of white long legs and one are exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already the fifth elf guardian warrior who has been hoisted. In addition to the wind butterfly, now only Rogge is fighting alone. The fat man knows that Wind Butterfly can't support it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty is completely unappreciated to appreciate this fragrant and stimulating picture, his eyes flashing with silver glare, searching for ghosts like * **. *** did not use the use of space gaps such as instantaneous movements, her fascinating body shape is completely because of her unimaginable height and movement that seems to be unaffected by gravity and inertia. If it relies on the naked eye to capture the action of the ***, the martial arts plain Rogge does not know how many holes have been thrown by her death slashing knife. *** I don't know what method I used, but I can avoid Rogge's mental search. Just a moment before the attack, her sharply rising energy will still cause a wave of ripples in Rogge's spiritual world. The fat man can therefore support this for many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has no intention of saving this elf. He looked around and tried to escape through the window. Right here, a huge black flame appeared quietly behind Rogge, and the death sickle silently extended from the black flame and hooked to Rogge's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly saw a trace of panic in the eyes of the elf warrior, his heart moved, his left arm erected, and the silver magic light shield was dangerously blocked. Death sickle! A silver spear suddenly appeared in his right hand, and the backhand stabbed the black flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The death of the sickle is recovered, and the silver spear of Rogge is opened. The huge force will force the fat man out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current *** has become a huge black flame, fully in line with her image of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has tried, his death energy and the black magical flame of Elysses are completely ineffective against ***. Only an attack that is directly condensed by mental power will evade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is moving like a ghost in the castle, and he is circling through various terrains. Although the defeat is only a matter of time, he really does not want to be brought up by the sickle of the ***! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has completely abandoned any large magic that requires a mantra, and instead casts a low-level magic that does not require any spell gestures and is directly driven by mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver light shield of his left arm is extremely powerful, blocking every attack of the Death Scythe, and all kinds of silver light balls and throwing spears will occasionally be in him. The right hand is condensed to counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the Elf Warriors, only the wind butterfly has combat power. *** I attacked her twice when she passed by her side. The martial arts high-spirited wind butterfly actually blocked the *** attack, which made the *** also unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, luck won't have a third time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge black flame once again appeared in front of the wind butterfly. A white raw fiber stretched out in the black flame and directly gripped the neck of the wind butterfly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracting any ugly giant claw from the black flame will not surprise the wind butterfly! She can't believe her eyes! Is this really the hand of this ancient devil? Is this so soft and handy that people dare not touch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the instinct of the battle made the wind butterfly sway a huge wheel saw, slanting to the hand, and her heart was so faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is indeed the devil's hand, exactly the right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unbelievable eyes of the wind butterfly, this hand holds the sharp sawtooth of her wheel saw, but it is not hurt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge force came, the wind butterfly's wheel saw flew to the sky, penetrated the ceiling, and fell into the upper room. The huge black flame in front of the wind butterfly suddenly disappeared, and then she slammed her neck and slowly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is complaining, he has already given up all his potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver light flashed out of the castle, followed by a huge black flame. In the night, the deadly scythe, which is difficult to distinguish with the naked eye, screams and slashes from all aspects to Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver light shield appeared behind Rogge's side, blocking the blow of the Death Scythe that did not know when it came out. At the same time, a silver magical array appeared behind him with Rogge's thoughts. From the center of the magical array, several silver bands of light were stretched out, and the lightning strikes the path of the death sickle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge finally hit ***! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flashed into a room, leaning against the corner of the wall, unable to breathe, the bean's sweat fell from his forehead, his head slammed Dip on the forehead. He wiped the sweat from his face, but he wiped a blood. He didn't know when he had a wound on his head. There were more than ten wounds in the whole body, and it was fortunate that he was temporarily sealed with magic. This time, the *** is not merciless. If it is not his instinctive reaction that blocks her several lightning and lightning attacks, Rogge is really skeptical, and now he will not be a living person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no longer considered the *** as a mage pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and just got ready to stand up and change places, but suddenly froze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The smack of the ‘妖莲’ glove is sticking out from behind Rogge silently. The long, smooth lines of the demon lotus completely illuminate the outline of the *** hand, but each of her slender fingers has a prismatic protrusion on the back, flashing a chilling cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The hand is gently stroking Rogge's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge swallowed helplessly, and his strength was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get! *** The index finger gently buckles the throat section of Rogge, the fat body immediately shocked, his face pale, screamed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is never a deadly person, but even afraid of death is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when the hand of *** has disappeared, but Rogge still can’t control his body, panting in the corner of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge smiled helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the devil’s re-sealing, the citizens have a carnival! However, looking at the bruises that were bruised and weak, and the standing stations were unstable, the crowd was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil seal has been around for two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the day is not yet bright, Rogge has already got up. He walked up to the huge balcony of the bedroom and looked at the still-sleeping city of Sayi by the slight morning light. He stretched out, and the morning breeze made him wake up a lot. He licked the sun, and there are still a lot of business to deal with today. The tax official, Will, is a good helper, but he is still too busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the service of an elf warrior, Rogge changed his clothes and walked down the third floor. Now he uses his authority to ask these elf warriors to take turns to serve him. Although the elves are a bit stupid in this respect, the delicate face and shyness can make up for everything. Now a familiar elf, Rogge can already hold a little teasing in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the wind butterfly became increasingly rampant after that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her eyes are still determined and there are no signs of submission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge feels that he is a little underestimating the will of the elf. Maybe it is necessary to change the strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped into the office of Count Luck, sitting on a comfortable large chair, and an elf brought in the good breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at everything in this large office. Although the city of Sayi is located in the most remote area of ​​the Ayre Principality, the family of Luck is obviously very historical. The furnishings here are all antique, and at first glance it is known as the fine art from the South. Although this office is not as luxurious as his time at the Hammer of the God of War, it is rich in history and culture. This is two tools that the nobility often used to suppress the tyrants. The tyrants can only help nothing about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, sitting here, Rogge can always feel the taste of power. The power to put more than 10,000 people in the palm of your hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge tastes a wine that is not too good in quality, but he breathes a sigh of relief and says to himself: "More than 10,000 collars People, some can't take it. But it's better than nothing! One million, ten million are not all made up of one thousand? Let's take it slowly!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door knocked at the door of the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will walked in behind a wizard warrior. He held a tall pile of documents in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, according to your instructions, I brought the contract of the Earl of Luck's industry. I made a list for your convenience. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the list and took two contracts and looked at it. This Weir is really good. It is very talented for numbers and accounting, and it is very effective. Being a tax official in this small city is a bit of a cursive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the contract and said something unexpectedly: "I really can’t see it, Count Luck actually has so many industries. The city is almost a little faster. It is his industry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults...." Will speaks and stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glanced at him and said with interest: "What do you think, even if you say it!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult" Weir has the courage to say, "I am very happy to take over the entire city of Sayi and .... and accept the industry of Count Luck, and all the people living here. After all, you rescued all the people from the devil's ear. However, Lord Rogge, you have to completely accept the territory of Count Luck, there seem to be some obstacles in the small law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not interested in the industry of Luck. But you know, you want to stop the resurrection of the ancient demon Amaro, only the elves live here, rely on them The lineage can suppress the power of the demon. But the elves and our human races are prone to conflicts. I must protect these elves from being turned into slaves by those greedy, short-sighted aristocrats." Rogge is righteous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge nodded with approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After "falling down the ancient demon", Rogge scared these simple citizens and said that the demon may still be resurrected, only the blood of the elf lives on this land. In order to completely suppress this seal. And he himself has the ability to monitor the seal at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge has let the Elf Warriors pick up the helmet and drop the pointed ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, nature is a simple citizen who begged Rogge to stay, don't give up these poor people. Rogge also took advantage of the situation, and received all the power of the city of Sayi, and officially lived in the castle of Count Luck. Although the castle was badly damaged, in the eyes of Rogge, it is the most beautiful scenery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also people who oppose it, that is, the most prominent knight of the Knights under Luck, and his brother Ketu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about this is how a very ambitious brother is Rogge’s opponent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man simply casts a magic to detect evil, and of course he has to move his hands and feet. Under the radiance of the holy light, the two brothers immediately rolled in black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are the embers of the devil!" Rogge pointed to the two brothers and sentenced them to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frenzy, angry and intertwined fears immediately swarmed and knocked the two brothers to the ground and tied them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the devil, the customs of the big 6 are very similar. Looking at the pillars of the fire, and gradually engulfed the bodies of the two brothers, the hatred of Rogge's heart also disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God on the day, your followers will destroy the unbelievers with the stake. And I, a believer who does not believe in God, will also use the stake to put you The believer sent to heaven!" Rogge sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having experienced such a small episode, the crowd has a few distractions and ambitions, and they have all dispelled their thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple logic. Those who can destroy the devil must be more terrible than the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these few days, people in the small towns are extremely enthusiastic about the elves. In fact, such a beautiful elf warrior wants people not to be enthusiastic. . Rogge looked at all the changes with satisfaction. Although this is only a small step forward from entering the human society, the significance of this small step is very significant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed the file and recovered from meditation. He said to Will: "You are a personal talent. Let's follow me, you will There is a future. I am a magician, there are many ways to see through other people's thoughts. But I will not do this. Just do your best to do things for me, and with the results, there will naturally be corresponding rewards. Remember, I am a very fair person. Well, now, you have carefully said the situation of the Principality of Aray."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Principality is small, population Not many, close to the Central Mountain Range, separated from Asrovik by several Principalities. Therefore, although the Ayre Principality is not big, but geographically it is very safe, and the financial income is insufficient, so the number of troops is not much, only 6,000. But in the calm Alai Principality, the burden of the six thousand troops in this district is also somewhat redundant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Dagong Tick Crick has three sons and six daughters, this year is already in his early 70s. He is considered to be a long life in the cold north of the country. Although his temperament is tyrannical, greedy and lustful, and self-sufficient, but because the history of the Alai family is long enough, there are more or less blood connections with the royal families of the other six or seven principalities. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the presence of the Astrophy in the north, the small countries of the Church of Light and Light, close to the Central Mountains, formed a sacred alliance. Once Astrafik used troops in one of the countries, all members of the Holy Alliance were obliged to send troops to participate in the war. In this way, the loose sacred alliance of the weekdays will become a war machine with tens of millions of people and 200,000 troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirick is a small and insignificant role in the Holy Alliance. In recent years, as he grew older, he became more and more fascinated with alchemy and magic, trying to continue his life in the wind and the vitality on the woman's belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Will retired, Rogge quickly calculated the value of the Earl of Luck. This kind of border town, real estate houses are not worth much, but some artworks are still some years old. In the rough calculation, all the counts of the count can also be worth 20,000 gold coins. What makes Rogge happy is that the count seems to have a special preference for gold coins, and he has saved 5,000 gold coins, which makes Rogge, who lacks gold at hand, convenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He comforted his waist and came to the floor-to-ceiling window. Not far from the barracks, hundreds of temporary construction workers were rebuilding the barracks under the command of several elf warriors, and hundreds of elf warriors were also busy rebuilding the barracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge satisfactorily watching the elf warriors busy with people. He has transferred all the eight hundred elf warriors who have stayed in the mountains, and is now expanding the barracks to accommodate these elf warriors. This elf force has been named 'the dark side of the moon', pointing to their destiny to break into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger calculates the power available at hand. The troops left by Count Luck are not only a dozen or so knights, but the infantry are too lacking in training to cope with possible future wars. If these Terran soldiers are trained by the experts of the Darkmoon Tribe, they are not sure. Even if it is suitable, it will take at least a few months to train, and it will not be available in time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man stunned his head and decided to go to the Ayre Principality to solve the legal basis of the city of Sayi. Regardless of the North and the South, the basic elements of the aristocracy are a long history, pure and noble blood, extraordinary wealth and strong strength. These things, in addition to the first two, Rogge have. With the latter two, it is not very difficult to get the first two. The fat man couldn't help but miss Robsky. This coward is definitely the best person to complete this task! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sigh of relief, looked at the time, told him not to disturb anyone, and went to the quiet room to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the battle with ***, Rogge’s understanding of magic has changed dramatically. He has always been to repair the magic according to the requirements of orthodox magic, and then practice one by one using a class of distinct, strict grades of magic. In addition to the mental impact, the enormous mental power is only used to control the magic more precisely. Like most of the world's magicians, he is obsessed with delving into the highest level of magic that his magic can move, and for low-level magic, he is set aside after being proficient in use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time, his battle with *** was extremely difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The sorcerer’s sorcerer’s sorcerer did not give him any time to recite the spell, but at the moment of life and death, he forced Rogge to use his mental power directly. The method of attack. Rogge is now, the magic shield formed by the mental power and the dark magic is extremely quick and effective, and can withstand the attack of the blasphemy. Of course, he also knows that *** is completely exhausted. On the other hand, his mental power is completely substantive and the attack is attacked. Even the *** has to evade. It’s just that this type of attack is too wasteful. The more economical way to deal with ordinary opponents is to directly drive the magic to form a magical array, so as to cast low-level magic. Although in this way Rogge can only cast three levels of magic, but almost instantly cast magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest level of magician battle that Rogge can learn from is the battle between Elysses and Furoya. With a lot of secret medicines and artifacts, Froya can cast powerful and powerful high-level magic in an extravagant manner. And Elysses is completely another style, her magic is self-contained, very fast, and often establishes an absolute advantage in an instant by using a lot of low-level magic to smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting with a magician like Elysses, even a close fight will become a nightmare for the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days of thinking, Rogge has understood that this is the direction in which he should work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days of hard work, Rogge has trained the first-class spell magic missiles very skillfully. After mixing the dark magic, the magic missile color has been released. From red and bright to purple and black, the power has increased by nearly half. Although the lethality of a single magic missile is very limited, but the amount is too much, the lethality is very terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the quiet room, Rogge stood for a moment, suddenly a dozen or so magical arrays of purple and black light appeared around him, each Five magic missiles flew out in a magical array. After dozens of magical missiles flew in the air for a few weeks, they gathered together and flew to Rogge. A huge silver shield suddenly appeared in Rogge's hands, and he was all shrinking behind the shield, and then there was a series of earth-shattering explosions in the quiet room...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
