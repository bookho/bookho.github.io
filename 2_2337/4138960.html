			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream roll three under the attack<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller suddenly felt different, Looking up into the sky. In the night, I saw a thick black, with no starlight. And this black is still rolling, like a large piece of viscous liquid, it is possible to drip at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sacrifice stood up and raised the staff in his hand. As soon as the staff came into the eye, he felt different. The pale green halo on the staff that has been scattered all the year round has disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller immediately turned back, only to see that the green flames on the altar behind him did not know when it had become more than a meter high. The fire also became dim, as if it was suppressed by the darkness of the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the end of the matter, Ogan Heller no longer panic. He reached out and took out a thick magical book burning with a faint fire, and pulled out two animal teeth from the bone chain worn in the item, deeply piercing his chest. The animal's teeth are hollow, and the hidden liquid inside is slowly injected into the body of the great sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious liquid is like a hot fire, and the blood of Ogan Heller is boiling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the Great Sacrifice is as long as it is blowing, and it grows tall and strong, and two fangs stick out in the mouth, and both eyes are covered with a layer of blood. He took a deep breath and then suddenly made a roar of the entire peak of Bimen! In an instant, the originally silent beast temple suddenly boiled, and the beast's roaring and screaming was one after another, and they should be in harmony with each other, as if they were warning and challenging the invaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller opened the magic book in his hand and turned to one of the pages, then he looked up and scanned the dark night sky. suddenly. The Great Sacrifice raised the magic book in his hand and screamed! This beast-like roar seems to be a starting spell. In an instant, all the words on the page of the magic book are lit up, and the corresponding group of green fireworks explode in the air! Against the backdrop of endless night, this group of green fireworks is particularly splendid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green fireworks suddenly lit up a little blue-eyed, then the air faintly passed a crisp pain. A figure crashed into the air. When she fell to the air, she finally stabilized her body. The long sword in the hand re-radiates a little bit of a dreamlike beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni whispered, the whole person turned into a brilliant blue meteor, rushing straight to Ogan Heller! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the body of the Great Sacrifice has grown to more than three meters high. He stared at the fast-flying Androni, and once again issued a demonstration of roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller’s snoring, the goddess of Androni’s body in the sky is also dark and clear, and then blows out like rain Beautiful stardust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller’s magic book in his hand has turned over a page. He roared again, this time the roar was much lower than the arrogance of the moment, but the momentum of Androni in the air was a stagnation. And along with this roar, the flame giants as many as four meters jumped out of the flames of the altar one by one, guarding around Ogen Heller. These flame giants are completely different from the elemental fires summoned by ordinary magic. They are composed of exotic green flames with clear shapes and heavy armor. There are different weapons in their hands. It seems that they are more like a warrior who is surrounded by fire, not a giant of elements made up of flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen flame giants jumping out of the altar, but there are still new giants constantly forming from the altar flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s momentum is getting slower and slower, like a fish that is struggling against the current. Ogan Heller was staring at the beautiful figure in the air, and the book in his hand turned over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni seems to be aware of the danger. The momentum suddenly suddenly stopped, then flashed to one side. But she suddenly realized that the space around it should be a void. I don't know when it has become sticky and heavy, like a bucket of heavy oil. Her actions, which should have been as fast as electricity, have become cumbersome, and even an ordinary eagle is much more agile than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller’s giant mouth reveals a cruel sneer, and he begins to growl and mourn the spell. The mysterious magic book in the hands of the Great Sacrifice has always required only one or two notes to be launched, but now it is necessary to recite a spell that is not too short, which shows that this must be a powerful magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class is an experienced killer. The timing and location of his choices were impeccable. Such a powerful and unclear existence of Ogan Heller has a means of protection, and outsiders are often difficult to detect. However, this kind of place in the heel is ignored by most races. Once this place is stabbed. The severe pain caused is simply unbearable, and the ability to move this leg is basically abolished after the foot is cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Ogan Heller’s ** unexpectedly strong, the skin's protective strength is even chasing the dragon! The death class is full of strength and can only penetrate two inches, and it is no longer able to go deeper, let alone the high-speed vibration to cut the roots of Ogan Heller! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the sword in the hands of the Death Class is not an ordinary magic weapon, but a twelfth movement at dusk. Although there are still only five pieces of fine swords so far, the remaining seven movements don't even know what year and month will appear, but this does not prevent this sword from becoming a powerful magic weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller snorted in pain, his magical brilliance flashed continuously, and finally he was still slow, and almost all the spells that were about to end were beaten. Broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this spell is destined to be impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange whistling in the air, and a steel axe fell to the top of Ogan Heller! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! A bang of metal collisions echoed in the hall, and the sound waves even blew away the flames of the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s body emerged from the air and flew backwards. The fat man turned over and landed on the ground. He looked at the huge axe that had been completely curled in his hands, and licked the head of Ogan Heller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high crown on the head of the Great Sacrifice was cut in half. The rough mane on his head was also cut off a lot. However, Rogge did not cut his head and did not smash the skull, but left a two-inch gap on Ogan Heller’s scalp. Long small wounds have been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This axe is still a bit fruitful. It slammed the last note of the Ogan Heller spell and finally interrupted the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller screamed, and the magic book in his hand quickly turned over dozens of pages. Then set it on one page. Rogge's eyes were sharp, and he vaguely saw that the depiction on that page was full of flames. The fat man said nothing. Turned around and ran, and instantly passed through the two flaming giants that rushed up and fled to the other end of the hall. The Death Class also sneaked into the darkness, and did not know where to hide. Androni is not afraid of fire, but she sees the momentum is not right, but also temporarily attached to the wall, to see the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call. A ring of flames ignited the entire hall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flame is completely different from ordinary magical flames. They are extremely sticky and extremely hot, similar to the silver dragon flame. The fat man still felt a strange breath from this flame, which is a very lively atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue ran fast, but it was not as fast as the flames. Originally, his magic resistance was strong, and it was nothing to be grilled on fire. However, the strange flame of Ogan Heller just got out. The breath of that life immediately entered the body of Rogge. All his magic touched this breath, and immediately climbed wildly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was shocked! For the magician, the magic is not as strong as possible, but the magic that is controlled is really useful. If the magic is completely out of control, the magician is likely to be burned. Rogge ran all the way and rushed to the edge of the altar. I opened the door and rushed in. He hid in the room for a moment, and then he calmed down the magic of the surging. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if Androni’s outstanding beauty is irritating to Ogan Heller. The big bloody eyes are just staring at her, and it looks extremely angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni has already resumed full speed at this moment, she is moving forward and retreating like electricity, pulling out a beautiful blue light belt in the hall, and every wave of the stars is waving. Will form a group of light balls composed of more than ten intertwined star blades, and go to Ogan Heller! There are several flame giants behind her, but the giants are too far away from her speed. Can't stop her action completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller suddenly waved his staff. Two groups of green flames ignited in the eyelids of the unknown beast skull inlaid with the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic book in the hands of Ogan Heller is constantly turning, and the right hand's staff is lifted again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this short moment, the god of death is gone, and he has stabbed him several times in the space of the orc’s great sacrifice. There are five kinds of bad things on the sword. The status has almost been achieved in Ogan Heller's body. However, Ogan Heller did not know what magic to bless himself, and the degree of toughness was even stronger than the magic armor of the top! Androni's star blade can only leave a few shallow scratches on his body, and the stabbing of the Death Class can't reach his bones. This little injury is not in the eyes of the big sacrifice that is strong in resilience. Moreover, Ogan Heller's magic resistance is extremely amazing, and the negative effects left by the twelfth movement on him can only last for a second or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dull roar in the hall, and Ogan Heller’s huge body shook and gave a painful roar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quietly emerged from the darkness, the huge triangular hammer in his hand has been distorted, he did not say anything, one turned, and disappeared in an instant. Outside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just slammed his knees on the knees of the Great Sacrifice, but still did not seem to hurt his bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man secretly cursed. He had already stared at the magic book and the staff in the hands of Ogan Heller, but there was a powerful invisible field around the two things, which made him completely unable to start. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they can’t break the defense of Ogan Heller, but the three are all quick and fast, and Ogan Heller’s magic can’t give them real The blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle in the Sacrificial Hall was in a stalemate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the reciprocating slamming, the unstoppable orc great sacrifice, Rogge could not help but frown with a few consecutive hits and re-hidden in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to withstand three people so many blows. Ogan Heller almost can be called immortal. His magical attack power is large, but it is obviously derived from the power of the magic book in his hand. His own power table reality is not matched with his powerful body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there must be another reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the battle in the hall, Rogge quietly withdrew from the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sacrifice Hall is just one of the many battlefields in the Temple of the Beast. At this moment, the beasts in the whole beast temple are like thunder and fire, and there are always one or two sounds like depression. A thunderous magical explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall building in the Beast Temple suddenly swayed a few times and then collapsed. There were countless beasts mourning in pain under the ruins. In the overflowing smoke, Miro was purple. Pull the giant hammer and fly out murderously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is good at using martial arts to demolish buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp array of Centaur rushed out from the side of the courtyard, screaming and rushing to Miro. Miro smiled coldly and shook hands, and when he was about to be a much taller man, he would become a meat sauce! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luggy like a ghost stopped to look at the massacre that was busy with the slaughter, and went through the room, not searching for various areas. He turned over a low wall. Suddenly I saw a huge square in front of me. In the center of the square is a group of orcs. They are not armed with a blade, and they are only wearing a linen robes. These orcs completely ignored the fire of the sky and the killing sounds around them. All of them were concentrating on what they were thinking, and it seemed to be holding a ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ritual? Rogge naturally knows what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the wall for a moment and finally completed the silent spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the beast crowd suddenly lit up, and a seven-color crystal column formed by magic suddenly appeared! The crystal column is getting brighter and brighter, and there is a hot fireball between the moments! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment. The crystal column changes seven colors in an instant, and seven light waves are illuminated on these orcs. Each light wave represents a magical damage of different attributes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
