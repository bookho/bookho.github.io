			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventh Day Book of the Seventh Day Trial (2)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is supposed to be the night world At the moment, it has become the ocean of Shenghui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft sacred glory has the essence, if a piece of light snow, swells and falls from the sky. The night that was supposed to fall was expelled to the corner by Shenghui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, on the entire Gloria continent, I do not know how many people have left the house, looking up at the vision of the heavens and the earth in awe, The most extensive miracle since. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has become awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance of the sky is not the milky white that people usually see, but pale gold and light blue alternate, and occasionally there are other colors. So the sky should have only seen beautiful, but the faint pressure in the sacred glow of the piece of snow, makes people feel awe in looking up at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure in Shenghui is barely noticeable, but whether it is an ordinary civilian or a strong person in the world, the tremors felt in his heart are There is no difference, just like in the face of an ancient dragon, both rabbits and lions will be equally fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands on the long step of the Great Temple of Light, looking up at the falling glory in the sky, opening his mouth slightly and breathing deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he blew was a smoky blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man no longer looks up at the holy glow of the sky, pushes open the door of the Great Shrine, and strides forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This long and lonely corridor, Rogge, has gone through many times, and every time he walks, he will have more different feelings. This time, from the moment he stepped on the promenade, his heart was inexplicably faint. That feeling. It seems that it is like being on a desert island and suddenly lost contact with another partner. It is sadness, loneliness, and a little panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stepped up and came to the Pope’s prayer room a moment later. Outside the old wooden door, Augustus was standing there, seemingly waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the arrival of Rogge. The blood angel stepped silently to the side and gave way to Rogge. Roger brows slightly wrinkled. Go to the door and raise your hand to knock on the door. His hand was lifted high, but he finally fell gently on the door, stroking the mottled lines on the wooden door that represented the breath of the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door has not been opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of touching the wooden door, Rogge already felt that there was nothing behind the door, and the pope and his prayer room had disappeared into the endless void. No longer exists. This is true nothingness. Unlike the turbulent flow of space, the existence of nothing in the world of nothingness, that is, the soul can not stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stroking the wooden door for a long time, this turned to Augustus, and asked heavily: "Has your knees gone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel nodded and calmly said: "Yes. Your Majesty knows that you will come back, but he said that he can't wait until that time, so let me wait for you here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger's eyebrows are slightly raised. Dao: "Has he said anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustus’s voice is slowly sinking, saying: "The moment before your majesty, your eyes have Look through the future, and through the fog that obscures the heavens and gods. He told me that the one who is now at the head of the twelve Lords is both the devastating Lord Dissmasen and the Redeemer, Isaac. The Lord of Destruction and the Lord of Redemption are actually just two sides of the same body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Destruction, the Lord of Redemption, the two are one? ! After a moment of silence, Rogge looked up: "I understand that the original destruction is the redemption of heaven. The heavens need purity, not tolerance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus smiled awkwardly and said: "The heavens have always had only one kind of brilliance. When have there been tolerance? Since the gods have been for us Choosing the best road, why bother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustus smiled a little and replied: "Dear Lord Rogge, if I see it right, you have carried the glory of the devastating Lord Dissmasen! Before you doubt my disrespect, are you Can you explain where the injury on the back came from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue stared at Augustus’s gaze gradually, behind him The edges of the scene are slightly blurred, as if a very pale shadow enveloped them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a breeze in the promenade, and Augustus has a few brownish-gold hairs that flew quietly and broke into pieces silently. Dissipated in the wind without a trace, as if it had never appeared before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is standing on the shore, as if there is no awareness of the changes around him. He has neither alert nor strength, just looking at Rogge calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the corridor shrouded quietly, and the frost on the face of Rogge was also changed at the same time, smiling: "Dear Augustus adults, forgive I have just been rude. But I am really very strange. Angels who are coming or reincarnation should not have their own judgment. They only have unconditional obedience to the god of the Lord God. But now it seems that this rule is completely unsuitable for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel is smiling again, and the firm and weather-beaten face is a little more kind, saying: "After the final judgment, perhaps this plane The ordinary existence can still be unknowingly passed down to the millennium until the moment of being abandoned. However, these angels who have come or reincarnate have already branded this plane, except for the energy that was restored to the source of cost. In addition, there is no other way to eliminate the imprinted mark on the surface space rule. There is only one kind of brilliance in the heavens, so in the final judgment, the first thing to clean is us. In fact, I still exist, what disappears is just a consciousness called Augustus. In fact, the only difference between me and other angels is that the consciousness named Augustus does not want to disappear. So you see, I don’t actually have Too many differences, just have some ideas of your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the outside of the window, Shenghui lights up again, and the dimly lit gallery is illuminated. Such as white. This time, the holy glow is light blue. Has a strong penetrating power. Under this unprecedented sacred glory, both boulder and walls have become almost transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there is no corner in the entire plane for dark hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this glorious sacred place, Rogge and Augustus are opposite each other, still talking like many years of friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Augustus, when is there a statue in the Purgatory Angel Hall? Who is it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there are only eleven statues in the hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did the door of the day appear?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty once said to me. Change is the eternal theme throughout the entire period of time. What existed. It may not continue. It never appeared. It will not come at first. We can see and be able to grasp the reality is limited, so it is normal to appear beyond our expected results. Who has stipulated that twelve angels must be prepared, and the heavens can begin to build the gates of heaven. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and said: "This is also true. But although there are some things in the world that are already doomed, but I am going to go Do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus smiles. Road: "Everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded and said: "In this case, I don't think we have to fight side by side, we will do our best." It’s almost time, I should go.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wait a minute.” Augustus stopped Rogge and said: “There is one more thing here. I want to give it to you. This is what I personally handed it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blood angel reached over, there was already one more thing in the palm, a Rogge Things that I have wanted for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a metal disc with a mysterious coldness. The plate is engraved with a very fine pattern. When you look closely, you will find that these patterns are actually composed of a small to almost indistinguishable symbol, and these symbols are not engraved on the body, but slightly floating above the disk. These symbols are too small, and the distance between them and the metal disk surface is too close, which is to use Rogge's eyesight. When I first saw it, I almost didn't see that they were actually suspended. When Rogge stared again, he found that these fine symbols were slowly flowing. From the outside, they are almost static, even if they have been in the past few hundred years, they have not been able to remove the distance of a hair. However, if judged by their own size, they are rushing at a very fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire disc has become a world, and it has been moving around in accordance with its own laws. Roger stared at the disc and instantly realized that the tiny symbols were not simple symbols. If you look carefully. It seems that each symbol is composed of countless smaller symbol patterns. It seems. Perhaps every symbol is just like this metal disc, and it is a world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then what are the more subtle symbols that make up this symbol? Is it possible to decompose the same? Until endless? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s brain is slightly dizzy. He fixed his mind and gaze slightly, and he took his eyes back from the metal disc. The fat man gently stroked this metal disc, and his heart was dark and emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the space rule that Rodriguez wants to get in his life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asked Augustus: "Is this something I can't just take it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel said: "Why can't? Anyway, the people who guard it have returned to the embrace of heaven. This thing is now an object of no one. Since I can't read it, don't show it to you. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the metal disc that recorded the space law into his arms and sighed softly: "This thing is of no use to me." "Let's make a commemoration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, when this space law begins, Rogge can't suppress the emotion in his heart. Rodriguez worked hard for his life. If he was present at the moment, he would have thought it would be worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law of space is endless, and if it takes time, you may be able to understand the endless power. However, the problem is precisely in the past. If you want to understand, the time you want to waste will probably be calculated in a hundred years. Originally, Rodriguez and Rogge at the moment had nearly infinite life, and a hundred years was just a flick of a finger. But at the moment when the gate of heaven is being established, the only thing missing from this plane is time. Moreover, according to the power of the heavenly gods, even if Rodriguez got the law of space, he was doomed to have no time to study anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Rogge, the seventh page of the book of Hilo and the content of this space law are vast, he is just a small On the island, I saw a very limited piece of water. Don't say that there is a vast world under the water, that is, what he sees, and it is just a small place in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is no time, since there are still a lot of content on the seventh page of the book of Hilo, there is a space rule, and What is the use? Only since this is the wish of Rodriguez, the fat man at this moment to take up the law of space is just to fulfill this wish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge no longer speaks, turns and walks outward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel hesitated a little, still asked: "Master Rogge, ask a question that may not be asked. What you have just shown seems to be the power of the field, But I don't feel any speciality in your field, even the characteristics of the broken field disappeared. Now your field is a pure field, and that's it. If so, what do you want in the field? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge didn't look back, just laughed and said: "The one that once existed may not continue to happen. It never appeared, it will not come. So, in a field where there is no use at all, it must not exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said, he grew up. Augustus stayed alone on the promenade, frowning for a moment, shaking his head and slowly moving away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheng Hui gradually dissipated and the night returned to its proper place. Just in the middle of the day, there was a dazzling star. Hundreds of meteors are flying around the stars, almost the size of the blue moon. Occasionally, this star will burst into the brilliance, and then drop a large expanse of light rain. In the area where the light rains and falls, people who are surprised and delighted find that this gorgeous light rain is actually the rain of petals condensed by the film Sheng Hui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light rain, they heard bursts of hymns and praises to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kneel, pray, grateful, and dare not look up at the stars that hang high in the air and represent the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
