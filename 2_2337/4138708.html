			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few red-hot flaming fires broke into the battlefield. These little Yingying fires are so inconspicuous that no one notices them on the fierce battlefield. Even when these flaming fires turned into a thin red mist that shrouded the entire battlefield, few people had the time to pay attention to it. The intelligence of the Wyverns is not enough to tell them what the red fog is, and the holy knights are innocent. When they are besieged by dozens of bipeds, the price of each distraction may be death. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very common five-level magic: the fog of frenzy. People or creatures that inhale mist often fall into frenzied, bloodthirsty or chaotic. But this kind of magic is often not useful for vindictive or magical characters. For example, Kara Yang, coming and going in the fog, is completely unaffected. Kara Yang’s law enforcement officers are highly resistant to magic and are completely unmoved. Only one holy knight is unlucky. After inhaling the fog, he only feels that the whole body is hot and bloody, and his mind is high! He screamed, his eyes became blood red, and a jump jumped out of the square and entered the group of two-legged dragons. For a time, his fighting power increased, and the second sword pierced the neck of a two-legged dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, this seemingly ordinary magic is really insane. Kara Yang soon showed this, but it was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the frenzied fog, no matter what state the Wyverns are in, the combat power will increase dramatically, and the holy knight who rushed to the front has been doubled. The foot dragons teared them apart. The square, which is already in the storm, can now collapse at any time. In addition to the central jungle parade, the eight people in the array are already wounded by everyone, and each face is green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang is anxious and angry, shouting, and no longer care about the consumption of vindictiveness, the long sword on the sacred light, condensed into a white flame! He squatted in the air, screamed, and swayed a cross-shaped sword, smashing the two two-legged dragons in front, and cutting off one wing of another unlucky guy. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this sword passed, Kara Yang’s vindictiveness was dim. But the two-legged dragons succumbed to the power of his sword, instinctively already have some cringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a tiny black shadow swept past Cara’s line of sight, and his heart could not help but tighten. This little black shadow swiftly moved to the jungle parade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hughett! Quickly open!" Kara Yang screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jungle parade is not low, and the words immediately jumped up. However, the shadow was flexibly turned up in the air, slamming into the thigh and piercing his thigh. This black shadow turned out to be a short arrow. The muscles of the jungle parade were forced and the short arrows were squeezed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang’s heart is wide, just thinking that the power of this short arrow is not so good, I saw that the jungle parade suddenly suddenly hard and heavy Felled from the air. When landing, a face has completely turned purple black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little short arrow is an unbeatable poison! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang roared, his eyes swept away, and now there are two ghostly shadows that hit his men. His figure flashed, and a sword fell off a short arrow, but the other one could not stop it. His men saw that such a poisonous tracking magic short arrow struck, all desperately dodging, and unconsciously, the formation has been scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams in the battlefield have come and gone, and the sacred knights who have spread the formation are no longer rivals of the Wyvern. Kara Yang’s eyes were red and bloody, killing them in madness, trying to bring their own hands together. His ears suddenly caught a familiar, low curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, the cold hair on his neck stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint green ball of light flew to him, a decomposition that allowed him to suffer too much. Kara Yang’s heart jumped. Fortunately, a decomposition was not difficult to deal with. He quickly shuttled in and out of the battlefield, followed by the green ball of light. He rushed to the front of a two-legged dragon, and suddenly settled, and then the figure appeared in the back of the Wyvern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unlucky two-legged dragon screamed and turned into a little bit of shavings, and the smoke disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang sneered, looking back, suddenly stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forests that existed in this ancient era are all towering ancient trees. The two-meter-diameter thick trees and tens of meters high trees can be seen everywhere. In the territory of this two-legged dragon, the small shrubs around the old trees have been cleaned up. Originally in this forest, shrubs are also difficult to compete with these ancient trees for nutrients and sunlight, so they are sparse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, Kara Yang is more disadvantaged. However, what he always couldn't understand is that the two-legged flying dragon saw him as an enemy. Why can the fat pig hide in the battlefield safely and unscrupulously? Are the two-legged dragons smashed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang adults estimated the situation and finally decided to withdraw first. He launched a set of tight swords, the sword light fluttered around, the action was lightning fast, interspersed between the tall two-legged dragons, and the battlefield was taken out in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a soft bang behind him, and a burning magical flame arrow hit the air. Kara Yang screamed and waved his sword. However, the real danger is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasant, low-pitched female voice sounded in the woods, seemingly cursing, and seemed to be praying, but the language used was meaningless. Kara Yang listened, and his figure suddenly stagnate, and he could hardly believe his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strange whistling sounds in the woods, and Kara Yang only feels a flash of gray. He instinctively mentioned all the vindictiveness, and killed a sword! When there was a loud noise, a spear was opened by him. The bone spear has not stopped, and an old tree next to it is pierced! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang holds the sword and stands still, waiting for the next wave of attacks. If he had not heard the mistake, if it was the bone spear thrown by the owner of the voice, then his real crisis was in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咻咻咻! Three screams rang again and again. Kara Yang's long sword flashed a wave, and fell a bone spear. With this force, he quickly retreated, and the other two bone spears flew over his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, a fireball exploded in the place where he stood, the heat wave rolled over, and his head was burnt. Kara Yang was a little scared in his heart. It was difficult for him to deal with this mysterious character. Now there is a Rogge on the battlefield! There is not much left in your own vindictiveness, and then you will be delayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the initiative and turned around and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咻咻咻! Another three whistling sounds. Three bone spears flew up and down to attack Kara Yang. Kara Yang barely escaped the two, and tried to open the third root with a sword. At this time, a hot, smoky light blue breath rushed from the side, Kara Yang chest in the chest, and felt that a strong force on the sword, could not help but spurt a blood, the blood actually has A touch of blue spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang held his breath and slammed it, and the sword flew into the bushes and then went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can let him escape! Rogge, who couldn’t catch up, sighed. He grabbed the handle of Karajan’s sword with both hands and pulled it out of Gregory’s body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gregory was just nailed to the ground by Kara Yang, and he felt that he had no face. Just a two-legged dragon smashed his head and nowhere, and it immediately had a source of grievances. Gregory slammed it. The fangs and the eyes were full of fire. The two-legged dragon was panicked, and both feet were soft. They immediately fell on the ground and shivered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Among the dragons, how many dragons and clans are tall and standing at the top of the pyramid. And the two-legged dragons are obviously the poor people on the base. It is born to Longwei. Inferior, the creatures that have some of the benefits of the dragon's blood have a special bonus effect. Although it is only a skull dragon, it is still a very low-level bone dragon, but even so, in terms of dragon blood, Gregory also It’s much more noble than the two-legged dragon in front of you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;It suddenly remembered that he had a task, so he let go of the poor two-legged dragon and plunged into the jungle. It was a smashing, and there was a chicken jump in the woods.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the long-legged dragon and other Gregory walked for a long time, they dared to stand up and showed a fierce look at Rogge. Rogge smiled faintly, it seems that bullying is a biological One of the instincts. Rogge’s eyes brightened, his mental power touched the magical energy, and he painted several magic symbols in the air, attached to himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two-legged dragons forced a few steps, and suddenly felt the power of Roger's 'Fearful Cloak' magic, and immediately scared the Emperor. Rogge smiled, this four-level magic is still very practical. Can be close to himself The creatures that are hostile to them produce effects similar to those of fear. The magical fluctuations are much smaller than those of fear. It is the magic that is suitable for secret sneak attack. What's more, Gregory has been kneeling beside him, bone. The dragon's faint dragon is enough to let any two-legged dragons escape far away. . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp grid hiding place <br <br /> & nbsp />;After a long time, the first time I summoned the **, I almost couldn’t recognize her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***There is a dark black, full-faced helmet with a helmet decorated with demon wings. On the front of the helmet is a mask decorated with a sly demon face. She wore a half-length breastplate, and the natural flame pattern spread from her chest. There are separate armor on the elbows, knees, etc., and the exposed parts of the body, or the natural scales, or the formation of huge bone spurs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one of her hands is so beautiful. If the skin is glazed, the fingertips are nails with a hint of silver. Rogge has never seen such a perfect hand, but he knows the horror of these hands. *** The silver fingertips are simply invincible. Behind the power of this horror is the essence of countless undead creatures that are absorbed and confined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more beautiful it is, the more horrible it is? Rogge suddenly came up with such a strange idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But summoning *** success, that joyful moment overwhelmed everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory digs out of the woods and licks seven bone spears in his mouth. Then it fell to the feet of the ***, waving his tail in a please. In Gregory's view, powerful power is everything. Since the master is so powerful, of course, it is a little worse than the power when it is a demon dragon, but in front of him, he is so weak, treating his master is to be flattering, not afraid of numbness, even if he is like a kobold, he wags his tail. what is the relationship? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or let the Kara Yang give him a run, how much he suffered, and Gregory’s poison is enough for him." Rogge directly Communicate with *** in a spirited manner. He was not sure if he could speak, even though she suddenly had a body that surprised him. But he didn't want to ask, and he was a little afraid to ask, such an inscrutable magician pet, he had never heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that the relationship with *** has become very strange. It seems that the original call has turned into asking for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The angel is very powerful. Without these dragons, we are not his opponents. Gregorian's poison is very harmful, his energy is very Hard to recover. See you next time, he will die." The response of *** is very simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowns thinking that there is also an angel Chrisma. These people are just one of their tenths. There are only more than 30 heads in this group of Wyvern Dragons. It seems that to find these people, they have to find new opportunities. It doesn't matter, I have time and they consume! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I went back." The two angels, you are one of me. I have to pick first! ***Throwing such a sentence, pulling Gregory back to the outside world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and licked his lips.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked carefully at Kara Yang’s sword, the angel’s weapon, shouldn’t go anywhere?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This sword did not disappoint him, apparently after a very pure holy blessing. The body of the sword faintly flashes the milky white light, the light is mixed with a trace of gold thread, the sacred breath on the sword is simply blowing Come. This long sword is not only sharp, it obviously has a bonus effect on some divine magic, and the power should be even more amazing when dealing with undead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Thinking that Gregory was easily pierced by this sword, Rogge couldn't help but secretly hide far enough, otherwise it would not be eaten by Kara Yang.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; Rogge swords and saplings, made a rough scabbard, tied this long sword to the waist, and turned to the battlefield to die of the dead. Kara Yang with the striker They are all elites in the church. Which one does not have one or two pieces of magic equipment? Now Rogge is not the rich man who was rich in money and backed by Fischer and Fog. These equipments are for the poor and white. It is tantamount to sending charcoal in the snow!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the holy force attached to the weapon, it is easy to handle. After several hardships, Rogge has already trained the spirit and spirit. The force is evenly spread in the skin. Now it is all right for him to empty the pearl in the holy water. It is not a problem to wear a sword with a bare hand or even a sacred attribute. The only regret is that he can't move some equipment. Additional sacred attributes of magic or skills.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a broken stone tablet in the mouth of the valley. The original engraved pattern has been scraped down. It is replaced by a pair of wings and seven weapons arranged in a fan shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the site of ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, the owner was still a big mummy. Over the millennium, it continually absorbs energy, so that the wrapped cloth becomes hard as steel, and the focus of a lot of magical energy is branded with several huge magical symbols. As long as it is within a certain range, it will be subjected to the constant impact of negative energy such as cursing, weakness, and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's really a tough fight!" Gregory, who was behind him, felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***And Gregory’s landing, there was a small movement in the valley, and the cockroaches and zombies climbed from the ground and died. The knights are lined up in a team with arrays on either side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hierarchy of undead creatures is distinct, and the hero is completely based on strength. Standing next to the Necromancer are two zombie lords, followed by a dozen zombie warriors and mummies, and at the end are hundreds of the lowest level zombies and skeletons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are two other creatures standing in front of the entire queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is a tall black warrior with a black helmet and a giant sword. Under his helmet is a rough face, but his face is blue and black. His eyes flashed a light cyan glow, and two large corners protruded from the sides of the helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is a dark red flame bone demon. It is not tall, but the skeleton of the whole body is extremely large. There are three large horns on the head, and there are several huge bone spurs behind it. It holds a huge hammer, and between the opening and closing of the giant mouth, a small flame emerges from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the ***, the Black Warrior and the Flame Bones immediately fell to the ground. Until the *** walked in front of them, they dared to stand up, behind the high-spirited Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is very excited about his ability to be ranked before the Black Warrior and Flame Bones. The loyal bone dragon immediately reaches the loyalty of the owner. A new peak. The strength of these two creatures is now much stronger than the bone dragon. Forget the day, from the owner's master, (although Gregory is very clever, it also has some relationship between the master and the fat man in another world), and sends two powerful souls. After that, the owner spent a lot of effort to shape the new body for these two souls. The soul of Paulus formed the Black Warrior, and the Dwarf King became the Flame Bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior is very clever, and after he is born again, he is immediately under the master. The flame bone demon power is stronger than the black warrior, and it tries to resist the master. At that time, the master almost completely dismantled the flame bones in one minute. As a result, the energy of the bones and bones is greatly damaged, and the strength is almost the same as that of the black warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching the war, Gregory could not help but be lucky. I was fainted that time, and I wanted to challenge my master. If the master also dealt with myself like a flame bone demon.... Gregory didn’t dare to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the road is a stone tomb of more than ten meters high. The doorway of up to four meters is open, and the inside is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***When you walked into Shimen, the tomb was immediately lively. Dozens of ghosts are flying around, trying to illuminate the ancient tomb with a faint blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a ten-meter-long ramp, there is a hall with a radius of tens of meters and a height of nine meters. At the end of the hall is a tall stone chair, behind which is a stone slab that is split in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Go straight to the stone chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is in this hall, *** with the bone dragon, the black warrior and the flame bone demon siege the mummies. Hundreds of subordinates on both sides: all kinds of low-level undead creatures are fighting in a grave outside the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mummy's defensive power is abnormally high and almost immune to magic. It is *** one claw to catch it, and only two pieces of cloth can be torn off. And the big mummies are layered on top of each other, and the cloth strips are wrapped in more than twenty layers? Only the Flame Giant's Flame Hammer can effectively damage it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
