			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventh Day Book of the Seventh Day Trial (3)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is shining Stars, feminine stars and light rain fall on the heads of lucky and honest believers. Around the brightest stars, hundreds of flying meteors are equally beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are angels. Some of the most devout believers are humane to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night, the glory of the stars shines across the continent. This beautiful, mysterious, dreamlike night is very long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xinghui shines on Xiongshan, Dachuan, desert, and ocean, and also shines in a quiet and deep valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Valley is still as quiet as ever. But on this night, this quiet and beautiful valley is a little different. In the past, the valley was filled with serenity and beautiful tranquility, and this night, the silence of the Elven Valley was dead. Occasionally, there will be one or two faints screaming from the air, they hovering, seemingly want to find a meal in this dead silence, but the atmosphere of the valley is almost coagulated, making them shudder, Zhang Huang flies away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge magical array of the Elven Valley still exists, but all the magic symbols have lost their luster, and the magnificent temple that once floated in the air has become a piece. The dark boulder is slanted into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold night passed through the bodies of the elves. These elves quietly lie on the ground as if they were trapped in the deepest sleep. They have different postures, and many still maintain the movements of their lives. It seems that sleep is coming to everyone's head at the same time. In this deadly Elf Valley, there is another figure in action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a green robe. The figure was very straight and straight, and slowly walked through the elves that couldn't afford to be seen. The fallen elves were lifted up one by one, placed in a supine posture, and arranged for them to be slightly messy. Occasionally, he would stand up straight and stretched his muscles as if he was extremely tired. Just don't know that he is tired. Still tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of standing straight, the cold night lighted his face. Clear and calm, it is the repairs. It was only his eyebrows that had a little bit of knife-like texture, which added a lot of mulberry to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door of a windowless building in the corner of the valley suddenly opened, and the splendid brilliance emerged from the door, instantly showing that the entire Elven Valley was bright. A bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this glory, Effie blows out the building like the wind. She has a beautiful armor. On the armor, Ying Ying rises up with a faint magical fog, haunting her body. The smooth stretch of the armor on the armor has both decorative and seemingly offensive and defensive capabilities. With her movements, the pale gold ponytail was dancing in the air, flying and jumping off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie holds a longbow in his hand. The bow is dark red, and it seems to be condensed by blood. The statues of the twelve great elf kings on the bow are also very embarrassing. It doesn't look like a peace-loving elf. Instead, it seems to be like a blood elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the brilliance of the armor, Effie saw the entire land of the Elf Valley. She glanced at the floating temple that had become a huge stone, and the elves of the land. After a while, I looked at the Hughes who were still tidying up for those sleeping elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Xiusi. Has your ceremony failed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a careful An elf girl's messy long hair straightened and replied slowly: "It can't be said that it is a failure, but I don't know if it is successful. We need to do it only to complete this ceremony. As for the result, I think I have already seen it. "There is no more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie frowns: "Elder Sister, you have been busy with this ceremony for years. I just don't understand why you must Wake up Hilo? In my opinion, with the power that our plane can condense, there is almost no possibility of awakening Hilo. You are completely busy with a hopeless goal. And then come back. Luo has already failed in front of the Lord God of Heaven. Over the years, it seems that the gods of the heavens are not idle, but Hilo has been sleeping. Even if you wake it up, can such a loser reverse the whole situation? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;Xiusi sighed and said: "Effie, you are not what a devout elf should say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why pious, just because Is piety a tradition of elves?” Effie asked in reverse: “In fact, Hilo’s view of the elves and the heavenly gods is no different from the way of seeing the light. If the gods of heaven do not occupy this plane, I am afraid that Hilo will be thousands of years later. I will treat the elves in the same way. So why should I be pious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes has a long eyebrow, his face is slightly angry, his eyes are also It suddenly became sharp. However, Effie's eyes greeted the eyes of Hughes without fear of shrinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Hughes sighed and suddenly looked very bleak and lonely. His eyes slowly swept over the elves of the valley and sighed: "Effie, what you said... can't be said to be wrong. So let's forget Hilo, anyway, there is no time for this plane. Now we both It’s already the last elf of this plane. Don’t you want to make a fight with me at this time?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie is silent for a moment, tight The slender five fingers holding the dark blood longbow finally relaxed. Looking at the dead Elf Valley, this simple and direct elf girl also has sorrow and confusion that cannot be concealed in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of faint mist that covers the stars like a star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Shusi, you... Why do you want to turn all the elves into a sacrifice for Hilo? I really don't know, you spend countless This magical array, which has been spent for hundreds of years, is actually used for this purpose. Since it will eventually escape the destruction, since it is also desperate, why not let them gloriously die, but die in this illusion. Under the glory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes straightened his body and looked up at the distant night sky. Under the cover of the stars. If he is a standing ancient pine, he is proud, straight and lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Effie’s question, Hughes did not give an answer. Perhaps only the gods in the dark will know that Hughes does not want to answer, or can't answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie also did not wait for the answer of Hughes, and turned and walked outside the valley. She walked through many elves and took every step. The brilliance of the armor and the longbow will be dim. The pale gold ponytail no longer leaps, but falls straight. If a solid golden waterfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Effie’s footsteps suddenly stopped. She raised her head and slightly picked up her beautiful eyes and looked into the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star that represents the glory of the gods does not know when to shine, for a moment, the flaming water blue brilliance completely overwhelmed the night sky. Blue moon. The number of meteors flying around the stars has quietly doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another burst of light rain falling from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the previous landing of light rain, this time the light rain is much more beautiful. In countless flower rains that have been falling, dozens of meteors hovering around the stars have also landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie's right-handed slender and white fingers folded one by one, clenching the dark blood longbow. In her fingertips, there seems to be an invisible murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ribbon that Effie’s hair burst suddenly broke, and the long blond hair was immediately shackled and fluttered in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie began to walk further outside the Elf Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes suddenly said: "You are not going to go to him? The time left is really not much."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Feier did not return to the ground: "I know, but I will not go to him. I don't want him to see how I fell, the same. I don't want to see it. He fell down. So it’s still different, not seeing each other!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her crisp voice echoed in the valley, her figure has long disappeared In the middle of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held his hand and raised his head, looking up at the star that was not falling in the night sky, and transformed it into a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, a deadly elf valley suddenly slammed a crack, sounding like a broken porcelain sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this moment, the nights of the mainland are no longer quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the east of the mainland, the coast of the ocean. Standing on a plate and going up the tower. Here is where the big magician Bovta and his disciples live and work. Beauvoir has a bad temper. Moody, extreme disgusting people disturbed his research. Therefore, we will choose this piece of land to build our own tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you like it or not, building a tower is an unwritten tradition of the great magisters on the mainland. It seems that this is not enough to show the big magician. Same identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bovta has already discovered the stars that are not falling in the night sky, but his interest is all on the ectopic elemental creatures, and an important study is It is a critical issue and therefore does not care about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not expect that unsolicited visitors would come to visit his tower so soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the soft radiance and vague hymns, the three angels landed slowly on the large terrace of the Magic Tower. In the night, the wings behind them are so white, white and even dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of an angel is very feminine, she gently knocked on the door of the terrace. The slight knocking sound was a hoarse roar:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is outside? Really ah, it’s so bright. My magic experiments are all ruined! Damn, who are you, don't want to leave alive tonight, I have dozens of elemental creatures that are hungry!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a thunderous roar, a chunky old man with a magical scepter lifted the door of the terrace. Waiting to see the three angels standing on the terrace, he snorted on the spot, then picked up his small eyes and carefully looked at the three angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, the old man said in a huge voice that is not commensurate with his body shape: "You are an angel who came directly from heaven! It is indeed unexpected, but I am not interested in heaven now, and I can’t talk to the respected God of the highest. If you leave, I will not care about the failure of this experiment. Otherwise, my alien creatures will not be much worse than your angels. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Beauvoir are only halfway through, and they are drowned by the sudden surge of blood in the throat. He bowed his head and looked at the sword front that suddenly appeared on his chest. This is a giant sword, and the flames of the heavens are still burning on the sword front. Bovta's wounds have long been turned into a piece of coke, so he does not feel pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up hard, pointing his finger at the expressionless angel in front of him, screaming in his mouth, but his last spell could never be completed. He paused the magical scepter and wanted to summon his disciples, but he did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear sir, you made two mistakes." The angel in front of him said in a flat-sounding voice: "First, you should not blame the Lord." Second, we are coming to more than three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A huge fire column rises to the sky, until the height of 100 meters is slightly reduced. In the torch that reflected the shore of the sea, the magic tower collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westwood is a small city, but in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, almost no one does not know this small town. The only reason is that Westwood has a small, but knightly school known for cultivating the best knights. The Marquis of Huaxi, who presided over the college, was over 80 years old. When he was young, he was an official to the Imperial Marshal, and he was named after the power of the Sanctuary. After retiring, he put all his energy into the Knights College. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis is a devout believer. Therefore, when the stars appeared in the night, his old face also shined. However, the Marquis was also an authentic soldier, so this night, although special, he still forced all the students to go to bed on time, and he went to the bedroom as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bedroom door was pushed open, the Marquis was pleasantly surprised to find that two angels were floating in his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
