			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Book of the Seventh Daylight Daylight and Darkness<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Daylight and Darkness<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the little girl in front of him, Rog didn’t know what to do. He felt that this was the daughter that Mei gave him, but Rogge couldn't understand how a little baby girl grew up. This is more than just growing too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked around, this is a small town that was destroyed, and the raging fire was not long. Burnt bodies can be seen everywhere in the streets, corners and interiors. Jiaozuo has become the main color of the town. Apart from the small piece of land that he is walking under, he can't see a little green in the whole town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose? Since her daughter is already here, where is she? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge couldn’t sense a little rose, so his eyes fell back to the little girl. Although I know that my face is my own blood, my daughter, but this step of Rogge is always unable to go out. He even had some fear in his heart, a little murderous, and wanted to destroy this strange little girl directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the little girl staggered and stood up, revealing a sweet and pure smile, and extending two small hands toward Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly woke up from a big dream, striding forward, holding the little girl in his arms. Anyway, this is his daughter after all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl clasped Rogge’s robes tightly in her hands, and her little face was buried in Rogge’s chest, so Rogge did not see her little There was a strange smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked around and found no other notables. Then led the wind and the sky, and instantly disappeared above the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Great Shrine, the piano. Roy did not wait for a long time, and saw Rogge descend from the sky. Seeing the little girl sitting on the shoulder of Rogge, the piano was surprised. But she did not say a word, but silently followed Rogge into the transmission hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge without hesitation, with a big girl and two girls stepping into the portal, the face of the piano changed slightly. She really can't imagine what would happen to a girl who was weak and young in a space storm. Although she knows that Fengyue has incredible power. At least the little girl on the shoulder of Rogge looks nothing special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the piano suddenly found that at the dead end of Rogge’s line of sight, the two little girls looked at each other coldly, the intersection of silver and green eyes, There seems to be an invisible storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, when you don’t think about it, the piano looks at the space door that changes its color and makes a bite. The scalp rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time her luck is still good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they returned to the church, the secret was already hanging high in the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight is as cold as last night. In fact, everything in the secret is running so regularly, when will it happen, even There will be no change in the size and direction of the wind. Day after day, the mystery continues to repeat itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is half lying on the big bed. Quietly through the high floor-to-ceiling windows, I look at the bright shrine of the light shining in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is still the same as last night, lying on his chest. Her two small hands firmly grasped Rogge's pajamas and refused to relax. At this moment, the wind and moon, like a little girl defending his favorite toy, defends his territory. Her enemies are now curled up under Rogge's arms. A pair of small hands clasped Rogge's arm tightly and slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two little girls seem to be moving like they are sleeping. Rogge can even feel that they are sleeping very harder and ‘very hard. Looking at Xiaofengyue, Rogge smiled. When his gaze fell on Nafi, it became very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie, this is the name he just gave his daughter today. I don't know if it is too busy or consciously or unintentionally. Rogge has never given a name to her daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the church has extraordinary skills. In just one day, the transformation work has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also ordered the selection of beautiful girls from the apprentice church. Serve as the maid of this sleeping hall. Because the number of Rogge's request is too far, the helpless church manager had to select a group of girls over the age of 15 from the training camp, which met Rogge's request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man came back to see him, naturally he was so excited that he praised the manager and said that he was in a good mood. Until the flame tyrant, it should not be any more. Feel free to slaughter angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the fate of the fat, let the girls learn to dance. In front of these martial arts-savvy girls, it is hard to remember what kind of difficult moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man still can't enjoy this blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when the blue moon rose to the sky, Xiaofengyue was immediately trapped, and almost forced Ruger to go to sleep. In desperation, the fat man had to change his clothes to serve as a big bed for the small wind. Naifa almost showed up with the wind and the moon at the same moment. She looked like she had wanted to climb the chest of Rogge, but the body of the fat man was arbitrarily occupied by Xiaofengyue. She had to retreat and ask for the second. Arrived at Rogge's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and smiled happily and bitterly. Both Feng Yue and Nai Fei have too many things that he can't understand at all. Although Rogge's magic grew slowly, after reading the book of Hilo, his control of mental power began to advance by leaps and bounds, and the control of his own power became more and more subtle. Rogge even had a feeling that he was uncovering a veil that was hidden on everything, and he had to glimpse the origin of the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more he knows, the more he will find his ignorance. At least he couldn't figure out the strange changes that happened to his daughter. But no matter how naifi is mysterious, it is always his daughter. And Xiaofengyue also needs his care and care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he currently has. Rogge was like this, waiting for the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning light was on, Xiaofengyue and Naifei opened their eyes at the same time. They glanced at each other and immediately turned their heads and never looked again. other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge one by one. The two little guys got rid of themselves and they got up from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man snorted. Suddenly found that Xiaofengyue grew a little bit taller, and she was more beautiful, and Naifi looked bigger. The fat man snorted and didn't know if he was in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge summoned several maids, changed their clothes, and called the piano, and ordered her to look after Xiaofengyue and Naifei. Then he walked out of the sanctuary and flew to the Great Temple of Light in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not worried about Xiaofengyue. At present, in this plane, which is safer than the church, I am afraid that there is only the Great Temple of Light. What's more, although Fengyue is a 10-year-old girl, her strength is still terrifying. If the angels who come or reincarnate in the church want to beat her mind, it is completely self-seeking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat thing to do today is to find the Pope, so that you can see the ‘a few pieces’ artifacts that the Bright Church used to save for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame tyrant Donk Bakala has great strength, but the absolute power is still not weak at the moment. After being forced to a dead end, this tyrannical presence is often a bit of a life-saving or desperate means. Rogge does not want to be the target of the flame tyrant, for the sake of prevention, he wants to improve his strength as much as possible. Artifact is still the fastest way to improve strength for the fat man at the moment. Of course, the fat man can command a lot of holy churches in front of himself. But in the face of the tyrannical existence of Don Kebala, some common sense will know that staying behind does not guarantee safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights who guarded the Great Hall of Light saw Rogge, and they all politely bowed, but their thoughtful rituals could not hide the hostility in their hearts. In fact, Rogge is the same. He saw at a glance that these knights are descending low-ranking angels. As long as one thinks of the wind and moon forming the instinct of tearing the angel's wings, Rogge has provoked the wings of these angels, and then tore off the impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man walked quickly into the Great Hall of Light, and did not look at these knights at all, lest they be angry. Really do something out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of Augustus, Rogge walked slowly through a hall that was connected together. In these halls, many powerful magical equipment collected by the Church of Light is displayed in different categories. Most of these equipments are not artifacts, but they are rare and powerful magical equipment. There are dozens of pieces of equipment in some of the halls, and some halls have only a few pieces, and even a whole hall is only used to place a ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ring is made of fire red gold with several bright red diamonds. The whole ring is covered in a faint red mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a glance, Rogge knows that this ring is not a special product. He picked it up and played it over and over again. After a while, he finally discovered the special feature of this ring, which is extremely high flame resistance. The magic resistance of the fat man is far superior to others. If you wear such a ring, you will immediately achieve the effect of fire immunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the fire tyrant is going to deal with it, Rogge will immediately take the ring as it is. Going all the way, Rogge chose a soft armor and an ice gun. Later, Augustus led him into the hall where the magic sword was displayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s gaze swept over dozens of swords in the temple, and his interest was lacking. The sword is not his usual weapon, not to mention the fat martial arts in general, a good sword in hand, that is, Hu slashed. It was only when he glanced over a fine sword in a prominent position and suddenly stunned. The fat man strode over and took the sword from the shelf and slowly pulled the sword out of the sheath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when the sword of the sword leaps out of the scabbard, seven magical brilliances are reflected in the eyes of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently stroked the sword of the sword with his fingertips, and his heart sighed secretly. He did not ask why this fine sword appeared here, because this question is no longer required. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silently hangs the sword at his waist. Augustus saw Rogge pick this sword, but only gave him a meaningful look. Did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly asked: "Agus is an adult, since this sword has already appeared here, then the stars are empty?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus said: "The stars are being left by Mr. Prossis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog nodded, Nothing to say, just follow Augustus to the next hall. He had no choice but to rush a few pieces of equipment with flame protection properties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the church. Rogge went straight to his room. When the door was opened, the scene in the room surprised him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Moon and Naifa each occupy one side. I am scorning each other. At this moment, the windy moon looks like a ten-year-old, and it floats in the air. Is it higher than Naifei? But the little Nefie, who has no power, leans against the wall and can stand upright without falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano sits in the corner of the room and looks at the two little girls pale. Her body trembled slightly and looked like a little lamb standing beside the fierce World of Warcraft. When she saw Rogge entering the door, she finally breathed a sigh of relief. Struggling to stand up and bow to Rogge. With such a little bigger movement, she also shook a little, almost fell, it seems to be close to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the forehead of the piano, and the tired eyes, Rog smiled. The piano is docile and unobtrusive. Unlike other churches, she is also an advent angel. In the face of the double moon in the wind, the angels in the church did not dare to stay a little longer. The piano alone stayed in front of Fengyue for nearly a day, and now it is still very difficult to walk. The fat man couldn't help but look at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the piano can last so long, the real reason is not what he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge called the piano. Road: "There are some magical equipment outside, you go to the people who take part in the action. We will leave for the dark forest tomorrow morning, let the wizards who set up the magic array work hard! If the sun rises tomorrow, the magic There is no good word in the lineup, then my mood will be very bad. Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is said, Rogge shot on the ass of the piano, this Only let her go. As long as I can get out of the room, the piano has to thank the gods. How can I still care for Rogge's little light and thin? Rogge had previously taken advantage of her, but somehow, the piano felt that Rogge was not as cruel and lustful as the churches thought. Behind the fat man is almost a metamorphosis smile. The piano feels that there is only one cold heart. The fat man's face is laughing. But his eyes never laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
