			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the three chapters on the brave <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章三勇<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pride, it is indeed the biggest original sin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory body stretches and moves forward silently in the breeze Sliding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It flies in a freehand manner, while eloquently saying: "Pride will blind our eyes, let us not see the direction of advancement; arrogance will make our wings become Heavy, our ability to control the direction is weak; arrogance will also make us illusory illusion, thinking that with our dragon flame, claws and dragon language magic, we can be invincible in the world. In fact, any dragon, whether it is a sacred giant Dragons, colorful dragons or dragon lichs are insignificant in front of the greatest dragon gods. All the skills that make us different, the level of deformation, or absolute defense, and the dragon's field ability are A fragile little trick. So, don't doubt the greatness of the Dragon God. Nicholas, be humble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas dragged his heavy body and followed the frontlessly Only a one-meter long sacred dragon flies. His mind is still groggy, with a splitting headache, and the injuries everywhere are like fire. Cranio’s treatment for him has long since passed, and the wounds have begun to deteriorate. He must transport all the dragons to suppress the pain while flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the sacred dragon was heard as if he had come from far away, suddenly and suddenly. Nicholas couldn't think deeply about the meaning of the sacred dragon's words. He didn't know if this sacred dragon was omnipotent, but he knew that the sacred dragon was indeed omniscient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many hidden secrets of the silver miracle, and this sacred dragon knows it. It seems that he is indeed the messenger of the Dragon God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great dragon god, don't you give up on me?" Nicholas's heart ignited a glimmer of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, it is already the third day he followed the dragon god messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day, he also doubted the identity of the messenger, but every time he argued with the dragon god messenger, he was taught The poor words are poor. In fact, the silver miracle that once enjoyed the world of dragons has fallen to this day. There are so many blame in it. Moreover, the dragon god messenger is insignificant. It is the silver miracle that is seriously injured, and it is also sure that the messenger will be easily killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the wisdom of the messenger has deeply impressed him, at least the high theories of the messenger he never thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One hand created the root of all your misfortunes, the despicable Rogge, what is better than you? He has no power, no you There is no wisdom or foresight in the dragon language, but why does he live the better, and you have abandoned the Silver Dragons and been exiled by the Moonlight Dragon City, and now it is seriously injured?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Nicholas just wanted to say, Gregory immediately preached: "Do you want to say that he got the help of a powerful demon? Nicholas, now, you are not willing to let go of arrogance, seriously Think about who your enemy is? The two masters of the fat guy... ah, to be exact. Will the two who helped him be demons? You think carefully, their powerful power, superb Speed, incredible combat skills, the most pure sacred power, and, above all, the most important thing! That is their beauty! Can this be a vulgar demon possession?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas was shocked, : "Is it... they are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you finally willing to go down a little proudly? You are right! Their identity is far more than average. The dragon is noble. Even I can only look up to their brilliance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Rington paused and shouted: "They! Already The gods who can be with the dragon god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory said more excited, and finally could not help but scream. A small lightning suddenly fell from the extremely high void, accurately squatting on Gregory's head, and smashing its tiny dragon's body to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas was shocked and immediately looked up to find the mysterious enemy. But Gregory quickly struggled to fly and gasped: "It doesn't matter, this is a small punishment for the dragon god. The fat man is the two masters... No, the two goddesses are the godhead, the rank Or the ability of the field is much worse than the greatest dragon god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to revenge, you claim to have forsaken all morality and glory, but why can't you kill the fat man? Your strategy is not wrong, only shameless and shameless to deal with despicable shameless. But you are not doing it thoroughly! You can catch the baby as a hostage, You can kill the generals of his men, but why don't you kill the woman around him? This will make him suffer. You find that the elves of the city of the city are related to the death of Chris Ferrena. Why not kill one? The elves of the city, just for them to erect a statue for Chris Ferrena? You used Cranio and the ancient emperor to anger the goddess, and the Silver Dragon King also killed you in the duel. But why? Is it not foolish to steal all the crimes while you are in the final battle? Is it not stupid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All in all, arrogance Is the root of all your sufferings!" The messenger made a conclusion for the three days of preaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas, the strongest player in Silver Dragon, finally lowered his head humbly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory sighed with relief. Three days to fly in the mouth of Nicholas, the feelings in this, can not be described with thrilling. When Nicholas argued with him, he was scared to run away several times, but as long as he remembered his own enthusiasm, his efforts would inevitably fall short. At that time, any one of the two masters would be more angry than the silver miracle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two evils, courage and wisdom, Gregory chose to face Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this vulgar world..." Gregory's tone was filled with high dignity, but Nicholas felt it. This is the tone that the Dragon God messenger should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strength is not all! There is light, and the nature of power itself is not important. Whether it is light or dark, it is powerful enough to reach you." The purpose of revenge. There is nothing wrong with choosing the fall itself. The mistake is that you are not completely degraded. Now, I will guide you how to gain the wisdom of evil, which will not take you much time. After the end of my guidance. You It will easily defeat the enemy you used to be. But remember, in the face of two beautiful goddesses, be sure to be humble, if they are angry, then run away. It is not a shame to avoid the gods. You are going to kill, just the fat man. Don't do anything unnecessary until you achieve this goal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas focuses on the head. This action touched many injuries on his body and brought a lot of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Gregory almost screamed, and the excitement of success was so powerful. So much so that it almost lost. It is looking forward to the rewards of the two masters, although in the days that have just come, it is very painful to be swallowed dozens of times of the size of the body of Warcraft every day, but the pain will be exchanged for the future to become the glory of the sacred dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if it is painful, the glorious Gregory can bear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory turned around and headed north: "Follow me! The first thing you have to do is to destroy the two Terran villages, and then the goal is on the Bluestone Hill. The ground frost smashed the giants. Finally, we have to go to the abyss gap in the northern part of the dark forest. These three places represent three evil wisdoms. When you complete these tests, you will have the power of revenge! At that time, as a reward Dragon God will restore all your abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute!" Nicholas cried: "I have experienced the power of the Dragon God, that power There is no evil. If I fall completely, isn't it going further on the road to abandon the Dragon God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory replied faintly: "How much do you know about the realm of the gods? I once said that there is light in the light. The shadow of the dragon god is no different from the dragon god itself. The mystery of this, when one day you are strong Naturally, I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Army finally embarked on the South Return Way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the army, all traces of the city of the Clouds have been completely erased from the world. Everything in the city, the demolition and relocation has been removed, and the layout of the entire city of Yunxiao has now become thousands of pages of map paper, kept by the dwarf engineers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, all the dwarf warriors worked together. Split the city of Yunxiao into a pile of gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called death without proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the mark that the emperor expressed grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that piece of wasteland. I am sleeping with the soul of the 40,000 soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northern country of autumn, there is a chill in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is not a cloud. This cloud, which is far from the world, has covered the vast territory of the north to Yunxiao City, the east to the dark forest, and the southwest to the capital of Richelieu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that half of the Astrophy Empire is saddened by the 40,000 most brave North Warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Empire Army, there was another small team on the avenue. The team consists of three carriages and more than ten elf warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one of the carriages, two coffins are placed side by side. A huge forest blue ice wraps the coffin. In the cold weather of the northern autumn, the ice can last for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage of another carriage, Fu Luoya is holding the cockroach, looking out of the window, looking at the unchanging scenery, and the sky. Ice-blue moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a small new injury on her delicate white cheeks. This is a minor injury, but it hurts her face and it is so eye-catching. But I don't know why, the little goblin who had always paid great attention to looks seemed to be very worried, and did not take the injury on his face seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts, I don’t know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, she insisted on staying up for Rogge, and in less than half an hour, she almost lost her life. If it wasn't for Androni who was always on the sidelines, she would have gone with the wind. But her face has also added a thin scar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni saved her life, the old feelings rekindled on the spot, and when Froya was about to take her arms, she wanted to kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under the gaze of Froya's bright tourmaline, Androni couldn't kiss for a long time! For a long time, she had to let go. Looking at the back of Fringe’s departure, Androni’s heart suddenly hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biting pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third carriage is a little further from the entire fleet and looks solitary. This carriage should have been very beautiful, but now the car is ragged and leaking on all sides, just like a few catastrophe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no driver at all on the carriage, and there is only one horse on the cart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, Androni sat cross-legged, staring across the lap. She did not expect that she would one day watch Rogge and watch him sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger and his clothes were lying in the carriage, apparently sleeping very deeply. He didn't need to sleep at all, but after the wrath of the natural goddess, he did not dare to meditate, so he only had to rely on a short sleep to make up the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been sleeping for three days, and this moment is really unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he was only wearing a wide, soft robes, and there was no magic equipment on his body. Judging from the hands and feet he was exposed to, there were probably not a few clothes under the robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K! I don't know where there was a whispering whistle, and Androni's ear immediately erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of wood on the carriage does not know when it begins to reveal a faint cyan, and then turns into a liquid object like a life. It flashed out a pointed, thin tentacle, and the tip of the tentacle shone with the coldness of the forest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock in his sleep turned over, his left hand suddenly slid out, grabbed the silver strip. His hands are covered with thick silver light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden strip screamed and quickly shrank into a ball of cyan liquid in the hands of Rogge. Rogge grabbed it with a hand, and the blisters were shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
