In such an environment, with the dark and powerful body and the demon power characterized by darkness and chaos, Rogge can fully exert his greatest strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sensing the high-speed chasing Su, Rogge took the initiative and jumped into the unknown world behind the space door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unknown world is always better than the helplessness in the deep red field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment through the space door, Rogge felt like there were countless knives across the surface of the body. He knew that it was due to the violent energy of the crack in the space. With his physical condition hurt, Serena, who was kicked in by him, must not be smeared by the space storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Rogge appeared in front of a lava world composed of red and black. He was surprised to find himself in the air and was falling down quickly. He looked back and saw only a burning cloud of fire, and he could not see the trace of the space door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled bitterly, knowing that this space door is likely to be one-way, only to enter. If you want to escape this world, I am afraid I have to find another way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly passed through a small piece of cloth, with a few pieces of broken metal armor. From the color of the light red nails, Rogge faintly recognized this is the armor fragments of Serena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked down immediately, seeing Serena being far below him, falling helplessly. She is red. On the back is a red giant sword. In this red and black world, it is almost the same as the background color, so it was ignored by Rogge at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking far away, Serena struggled in vain in the air, but it was useless. At this distance, Rogge has been able to see that the ground below is a large piece of blackened rock. There are three or five full-bodied monsters who have already discovered the prey in the air and are waiting for the rest of Serena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is thinking. Speed ​​up to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serena's full body armor has been ruined, and the bare skin is full of tiny blood marks. The giant sword behind her dark red flow, forming a faint red mask on her body that protected her. It is for this reason that she was able to keep a small life while crossing the door of space, not torn by the violent energy of the space crack. Even if there is the protection of the great sword, her injury does not seem to be light. Falling from this height. If she can't die, she has to go to most of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger and Serena are quickly approaching, and she can listen to her panicked scream. Waiting for her is a three-and-five humanoid monster. From the short, curved corners, dark red skin and stout limbs on their heads, they are all demons of the abyss world. However, Rogge judges from their height of less than three meters and the strength of their bodies that these demons are not high-end goods, and at most they are some wandering servants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He learned from the black crystal of Elysses that the devil and the abyss world are similar. But it is not the same world as the world misunderstood. The abyss world has direct exports in the devil world, and these exits have always been a forbidden place in the devil world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the devil world, the abyss world, also composed of blood and fire, is more chaotic and violent, and less suitable for those whose properties do not fit. The abyss is filled with many irrational fierce monsters, but there are also many extremely fierce demons. The power of these demons is even a fear of the royal family. Fortunately, most of the time, these big devils are hiding in the deepest lava cracks in the abyss. It is not going to the area where the surface of the abyss is close to the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, each time these great devils come through the exit to the devil world, they will all rise up in the devil world*. The forces of the demon world will be dispatched at this time, there is hope to destroy the great devil, and there is hope to trade with the devil, in order to achieve some ulterior motives with the help of the power of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feeling of power, Rogge identified this as the abyss world. However, compared with the abyss world described in the black crystal, it is much gentler here, and even these magic servants on the ground are far weaker than those described in the black crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has already tried the power to launch a giant sword countless times. However, in addition to giving her a layer of protection, this sword has no movement. No matter how she drives, the giant sword is like a sleep, completely ignoring her request to send to a safe place. Because of this, Serena in desperation had to ask Rogge for help. But she really couldn't open her mouth, and it was her limit to plead with her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled reluctantly, and Selena was flushed, but the ground that was approaching quickly evoked her most primitive fear, she Can't help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at less than ten meters from the ground, Serena’s body suddenly slowed down, followed by a gust of wind, blowing her to the side, from that Several heads couldn’t help but flow over the head of the servant full of sulphur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few servants have been completely attracted by Serena’s tenderness and screaming, and they have chased their legs to her place. But as soon as they were on the move, Rogge was already heavily on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How violent the momentum from the height of the kilometer? Rogge used this impulse to launch a wave of earthquakes. As the ground trembled, the murderers fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stunned the spell, and a long knife with a cyan glow appeared in his hand. As soon as the knife appeared, he rushed to a few stunned servants, and the mentally driven ‘dark master’ was instantly released! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invisible shock wave swept through several servants, and they sensed a sudden paralysis, and they were scheduled to move in place. Rogge waved the magic knife in his hand and cut them into segments in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abyss world is full of lava, and all the activities here have a high resistance to the flames. The magic associated with the ice system is also greatly weakened by the environment. So Rogge wants to come and think, it is most effective to use the magic blade cutting with the 'dark master' that can control or fix evil dark creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these two tricks are good for dealing with weak monsters. If you run into a slightly stronger demon, Rogge, who knows only a little bit of martial arts, will eat immediately. A big loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the fat man slashed his last servant, Serena fell from the air, plopped, and fell personally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only felt that the bones on her body seemed to be scattered. It was hard to endure the pain in the whole body and struggled to climb up. She sat up. I saw that the fat man who had teased her many times stood in front of her and looked at her body with impunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celena looked down at Rogge’s gaze and immediately screamed, pulling the broken clothes to cover the left breast. She was ashamed, stood up and pointed at Rogge and said: "The shameless thing, you dare to be rude. I will kill you immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sily and angry, Serena did not notice the corpse of the servant behind Rogge. At this time, the magic time was passed, and Roger’s magical knife disappeared. The arrogant Serena faces Rogge with bare hands and has no fear in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed her hands and the dark red sword behind her was in her hands. Serena's giant sword pointed to Rogge and yelled: "I haven't counted my account yet, you still dare to get up! The dirty things, you are committing suicide, or I want to do it!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the dark red sword with his heart. Asked: "This sword is a bit weird. What is it called, how is it in your hand? It's weird, how can you drive such a powerful sword?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty contemptuous attitude angered Serena, she did not answer, take a step. Swords to Rogge's waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has found that here Serena is completely unable to launch the powerful stunts attached to the Great Sword. Without the help of these powerful stunts, this little girl is just a rookie with no fighting experience. Although at this age, her vindictiveness and sword skills are outstanding, but in the eyes of the fat man who is extremely rich in combat experience, her skills are all useless flowers and embroidered legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sneered, the fat hand stretched out and grabbed the hand of the girl holding the sword, and wanted to take the giant sword. But when his fingertips were about to touch the girl's tender wrists, his face suddenly changed. Lightning back. Let a girl's sword pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly looked up to the sky, staring at the blood cloud in the sky. He has already felt that everything in this world is echoing this dark red giant sword. Whether it is the lava on the ground or the fire cloud in the sky, every change is consistent with the dark red on the giant sword. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly has a feeling that this giant sword is actually one with the world in which he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this infinite abyssal world in front of us an illusion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowns, taking a step back at will, letting the sword of the giant sword pass, and then waving a hand, a loud slap in the face After the huge sword fell, Serena, who was out of control, went back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celena sat on the floor, holding a burning cheek in her hand, and the beautiful eyes with tears looked at Rogge unbelievably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn fat man actually beat her! She even gave her a slap in the face! From small to large, no one has ever said that she has a heavy word, but this fat man actually hit her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celena holding a numb face, obviously felt there was already slightly swollen. She screamed and jumped up, madly waving a giant sword to kill Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪Two, it’s two slaps that let her turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long hair that Serena bundles is also dissipated. Her eyes are red and bloody, and she is rushing to Rogge! Rogge looked a little impatient. He relaxed the girl's arm and put the giant sword to the side, then a heavy punch fell on her abdomen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Serena’s face is very close to Rogge, and she can clearly see the cold and ruthless light in Rogge’s eyes. Before the twitching pain in the abdomen drowned her consciousness, the fat fist of the fat man was getting closer and closer to her face!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So heavy one What happens when the punches come up? Serena instantly thought of countless possibilities. The nasal bones are broken, the eyes are bruised, and the face will be swollen. God...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closed her eyes and gave a hysterical scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the expected punch did not fall on her face. She sneaked open her eyes and saw Rogge's expressionless face. The fat man is cold and authentic: "If you know what you are afraid of, let me be honest and obedient!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter how tortured you, I will not give in! Wait for us After I go out, my father will kill you!" The girl cried angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Dissatisfied?" Rogge raised his eyebrows and gave Serena a slap. Two times, she has completely torn her broken clothes. A pair of pigeon-like white ** was revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serena’s eyes are all tears, she has no resistance, although she still does not yield, but the panic in her eyes can no longer be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge threw her on the floor, took off her shirt, and sneered: "Is it easy to get out of here? You I must have heard of what is called traitor and kill. Since you are not obedient, let you try this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father will kill you "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so naive! Will I be afraid of Straw?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watching Rogge lean over, Serena finally screamed and cried: "No! Don't! I... I... Obey! Please..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Seeing that Rogge finally stopped the action, a big stone in her heart finally fell temporarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge let Serena stand up and watch her keep finishing her clothes. However, her clothes were so bad that they blocked the side and could not cover it. The girl sobbed low. I can't help adjusting my bra, trying to cover a little more skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge couldn’t help but say: "I don't need to cover it, I am not interested in your underdeveloped little girl!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
