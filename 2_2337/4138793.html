			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days, a report on the strange squatting war before the Wright Fortress was placed in front of Pompey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Peidao: "It seems that our little ally has really brought us a surprise. He can actually persuade the Leiden Kingdom to leave the war, it is not easy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Doliyak also read the battle report, Shen Shen said: "Pang Pei adults, with our current strength to eat the Leiden Kingdom is afraid of some difficulties Except for the guards who have no fighting power, my army has all been put into the battlefield. You see, are you borrowing some soldiers from the Marshal Semen of the Southern Military Region?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Pompey tapped the table gently, after a while: "Semmen is famous for his stubbornness. His mind is only loyal to his majesty. This time we are acting arbitrarily, wanting to He borrowed troops from him, fearing it was not easy. Then say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei smiled and said: "With such a big credit, we have no It is necessary to give the old stubborn one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the camp There is snow falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, the days of the Pancala Valley are always gloomy. Every other day, there will be a heavy snow, not exactly the spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a masterpiece of Rockefeller and his Storm Masters. The coalition of the coalition forces trapped in the Pancala Valley is in short supply. The cold climate will make people consume more energy. The coalition forces that could have supported the ten days may only last for eight days under the snow. In particular, the coalition forces that havetily retreated are still lacking sufficient cold equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller walked into the big account with a bitter cold. Dollyk and Pompey couldn't help but have a chill. Even in the midsummer, ordinary people want to stand next to Master Rockefeller who has just cast magic, and they have to wear thick winter clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Rockefeller, is today's magic still going well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess of ice bless, everything It’s very smooth. I think there will be another three or four days, and the coalition forces will start a large number of deaths because of the cold. From the time point of view, even if the Layton army has now captured the Wright Fortress, we only need to support two days, no Let the reinforcements meet with the coalition forces in the valley. Captain Pompey, victory is in sight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, victory has arrived. You should first take a look This battle report!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller carefully read the entire report and smiled: "So, the reinforcements will not appear. But this way The plan behind us can be a bit difficult. Not to mention this, the coalition forces trapped in the Pancala Valley have just sent someone to send this letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The letter was written by Commander Du Lin. He hopes that Pompey will be able to accept the surrender of thousands of seriously wounded and sick people in the Pancala Valley and treat them as prisoners of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aha!" Duke Doliyah laughed. "This dulin must be very young! The empire treats prisoners of war? Haha! If the prisoners of the empire If it is not sold as a slave, it is always a serious injury, and it is seriously injured. It becomes a corpse. Doolin thinks his soldiers are not fast enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pompey was silent and pondered. After a long period of time, he slowly said: "Since the reunification of the empire, the main direction of expanding the territory is on the east and west sides. Whether it is the dark forest of the east, the western dwarf empire is still the northern ice. The barbarians and giants who live on the sea wilderness can be said to be aliens. The tradition of imperial warfare is slowly formed in this context. But in the south, which advocates knighthood and humanity, the war habit between human states is not In the past, we need to use debride to deter the enemy, but now the Holy Alliance is destined to be the territory of the empire, and our past set cannot be used by our own people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Dollyk argued: "Duringlin hopes that he can get rid of the wounded and the sick to reduce the consumption of food. They may still support it for two more days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Pompey smiled and said: "So Du Lin is not simple, but his heart is also awkward. But compared with the entire empire, the Holy Alliance is a negligible place. The reason why the Empire can be so strong is not because of us. I have the sharpest sword on the Big 6, but because we have the heart that can hold everything. Since they are destined to die, what are we waiting for two days? What is it? I decided to accept Doolin’s request, Give him the battle report of Wright Fortress and ask him to surrender. I will give them a treatment that the warriors deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Rockefeller suddenly said: "Rogge is a very powerful magician, and there are many strong people around him. This is the most important point he has different from the rulers of the Holy Alliance. The goal we want It’s the Druids of the Cloud City, and the power of Rogge is very important to the Holy Spirit.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei nodded and only paid a small amount The price of the annexation of the Holy Alliance, while the underarms with those Druids in the dark forests of the East have no progress. This time we are giving a slap in the face of the city of Yunxiao. But even so, our current power is still far from those of Druid. As for the plan... There is no fixed plan in the world, and the ending is very good. Don’t make extra money. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But" Dolyak still insisted: "If you sit and watch him grow up, are you not afraid that he will betray the empire?" Just as he betrayed the Holy Alliance this time? Adult Pompey, Rogge is not a trustworthy person. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I certainly won't trust Rogge completely, but I understand him." After all, everyone will be selfish, and not only is he alone. Pompey smiled and saw Doriak's eyes. The cold eyes immediately gave the latter a cold sweat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the Holy Alliance borders the Empire is Doria. The province governed by the Duke of the Duke. The land that was placed under the empire under the agreement was actually incorporated into the province. If Rogge was killed and Aray and Latvia were merged into the province, then Duke Duke The land under the jurisdiction is doubled, the population is tripled, and the tax revenue is increased by five times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey spent a few laps in the account In fact, these days I have been thinking about how to deal with the Holy Alliance. Conquest is much more difficult than occupation. We can eliminate the soldiers of the Holy Alliance, but soon it will be there, more soldiers stand in front of us. I remember that after the Empire annexed the vast land of the Dwarf Empire, it was always a headache for the local rebel army. At that time, the genius of the empire led General Alexander to lead his invincible 'Ice River' legion to go to chaos. He once vowed to go out. The chaos is not extinguished one day. He didn't return to the emperor in one day. As a result, Alexander is still fighting the dwarves in the provinces of the west. For ten years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pompeyton It’s the people’s heart that is really hard to conquer. Now the people of the Holy Alliance hate Rogge more than hate the empire. This is a good opportunity. Why do we ruin such a good target? Repression of the Rebels is a thankless thing, let him do it! Dolly, I hope you can understand that the Holy Alliance is a very hard bone, if you do not have a very strong stomach, It is impossible to digest this bone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning two days later, the coalition forces trapped in the Pancala Valley finally made the decision: surrender.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This Du Lin, really can bend and stretch! It seems that he wants to keep a fire for the future revenge." Pompey looked at the surrender book and said with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, we are better off killing these fires now." As long as they are not allowed to surrender, after three or four days, we can enter the valley to collect the body. "The Duke of Doliya suggested that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei, a smile, my Poseidon Corps has been like the Glacier Corps, staying here for ten years. Since how to deal with these tens of thousands of coalition forces is a very difficult decision, let our small allies come to a headache. Anyway, I will go to the Wright Fortress to meet him, and then hand them over to him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright Fortress has cleaned the wounds of war. The body of the warrior has been buried, and the thorns and vines have exhausted all their vitality and completely withered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Layton has already returned to the country under the leadership of Clark, and Marshal Alams has only left 10,000 soldiers. The Marshal temporarily entered the Wright Fortress as a representative of the Leiden Kingdom, waiting for Pompey's arrival. Leighton’s army is still camping outside the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Alams brought a message to Rogge that shocked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ikerel...has committed suicide?!" Rogge still can't believe it, although from the rupture of the crystal plate, his heart is faintly uneasy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what about Luo Meng?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal replied: "The next illness is not And refused to heal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She hopes to be buried in the city of the elves. His Majesty has also made a will, I hope you can bury him next to Miss Eckel. After all... we don't know where your elf city is." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roger, there is one more thing..." Marshal Alams hesitated, and said: "Your Majesty is in the will... already has a big The prince is a prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately sharply grasped the point: "You mean, I hope that after the death, I and the Empire can support Clarke to board. Big place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I think we have had an agreement on this matter." Marshal Alams has a meaning. Didn't say it, it was before the Wright Fortress that he actually saved Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is also very aware of this, and in the future, he still needs the support of Marshal Alams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Arams, you have military power, as long as you have your support, after the death, the great prince can not compete with Clark."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal sighed with a sigh of relief and always loyal to the royal family. If the public is against the will of the Majesty, then I will not have a soldier who will obey my command. So, we need the pressure from the empire and you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded no problem. But since His Majesty has a will and is already known, we better endure it. Wait for the big prince." His Highness made a few mistakes, and after he was infamous, he tried to overthrow him. At that time, it was the time for Clark to succeed. As long as we stabilized the situation of the Holy Alliance, you took control of the power of Layton and changed the position of Dagong. The individual is not a difficult thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Alams reached out and held it with Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great prince Kerry in the city of Layton is very sad, but his heart is very excited. He even hopes that King Romon will die soon, so that he will not reproduce any variables. But he did not know that his fate had been decided by a secret agreement far from the Wright Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the war of the Holy Alliance has not been extinguished, this night's Wright Fortress is still a glory, a scene of singing and dancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secret room, Marshal Pompey, Rogge, and Arams have signed the Holy Alliance on behalf of the Empire, the Principality of Aray, and Layton. The Wright Agreement is now the time for the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pang Pei, you have really given me a problem! You know that my army is not much, suddenly more than 50,000 prisoners, this Didn't you want my life?" Rogge said with a glass of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei took a sip of wine and smiled: "Rogge, the Holy Alliance is far from being stable. These captives are a very important card. Now I will hand them over to you. I hope that you can use this card and settle down the Alle Principality of the League... and the Principality of Layton as soon as possible. Only then can we draw our hands to deal with the main enemy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not believe that Pompey is well-intentioned. The 50,000 captives are like the sharpest double-edged sword, or the most threatening fire. If you don't handle it well, you will not only cut Rogge's hand, but also ignite the revenge flame in the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this reception, a group of optimistic Pompey is so inconspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the meeting, Rogge could hardly believe that this grocery store owner would be a big man who was in charge of the empire and could influence the movement of the empire. While talking to Pompey, Rogge once again quietly scanned Pompey's reality with his mental power. What still makes him unbelievable is that Pompey’s body is empty and completely devoid of vindictiveness, even the Duke of Dolyak, who is obviously over-indulgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I met, Rogge carefully detected it once in spirit, but he couldn’t believe the result, so he couldn’t help but probe again. once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei suddenly smiled: "The imperial army was surrounded by monsters in the abyss world. I was seriously injured when I broke out. If it weren’t for the soldiers, I would be desperate, I This life has long been left in the abyss world a few kilometers from the ground. After returning to the ground, my life is back, but the martial arts are all ruined. Now on the body, I am even one of your men. Soldiers are worse than you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Duke of Doliya came over with a glass of wine. When the Duke was young, he should be a very handsome and tall figure. He only had a great blessing in his later years. Standing with Rogge, he could almost put him in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger Master!" The Duke of Doliya mysteriously lowered his voice: "How can you not see your famous Elf Guards on such a pleasant occasion tonight?" What? These maids are worthy, but they are too far away from the elves! I heard that you have given to King Romon, oh no! It should be Romont, now a very good elf beauty... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has long been expected in Rogge. He gently swayed the glass and looked at the red wine in the wine. He smiled and said: "The Elf Guard is my guard, but it is not my slave. And the elves are notoriously stubborn, and I often command Don't move them. Dollyk, in fact, these elves have no chance to get involved. After all, I don't want to be cut off when I am asleep. King Romon used his mighty power to conquer the elf's heart. However, since the adults have made your request, I will definitely pay attention to the opportunity for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Dolyak said in a row: "Good! Rogge, you Don't forget it! Right, is Pope Pangpei interested in the elves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei laughed: "If Rogge is willing to arrange, of course Best. But I can't do it, just one. It doesn't have to be beautiful, and the temperament must be docile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doriak's gaze is on the shuttle maid I turned around and finally fell into a pretty girl with a beautiful color. . The girl was carrying a tray and the money was coming to this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Rogge, now the agreement has been signed, the big event has been set. But on such a wonderful night, there is no point in the Yuxing program is really impossible to say ..." Dolly Duke Yake smiled as he glanced up and down the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the show is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tray in the girl’s hand suddenly flew high, and everyone’s eyes in the hall fell on a few glasses of volley, a cold light from the girl The child's hand lit up and slammed into Pompey's throat!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei's face remained unchanged and stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his physical actions are far from being able to keep up with the responsiveness of thinking, and the Duke of Dolyak is stunned and completely out of reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s eyebrows rose and he reached out and grabbed the girl’s wrist. He had already sensed the girl's murderousness. If she had her hand, then she would be a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another vain hand grabbed the girl’s wrist before Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hand is twisted at random, and the girl can't help but fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge recognizes that this chubby middle-aged man is a staff member brought by Pompey, and now it seems that he also has Pompey's bodyguard. The middle-aged man took the three-inch steel needle in the girl's hand and looked at the girl's arm to hide the steel needle in his arm. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes are burning with raging anger, but the body is soft and uncontrollable, and even the words can’t be said.<br /><br />&nbsp ;;;nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at the girl, and looked at the Duke of Doliya, who was shocked and determined, and asked the girl: "Who is instructing you to assassinate the empire's VIP?" As long as I say it, I will let you live a life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man is white, and the girl can open again.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child took a sip and shouted: "The traitor! If there are not two empire dogs here, this needle is stabbing you! But don't think that you can feel at ease later. Enjoy your power and wealth, one day, one day, you will die in our hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue faintly smiles like you have a strict organization But I believe that you will say everything soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and smiled at the Duke of Dolyak: "Duke of the Duke You know a lot, I think there must be a way for the stubborn little guy to open it. I will give her to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of the Duke of Doliyak, Pompey smiled and said: "Although Roger is young, the grasp of the human heart is so old and admirable! Tonight's 'Yuxing show' is unexpected. "Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled, he did spend a lot of time before the rebel group 'successfully' mixed into the reception. This girl is a member of the real resistance organization. For a person like Duke of Dolyak, it is difficult for ordinary beauty to evoke his interest. Only fresh tricks can make him temporarily forget Rogge's elves. Otherwise, if in the future the imperial powers are all asking Roger for an elf, it will not take long for it to turn to the elves to rebel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Pompey saw his arrangement at a glance, and Rogge couldn’t help but be more alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei put away a smile and dignified: "The show is good, but in such a short period of time there is an organized inside of this semi-military fortress. Rebel, this is not a happy news. You can see that you are very adventurous. And when I am old, the old man will be more conservative. My advice is, don’t underestimate these rebels when they gather When we are together, we tend to have unexpected powers. We have a long way to cooperate in the future. I hope that you can pay attention to these rebels and not let unexpected winds and waves overturn your ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Pompey left the Wright Fortress, and the Poseidon Corps turned eastward and went to sweep the remnants of several small Principalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the Livi and Latvian coalition forces, although the damage is exhausted, but there are still some remaining troops in the two countries, especially the guards of the two kings, although the number is small, On the combat power is the elite in the elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only more than 50,000 prisoners, including Doolin, gave Roger a headache. These people are not, not killing. They are always worried about riots, and the guards who are guards are not a small number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought about it for a day, and invited Marshal Alams, saying that the Wright Fortress is located in the Kingdom of Levi, according to the agreement, the Kingdom of Livi should be merged. The Kingdom of Layton, so he is ready to hand over 50,000 prisoners to Layton along with the Wright Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Alams is naturally familiar with the customs and customs of the Alliance. He can still laugh at the fortress, and the captive is determined not to accept it. The marshal proposed to let these soldiers pledge not to be enemies of the empire, and those who took the oath could be free. For the role of the oath, Rogge had a deep understanding. Although he did not agree, he still agreed to try. As a result, except for more than a hundred people, the rest of the people refused to take the oath, even if Rogge threatened to sell them all as slaves. In desperation, Alams and Rogge finally decided that the Wright Fortress was under the control of the two countries, and 50,000 prisoners were detained in the fortress, and the 10,000 guards were also Each of the two countries is half. Wait for the right time to transfer these prisoners of war. After all, if 50,000 prisoners of war are transferred, it is also very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved the problem of prisoners of war, Rogge and Ayras began to continue to remove the remaining coalition forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reorganized the remaining troops, led by Charlie led by 20,000 troops to the kingdom of Latvia. On the same day, Marshal Erams led a 10,000 Leiden warriors to march into the city of Levi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wright Fortress, which has been noisy for a long time, is finally quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood in front of the window, feeling the warmth of the wind, and temporarily left all the troubles behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door opening, Androni came in like the wind. She turned around in the room with lightning, turned every corner up, and then reached out and groped around Rogge. In a twinkling of an eye, she took out a small crystal bottle from Rogge's arms, and after a little recognizing it, she opened it and drunk it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, wait!" Rogge screamed at her who was about to turn away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Androni was thin and thin, his head was slightly messy, and there was still a lot of blood in his eyes. She didn't care about the world's big plans. When she was preparing for the military attack on the day, she was just standing behind Rogge. Her mind was still full of fighting spirit, and she turned a blind eye to the lives and deaths of tens of thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, you should take a break. You can’t always rely on magic potions to keep your energy! And, that was the last bottle, tomorrow you I don’t want to drink too much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge smiled: "If it weren't for me, you wouldn't use the power of the sanctuary unintentionally!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni's face One red, angered: "You have itchy skin! Actually dare to mention this! Right, when do you return to the city of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It will start tomorrow at noon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I will meet you on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wait!" Rogge stopped her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni frowned in a dangerous eyebrow: "My recent mood is not good, you have something to say, don't bother me..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at her and suddenly asked: "Are you good for Auger Reich?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Who is Andrego? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androne is staring strangely at Rogge? What happened to you today, always say something weird!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has nothing to do, I just ask at random."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said: "Inexplicable! It seems that I should leave the energy recovery agent to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went out of the room like a wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room suddenly became a bit weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the bones of the bone dragon were found out of the air. It stared at the door that Androni had left for a long time before regaining his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plop, the bones of the bones jumped out of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s room is large, but the bone dragon’s body is bigger. It took two laps to barely stay, and of course, almost all the furniture in the room was squeezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bone dragon just jumped out, Rogge knew it was not good, he also jumped up, and this fell safely on the back of the bone dragon. . It is not a fun thing to be taken care of by the sharp bone spurs of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is angry and waiting to be asked. I didn’t expect Gregory to know how to preempt: "Are you asking about the owner? This is very Dangerous move..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s arrogance rises and laughs: "How is this possible! I definitely don't have this meaning! Right, Gregory Inside, you said... your master and O'Reilly... Is it something like that? I suddenly thought of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are asking The master’s business, this is really dangerous...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: “Gregory, you must know something! If you are willing to tell me If..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly stopped, and the bone dragon is obviously not threatened by him, because *** is much more terrifying than Rogge. The clever bone dragon has always chosen to obey only the strongest. As for the lure, what would a skull dragon want? Rogge can't think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want the master to challenge O'Reilly again? Go to challenge a god? This is... what the word says, right, it’s murder ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly don't mean this, I just think that O'Reilly and *** are a bit like..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon was silent for a while, suddenly said: "Do you want to buy me? My loyalty to the owner, that is the same for thousands of years!
