			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still the dead forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still a gloomy sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, wandering aimlessly. The undead creatures in this forest are also quite rare. It wandered for a day, but it encountered two similarities. There is no communication between them. I pass by and I don’t know when I will meet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a footstep behind him, and Gao Da suddenly turned back, and another similar one rushed up. It turned its head and continued on its own journey. Suddenly, the whole world turned upside down and the forest became in heaven. Its low intelligence can't answer this question for it, and there is no time for it to think again. A long knife has broken its skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A faint white mist floated out of the broken skull and was sucked into the hollow of the nose. *** Stand up, take a look around, and make a silent roar toward the sky, rushing into the forest with a swiftness that does not belong to you, to find the next target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Dragon and Beauty" mercenary group embarked on the journey in the coolness of the early autumn. Rens and his thieves rushed to Reyesberg to scout the terrain and arrange traps. In the mercenary team, Kate led a hundred and fifty knights, and Et led the 200 swordsmen. In the middle of the team is more than a dozen big cars, quite heavy. Fiss was sitting in one of the carriages, and Franco was his guard, and he sat in the carriage. Rogge rode with Kate and pretended to be an axe cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary group's destination is Le Mans, a small town sixty miles from Salles. The scale of Le Mans is acceptable, and there are people in the town. Since the arrival of Snow Fox, there has been no news about the town in the league. Several reconnaissances by Rens indicated that people with snow foxes would appear in the town from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, people in Le Mans Town 6 continued to get up and began to prepare for the new day's food and clothing. The sun has not yet fully risen, but the morning light has illuminated the entire town. The sound of the cockerel dog jumped gradually, and the smoke of the road gradually rose. The industrious figures on the streets have been moving around. This mountain town, because of its remote location and poor property, often has only three or five caravans coming in a year. People in the town are used to self-sufficiency, life for decades, and it is also quiet and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early morning breeze has brought a little coolness, the sun slowly rises from the forest, and the red is plated with golden glow A layer of bright colors. The trees that are shaking in the town seem to be decorated with golden leaves, and the early birds have joined the chorus team. A good morning scenery in the mountains!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Rogge has no half-roots. The fat man frowned and looked at the low and sloping houses on both sides of the boulevard. Even though it was the widest street in the middle of the town, there were few shops. The townspeople on the side of the road were dressed in rough and rugged, and looked at the calming cavalry team that broke the town with curiosity, indifference and even hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This town has three or four hundred households. I think about it. If they look poor, the average family can have 2 gold coins per year." In addition, the tax that can be collected is five silver coins, and it has to be paid for three and a half.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...After one year, you can have 50 gold coins. Is it my territory?" The fat man began to talk to himself, and the last sentence could not help but the voice was high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco looked at Rogge with dissatisfaction, and the fat man’s financial fans completely dispelled Yaxing, who appreciated the scenery of the mountain village. Kate said nothing, sixty light-handed axe cavalry followed, and the rest of the mercenaries disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team slowly arrived at the small square in the middle of the town. The square has gathered a lot of people. A tall, spirited old man seems to be the leader. of. He came up and gave a ceremony: "My distinguished knights, I am the mayor of this town, Ian, what do you want to do in our poor place?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said awkwardly: "We are the Knights of the Bavarian Principality. My name is Rogge. This is Franco. This is Kate. In the future, there are places in the town that are near our territory." You are the mayor, let us prepare some food, and then report the population and income of the town. After the meal, you will take us around the town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute!" A very tall, dark-skinned man stood up with a huge hammer in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man faced Kate's momentum and resisted hard, but did not back down. "I am the blacksmith Bam in the town! What do you use to prove that it is the Knights of the Principality? In the past, the Principality did what it did in addition to collecting taxes? When those damn thieves came to snatch Shana, how could they not see a knight? When they slaughtered my brother, how could there be no knights? Now that the thieves are gone, we have just had a quiet period of six months, but you are back to collect taxes! What are you different from those thieves! We are now snow and silver foxes. Territory, at least they saved us!" There was a commotion in the crowd around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frangoa took a look at Rogge and whispered: "Look at it! The townspeople don't have a woman. And they all have weapons." Rogge carefully At first glance, it does not matter. The townspeople hold more weapons in their hands, and of course the farm tools are barely counted as weapons. Rogge carefully observed the houses around him, and some people were peeping out from behind the closed windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s face, said to Kate: “I’m afraid there will be trouble after the battle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Kate snorted and jumped up. Bam screamed and the hammer lifted and slammed down. A cold light, a clear sound sounded, Kate axe from the bottom up, the Dahan's hammer easily into two paragraphs, the man and the horse intertwined, and the heavy handle of the gun hit the back of the big man. In the crisp fractures, Dahankou sprayed blood, flew out three or four meters, and fell heavily on the ground. The crowd was a sigh of relief. Kate glanced around and satisfactorily saw the eyes of the townspeople in addition to hatred and more fear. He returned to the horse and went down to the ground, Bam, and the axe gun was lifted up, ready to take him to two axes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Ian rushed over and pulled Kate's rope. "The Cavaliers, Bam offended the adults, and sinned to death. But the adults have already taught him the lessons. Seeing that we are all adults, we will not die around him. The old man has already been There are some meals arranged in the town hall. Don’t be too rough for everyone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked around and said slowly: “This is the enemy. Sin, let me remember for a moment. Let's go eat, go back and clean up the foxes, and fix your bones. I know that you are still not satisfied, those foxes give you some sweetness. But you remember, this is us in the future. Our territory! We are your masters! Our words are the law in this land! If you are dissatisfied, you can try it like that idiot. But this time don't expect me to be merciful. Ian, go find a few A beautiful girl came to greet. If you let me have a more beautiful girl in the town, the old man is going to the slave camp for the last ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the town’s hall is extremely depressed. The knights were quietly eating simple breakfast, and several girls in the town shuttled food and packed some cutlery dishes. Occasionally there are one or two sporadic screams, I don’t know which cavalry has touched a girl’s **. Rogge and other three sat at a table, whispering and discussing anything, the food on the table was swept seven or eight, but the three people were obviously unintentional to taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old mayor Ian stood with a smile. Fortunately, he was fortunate that there was no worst case. These knights seem to have little interest in the girl in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the time of preparing the meal, Rogge kept asking him about the situation of the Snow Fox Brigade. Shortly after the Snow Fox Brigade stationed in Sellersburg, a group of thieves came to Le Mans town and ransacked the town, killing a few people. The Snow Fox team just passed the town at this time, and they annihilated the thieves and saved the whole town. Later, snow fox people often exchanged supplies in the town, and the price was fair. After the arrival of Snow Fox, the tax collectors of the League have never appeared again. The simple townspeople are heart-warming to Snow Fox. But what the civilians think is not within the scope of the aristocrats of Rogge. Politics is a compulsory course for the great aristocracy. Most of these small aristocrats are not wasting their time on politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rush of horseshoes came over and stopped at the door of the town hall. A dusty servant's axe gun knight rushed in, took off his helmet, and hurried to the table at Rogge. He said loudly: "The snow fox has already appeared..." Kate slammed him with a slap in the face, "Calling So what do you do loudly!" The Cavalier immediately snorted and whispered to Roger and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and others repeatedly asked the cavalry, the voice was extremely low. Ian can only faintly hear a few sporadic words such as "sneak attack, ambush, demon forest". The old mayor carefully kept himself and smiles and postures, for fear of causing misunderstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, everyone has decided. Several aristocratic scums are relatively ridiculous. A few people greeted the knights and they rushed out of the town, leaving only a cup of the town hall. Ian hurriedly recruited a boy who looked very clever, whispered a few words, and the boy screamed. After a short time, the juvenile horseback followed the traces of the cavalry. Ian was busy comforting a few girls with red eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart’s mood has not been very good this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the Snow Fox Brigade, the 11th-level swordsman, was actually assigned to this backcountry, and it was half a year. He cursed cursedly and patrolled the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard work of moving a bag of ore to the van, and the six small trucks lined up in the small square in the castle, now half full. Hart was originally ordered to dig a lab of the Necromancer, but found nothing. Unexpectedly, he has a rich fine iron vein, which is very high grade and can be used directly for steelmaking. For the poor Principality of Ron, this iron ore is of extraordinary value, but it is a pity that it is only in the territory of the Bavarian Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Principal has been ignorant of the snow fox's occupation for a long time, but despite this, Hart still has to try to keep the secret of mining operations. A few months ago, the strange attack caused Hart to lose a few elite cavalry and an intermediate magician. Occasionally, the magician was the nephew of the deputy head of the mercenary group. For this reason, Hart was called back to the headquarters. A skunk was extended for a year in the settlement of Sellers. Thinking of this, Hart's mood is more depressed, he began to look for lazy coolies, ready to practice whip skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horse galloped across the castle’s square, the knight jumped out of the horse, and ran to Hart so much, Hart’s face was like water, then gradually Cheerful, the last is a big laugh. He made a heavy message to the messenger and said: "After cleaning up the rabbit scorpions, I recommend you to the ice fox! You will follow me afterwards! Hahahaha! Little! Collect! Hunt!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a hundred cavalry and two hundred light infantry gathered in the square of the castle. A black robe mage is also standing next to Hart. Under Hart's order, the Fort Gate opened wide, and the three hundred snow fox mercenaries drove out of the Fortress, leaving only fifty swordsmen in the fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger and others are still walking like the outings on the road leading to the city of Selles, the formation of the cavalry is very open. . Turned over a small hill, the cavalry in front of the sudden suddenly stood, the cavalry behind was blocked, the squatting forward, and turned around at the intersection, did not make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of an open field, a heavy-armed Hart waited for Rogge with the snow fox mercenaries in a queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger and others took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow fox is called the elite, the queue is strict, a solemn, no one is silent. When he saw Rogge and others, Hart sneered, his tongue licked his lips, and slowly raised the rifle. The infantry behind him was divided into two teams. In the snoring, he began to pack slowly and neatly. Every ten steps, I slashed the knife and slammed the shield. The big squad still had no movement. Hart cocked the gun high and erected, and there was no sloshing. Hundreds of people in the district, killing the gas, but it is like a thousand horses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and others look at each other and want to use the 50 cavalry to lure the enemy, first to strike for a while, killing each other. But never expected that the other side is such a lion. The horses were provoked by murderousness, and began to uneasily step on their hooves. Some cavalrymen were already white. Established for half a year, training rookie cavalry for just two months, when it comes to the veterans who have been through the battlefield, it immediately shows a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several aristocratic scums look at each other, and now the other side is also white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger took the opportunity to sing and sing a spell, and there was a black fog between the two sides. After the scattered, the ground was covered with dense spider webs, covering Dozens of meters square. Kate axe guns high, open the order: "Prepare!! Zhang Gong! Aiming at the left front of the infantry team, ten arrows screaming and flying toward the infantry team, the snow fox infantry raised the shield neatly. But their equipment is really not good. The light shield is not enough to cover the whole body, and the leather armor has poor protection against the bow and arrow. After the arrow rains (if this arrow can also be called arrow rain), there are five or six infantry soldiers on the ground.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate axe swayed again: "Zhang Gong is a wave of arrows, and the Snow Fox infantry fell five or six people again. The Snowfox Infantry began to charge and tried to shorten the distance between the two sides. Hart stared calmly at the opponent's queue. As a commander of battles, he had to wait until the opponent was most confused, and then the final impact of the cavalry. Rogge's magic will not stop his cavalry, but the sprint is greatly affected. Fortunately, this magic does not last long, it is only five or six minutes, and Hart has patience. Unconsciously, he put his tongue out again and licked his lips, just like a wolf who smelled blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate lifted the axe gun for the third time: "All preparations!" The snow fox infantry has rushed to the 100 meters, heard Kate’s command, immediately put The shield lifted over the top of the head and continued to sprint, but the degree was slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
