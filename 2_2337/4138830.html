			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the heavens chapter six in the hell?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one is full of magic The demon and beautiful body fell weakly on the white jade table. The dense and dense sweat marks the magical lights, revealing the charming faint glow of the stars. The pale blond hair is like a flowing poem. Spread slowly on the white jade platform. The two stars are like two bays and lakes, and the water is covered with a faint cloud of smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lay on the white jade table, her eyes closed slightly, and no more strength. The elf's body that lost strength was very weak, and the short squally showers had made her unable to afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silk scarf gently wiped the sweat from her forehead and the tears that had already flowed in unconsciously, then the hand gently gathered Her eyes, after a moment, a little ice fell on her forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the dark coat of arms, this is the curse from the abyss demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it's done, it's the end of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge finally fell. He looked at the calm wind butterfly with some surprise, as if the power of the curse contained in the dark coat of arms did not work for her completely. He took out a black crystal bottle and poured a few drops of liquid like a glue. As soon as the crystal bottle was opened, the bloody and suffocating blood was scattered throughout the room. It seems that the room itself is a huge blood pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood-like potion quickly plunged into the body of the butterfly, not the traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the roar of Rogge’s curse sounded, the wind butterfly calmed down like a windless lake, and slipped a drop of crystal water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it all ends, the lily of the night. Can you still fall so quietly again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of you, is there a future you want? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night, the lights were still lit in the elders’ house. The elder elders are very interested, and in such a late night, they are still reading tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His room is as simple as ever, so that every visitor feels a clear spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the water on the stove is boiling. The fire was just right, and Xiusi put down the book in his hand. Prepare yourself for a good cup of tea. These days, Froya did not come to grab tea with him, so that he was very happy, but there were some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking this small cup of tea, the spirit of Xiusi rose. He also lifted the kettle and poured a glass of boiling water into an empty teacup. The cups of water are simmering, and they are not condensed. In a blink of an eye, they become a group of unchanging air masses. The center of the air mass suddenly became dark. In a twinkling of an eye, a window leading to a distant place is opened in the water vapor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water vapor shows a large and deep room, and a dozen mysterious characters wearing dark black robes and completely no face are sitting around At the round table, I seem to be waiting for something. Their eyes suddenly looked at the Hurricane on the side of the water vapor, and they all stood up and walked together for a ceremony before they sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected illusion of nothingness." A mysterious man spoke up, his voice sounded very old: "You must have seen the 'shadow' Three months of operation. We successfully grabbed a lot of business from the "Silhouette Dancer" in the hands of Prince Agrofik, Prince Rogge. In the past three months, Prince Rogge has provided us with at least seventy. The income of 10,000 gold coins has become our most important guest. For this reason, the past three months are also the three months with the highest income of 'shadows'. In order to further crack down on 'dark night dancers', I propose to lower the price of providing services, after all, Now we still have a lot of room for profit, so that you can completely win him from the 'night dancers'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I oppose!" Another The old voice sounded: "The latest information shows that Prince Rutger’s treasury is empty, and he has no way to spare any more to buy our services. Now, we cancel his VIP treatment and consider accepting against Prince Rogge. Mission . Designate the "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"He started from the cannon as a cannon fodder and made war money. Now that he is already the Prince of Asrofic Empire, how can there be such an easy war money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moments, the presence of the 'shadows' of the elders divided into two sides and quarreled. In contrast, there is still more opposition to continue to support Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes coughed, and the elders in the quarrel finally quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First talk about it, what is the task for Prince Rogge recently?" Hughes slowly. His voice was transmitted through the window of space in the water vapor into the dark room. It has become a kind of sound that is fluttering and vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious figure who continues to support Rogge said: "My local team recently received two missions in the Empire. One is to ask for investigation of Prince Rogue’s side. The information of the mysterious strong, the information provided by the guests only said that the strong man appeared. Once wearing dark black full body armor, suspected of being a woman, there is no other information. Another task is to ask for a thorough investigation of the 'eye of wisdom' 'The secrets of the church, especially what their goddess O'Reilly is, what are the strongest in the church. The two missions have said that compensation is not a problem, as long as we can complete the task. According to my investigation, The real principal behind these two missions is likely to be Imperial Prime Minister Straw. In all respects, he is much more valuable than Prince Rogge. But our 'shadow' has always been the rule. VIP's mission, so I recommend canceling the treatment of Rogge VIP. However, if we can complete these two tasks, we must make a final decision by the respected illusory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;& Nbsp; Hughes has been indulging for a long time, and finally said: "The rules are not static. Now the era of great turmoil is coming. This is the best time for us to "shadow" and grow beyond the 'night dancers' to become the dark world." Timing. When the turbulence is coming, judging the future trend is the most important thing. I think Prince Rogge is very ruthless and decisive and vicious. In the turbulent times, there is no mistake in putting some chips on such a person. I agree to provide services first and then charge. The way to borrow, but there must be a limit, it is better to use 300,000 gold coins. Now is a special period, so the two tasks of Straw are also followed. As for the reward, the investigation of the mysterious strongman is priced at nine. Millions of gold coins, the lowest 8.5 million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of Xiusi immediately made the people present there talk, they are the strongest in the dark world. Seeing a lot of knowledge, but never thought it would be such a high price! In the past, the price of collecting information about the Sanctuary strongman was only two million gold coins. That is still the price offered by the ‘night dancer’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes and others talked for a while, and said: "The price itself has revealed a lot of information, so before the quotation, you must first collect 500,000 gold coins. The cost of this. If Straw agreed, these fees will be deducted from the final total cost. If he does not agree, it will not be returned, it is the price of this information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the investigation of the 'eye of wisdom', the goddess O'Reilly's mission..." Hughes sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole room was quiet. Everyone is waiting for his decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Hughes spoke up: "I think 'shadow' has half the chance to complete this task, which can be true to Straw. As for the reward... ...that is the sword of Damocles in the hands of Straw! This also prevents him from seeing our 'shadow' ability!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room A dead silence, only a heavy gasping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally someone who spoke up: "The omniscient image of nothingness! The sword of Damocles is in the hands of Straw? This intelligence itself It’s worth millions of gold coins!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a trembling in his voice, apparently unable to suppress the shock in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Straw disagrees, then sell this information out, I think 1.5 million gold coins will be a very suitable The price." Hughes calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud voice in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes coughed again and stayed quiet. Only then: "Elder elders, 'shadow' can develop to today's scale, and it is closely related to your hard work for so many years. But the turbulent era is coming, I think all elders are very clear, the only key to survival in the dark world is strength. I hope that elders will work hard in this direction in the future. Also, how are the preparations for the Westbound team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just what?" Hughes asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders hesitated: "There are five hundred dragon warriors in the escorts provided by the 'night dancers'. The price is still fair. I am afraid... ...they will move in the dark. After all, the annual westbound team is very important, but we have invested in the income for the whole year!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is categorical: "The 'night dancers' are the kings of the four hundred years in the dark world, and their credibility is not to be doubted. The westbound miles away, the road is extremely dangerous, and there are more than 500 combative dragon warrior guards. Grasping is much bigger. Even if there is risk, it is worthwhile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I follow your instructions. Dear illusory."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the discussion of the next few things, the large piece of nothingness on the round table, which seems to have swallowed up all the light, slowly dissipated. The ‘shadow’ elders of the crowd also left silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes poured the cooled water from the cup into the flower pond, took out a book, and looked at it leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is still asleep in the beautiful world of painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is sitting on a branch of a towering old tree, the metal wings of the demon lotus swaying slightly in the breeze. She is carefully reading the memory of God's source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky swept a huge figure, and after a few laps, swooped down to the world of the painting, hovering steadily by the lake The air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon in the world of death who dares to approach Weina is only one Gregory. At this moment, the bone dragon not only has a pair of fleshy wings shining with a holy milky luster, but it also has a milky white dragon scale belt that is more than one meter wide. This dragon scale extends from the top of the head and the back of the neck to the tip of the tail. Although the vast majority of the bone dragon's body is still bone, it seems to have more prestige. Far from being a strange and discordant moment when there was only one pair of flesh wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon put his head to Wella, and he said: "The owner of Weina, will the windy moon owner not blame me after waking up?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena raised his left hand upwards, and a gravitational force immediately flew to the sky with the bone dragon rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While reading the memory of the origin of God, she casually said: "I have warned you several times, Gregory, when you completely change Before becoming a sacred dragon. Don't approach me within one kilometer! Fengyue... let her sleep a little longer, and she is tired anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly lightly 'beeped'. Then smiled and said: "This is very interesting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Wella has already skyrocketed, said: "Gregory! You are well Here, I went to the world once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon only came and screamed: "Vina master! Bring me..." but Wella's The figure has already disappeared into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory snorted and flung a few laps in the sky. It is not afraid of loneliness, although there is no undead creature within a thousand miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon is afraid to face the wind and moon alone, even if it is just a sleepy moon. The bone dragon does not know at all. If one day wakes up, how does it face the two masters? The clever bone dragon knows that there is no answer to this question, and he can only listen to his fate, so most of the time it chooses not to think at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Wella left it alone to guard the world of this small painting, it can not help but think about this life-and-death problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon slowly descended, looking at the calm and sleepy wind, the wings were shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Moon Master... Actually, I... I am also a last resort! You didn’t bring me on the same day, I... If I don’t surrender, Wina’s owner is sure Take me out. Hey, both of you are so powerful. If you don’t pay attention to it, you will definitely destroy me. You also know that the world of death is vast, but no matter where I hide. Weina’s owner wants to catch I am coming out, it is easy. I... Although I am not dead, I am afraid of death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon, who was sighing and whispering to himself, was shocked. This familiar cold voice almost stopped the fire of its soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory trembled and looked up, seeing the pair of silver plaques also looking at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Moon...Master..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue did not pay attention to the bone dragon, just the right hand Go to the front, look carefully for a while, then slowly fly. Her speed is getting faster and faster, and she flies high in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the petite figure of the gray robe suddenly stagnate, and even planted it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brush. The wind and the moon's wings suddenly unfolded. This stabilized the falling body. She staggered to the sky and finally disappeared into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon only felt a whirlwind. I couldn’t support it anymore, and I planted it into the small lake, causing a big wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the butterfly is quietly sleeping on the white jade table. The wound on her chest has long since disappeared. The skin above and below the body is tender and tender, except for a long pale gold. Other than the change to silvery gray, there are no other changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side of this large magical lab, Roger, half-length, is on the ground, concentrating on the magical array. The beautiful demon lotus has been floating behind him for a long time, he did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at him quietly until the fat man took a sigh of relief and stood up with a satisfied look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are very proficient in the curse." Wella is still the cold and cold tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was shocked, but he did not look back, but flew forward with lightning, while leaving a silver light shield in place. Rogge turned around in the air, and it was only after seeing the quiet Vena in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man set his heart and smiled: "There have been some new experiences in the study of magic in the past few days, just to test it. Being bullied by these Druids for so long, If you don't retaliate, you can't get this bad smell. Although you can't do them, it's good to scare them. Don't let them always attack without worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina quietly watched Rogge begin to swear at the small grayish fog in the center of the magic array. Then she began to scan the entire magic lab, and finally her eyes stayed on the wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s spell is finally over. He is in a state of sluggishness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a primitive jungle in the empire, there is a secret Druid camp. In the entire empire, such camps do not know how much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s rare that there is a hot spring in the camp. At this moment, the tall and handsome Relo just came out of the hot spring. He only wore a pair of trousers and exposed the upper body full of power and beauty. He had an unremarkable dagger on his waist, and he could see that he was very valued for this dagger. I don't want to take a moment when I enjoy the hot springs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo entered the central hall of the camp, and the two older Druids were waiting there. Relo sat down. When I was about to discuss the important things, I made a sigh and jumped out of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly took off his waist and daggered it, and immediately threw it on the ground, as if he was in his hand, not the artifact, but a burning red subway. The same as the block. At this moment, the position of the original dagger in his waist is already a black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Druids are far less powerful than Relo, and they stand up in a blank look. I don't know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of the soul of the soul emits a burst of light gray fog, which finally constitutes a human form, and the face is more and more clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat, sinister and proud face is Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this fat face, even the body made of fog, Relo can be said to be very familiar. He has been looking for an opportunity to insert the soul of the soul into Rogge, but he never thought that Rogge would turn his face when he turned his face. Completely disrupted his plan. Under the circumstance, he had to make the real thing to break out. As for the life and death of Princess Marika, it is not the scope of his consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
