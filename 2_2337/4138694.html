			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf king who died in the bloody battle withdrew the dungeon. He was covered in blood, and there was a huge wound with deep visible bones on his back. The whole body was cut open, the warhammer was dull, and the flame energy had been exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only more than thirty dwarves can escape to the dungeon with the wrath of the wrath, and there are more than 1,500 people in the battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't shake. Not because of pain, but because of remorse, anger, fear and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fears because he challenges the evil, powerful hell. The demon claws tore his body armor and left the wound on his back. This is the power from hell! It is the power he can't match! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was desperate, but because of the moment before the withdrawal, he saw a powerful sorcerer instantly disappeared under the hand of the witch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is desperate, but also because of the death of angry rock. The powerful angry rock could not survive the devil's hand for ten minutes! Although he did not know which kind of demons were riding the bone dragons, but he was only swept by the devil's eyes, he did not know that he had a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil!" The Dwarf King lost his self-talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly yelled and said with a laugh: "Yes! They are the devil! The devil can only deal with the devil!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King pushed the doctor for his treatment and shouted: "Come on! Help me to go to the abyss! Go to the Master of the Eyes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of strength, everyone is different. Although in the eyes of Rogge, Froya is indeed powerful, but this powerful and dwarf king understands completely different. Can use a magic wand worth 5,000 gold coins to destroy his summoned creatures quietly, which makes Rogge once again perceive, vivid, concrete and profoundly realize his own secular merchants and great wizards. The wealth gap between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the past, which time did you rely on an expensive equipment and a large number of reels to gain the advantage of a strong opponent? As for a few aristocratic youths, because they are already small, they have demonstrated their strength far beyond the true level. Killed at the same level, nine wins in ten battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold coins, your heavy weight is really everywhere! Rogge’s conviction is this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the underground city more than five meters high was overwhelmed and fell heavily. Dozens of dwarves who had been killed by the door were smashed into patties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang! "The same is a five-meter-high ancient mammoth looking up to the sky, screaming victoriously. The dwarves are horrified to see this horror creature that has never appeared in the underground world. The hand holding the tomahawk is shaking, but Still roaring and rushing up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proud dwarves would rather die than to fall into the hands of slave traders. But this is not big and the slaves Our intentions. After a few years old and small foxes have been together before the war, they agreed that it is very easy to die on the battlefield, but in the normal state of mind, the most difficult elves are not going to die, Needless to say, the dwarf. So how to disintegrate the dwarf's fighting spirit is the key.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very useful low-level magic suitable for the current situation: fear. This two The level of small magic is not small. Although the dwarves have simple minds and have certain immunity to such magic, as long as the amount of magic is sufficient, one can't, and a few more. This is Rogge's elimination from Froja. Enlightened in the battle of the Demon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Froya's magic, fears such small spells can easily be put on seventy or eighty, and Rogge can also put ten times. This is not the theory of Fu Luoya. The wand counts the magic wand. Rogge's handwriting is much smaller, can't afford the magic wand, only use one-off reels. But it takes a lot of people to use a large cloth bag to hold the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few low-end magic scrolls that can be bought in a few gold coins, and the volume can be greatly discounted. This big bag reel is just ten The price of the dwarf slaves is only.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves’ elite warriors have already been exhausted in the first two wars, and now the miners have become the absolute main force, the adult dwarves Women and older children account for the vast majority. The invaders are calm, as long as the dwarves resist in groups, there will be a pale yellow magical light ball flying over, and then within ten meters of the sphere of fear. The dwarves who haven’t experienced the battle are only crying and fleeing. The slave warriors are from the back. On the back of the head is generally Yigun, unconscious on the spot, and so slowly sweep the battlefield after the battle <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;The palace of the Dwarf King is still gorgeous. However, the general gold and silver are not in the eyes of Rogge. He is looking for the secret room of the Dwarf King. People who are rich and wealthy will have this thing, aren't they? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge, Kate with dozens of hands in the Dwarf King’s palace, in addition to stunned a bunch of dwarves, that is, turned to ordinary Gold and silver treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting Rogge!" A dragon and a beautiful knight flew to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s spirit rose and immediately greeted him and asked, “Is there any secret room?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, found a secret road, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What! But take me there!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty, Kate, and more than forty people stand silently in front of the secret road. If an underground passage with a six-meter-high brass gate can also be called a secret passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the gate opens, and a dozen meters behind the door is a cliff that does not know how deep it is. The cliff is more than 50 meters wide. A stone bridge that only allows two people to cross across the two shores is not known to be natural or artificial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked down at the cliff and could only look down more than a hundred meters, and then there was a misty mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The villain saw the Dwarf King with a dozen or so men who fled from here!" The knight who came to report did not forget the merits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitates, the desire for wealth is overwhelmed by reason. He sent a knight to check the other side of the other side, seeing nothing safe, and immediately led the team to chase down. Kate is more elaborate, called a person to go back to the news, to assemble people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning a corner, Rogge stepped into a strange closed hall with a radius of 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a closed hall. There are countless square stone caves carved into the walls of the hall. The stone faints are visible in the cave. This hall is a big cemetery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rangerous Flame Hammer with the remaining twenty soldiers standing on the other side of the hall, glaring at the invaders. The dwarf warriors are all in the blood, and many people are standing still, and the momentum of death is rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man took the dragon and the beautiful knights striding forward, until they stopped ten meters away. Rogge looked at the future property in front of him one by one and looked at it with enthusiasm. The knights behind him are also very sturdy, looking at the dwarves in the end of the road with a look of arrogance, full of a small person's dedication. Only Kate's face was like water, and he couldn't help but look at the hammer of anger. The ten fingers holding the gun were loose and tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha!" This time must be three laughs. Rogge smiled in the sky, laughing and angering the flames of the gods. Generally speaking, after laughing, the number will fall apart. I don’t know what to do. I have to do this with my uncle. However, Rogge is not prepared to follow the routine, still laughing, the fat man holding a scroll of chaos, is ready to sneak attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed a few times, and the angry flame hammer was still ready to listen to what nonsense he had next, but he didn’t think that the cold flashed, and Kate had already shot. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar of the Dwarf King, the two groups of people fought together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take my blood as a guide, feed on my flesh..." A huge, old voice echoed in the hall. Rogge glimpsed, looking for the source of the sound. The dwarf warriors suddenly madly attacked, entangled the dragon and the beautiful knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put my heart on the earth, divide my limbs into four sides..." The voice is getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog immediately felt that this was an ancient mantra, and he no longer cares about the dwarf’s life and death, shouted, slammed the soul in a circle, cut down two a dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My eyes will be your eyes, my bones will become your scepter..." The sound is so great that there is a stone crumb on the stone wall.簌 Drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come out! The devils sleeping in the abyss! I will sacrifice my soul to you!" Seeing the spell is about to be completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an old bastard!" The fat man screamed exhaustedly, and a mental impact rushed to the invisible eyes of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old dwarf came out and his eyes were red. After completing such a big spell, he could not withstand the spiritual impact of Rogge, and his eyes spewed out two The fine blood. But the spell has been completed, and the body of the eye has blown into a cloud of blood in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall shook a little slightly, and in the distance there was a faint sound of something falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate changed his face and called: "Stone Bridge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone wall in the hall suddenly Falling down, a huge beetle-shaped creature two meters high jumped out of the hole. Its four hind legs landed, and the whole body suddenly stood up. The ends of the two forelimbs were covered with extremely sharp serrations. A pair of huge compound eyes were reddened by the blood of the eyes, and the horrible and ugly mouth could not stop. The screaming voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Abyss Devoters!" After all, Rogge read the book and immediately recognized the creature in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abyss devourer is a sinister abyssal creature, extremely bloodthirsty, action-like, and strong. Although the individual is not very powerful, this creature has always been squadrons, like the wolves of the underground world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the initiative and shouted: "Brothers! Quick withdrawal! Retreat to the outside and say!" As long as he fled to Froja's side, how many abyss devours It doesn't work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, with a cry, another abyss devourer jumped out of the hunters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat face is immediately white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! Devils! This is the price for you to enter the dwarfs! Let my people bury them!" The Dwarf King smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ancestors! Laozi smashed your old potato first! Receive your soul again! You want to die in peace, is it so easy!" At this point, Rogge did not retreat, and he took the axe and smashed it to the angry flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dwarf Wang Wuyi is actually much higher than Rogge, that is, the strength is worse, and the hammer technique is enough to make up for it. Between the three and five, Rogge was sturdy. When Kate saw it, he shot a dwarf and threw it at the Dwarf King. The dwarf was still not dead, and he could not scream in the air. The angry flames hammered his eyes red, screaming and killing Kate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless abyss devourers coming out of the cave. In the eyes of these abyss demons, the two sides that are being torn are food. A beetle went up and down in the battlefield, and one dwarf and the dragon and the beautiful knights fell down. The fallen person was immediately eaten by the abyss devourer, and there was no one left in the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge’s magic has long been exhausted and his body is exhausted. The angry flame hammer has fallen in the laughter. Seven or eight abyss devourers piled on his body, and the sound of biting and chewing made people feel sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King is very happy to die. "You devils! I am going to drag you down to hell, haha..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reversed a beetle with an axe and screamed: Son! Fuck your ancestors! You can rest assured that Laozi must only let you go alone as a bug! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between moments, the dwarves have fallen to the ground, and the dragons and beauty knights around Rogge and Kate are only less than twenty. Everyone hid in the corner of the hall and supported it in a round. It was a little bit profitable, and the front was crowded with seven or eight abyss devourers, giving everyone a little breathing space. But the beetles are still constantly coming from the hole. There was no more than a hundred beetles in the hall. From time to time, someone was dragged out by the beetle and eaten on the spot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rescuer did not come for a long time, that is Come, and will never be the opponent of so many abyss devourers. Rogge is getting more and more desperate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exhausted Rogge finally fell to the ground, and the pain in the calf was a bit of pain. An abyss devourer is fighting with the "reincarnation" of the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn dwarf, Laozi is in hell, and your soul is not finished!" Rogge spit out the last sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After brushing, the abyss devourer who was biting Rogge was split in half by a huge sickle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing ***, Rogge almost burst into tears. *** A few knives cut down the abyss devourer around Rogge and kicked the fat man back into the protective circle. Then *** left and right to catch, and the beetles are killing. However, the abyss devourers are too many, the worms can not pile up, forced to *** have to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s heart gradually sank. At this time, a shout in the distance shouted. Looking at Rogge, it turned out that Paulus had killed with twenty golden lion knights. Looking at the abyss who seemed to be boundless in the hall, Paulus's face was obviously white. He hesitated, and he screamed and led the team to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short distance of 100 meters, but the most elite gold lion knight fell 11 times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Paulus, Rogge was so excited that he couldn’t speak. Paulus brows a wrinkle and does not save the spirit of the Cavaliers. But this does not mean that I don't hate you. If you can go back alive this time, don't expect me to be polite to you! Damn, where are so many bugs coming from? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless abyss of the devourer makes it difficult to cope with it. At the time of the battle, Rogge feels that a mental shock has spread from the body. After exploring more than a dozen abyss devourers, she suddenly flew high from the back of the bone dragon and cast a full-scale squeak on the cliff over a dozen meters high. After the bang, the knives of the *** smashed and a big hole was opened on the cliff.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hole is deep and deep, there is no hole.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lion knight’s cloak is a good rope material. After a moment, a rope hangs in front of everyone. At this moment, count the eight golden lion knights, still alive There are only sixteen people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real knight Paulus led his men to leave, so that Rogge and others who had long been unable to fight again climbed first. Go up. *** Sweep down from the hole, join the battle group again. The smoke on the battlefield, dozens of zombies, cockroaches and some can not name Undead creatures were summoned by ***. However, these creatures were limited in combat power, and they were bitten into pieces of bone and carrion in a blink of an eye. When Paulus began to climb the rope, Gregory screamed. It was torn into a pile of bones.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the left hand of the *** has completely disappeared, and the wings behind it have been torn off halfway, struggling with only one invincible right hand support. She saw that Paulus and the two surviving gold lion knights had climbed into the hole, one wing, barely flew up, and leaped back into the space. Just then, a beetle suddenly jumped up. I bite the leg bones of the *** and dragged her down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, *** was overwhelmed by the boundless beetle. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heartless pain, although it is reasonable that *** is not really going to disappear.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulus, who was in the blood, finally climbed up and saw Rogge’s face grief, still looking down and saying: “The devil was Come? Ok, now is not the time to manage this! We are going fast, we are safe only after we find Princess Froya! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Safety..." Kate spoke to himself, and suddenly he stared at Paulus behind him in horror, unable to speak with a big mouth. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulus was shocked and immediately turned back, but he saw that there was nothing but a beetle that couldn’t help but the people above it.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strong blow behind him, and Paulus couldn’t help but fall out. He looked back in the air and just met Kate’s face. The face of the expression.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beetle instantly swallowed up the food that fell from the sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Rogge couldn’t speak for a while. Until Kate shouted: "What are you doing, come help me!" Rogge hesitated, remembered the past friendship, joined the battle group, solved the golden lion knight in three or two, and threw it into the insect food. . The three dragons and the beautiful knights who are still alive have experienced many tests of life and death. They are extremely fast, although they are not clear, but they all help. Even a seriously injured one barely raised the sword and cut it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, don’t show your position quickly, and wait for a while to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate is very satisfied with his performance, leading the crowd to start looking for an escape route. Rogge caught up with the lead Kate and whispered: "The front is not necessarily safe. How do you start with him now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate silence A moment, whispered back: "Now is not a good time, maybe I am anxious. But for a while, there may not be such an opportunity. We have rushed into this greed and folded so many people, especially a lot of dead. Gold Lion Knight, how do you tell me after going back? Can you see the light with the princess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: "I can and the princess "Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and the princess's two maids have a leg? It is reasonable to say that they will all be Orphey's people in the future. Dagong’s son doesn’t care too much about the two maids, but he’s a little uncomfortable in his heart. But these are trivial things. This time the golden lion knight is almost completely killed, it’s the real big thing! Can’t think of it, or completely destroy all The mouth is actually. Especially Paulus, I see that he is very want to be a princess behind the scenes lover Now only the voice of our own is reported, although it is inevitable that a heavy penalty will be inevitable, but there is still room for some maneuver. Let this Paulus report, if you want to die, you will only flee." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate’s voice is calm, and Rogge’s heart is still somewhat uneasy, and there is a hint of coziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fat man thought about it, Kate was insidious, but in the past few times he was born and died, he never left himself. As for this killing of Paulus, the beneficiary actually There are also myself. He sighed and followed Kate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After many hardships, the latter are all smooth. Six people found the way back without much trouble, and Froya was standing on the edge of the cliff. Only the remaining 200 people of the hunting team are gathered here. They are placed on the edge of the cliff and are surrounded by a magic circle. A blood-stained creature in the magical array is constantly struggling, with a strong bloody suffocation. From time to time, several abyss devourers jumped out of the darkness, and immediately there was only that blood man in his eyes, rushing away. The warriors who were guarding the magical squadron slashed and slashed, and threw the body into the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge and others, Flora’s face was a surprise, and then she was surprised. She did not expect that more than a hundred people actually only six people came back alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the magical power of the eye-catching abyss devourer has been exhausted, and no new beetles will come out. But the existing beetles also need to be dealt with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Flora let everyone appreciate her magical power, or that is her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of the three holes, there is no other way out in that hall. Froya sealed the two exits on the ground with a few simple little magics. She stood on the hole of Rogge's escape, and took out a colorful magic scroll. The magic power contained in the reel is almost incomparable to the warrior who can't magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not to use this scroll to let the rich enemy Froya hesitate for a long time. She glanced at Rogge, who was staring at the scroll in her hand, and couldn’t help but be angry and funny. He is such a beautiful woman standing in front of him, his erotic man is only staring at the magic scroll and mammoth. However, still he knows the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Rogge saw the use of a magic scroll, it also required such a lengthy spell. The tangible curse was full of chanting for three minutes, and a cloud of dark green gas began to spread in the hall. The clouds are everywhere, and the abyss devours people to sneak into the ground. After a short time, they turn over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cloud of Death, the horrible eight-level magic, the creatures in the cloud must constantly suffer the double blow of the soul, which is the magic that is most suitable for the immediate situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, there will be abyss devourers a few meters high, but in vain fall back into the air. Looking at the worms accumulated underneath, Fu Luoya said with some sadness: "If you are not afraid of damaging the baby here, I will not use such a precious magic scroll! I will clean the battlefield and let me pick it first!"哼!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
