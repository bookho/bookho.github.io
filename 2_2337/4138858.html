			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin and penalty chapters fainted in the morning<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning light just reflected the earth, Numerous military numbers broke the tranquility of the morning, and the 100,000-strong army was listed as a majestic battlefield, slowly approaching the city of Yunxiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This division of labor is clear, the main attack is the responsibility of the two major regiments of Glacier and Poseidon, Rogge’s main task is to meet and entangle the other party to dare to rush into the battlefield. Strong, lest they cause confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walks side by side with Alexander and Pompey. Although he smiles, he has no grasp of his task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class is absolutely unwilling to be enemies with the city of Yunxiao. I have not known where I have been at this moment. Both Serrafi and Hughes also made excuses to run, and the only thing that made him feel comfortable was that Androni was finally back. With her sitting in the town, Rogge’s bottom is full. Although Androni's heat is still a little worse, it is also a sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the Elder Hall of the Cloud City, the atmosphere is unprecedentedly dignified. All the important people in the city have arrived to discuss how to deal with this unprecedented crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large elders hall is empty at the moment, and now there are fewer than ten people in more than 20 elders, and the rest of the elders are scattered throughout the mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elder said: "So far, more than 4,000 soldiers have been summoned from various places, and the current high-level Drew in the city of Yunxiao There are fifty, and there are more than one hundred and twenty in the middle and low-level Druids. This is all the power we have now. The rest of our reinforcements have been stopped by Alexander, they can not cross the blockade and We meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another elder caressed the dark blue long beard and said: "This time Alexander and Pompey took great risks to attack the clouds. City. The land really made us unexpected. But with the power we are now assembling, relying on the city of Yunxiao, it is enough to withstand the 100,000 troops of the other side. What's more, the natural danger of the city of Yunxiao, plus the ice wind There is no possibility that they will be attacked by the existence of enchantment. As long as they are delayed for a while, they will be known to attack us. The emperor will do whatever it takes. Under heavy pressure, it will inevitably take action to severely punish this. Two daring guys. By then, Empire III The famous will go to the second, and there will be only Frederick standing on our side. It is a matter of course to master the power of the emperor. At that time, our generals should also grow up. So, it seems that Alexander and Pompey are just vain. It gives us such a good opportunity without any reason!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other figure is surprisingly tall The elder frowned: "The elders of Elvis, who have been able to enjoy many years of fame, will certainly not be so arrogant. In particular, Alexander fought in the West Xinjiang for more than ten years, and completely defeated hundreds of thousands of dwarves in 100,000 people. Destroyed several famous dwarf empire, but this must not be a small person. In my opinion, they must have powerful means that we don’t know. I will see you together. I think it should start the 'sky Angry, so at least unbeaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blues’s Elvis’s face sinks and says: “After the sky’s wrath is started, the clouds are The magic of the city’s accumulation will consume 20%! I don’t think it’s completely It is necessary to have this! I will lead the Druids to fight for a while, to test their strengths! I will see if the Emperor God has any skill!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall elder frowned: "But it takes at least three hours to start the wrath of the sky! If..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ervi Sri Lankan said: "Even if I fail. Elder Gavin, can you tell me how their 100,000 ordinary warriors climbed 2,000 meters on the peak of almost completely vertical clouds and attacked the clouds? City?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gao Gawen’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the wrath of the sky in the north of Druid, who has been silently, has finally opened: "Don’t fight any more! Elvis, you lead Drew Follow the warriors and see what they have. The rest of the elders will come with me, and we will start the sky wrath now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elders are a bit stunned They did not think that the wrath of the sky would make such a decision that both sides are satisfied. The behaviors that are common in such politicians are simply similar to the hustle and bustle at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world that the ice wind sees in the eyes is not what they can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the sky looked at Elvis, and suddenly sighed heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the clouds, a large number of clouds suddenly emerged, and when the clouds were exhausted, thousands of Druid warriors appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The city of the clouds...they are too self-conscious!" Alexander was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is just around the corner, and Pompey, who has always been easygoing, has begun to faintly reveal murderousness. He faintly said: "Like us, it seems that Druid is also preparing to give us A surprise! Go to Master Rockefeller and let the Druids see the blizzard magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander went to the sound, and after a short time, the wind gradually It’s getting bigger, and the breeze that was originally on the way has turned in the direction and turned into a gust of wind blowing to the Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, snow has fallen in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature dropped sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poseidon warriors have long been familiar with the blizzard magic, they have flashed blue light constantly, and the armor has been adjusted to the ice defense property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the Druid Warriors, the great elder Elvis made a strange long sound, his body swelled rapidly, and his body robe was blinked. Supported into pieces and rags. Then, with more than 100,000 pairs of eyes watching, his lower body has become a huge deer body, the upper body still retains the human form, and the muscles of the knots show the terrorist power of this huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He greeted the whistling snow and glared at the enemies in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alves is now over five meters tall, and four giant hoofs with shimmering light have bucket sizes! Suddenly he screamed with a scream of noise, and a giant dorsal fin like a battle flag suddenly exploded behind Elvis. Flying proudly in the snow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvis once again roared, the oak staff in his hand slammed forward, then stepped on the thunder, even alone facing the opposite 100,000 The army launched a charge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of Druid warriors screamed, followed by the footsteps of Elvis, and began an assault! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is suddenly big! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller began to add ** wind and snow power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander squinted and gave the first order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of reloaded infantry are taking a heavy step. Came to the front. They inserted a huge shield on the ground and extended the rifle out of the shield. A steel barrier was formed before the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand spearmen also stepped out of the battlefield and waited. Only when entering the range, the enemy will use their own blood to check the horror power of the three-meter heavy iron spear in their hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge figure of Elvis has become clear in the snow, and the front row of heavy infantry have even seen his face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blizzard is whistling, in the raging wind, the piece of snow has become a killing weapon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as the spears have tightened their muscles, the moment they throw their iron spears. There was a huge indescribable noise on the battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the smashing, there is no more sound between heaven and earth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spearmen fell down, and many of the fallen soldiers’ ears spurred two thin blood lines! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the disaster is not over yet...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another big electric light quietly falling, this is A horrible electric light that is several tens of meters thick! With the electric light falling, hundreds of spearmen have disappeared completely, just as they have never existed in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander looked up at the sky, and the spiral clouds over the city of Clouds did not know when it had expanded into a horrible cloud vortex with a length of hundreds of kilometers. The dark clouds formed by Rockefeller's blizzard magic have been swept into the vortex and become part of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvis screamed, his mouth spurting a large group of brown mist. The fog spread at an incredible speed, and instantly surpassed the forefront of thousands of heavy infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, the fog has faded, but the brown color of the fog has remained on the heavy infantry's armor, rifle and shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young heavy infantryman has been seriously injured in the terror. He couldn't support it anymore, and suddenly fell to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of the light, the heavy shield that was dyed brown in his hand actually fell into several pieces! Among the fractures, there is a layer of rust, no wonder it will break when it falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the shield, his long shot was broken into two sections, and the heavy armor on his body also fell off! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is dignified. He had already expected to hide the dragon and the tiger in the city of Yunxiao, but never imagined that an elder Druid would be able to use ‘metal rust’ to such a degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvis once again arrogant, an invisible force field emanating from him, centered on him. The heavy infantry who were within 100 meters of him could not help but be pushed away. This force field does not work for them. They are dragged away by the armor of their bodies and the shield of weapons in their hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘metal push away’, Rogge once again saw the great role of Drew in the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye. The line of defense of the elite heavy infantry was opened by Alves to a hard place. Elvis sneered and inserted the oak stick in his hand into the dirt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty shoots emerged from the soil, and instantly grew up and turned into dozens of trees up to four meters. These tree people have just formed, they have been ordered by Elvis, swarming through the gap on the heavy infantry defense line, rushing to the rear spearmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei, who has been calmly watching the battle, suddenly pulled out the sword and pulled out the sword. After the magic was applied, Elvis was in a weak state! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand Poseidon warriors singularly arrogant, and Qi Qi throws the battle axe in his hand to Elvis! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the whistling axe of the sky, even if it is a dragon, Elvis will be hit hard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never imagined that the ability of the Poseidon Corps to master the instant fighters was so strong that at this moment his face was also panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another large electric light silently falls in front of Elvis. As soon as the battle axe was put into the electric light, it was destroyed by the irresistible energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the ultimate magic of the City of Clouds, the wrath of the sky?" Alexander smiled, and he turned his head to the war priest around Calda: " Is there a way to deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calda did not answer, he just squinted and stared at the swirling vortex in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he screamed and screamed, waving a huge three-headed chain and rushing to the battle of the heavy knights in the left column! With his movements, hundreds of war priests in the battlefield quickly gathered in the battle for the heavy knights. And the tens of thousands of heavy-loaded knights still maintain a neat queue. From the action of the war priests, they already know that the next 'sky wrath' will fall on their heads, but no one knight tries to escape, they just do their best. Use your anger to add a bit of defense to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wars of the War Division have waved the chain in their hands, and each time they wave, there will be more than a dozen knights flashing a light blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, the 10,000 reloaded knights were covered in a light blue glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electric light has fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fall in the battle of the reloading knight, as the war priest Calda expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
