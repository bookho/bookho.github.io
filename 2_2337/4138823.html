			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;□[Repost: Insights on spatial rules] 1: The whole world is divided into countless parallel spaces, where the energy in one space forms God and becomes Spirit world. God understands some of the rules of space, so God goes out to conquer other spaces, and forcibly promotes the rules of the space in which God is located to other spaces. It is now the turn of Rogge's space. The devil world is a space different from God. The energy inside forms the Mozu. The Mozu may also conquer some space. They also want to touch this space of Rogge. In addition, there may be some other gods who have formed space energy to create their religion. They also want to occupy the space of Rogge, and the forces of all parties will accumulate in the space of Rogge. Zczl<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;□[Repost: Insights on Space Rules] 2: As for the space where Fengyue is located, it is a space conquered by God, the divine energy inside, Has been received as a voter in the realm of the gods (because the reincarnation angel will return to the gods in the form of energy after death, reference to the two angels absorbed by the wind), and the energy of the demon may also be absorbed into the devil world may be The angels are destroyed, leaving only some of the energy of death, so there will be other space of soul or death power absorbed into this space, such as Gregory. The space in which the pet is summoned by the mage is not fixed. The windy moon is just in this space, and because of the powerful spirit of Rogge, it can enter this different space. Zczl<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;□[Repost: Insights on space rules]3: Although the angel conquered this space, but because the death atmosphere is too large, it is not suitable for angels to live, so There are no angels, but the atmosphere of death is too great. The gods are also afraid of the accumulation of death energy to produce anti-theistic power. Therefore, there are hunters to patrol to prevent. The convergence of the energy of death (that is, the energy of the soul) will produce kings, and most of the kings have taught the horrors of angels (they may be the annihilator of a certain space), so they can only bear it. Zczl<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;□[Reposted: Insights on Space Rules]4: From the cognition of Elysses and the appearance of the Mozu spy, the Mozu knows How to freely enter and exit the space, but can not control which space to go, must have the coordinates of the spirit, this point is the same magic of Fu Luoya, and the space that Fu Luoya can control, in fact, only the artifact lost paradise created That space only. The Protoss can control which space to go, but can't guarantee the original energy after freely entering and leaving the space. Zczl<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Reposted: Insights on spatial rules]5: Assuming that the above inferences are correct, then the demon world seems to be more powerful, so the Protoss still needs to conquer a few more spaces. Concentrate the divine power to go to the gods to increase the divine power, so it can be said that both the Protoss and the Mozu masters have mastered some of the laws of space, so that Rogge has the mastery of all the space laws. So why the Protoss want to collect the image of the purgatory angel, it seems to be related to this. Zczl<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;□A terrible woman once again confirms my theory and experience: don’t offend a woman, let alone offend a little woman, especially don’t offend a lace Woman lingshide<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;□[Repost: Insights on space rules]6: And Rodriguez tried to destroy the law of the gods, the law of the gods is It is lower than the space law because it is only a rule of partial space. Rogge wants to establish his own rules. Naturally, he can't overthrow the rules in the laws of the gods. He can only master the rules of space. He can master the rules of the board, and then he can modify the rules of the board of the gods or create a space. Specific rules. Zczl<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;□[Repost: Insights on Space Rules]7: This is also a stronger place for Rogge than Rodriguez, because Rodriguez just thought Put the apple into the board. Once the apple is placed on the board, although the board is changed, the board has not changed, because the maker of the board can adapt to the apple by modifying the rules. For example, if the apple is used as two kings, it can be inclined horizontally and vertically. OK, you can even fly, but the board is still a chessboard, at most because of the power of Apple, and the game is messed up. But God has many chessboards, so Rodriguez will use the energy of this space to resist the laws of God in this space. He may be the strongest in this space, but he still can't host God zczl<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;□[Repost: Insights on Space Rules]9: But Rogge is different, although Rogge is temporarily considered to be an apple on the board, but with Rogge After the complete space law (he is a combination of God and the devil), he can build a new chessboard. On this chessboard, it is necessary to follow the way of the military chess or the method of flying chess. I have the final say. But God obviously has not mastered all the rules of space. It is impossible for God to destroy space. God can only destroy this space. It is impossible to forcefully change the law of existence of this space (existence is reasonable?
