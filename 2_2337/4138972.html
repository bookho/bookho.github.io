			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如一梦卷章九望远下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer sun, thousands of knights guard More than ten carriages are on the way to the southern empire. The center of the carriage is luxurious and wide, and can be pulled by four good horses. The carriage is inlaid with the emblem of the Holy Church. This carriage is almost universally known in the Dro Empire, because it is a carriage dedicated to the Holy Church Pope Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogian sat in the carriage and was looking at the script in his hand. He is about to preach the soldiers of the Dro Empire and the local civilians on the southern front, recruiting new believers, and this thing in his hand is the sermon written by his clerics for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the south is not smooth. Because at this time in this vast area, both cavalry are coming and going, trying to capture the fighter. In front of the thousands of cavalry teams, the guards of the thousand knights are actually very thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly put down the script in his hand and knocked on the window. After a while, the delicate face of the Bauhinia butterfly appeared in front of the window and asked: "What do you mean by Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue Road: "There is a cavalry rushing to us at a high speed, about ten kilometers away from us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly is leading away. The long military number immediately rang, and half of the thousand knights dismounted. They brought up the giant shield, erected a long gun, and defended more than a dozen carriages in the center. The other half of the Cavaliers took the folding handcuffs behind them and quickly filled the arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the carriage, Rogge had finished reading the script, and he took out another magic book and read it in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there has been a faint tremor on the earth, and it is clear that the enemy forces are not small. In the blink of an eye. A knight's figure appeared on a small hill not far away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his back to the sun, stood on the hill, Looking at Roger's team. It’s just such a simple posture, that is, people feel that there is boundless majesty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the thunderous hoofs were transmitted to the team side, and then one knight appeared on the hill, behind the head of the knight In a neat battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team is a bit strange. Their armor systems are not very uniform, and the weapons used in the land are also uneven. It looks like a miscellaneous force. However, when thousands of knights were on the top of the hills and arranged in a neat battle battlefield, the murderousness suddenly rose to the sky, and some of the horses of the Rogge team were stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the carriage's window was opened, and Rogge's face was exposed behind the window, just in time to meet the knight's gaze on the mountain. When the window opened, the murderous air from the distance suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger adults. The enemy looks bad, do we let the ice and snow mage get off the bus and prepare for the battle?" The Bauhinia butterfly goes to the car Next, please show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not heard, just looking at the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hill, a knight went to the side of the knight and said to him: "Kate, it seems that we have caught a rare sight. Big fish! The brethren are all ready. Charge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Charge? Old Ryan, have you experienced sixty-five battles without dying? So I feel a little too long to live?” Kate snorted and then answered: “This time, I just want to see him. This rare big fish... is left to Rosio The marshal will go eat it, I will see if he can eat it. Withdraw the army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights on the hills are rolling away. Rogge took back his eyes and smiled. He said to the Bauhinia Butterfly: "What do you think of that person and his knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very... ... terrible." The Bauhinia butterfly took a long time to find the right word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, our ice warrior has developed in this direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;What makes Rogello feel gratified is. After this incident, although he and Ete have been deeply separated, but Ett has matured a lot and become calm. At this time, he saw Kate in front of the lineup, but as if he did not see it at all, there was no abnormal performance, which made Rogge very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge set foot on the southern land again, the old people of that year would meet one by one. It’s just that the years have passed away. In the twinkling of an eye, things are already human. Seeing this battlefield, Rogge and Kate are just trying to see the old people who have not seen them for a long time. But when they meet next time, are they friends or friends? Rogge didn't know, Kate didn't know it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue on the road!" Rogge commanded, and closed the window. The road is still very long, and the front will not be too flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team that travels between the quiet rolling hills is striking. The guardian strength of the thousand knights is not too big, enough to scare off the enemy of the small stocks, and just happens to be the delicious dish of the guerrilla cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team suddenly stopped. On the distant mountains, there were knights of the brigade. Looking far away, it can be seen that the black battle flag fluttering on the top of the surface, there are strange faces of the upper body as a glamorous woman, the lower body is the pattern of the horrible spider torso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today’s Didro Empire, this battle flag is well known. That is the human face spider knight led by Gonzalez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, not waiting for Rogge, thousands of ice warriors will be dismounted, holding a shield and holding a gun, quietly waiting for the enemy's charge. The Ice Warrior is not a professional knight, so after being approached by such a regular knight, the escape is sure to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hill, Gonzalez took off his helmet and squinted his eyes and looked at the distant team. He has a beard and a long brown-haired hair fluttering in the breeze, looking rough and mighty. The same is true of his style of bringing troops. If there is a hurricane, it is often rushing to kill, and immediately after the battle is set to fly high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gangzares! From the point of view of the badge, it is the team of the Holy Church Pope Rogge! It’s incredible, he dared to appear in this place, And only a thousand guards! Adults, our number is four times their number. This is a golden opportunity, charge it!" The deputy behind Gonzalez was in desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gonzalez raised his hand. Stopping the adjutant's words, slowly said: "From the route they came from, they must have met the Lions Legion. But can you see the signs of fighting from them?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no place! I have heard that the Lions Army Corps commanded General Kate and the Holy Church Pope Rogge had old friendships. Is this time Kate adults intend to go private? If this is the case, then we can make another contribution after we catch Pope Rogge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gonzalez snorted. Dao: "Do you think that Kate who climbed out of the dead heap would value the old feelings like this? Like his kind of person who struggled on the edge of life and death every day, he would have a natural instinct for danger. He let this big fish only let go. There is a reason, that is, he can't swallow it! Kate can't swallow the fish. Do you think we might swallow it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant still doesn't give up After all, this fish is really too big. Have you caught Rogge, is it a great achievement? So he still said: "Adult, this may be Rogge's guilty conscience. In any case, we should also attack their battles. Try the real thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gonzalez put on his helmet and waved his hand and said, "You don't have to say more, withdraw the army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage in the middle of Rogge closed the magic book Darkly said: "It seems that Anne's brother is very eye-catching!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the trouble on the road has not come to an end. In the early morning of the next day, the safari cavalry of the third Bavarian Principal appeared again at the end of the avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of this cavalry looks out into the distance. There is also some hesitation. Like the Lions Legion, he is part of the Southern Legion of the Bavarian Principality. He knows the hunting area of ​​the Lions Legion, and he wonders why Kate will let go of the delicious taste. But he did not resist the huge temptation, and led the 3,000 light cavalry to charge the Rogge team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safari cavalry tactics are quite clever. They know that opponents with heavy rifle guns are very difficult to deal with, so they are ready to run around the team to find their opponents. flaw. Only when they rushed to the front of the Cavaliers just pulled closer to the team, suddenly, an invisible pressure on the face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rogge team is ready for this. All the ice warriors have been dismissed. Although the horses are showing signs of being shocked, they are held by the masters, but they are only uneasily stepping on the four hooves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large area of ​​invisible pressure that seems to move, quickly catching up with the hunting cavalry who have found it different and trying to avoid this strange area . These cavalry can only do their best to control the frightened horses under the arm of the moment. How can they charge the Rogge team? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the doors of more than ten carriages in the team opened wide, and dozens of mages emerged, attacking magic in a wide range of attacks. After the batch of hunting cavalry on the head, the ice warriors who had been replaced with the round shield tomahawks screamed and rushed to the chaotic hunting cavalry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is over soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunting cavalry threw down more than a thousand bodies and fled. Half of these dead and wounded people died under their own horseshoes. As for the Rogge side, only a dozen Ice Warriors suffered minor injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a brilliant record, in fact, should be attributed to the underground gnomes that are always hidden behind the scenes. Not to mention that Gregory's hiding power is far beyond the Sanctuary killer, that is, it stands openly there, and it is estimated that there will not be a few full-speed charge knights who will notice such a trivial little thing. However, Longwei of Gregory can be genuine, after the dragon is reduced to the lowest. The coverage area has been greatly expanded, and the underground gnomes have become the coverage of Longwei within a few hundred meters of the week. The faint Longwei is not enough to intimidate the determined knight, but the war horse is different. The innate instinct makes them feel even a little bit of Gregory's breath, and they will be afraid of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnomes quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of pleasure that acts as a behind-the-scenes hand has filled the whole body, and this time it’s beautiful, and maybe it’s rewarded by the owner of Wella when I go back. Even if the owner does not reward it, now the master's master is no longer the same. Presumably, it is also possible to get some benefits from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After simply cleaning the battlefield, the team has already started. This time Rogge’s team has never encountered a new attack. When arriving at the destination, Roger’s magic book just turned to the last page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon is in the sky. The cold moon rushed down and put a layer of silver ash on the southern land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a waterfall, Androni stood on a boulder in the waterhole and watched the cascading waterfall fall into the pool below. Beside her, stood a man in his early thirties, his beard trimmed very neatly. Elegance is evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, come back to us! Father needs you very much now." The man said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at the waterfall, and for a long time said: "All you need is the sword in my hand, although I don't know where to go now. But... I don't want to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man sighed and said: "Annie, even if my father and we value power, but the connection between the blood It’s impossible to get rid of it! You will come to me. I’m afraid it’s hurt by them? Oh, it’s too stubborn, you don’t care if you don’t want to come back. Some words I shouldn’t have said, but I It’s your brother, you can’t watch you go to destruction. This war. You can’t win it! If you don’t want to come back to us, leave here immediately, go as far as you can! After the war, Come back to the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni didn't turn around, just sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked at the position of the blue moon and said: "The time is not early, I should go back to the military camp. You remember my words." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps and finally couldn’t help but turn back and sighed, "Annie... In fact, we are not missing this sword in your hands." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s body trembled. But finally hold back. Did not look back. Her heart just thought: "But I... I can't leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Moon is moving quietly in the night sky, and it will fall into the distance in a blink of an eye. In the faint mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breeze swept behind Androni. After the wind stopped, she had another figure behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge faintly said: "To find you, just use your heart. Is it possible for a kind person like me to have a magic mark on you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Androni took a sip and said, "You are kind? That's a hell! You have to find me something, just say it! It is impossible to think of me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have made a bet, I am here to prepare for this bet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni This reminds me that she did have a duel with Rogge, and if she lost, she would have to deal with Rogge. She smiled coldly and raised her sword. She said, "Good! But I have recently started to be heavy, and you have been careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled slightly. The capacity of the foot, like standing on the ice, slips back. Driven by his mental power, advanced stone skin surgery, shadowing, injury protection and other magic blessed one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is a little bit stunned. In her memory, Rogge's battle never followed the usual tactics of the magician, but this time he performed too much like a normal magician, which is really wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sighed and sighed, and the temper was instantly lifted to the extreme, and it became a water blue vindictive armor in the body. Then she rushed to Rogge and flew directly to Rogge's throat! Just in the moment of the sword and the body, Rogge’s figure suddenly fell into a point, and a total of seven Rogge stood in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phantom is a very high-level but very practical magic. Each time an attacker hits a caster, the damage is transferred to a shadow cast. The caster himself was able to escape the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled coldly, and the blue sky trembled, and immediately stabbed Rogge six times, destroying him all. At this point, the spell prepared by Rogge is just finished. She saw the machine is not good, the figure immediately flashed, and immediately around Rogge, to prevent him from locking his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge adds protective magic to himself, opens the distance, and casts a weakened spell to Androni. Then attack with the attack magic. This battle can be used as a classic textbook for the decisive tactics of the caster and the warrior. The only difference is that Rogge's curse magic has a very high success rate. In fact, as long as the fat is locked in position. Androni has not yet succeeded in resisting the curse. And all the protective magic of the fat man is instant, so that she can hardly find the gap in the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this battle, Androni had to be very careful, and her heart was screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is finally here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly took out a huge and quaint magic scroll from his arms, Androni couldn’t see the thickness of the bowl, half a meter long How the magic scroll was originally put down in this fat man's arms. It was only Rogge who looked at the reel and suddenly paused and seemed to take the wrong scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Androni lose this opportunity? She bullied Rogge like electricity. A sword bypasses the reel and stabs to Rogge's shoulder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the fat man suddenly smiles treacherously. He turned a huge reel, knocking down her head like a thunder! Androni was shocked, she barely flicked, and the result was a sharp pain on her wrist, and the stars fell out of the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the alarming Androni and smiled: "You lost! Who stipulated that this must be a magic scroll?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly unrolled the scroll, which was a blank. This thing. In fact, it is just a short copper rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is a frosty, hateful to Rogge. Finally, her eyes closed and I said coldly: "I did lose. How do you want to do it, move faster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog picked up the blue sky The starry sky is in her hands. Gentle and authentic: "If you lose, then you have to listen to me. You are leaving the Dro Empire now, the farther you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;安Droni suddenly opened his eyes and stayed, saying: "You... how are you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "You want to say How suddenly I became very good, isn't it? The world is actually very indifferent, and now it is chaotic, everyone is only thinking about themselves. If I don't care about you, this time. Who will care about you? Leave Annie. You don't belong here. This war has nothing to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
