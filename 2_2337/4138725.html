			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter Ten Legends<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious music is floating in the forest, the elf's team is procrastinating Deferred, I can't see the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sarah musicians played beautiful music, and the elves who inherited the songs sang old songs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves live a simple and natural life, and there is not much trouble in moving. Countless plant seeds will reconstruct an elf city in the future. Each of the three elf rituals carries a golden, full-sized seed. This is the seed of the three elves old trees. Under the influence of magic, the original ancient trees bear the fruit that gathers all the essences, and then wither. In the next place, the elves will grow up again and shelter the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This large-scale migration broke the silence in the Central Mountains. Hundreds of elf Rangers and Jungle Killers wandered around the brigade, and they scouted for a hundred kilometers. In the sky above the team, there were always a few lions circling, monitoring the wind and the wind in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more than ten Modo dragons raised by the Changshengshu tribe are not used for war, but are used to relocate and haul raw materials. This huge creature, which is more than ten meters long and extremely thick and strong, can carry more than ten tons of heavy objects, or drag dozens of tons of goods behind it. The trucks of the Longevity Tree Tribe are also amazing, light, elegant and strong. At the back of each monitor lizard, a long rig of trucks is towed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Dark Moon' tribe is known for its force, and there are dozens of beasts. From the assassination of the Shadow Devil to the slap-sized, golden and purple king bee, it looks very strange, not the style of the elf. But the same thing is that these beasts, regardless of size, are extremely dangerous. The nearby elves are far away from them. Although Rogge is not afraid of the beasts like the Shadow Devil, he feels very uncomfortable with the Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, it should have been the most powerful flying seven-color deer tribe because the wetland dragons all died, this move is a bit bleak. Rogge also regretted it. I knew it was so early. I really shouldn’t have done it so much, but I still cut my arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding in the white tall dragon, Rogge really has a little anticipation. Just looking at this endless team of elves, he always smiles. Originally, I only wanted to take a ticket and left, but now it seems to be tied to the chariot. In any case, this is a huge team and a great force. It’s used well, maybe it’s the foundation for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, managing this tens of thousands of elves is not an easy task. Rogge couldn't help but miss the brothers who created the hammer of the god of war. Now, he can only rely on him alone. Her relationship with elf elders, especially Hughes, is subtle. The elves have their own interests. How to gradually bring these elves to their own tracks, I am afraid it is a problem that will make Rogge have a headache for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, the benefits of fat harvesting are also enormous. He listened to the low roar of the white tiger behind him, and he couldn't help but rejoice. Since being assigned to Rogge's personal guard, the wind butterfly is inseparable from Rogge. It’s just that her white tiger and Rogge’s dragon horse don’t look at each other, they always have to face each other. However, although the white tiger of Fengdie is a well-known genius in the elves, it is always afraid to be too close to Rogge. Perhaps it is a lingering fear of the day. So the two animals who are not in one grade at all are relatively roaring every day. Longma is very clever, it is a horse, and it is always away from Rogge. If it is a single order, it will not be close to the white tiger halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked at the singularity of the wind and said, "I don’t mind if I look at the old things of Xiusi." The elf goes to bed! Even the wind butterfly has been sent over, it is really the cost! If I have such a big blood, I must recover several times of interest. It seems that the elves are not doing well, old Things will never stop with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly two angry eyes fell on Rogge. In the heart of Rogge, pretending to be nothing, sneaked away and saw the fire of hatred flashing away in the eyes of Rumsfeld in the distance. The fat man smiled and left God in his heart. This ramsfield and the wind butterfly are both guardians of the sanctuary. Seeing this is very interesting for the wind butterfly. Although the elves have a bright and pure character, he is unlikely to slap himself in the back, but Rogge has never been soft on this kind of rival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man secretly made up his mind and must find an opportunity to quietly kill this Rumsfeld. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves who follow God and search for the Holy Land go northward day after day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is getting colder, and occasionally a few yellow leaves fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days, eleven elder elders and three elf sacrifices formed a new Presbyterian church. Under the insistence of Elder Chess, Roger was also entered into the Presbyterian Church and was regarded as a great elder. A human race has become a great elder of the elves, and it still makes some elves unable to adapt, even though this person is a god-giving adult. But with the full support of all the elders, the elves are also helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to drive this huge elf chariot, Rogge has exhausted his efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way north, the three elves sacrificed several times to find a beautiful place, suitable for the growth of elves and old trees, intending to settle down here, but by Rogge again and again The ground was vetoed. The elders are standing on the side of Rogge, but the elf rituals have gradually raised objections. In their view, many of Rogge’s actions slowly began to deviate from Hilo’s teachings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf rituals who follow Rogge are the heroic believers of Hilo, who have always regarded Hilo’s words and deities in the miraculous era as the supreme example. Therefore, Rogge, who is known as the Hero of Hilo, appears, and they will follow Rogge northbound desperately. However, after Rogge took over the power of the Elves, the series of orders issued was quite different from the previous nature of the Elves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat in the name of training, the four elites of the fighting force was drawn out, forming a mixed combat force composed of eight hundred elf warriors. The first battle of this unit was to attack an orc village encountered on the way to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves and the orcs have inextricable hatred, and the elves, especially the female elves, will fall in love immediately if they fall into the hands of the orcs. But even after committing suicide, their bodies could not escape the embarrassment of the barbaric beasts. With this historical hatred, Roger’s proposal to destroy the orc village is not objected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ordinary orc village, where can you stand the attack of a very elite elf warrior? In a moment, more than a hundred adult orcs who rushed out of the village were shot by the elves. Occasionally, the orcs are outcropping in the village, and they will be nailed to death by the elf god shooters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger rides on the dragon horse, under the guard of the twelve elf guardian warriors, watching the battle on a high ground next to the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elf knight to return the battle: "God makes the adults! All the orcs who can fight in this village are cleared, the battle is over. Adults, are we going to go? Chasing the brigade?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The battle is over? Why didn't I think? Is there an orc in the village?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The elf knight is a slogan...Adult, there are some orcs in the village! But...they are all children and women..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s voice is as cold as the smog in hell: “Children will grow into warriors, The woman will give birth to a new child. Thirty years later, this village will have hundreds of orcs who hate the elves! The battle is not over yet, I need no more orcs in this village! Whether she is a mother! Still a child who is breastfeeding! Go and execute the order! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This! grown ups! This violates the principle of the elf! The elf is caring for life! "The elf knight slammed and fiercely opposed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked around and saw the elf warriors around him were unbelievable. Expression.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a god! I am also the elder of the Presbyterian Church! My order represents the will of Hilo! You must perform! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I refuse! "The elves' reluctance is also famous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Rumsfeld! Rogge shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the guardian warriors and go to the orc's village. After five minutes, I don't want that village to have any living orcs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lahms Field opened his mouth and closed it. As the guardian of the sanctuary, obeying the command of the elders and sacrifices is his highest principle. He turned over his huge elk, waved his hand and rushed down the hill with ten guardian warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a demon!" The elf knight who refused the order was excited. He couldn’t control himself and rushed over to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was green and the elf knight was shot down on the ground. The wind butterfly with the huge wheel saw then fell lightly, placing the extremely sharp carousel on the neck of the Elf Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc village began to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glanced deeply at the elf knight in front of him and asked, "What do you say in the Elf Code when attacking elders and divines?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf knight screamed angrily: "What is the crime of slaughtering women and children in the Elf Code?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I represent the will of Hilo. The Elf Code is the embodiment of Hilo's will, and I, the god of Hilo. So, the Elf Code should be explained by me! I hope that you remember that the two orders must obey." People can't be human." Rogge was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You demon, you have forsaken the beliefs and principles of the elves! You killed me!" The elf knight struggled, but the seemingly weak wind pressure The hand on his back neck has a lot of strength, and he can't get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the wind butterfly, her face has an intolerable color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is a worthless person, but the life of the elf is noble. I won't kill any elf at will. Just spare your life, go back to the Green Sea yourself! Don't have to follow me anymore! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man caught a hint of joy in the eyes of the wind butterfly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eleven guardian warriors have returned Russfield is full of bloody blood of the orcs, all eyes are bloodshot, and the handsome face is floating up, it looks very embarrassed. He turned over from The elk jumped up and took a hurricane.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes the adults, according to your orders, all the orcs do not stay. "Rumsfeld didn't look to Rogge, nor did he look at the wind butterfly. His voice was calm, but Rogge heard his inner anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge nodded and smiled: "Very good! It is the most proud sacred guardian of the elves! Hilo will reward you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly looked at Rumsfeld melancholy, but wanted to say something, but closed his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these fat guys are in the eye. In his eyes, the wind butterfly is already his own property. Under the acquiescence of the Presbyterian Church, as long as he does things, it will not arouse the public anger of the elves. There will be no interference, and the simple elves are not the opponents of his conspiracy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that Wind Butterfly and Rumsfeld are mutually There is a bit of affection.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," Rogge thought bitterly. "I see how long your affection will last! It won't take long, I will turn Rumsfeld into a devil! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneered in his heart and led the elves to chase the brigade.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this campaign, Rogge led the elves to the orcs and goblin villages encountered on the way, and the World of Warcraft community began to sweep again and again. At the end of each battle, he would send Rumsfeld to lead the guardian warriors. Finally, the battlefields are cleaned up. The elves are honored, and the fat people know that they will kill all the enemies as long as they promise not to live, regardless of their age and gender.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge is not entirely convinced of the rumors. He has secretly observed the entire battlefield with his mental power the previous time, until he confirmed that the elves had executed his orders without compromise, and this took over. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God made the cold warfare means of the adults shocked all the elves, and even the elders of the Sisters who were born in the killer could not accept it for a while. In the middle of the night, Hughes quietly visited Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes adults, this series of killings makes it difficult for me to be a killer, and the mood of the people can be imagined. Why?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Xius, you know, the human world is very turbulent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves want to exhibit, they must stand around the human kingdom, and learn from the human race. We have to go to the north, except for more than ten Outside the country, there is a terrible big empire: the Asrofik Empire. What do you think is the most important thing in the turbulent times?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course, strength means to say, force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is it. The elders of Xius, the old rules of the elves are too much, too peace-loving and Life. On the battlefield, these will become fatal wounds of the elves. The elves are excellent warriors, but the elves do not have a good army. Now these small-scale killings are Train a persevering and elite elf force. We may have a series of battles at the beginning of the human border. We must prepare early. Peace has never been obtained at the negotiating table. Peace can only be in war and blood. If I can change the life of an elf with the life of a hundred orcs, I think it is worth it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of the fat man The thoughts of the proud elves. Hughes listened and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Xiusi, if the elves do not want to continue to hide in the mountains, this is the only way! In the future Presbyterian, I am afraid you have to support me more. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes finally chose to support Rogge unconditionally, and he was over-represented, and Rogge regained the upper hand in the Presbyterian Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rituals are the most opposed to Rogge’s practice. In their view, Rogge is the embarrassment of the most basic teachings of Hilo. The most powerful against Rogge is the female sacrifice of the Sala people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing mature and glamorous, compared to the thinness of other elves, she is very full. Unfortunately, Rogge knew that she was an avid believer, and that Hilo's sacrifices must maintain their purity, which allowed the lustful fat man to dispel the unclean thoughts. However, even if Rogge had always had a good impression of her, every time the Presbyterians always met her crazy opposition, they would not be able to stand it. Although the opposition voices of the sacrificial monks did not affect Rogge's final decision, the fat man had made up his mind that once he found a suitable settlement, he would begin to resolve these opposition voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't let these elves slap on me! If you go on, you can't do anything!" Rogge began to conceive new ideas in his spare time. Power structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs blind faith and dictatorship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the interests of the saints, Rogge is still firmly pursuing his bloody plan. After more than a month of northward travel, the hands of all Elf warriors have been contaminated with the blood of women and children of different races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Wind Butterfly quietly came to Rogge’s camp. She wore a dark green robe that was common to the elves, and the special body armor had been removed. This robes shows her perfect posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is a little pale. Rogge saw her come in, and some of them guessed her intentions. But he didn't break it, just let her sit down, and the two were speechless. In the end, the wind butterfly couldn't help but speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does God make adults not to kill the village again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Say you are real Come here, in front of me, don't have to go around." Rog smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind butterfly face red, bowed his head and gently said: "God can not let the adults do not let Rumsfeld clean up the battlefield again? He will collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and asked: "Then you said, who is going to clean the battlefield?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God made the adults clean the battlefield!" She finally got the courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible. Let you do this, all the elves will hate me, against me. If I fall, then the elves change The fate of the effort will stop here. You said, should I use the fate of the entire elf to fulfill your self-sacrificing ideal?" The fat man suddenly regarded himself as the savior of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a chaos in the wind, she really does not understand why the idea of ​​sacrificing self has turned into the evil to send the whole family of the elves into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..." Rogge stood up and walked behind the wind butterfly. "Maybe I will think about relocating Rumsfeld." Said, he gently stroked the beautiful pointed ears of the wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the Elf's ear is a very intimate move, because the ear is one of the most sensitive parts of the elf. A touch of blush spread across the ears, cheeks and neck of the butterfly. She suddenly stood up and panicked. "What did God make an adult... Is this a deal?" Later, there was already a trace of anger in her voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, do you want to think about it?" Rogge took a hard look and embraced the butterfly in his arms. Under the soft, thin robes, he can clearly feel the perfect curve of the butterfly. He reached into the chest of the wind butterfly with one hand and took her slim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly, you know, I can make Rumsfeld a devil. Of course, it depends on how you choose." Rogge gently Biting the ears of the wind butterfly, blowing into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reject! "The wind butterfly suddenly broke free from Rogge's arms and rushed out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at her back and smiled calmly. Since the butterfly has become The bargaining chip of this big deal, wanting to run out of Rogge’s palm, is it easy?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northbound seems to have no end, the Presbyterian Church is getting more and more silent. Only The Philippine elders of Xius, Sarah, and the seven-color deer tribe know where the end of the trip is.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge will lead the elves through the Central Mountains to the north. The human kingdom, where to find a place that borders the human kingdom, lays the foundation. The fat man said to the three elders that the elves must communicate with the human race and exchange each other for real change. The real idea in his heart is that it is only It only makes sense in the human kingdom. Only when you reach the summit of power can you really have the opportunity to challenge the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competing with a behemoth like the Bright Church, win Negative is no longer a victory for several battles. This kind of battle. Fighting, fighting resources, all kinds of resources.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root of power is the right to allocate resources.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of fighting for power, whether he used the legend to deceive the elves, or whether he was originally part of the legend of the elves, Rogge is already unclear.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;月夜.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming sound resounded through the forests of the Central Mountains and stunned a large bird.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni slammed up and gasped. She couldn’t remember to have this nightmare for the first time.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up in her cloak, drilled a tent, and the cold moonlight fell on her, and the wind in the late autumn brought a chill of bones. The flush of Androni’s face gradually faded. However, the whole body is still soft and weak, especially the two long legs, like cotton.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took a deep breath of cold air, this It’s good As soon as she closes her eyes, she will see the deep, silvery eyes, the beautiful face, and the pair of soft, delicate hands that have caused her countless nightmares. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her white teeth gently bite her lower lip, desperately trying not to recall the absurdity of a month ago. But all this is just like life, the cold and smooth hands walked around her body, not letting every inch of skin, every corner. The hands seem to have a strange magical power. Wherever they go, they are soft, sour, and a strange feeling that can't be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
