			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin and fines are faint on the morning<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章一晨昏<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a distance of only a few hundred kilometers from the emperor, there is a wilderness that is invigorating. There are no birds on this wilderness, and no animal beasts can be heard. Even plants with strong adaptability such as cactus and seabuckthorn can not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that for some mysterious reason, all vitality is far from the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from another perspective, this wilderness can also be said to be full of vitality, because at least 50,000 troops are now stationed on the wasteland. The wilderness of the wilderness can not be overwhelmed by the mighty Hutu warriors, and the extreme absurdity has been overcome by the powerful and efficient munitions system of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flat road across the wilderness, food, fresh water, and all supplies are constantly being shipped, so that the 50,000 Hutu warriors are always Maintain a high level of combat effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness is lonely, and this loneliness sometimes makes people crazy. But loneliness can not help but 50,000 Hutu warriors, the luckiest of them can be rotated back to the tribe after three months, reunion with their families. The person who has been stationed for the longest time only needs to stay here for two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge ring fortress built on the wasteland, but the defense of the fortress is inward rather than outward. This huge ring fortress stretches for dozens of kilometers, encircling a large wasteland behind a high wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge danger hidden under this wasteland. It is because of this danger that all life instinctively chooses to stay away from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial prime minister, Straw, and the great Druid Gulbanda standing next to him are very aware of this. But for them, only the unknown is dangerous. This known danger is not enough to scare them the strongest people standing at the top of the Terran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now standing on the highest tower of the ring fortress. Looking down at the huge crack in the center of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crack is completely dark, and all the light can't be put into it. From the perspective of Straw, occasionally you can see a group of fires suddenly spurted out of the darkness, and after a few rushes, they will return to silence again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gul Banda is extremely tall, taller than Straw, and looks like a violent bear. His hair brows and even the beard are strangely dark green. It looks quite strange. Only a large oak wand in his hand showed his identity as a caster. But his stout physique, when this oak staff was dancing by him. It will certainly become a weapon with weak power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stroud adults don't need to worry!" Gulbanda said: "Pang Pei has done a lot of hands and feet on the seal, but now the seal has been initially I stabilized. You don't have to worry about the seal before Mr. Vonsk arrives. Master Vonsk is a master of multi-faceted space, this time he will bring more than thirty high-level Druids. At that time, we can work together to completely reinforce the seal and complete the mission of the Great. At that time, we need to do it. Let Alexander and Pompeii sleep forever in the dark forest. Hey, the silver saints have become increasingly Weak, the whole church can't find a few decent snow and ice mage. They want to fight against the city of clouds in magic, it is a fantasy! If Rogge did not help them, we can already celebrate the victory." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Straw echoed a few words. He knew in his heart that although Gulbanda was very arrogant, what he said was not wrong. He is just an ordinary elder in the city of Yunxiao, but there are as many as 20 high-level Druids that he has commanded! Under so many Druids. The fragile seal is easily reinforced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straum is well aware that in this battle between sects, the number of high-ranking wizards and oracles is far greater than the abilities of the strongest sects. The level is much more important. In fact, because a large number of high-order Druids exist, even if the sky is full of magic, there is no magic, and the city of Yunxiao will still easily overwhelm the silver sacred religion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be seen from the seal of the abyss. None of the Druids led by Gulbanda can compete with the god of the gods. However, they are too many in number, and they can be fully restored in just a few weeks after the joint reinforcement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straw knows that at this time another big elder Osedas of the city of Yunxiao has entered the dark forest of the extreme east, ready to surprise Pompey and Alexander. In order to make this surprise enough, he will not lead the number of Druids less than Gulbanda. This is not a lot of Druid warriors who can be called jungle experts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Vonsk are coming to the wasteland with a few elders and a large number of Druids in order to permanently reinforce the seal of the Abyssal Gate. . After this. He will try to solve the space crack in the prime minister's abyss to the abyss of Batu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the sword of Damocles is the biggest secret of Straw. But since this sword fell into the abyss of Barto, Straw could not do it. The consequences of the Barto devil rushing out of the space crack are not something he can bear. Therefore, the Imperial Prime Minister had to ask for help again in the city of Yunxiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered more than a dozen young generals who worked under Frederick. These people are from the city of Yunxiao, all savvy and talented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the bottom of the abyss in front of him, Straw’s eyes twitched slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he really control such a strong ally? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door of the abyss suddenly lit up a little bright and fine! Then there was a burst of invisible and powerful magical waves, and even Straw, who was only a little magical, clearly sensed the power of magical fluctuations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness trembled quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strao and Gulbanda stared blankly at the bottomless crack in front of them, listening to the hoarseness that suddenly came from the door of the abyss. The cry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the bottom of the abyss suddenly illuminates the brilliance of the various colors, and the magic symbols rush from the depths of the ground, and then blow up in the air for a day. Fire tree rain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cry, a three-meter-long shadow suddenly slammed out of the door of the abyss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge beetle-like creature. It unfolded four transparent thin wings and hovered in the air. Six compound eyes with dim red light couldn't help but glance at the soldiers patrolling the fortress walls. Suddenly there are so many foods that make it fierce and difficult to make a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The seal has collapsed!" Gulbanda screamed: "Scroo, here is dangerous, fast withdrawal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refused to be ceremonial and grabbed Straw. Jumped directly from the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden horn sounds one after another, and a team of soldiers rushed out of the camp. Going to the designated location. In a small square in the fortress, Druid and the Master are gathering, and at this moment they are gathering faster than ever. These casters know the terrible nature of the abyss, and if they delay the fighter, everyone will die without a place to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stough is distinguished and not good at commanding the battle, so the war will come. Gulbanda must first send him to safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the seal not consolidated? Why is it suddenly collapsed!" Anxious Straw refused to take his own image and shouted. In this tumultuous and noisy moment, he only yells to ensure that Gulbanda can hear his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulbanda was gloomy and said: "They must have ambushed an entire Masters group behind the gates of the Abyss! When they are scheduled, these Masters It will summon the abyss creatures from the inside of the Abyss Gate and destroy the seal of the Abyss Gate! It's damn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Straw's face is gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the mages who perform this task. At this moment must have been buried in the belly of countless abyss creatures. From the beginning, it was destined to be a death mission, but Pompey and Alexander were able to find so many wizards who dared to die. Their skills were very different and their determination was very great. After all, at the expense of so many masters, any commander must consider it again and again. It seems that I really underestimated them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the direction of the fortress wall has begun to scream before the death of the sound warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50,000 Hutu warriors, together with the Drew Law Division, can match the fighting power of the Neptune Corps of the day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer will be revealed soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death at this moment is already true, and often does not see any traces of activity within a few thousand miles. Only the remnants of the huge magical array left by the windy moon, and the undead creatures that survived by the zero stars are wandering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the owner, no energy, no food, these dozen undead creatures will lose all consciousness in the near future. Turn into a dust of death world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death is very quiet. But this is just the silence before the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the maze of time and space, the magnificent temple of Elgara is like a canoe. Slowly float on the river of light and energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic that moves the entire temple into the maze of time and space is the most outstanding achievement of the Great Lich in the world of death. And if Elgra could only show it, it would be enough to be proud. In the memory of the fire of wisdom, in addition to the discovery of the maze of time and space, thus creating the magic of the Lich King, in the past lichs, including Elgar, there are only two lichs Show this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the time in the labyrinth does not really flow independently, and space cannot exist without eternal existence. Everything here is part of the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Lich Algra is showing the most proud magic in its millennium life. As long as this magic succeeds, its position in the history of death world will far exceed that of other lichs, and will be on the same level as the great king of the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, its soul is not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a burning flame in the hall. This flame seems to be weak, but it contains enough power to tear all time and space! When the flame stretches and shrinks, it occasionally soars, and the flaming tongue will smash up to the top of the temple of up to 100 meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the flame, Elgra couldn’t stop singing the spell that seemed to never end, the wand with the green flame in his hand, not in the air Draw a magic symbol. Once the magic symbol is formed, it will automatically enter the rising flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the flame, stood the silent black warrior emperor and bone emperor. They have a bunch of magic gear around them. It can be seen only from the flame of light emitted from the surface that these magical equipment are rare boutiques. They are all collections of the kings of all ages. However, at this moment, the Black Warrior Emperor and the Bone Emperor will pick up a magical device and put it into the flame. As soon as these pieces of equipment enter the gray flame, they immediately emit dazzling glare, which is then instantly broken down into pure magical energy. Added to the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the Great Hall is dull and depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings look into the flames of the eyes, there are very complicated things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oldest king is not seen in the hall. The fire of wisdom, the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the huge gray flame in the center of the main hall is the body of the fire of wisdom. It is that it has forever lost its consciousness and soul forever, its body, its accumulated energy for tens of thousands of years, and now it is transformed into the most pure death inflammation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the full magic of death inflammation. Both will be the driving force of Elgera's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Elgera’s magic is successful, then the entire hall will be separated from the maze of time and space, and freed from the bondage of the world of death, moving to another Space goes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings already know that the maze of time and space is not safe. Wella can find it here, so other powerful presences can also be found here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few days ago, the world of death is now the most powerful king, the windy month. I have completely got rid of the shackles of the world of death and traveled to another world of unknowns. This anomalous behavior of Fengyue immediately aroused the vigilance of the kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason, just that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Elgera has completed the most magical magic of his life, and the kings still have a coordinate to other spaces. Although the space is extremely dangerous, after all, the Ninth Cavaliers have entered the space, so that the kings know more or less about the world. At least the ninth Knight Heinrich has proved that the world can accommodate the kings who have the power of pure death. In some spatial planes, the kings only have to show up. It will be completely smashed by the energy that keeps the space running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However unfortunately. Elgar's magic is only done in theory. It is in theory that the enormous magic required for this magic has gone far beyond the power of the kings. Take the magic of the Lich Elgra now. Even if you add three times five times, it is impossible to promote this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic, in a sense, has gone far beyond the height that ordinary existence might touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already the magic of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space drift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of it is very simple, and it is not too complicated to display. The only thing that is different is that it needs too much magic, and that's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More complex magic, and harsh conditions can be achieved by a magical genius. Only the magical demand is real, can not meet the magic requirements, what kind of genius is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cast space to drift, the fire of wisdom resolutely transforms his body into an unconscious death inflammation. It has accumulated tens of thousands of years of power to release one by one, to restore the original form of death energy, and the surviving kings put all the magic equipment collected into the inflammation of the refining, in order to increase the space drift even if even It is a little bit of death energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the tens of thousands of years of the fire of wisdom can support the inexhaustible magical needs of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence in the hall. In silence, the kings silently imprint the traces of the fire of wisdom in the memory of their souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the eight kings of the death world, four have now disappeared from the river of destiny. The rest of the kings are also about to leave. If the space drifts, the three kings will be shredded in the storm between the planes. If the magic is successful, they will never return to the world of death forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no history book in the world of death, and all history exists in the memory of the soul. When the fire of wisdom exists, the history of the death world can be traced for tens of thousands of years; at the moment when it loses consciousness. The history of abandoned land can only be checked for more than two thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the entire history of the world of death will come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the empire's extreme east, the 100,000 army is far from the city of Yunxiao Only one day away. Alexander ordered a camp at dusk and is expected to storm tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a large army, in any case, can not get Druid's eyes and ears, because Alexander did not consider the sneak attack. He wants to eat the city of the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the wrath of the sky and his hands fled, the city of the Clouds was destroyed. It is also a heavy blow to Druid. At least they will be destroyed in the image of the upper class in the imperial people, and the prestige of the natural goddess will drop to freezing point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any religion that relies on the support of believers. The destruction of the omniscient image of the gods is undoubtedly a disaster that cannot be sustained at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these days, Rogge was very impressed with Alexander’s military approach. His use of the detective ride and the formation of the marching line alone allowed Rogge to try for a long time. According to Alexander's marching style, the Druids who ambushed in the dark forest behind him could hardly pass through the army and return to the city of Yunxiao. If you want to bypass the army, you can only go back to the city of Yunxiao, which means walking hundreds of miles. In this case. At most, only a few of the most powerful Druids are able to return to the city of the Clouds. This amount is insignificant in the face of more than 100,000 troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faintly felt that something will happen in the battle of tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fat man counts the magic scrolls to be spared tomorrow in the camp. Froya got in and got in. She was holding a small, delicate crystal bottle in her arms and a beautifully crafted belt in her mouth. This belt is gray and shining like a cloud of clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge recognizes this as a force belt for the Giant of the Clouds. This belt has no other attributes, but it will greatly increase the natural strength of the wearer. Of course, this one property is already very powerful. Although this belt is good. However, the use of Rogge is not great. At present, he is most in need of equipment capable of improving the magical instant and silent ability. However, this kind of magic equipment is extremely difficult to find, and it is impossible to buy it. To get them, the best way is to use other great magicians. Grab in the hands. The fat man suddenly missed the sequencer robes. If this battle is won, Straw, who has lost his allies, is hard to beat. Is it estimated that the imperial prime minister who knows the current affairs will sacrifice this robe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little demon mouth is loose, the belt falls in front of Rogge: "Dead fat, I can't find other belts, I have to be cheaper. I have this belt." It has been modified. Now you can insert eight small bottles of magic potion. Which! You choose from these potions. See what you need!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three vials in these potions A small amount of water that can restore the magic of the elf, Rogge took it without hesitation. Above the battlefield. The extra magic of this point may save one's life. Next he took two bottles of magic that could boost magic resistance for a short time and two bottles of potions that would give you a powerful stone effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he puzzledly picked up a crystal bottle, which was almost red in black and exudes strong magical fluctuations. This kind of fluctuation is very uncomfortable, but Rogge feels a little familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... um... it’s called the bad guy The blood is good!” Froya apparently just named the pharmacy. “This is not for drinking the ground. You have to use magic to spur it. You will be filled with black mist within ten meters. You are not only in the fog. Containing highly toxic, there will be a variety of cursing effects in turn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is interested, this is definitely a rare event in the group battle The weapon! He immediately inserted the crystal bottle into the belt carefully and asked: "What kind of material is this good thing made? Is there any?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't say it, do it with the blood of the big bad guy! To put it bluntly, it's your blood! A big bucket only made such a bottle, of course the effect is good!" The little fairy has a pair of green eyes snickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately remembered a barrel of blood that had been picked up by Serafi, and then looked at the bottle of medicine, and could not speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya ran out, and licked a gray rushing breastplate and threw it in front of Rogge: "I can't use this, Still give it to you! You are always rampaged, need it more than I do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looks at it, it is the silver dragon breastplate!< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say anything, he took Fu Luoya over, and put the silver dragon breastplate on her. He is endless, and Froya has no way to resist. Although she struggles and struggles, she can't stop Rogge from placing the silver dragon breastplate on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't!" She also tried to struggle: "Put it on, I can't make a lot of magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger brows and wrinkles, forcibly buckles the silver dragon breastplate, this is: "I don't need your magic, you can live for me! High-end magic scrolls will do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know how many scrolls you have in your hand? This time you are running out, do you still have money to buy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; Rogge took her out like a chicken, and said: "I am sitting in this position, it is not easy to get money? In short, if you dare not wear it tomorrow, you will give me Staying in the military camp, not allowed to go to the battlefield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin gave up the struggle, lazily leaned on Rogge, and smiled: "Why? I am so good? Want to seduce me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
