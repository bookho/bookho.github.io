			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus has a long sigh, raised his hand, hesitated for a moment, only to wave down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sacred knights rushed into the long street, four rides in a row, and the row lined up to Orfelux. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrodic shouted, and even the horses began to emerge with a golden flame! A glimpse of the golden flame has spread from his hand to the entire gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed again, this time it sounded like a thunder! The sacred knights in front of the horses were frightened. Before the knights controlled the war horses, the guns that burned the golden flames had already hit the air! The flame on the gun instantly melted the chest of the holy knight rushing to the front, without any hindrance through his body, leaving only a four-round black hole! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning guns draw a straight trajectory, cross the 100-meter long street, pass through the bodies of two bright masters again, and fly straight toward the stake. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three giants of the Last Judiciary have long been guarded by the stake. The burning guns were so fierce that Kara Yang was cut off in front of a sword, and the swords and guns touched each other. A blood spurted out of his mouth and people flew out. At the same time, Chrisma slammed at the end of the gun and spit out a blood. He took a few steps back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dess’s face was white, and the figure flashed. It was just in front of the burning gun, and the trenches shot and the gun tip of the gun was ordered. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a smog on the square, and Dess was forced to retreat by burning guns. His feet plowed two deep trenches on the ground. A few black smoke emerged from his gripped hands, his eyes almost protruded from the eyelids, but he died against the burning guns, and did not let go anyway! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning gun finally went to the end, but before the landing, the golden flame suddenly flourished, forming a small flame storm, from Dess Scrape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flame storm, Dess had no abnormalities on the surface, but people gradually became weak and slowly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound, the gun that lost the flame fell in front of him. At the moment of landing, the guns have been broken into dozens of paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offirock raised his hand and grabbed a golden rifle in his hand. He smashed into the ranks of the Holy Knights, and the gunshots were like a tree. Putting flowers, one by one holy knight or throat, or heart, marked a note of blood, no one can stop him for a moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of Light began to step up the spellcasting, and some rosewoods have begun to ignite. Rogge saw the anomaly, so many mage, why is it so laborious to order a few pieces of wood? But watching Ophrod's graceful look, he couldn't help but look forward to it, and he was embarrassed. He also said that he did not know whether he would like Orpheq to successfully save Elysses. Rogge painfully put his face in his hand. After a while, he looked up and looked out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc is already on the walk, and there are more than a dozen meters to kill Long Street. The horse had more than a dozen gun swords and fell behind him more than ten meters behind him. The blood was stained with a hundred meters long street, and dozens of holy knights were lying on the long street and slept forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame on the rosewood gradually became a piece. Rogge looked at Elysses, her figure has been somewhat distorted, but still can see that she is staring at the figure of Orpheco fighting, a look of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred knights who attacked at this moment all flashed a variety of magical lights, and they have begun to have a variety of auxiliary magic for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc is still moving forward step by step, neither fast nor slow, where the golden guns go, there is no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, he smiled and walked out of the long street! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cardinal and the pope whispered a few words, and gave orders to the Guangming Masters. For a time, countless cross swords, holy light bullets, sacred shocks The sky was flying to Orphey. After a while, dozens of various summoned beasts appeared again and rushed to Orphey Roque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long street mouth is like a flower bloom, the magical blasting flames are overflowing, and several small buildings at the street are destroyed by the power of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guangming Masters stunned and watched Orphey Roker slowly rise to the sky under the guise of the golden vindictive. Under his prestige, the summoned beasts who never knew fear began to cringe and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal was panicked and was preparing to direct the Guangming Masters to move another round of magical attacks, but it was blocked by Augustus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel reached out and the sword in the square automatically flew back into his hand. Then he sheds white light all over the body, and the light is as strong as the essence. He also slowly rose to the sky and greeted Orphey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, I haven't seen you for a long time." Orphee Rock converges on his body and greets Blood Angel Augustus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus looked at Orfey Rouge in a complicated mood and sighed. "I didn't expect to have such a day. I finally advised you, now look back." It’s still too late.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc looked at Elysses deeply and didn’t answer. The light of his whole body re-lighted and became more like a real thing. The light became brighter and brighter, and a pair of three-meter-long light wings stretched out behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc screamed, the light wing fanned, and a shot was stabbed to Augustus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light on Augustus also suddenly lit up, and the long sword flickered in the air, welcoming the gun of Orpheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dull roar in the air, and the space suddenly became slightly distorted, and the earth seemed to tremble slightly. Several sacred knights stood too close, and they suddenly fell down, and then a lot of blood spilled out of the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash of light flashed, Orpheco slanted from the air, dozens of holy knights immediately swarmed, knife and gun, they will be placed To die. Kara Yang once again came first, and set a first step in the place where Orpheek fell, ready to give him a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is in the air, he is naked, his armor is gone, a grayish long fluttering, silver eyes A little bit sad. However, what attracts everyone’s attention is a pair of white wings that are slowly fanning! Unlike the light wing of Orpheek, it is a real white wing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gusto adults! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angel! That is the angel of the coming! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy knights and the bright wizards in the square are arguing. Many young knights have already burst into tears, and they took off their helmets. Augustus in the air has been smashed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang looks at the Augustus in the air, but he knows that only the power reaches the seventh order. Angels have the ability to show the source of power in this space: angel wings! Augustus was only an eighth-order angel when he was born in this world. In just a few decades, he was in this world. There was a breakthrough?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t think too much, and Orpheco fell to the ground. Karajan’s sword was stabbed to his back. In the past! He was awkward and hateful to Orpheq. Although he came to this world, the two were the lowest-level angels of the ninth order, but the Big Three came directly after the church chose the body. What is Rock? It’s just a reincarnation angel! But now, his strength is actually It’s already completely over the Big Three! Is it really falling asleep?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cara Yang knows that in heaven, if an angel wants to increase his strength, he will enter the previous level. How difficult it is! This kind of hatred almost makes him unable to control himself, and the sword that has been pierced is actually a little shaken!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the sword has successfully broken into Orpheus K's golden armor, Cara Yang almost could not restrain his excitement, he spurred the whole body of the Holy Power, desperately sent from the tip of the sword into the body of Orfelux.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang Sheng Li as a huge wave into Orfirock's body, but it ran into a raging anger! The anger easily swallowed this little spray, and then swept the entire body of Kara Yang <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karang Yang only felt that the whole body became light and spurted out a blood. His gaze became blurred and he only saw a piece of white in Orpheus. The back of Rock's spread, the scope is getting bigger and bigger, and a few snowflakes like things fall in front of his eyes.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orpheco's eyes became blood red, and his figure suddenly disappeared. At the same moment, he appeared behind Augustus, a sword to the wings of blood angels! Augustus had a pair of wings, a long shout, and the figure suddenly blurred, and Orpheco's sword slanted him apart, but now he only got a phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space in the air battle is filled with the strange whistling sound of thunder, lightning, fire and space tearing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oficrock and Augustus are constantly fighting with each other in an instant movement. After more than ten teleports, the two finally have no energy. Then move in an instant, but their movement in this space is still the imagination of Rogge. He stared at the battlefield in the air, forcibly remembering their energy distribution, fighting style and power level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large piece of blood is falling from the sky in the middle of a feather that flies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is falling from the air! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc screams in the sky, he has a wing in his left hand, and his feet are still bloody. However, his appearance is different from before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stares at the ink-like wings behind Orphee! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an exclamation in the square! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that? Fallen Angel! My Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil! The Devil Already appeared!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is in a mess, there are escapes, there are overwhelmed, and there is vainly charging the angels in the air. Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses couldn’t help it, tears rolled down. After waiting for this for a long time, she finally waited for Orphey Rox's choice. Even if she could enjoy this happy moment, it was not long, but she finally waited for happiness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she has completely forgotten the pain in her body and forgot the flame that wiped her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is standing in the air with a sword. The wings behind him only left the left one, and the right back is a terrible, one-foot-long huge wound, and you can see a few clear bones in the wound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked sadly at the fallen angel in the air, the disciple who devoted his ten years of hard work and gave all hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is now irreparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod was not chasing the blood angel who was seriously injured, but turned and flew to Elysses in the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope on the high platform opened his sleepy eyes. At this moment, Rogge suddenly felt that he was looking at the high platform, and the fear of Haotian once again controlled Rogge's body! He fell to the sky and trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman suddenly had the courage to rush to hug her daughter and wanted to escape. When I first arrived at the stairs, I fell to the ground and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold little hand gently stroked Rogge’s forehead, and the coolness quickly calmed his fear. Rogge looked up and saw the pair of black and white eyes at first sight. The eyes were like a sinking pool, and almost the whole soul of Rogge was sucked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a quiet and graceful woman. Her satin-like shawl was hanging straight down, and Rogge almost saw his face from that long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently lifted the all-powerful Rogge and let him sit in front of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asked, the woman raised her index finger on her lips and pointed her finger at the window. Rogge looked around and went on. Looking back, I don’t even know when the woman went through the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My poor child, how can you let the devil blind your soul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Pope on the high platform seems to be muttering, but the strange thing is that everyone has heard this sentence, a word is louder than a word, and the last few words are actually a great sound. The square echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord creates everything, and the Lord masters the world. If the Lord says that he wants to stop, he will not move forward." There seems to be only the Pope's vast voice in the heavens and the earth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things in the world suddenly lost color, and everything is still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod is also set in the air, still maintaining a fluttering posture; Elysses' smile is also solidified on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Pope’s voice continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord has given you glory, but you have paid it to the devil. The Lord said, I will take it away from my glory."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has returned to color and everything is starting to work again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the golden glare of the flamingo on the Philippine body faded quickly, and he sank down and fluttered in a hurry, which was maintained in the air. Struggling to fly to Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a big prophecy!" Rogge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s hand is pointing to Orphey Roque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord creates everything, the Lord masters the world. Those who offend the majesty of the Lord will be forbidden! Set!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofirok’s wings suddenly feel as heavy as they can, and they can’t wave anymore. He struggled desperately, contending with the enormous magical powers, and countless tiny bloodshots spattered from his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abandoning the Lord's faith will be deprived of the Lord's gift!" The Pope once again volleyed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc screams, countless black feathers fall off his wings, in the blood of the sky, the black wings are a little bit The ground is peeled off! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope stretches forward and walks gently on the ground. The entire square is shaking with him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod’s wings were completely torn apart, and two purple-black blood were marked on the sky, and the brilliance in his eyes quickly dimmed... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames have already slammed into the body of Elysses, and her black robe turned into a fly ash in the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod’s eyes lit up with the last flame, and his body suddenly rose upwards, crossed an arc and plunged into the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers finally touched Elysses and hugged her tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames rise and engulf two entangled bodies...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Offi, you "I shouldn't be back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I don't come back, I will never see you again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ophelia, you finally chose me, I am so happy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are without you, I am getting the whole world, how Will be happy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is like a summer flower, just for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the flames of the sky, his heart was gray. He vaguely saw two tangled transparent figures jumping out of the fire and rushing to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke Red Archbishop is also in vain, he looks into the pope's eyes, all despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope sat down on the throne and smothered the sweat on his head, saying: It’s old, it’s really old. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame burned the whole afternoon, and it was finally extinguished at dusk. Hundreds of rosewoods were all burned, but there was no ash left. The fire column was also empty. No one. Several cardinals rushed into the fire, and after a rush of rumors, a bishop cheered, raised a figurine, rushed back to the high platform, and dedicated it to the pope.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A graceful woman on the statue was tied to a stone pillar, and a demon with a double wing was holding her from behind. Every detail on the statue is vivid, it seems that the woman and the devil will live the next moment. Even the happy expression of the woman, Rogge, was clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to deeply hurt his happiness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elysses, Elysses..." Rogge muttered the name that had changed his life. "Wait for me, I must I will come back to retrieve your statue. I will never let you fall into the hands of others......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal with the statue Charmingly to the Pope: "In the neon, this is the sixth 'Angel in Purgatory' statue! You only got four statues when you were in office for thirty years. This great feat is over the first fifty. The sum of the pope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope stunned his old eyes and was comfortably used by his flattering. Originally, this seat of flattering has always been the Archbishop of Burke, but he has suddenly become lost, this opportunity is the second overall order, the 71-year-old Buchanan Red Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope took the statue and gently stroked it. Seeing the demon with the twin wings, he suddenly sighed and asked, "How is the adult of Augustus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buchanan is busy Dao: "The adult is extremely hurt and he is still in a coma. The priest has already treated the priest for the Augustus. However, it seems that the situation is not very optimistic."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hesitating for a moment, Buchanan whispered again: "The Pope is going down, this, it seems that after Augustus's recovery, the ability will be greatly reduced. The leader of the Holy Knight is so important. The position must be a strong person to be able to serve. The subordinate believes that the head of the Divine Knights of the Austro-Hungarian Grand Diocese is more decisive and decisive. Although his personal combat strength is worse, he is a rare military genius who can be qualified for the church. The position of the head of the Holy Knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope suddenly had some enthusiasm, he waved his hand and tiredly narrowed his eyes. Buchanan saw the plane and had to announce the end of the ceremony and served the Pope back to the cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille City has returned to anger, and the flow of people began to flood the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stood up, he knew that it would take a long time, the news of his escape from prison will come out, the confusion in front of him is the best time to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and just about to go downstairs, seeing the mother and daughter fell to the ground, with a piece of blood under them. He gave a slight glimpse, although he also made up his mind to kill and kill, but still did not do it? He gently turned over the two bodies. The deadly wounds were all cuts in the throat. The wounds were extremely smooth and smooth, and the trachea was cut off just right, without spending more effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who did this do?" Rogge thought. He suddenly remembered the mysterious woman, and the cold hand that calmed his fears. Thinking of the hand and having stroked his forehead, Rogge couldn't help but sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own impression, I only remember the straight length of the satin-like mirror, and the pair of eyes that are as deep as the ink. How she looks, she can't remember it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge didn't have time to go deeper, hurriedly flipped out a set of clothes in the house, and picked up a few silver coins and went to the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this miracle, Lille City will be a night of sleepless nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogers smoothly mixed the city of Lille. At this time, the sky is already dark, and although the night is hot, there is already a hint of coolness in the early autumn. He looked back and the whole city of Lille was brilliant and radiant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was suddenly sour in his heart. The city has had its own years of hard work! The hammer of the god of war, the title of the nobility, a small fortune, the status of power, the captain of the Knights, and the countless great people who met, did they all go with the wind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed, and those who were ruined, except for the unknown Etter and Kate in the Lion’s Camp, Franco And Rens is more or less affected by his own. Forget it, don't want to do this. With their family background, you can eat up to a bit of trouble. Big things will not be there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge looked back at the city of Lille in the distance. This time it was extremely heavy and oppressive. It seemed that there was a huge stone stuck in his chest. Forget it, don't want to be so much, or just flee from this place and say it, life is important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is so big, the church’s tentacles will not stretch so far? Besides, where can I get rich by myself? He wants to laugh three times, but he has a sigh of relief in his chest, and he can't laugh anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge mouth, spit out a piece of black crystal. He gently stroked the crystal and muttered the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly laughed and swallowed the black crystal. Then I identified the direction, turned to the north, and hurried to the central mountain range that stretched for miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Andre stood leisurely in the middle of a magnificent hall, staring at the three people sitting in the hall. Sitting in the hall is the Marshal Rosherio who rushed back from the front line and David, the head of the famous Wolf Knights of World War I, and the other is Gonzalez, who looks like a rough man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Rochrio black face, force a shot of the coffee table, this antique that has been more than 500 years old, Huanglong’s birthday is now Broken into a few pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually let Froya let go? You actually let a big magician with two artifacts go away? You actually put that savvy The sinister famous goblin has let go? Do you think that hundreds of lives in the family have lived for too long!!??" When it comes to the back, the marshal who has always had a good demeanor has roared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre is still a disapproving look, faintly said: "Marshal, in your life, in addition to power, or power? You can Have you ever loved someone? Have you ever had it? So of course you feel that it is incredible to do this. But in me, once again, I will choose the same."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Marshal was in a hurry, he grabbed a teacup and threw it hard on Andre’s flawless face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre sneered at the teacup, not flashing or defending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David jumped up and copied the teacup in mid-air. This plan is for me to arrange my brother to do it. This is something I don't think about, you don't have to be so angry. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Marshal's anger is increasing, and said: "You can let her go, but at least leave those two artifacts!" There are two artifacts in their hands, how much blood we have to flow! ? Just for your ridiculous feelings? Also, in order to put on the insignificant civilian woman, even the last three jury groups have offended, which is why! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei's face is stubborn and replies: "How many people die, how much blood does it have to do with me?" Moreover, are these soldiers in the eyes of their fathers, isn’t that a bunch of numbers? When did you really care about their life and death? Can't you bear to kill it? As for the Big Three, it’s just three clowns. It’s great to offend the three clowns. Are you afraid of the church to retaliate, not to be. Although I have never been interested in politics, I know that your use value is much higher than the three clowns. For the sake of the church, even the genius of such a great world as Orpheq can be sacrificed. Will it care about the lives of the three clowns? Even if you are not a father, my own use value is not smaller than any of them? As long as I am willing to marry the pope's old things, my position in the church will not be worse than them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's relax! Gonzalez yelled. "My father had a hard life, not for the entire Roscio family? Have you contributed to the family since childhood? And what about the face here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big Brother, your talents are all known in the family." Don't need you to remind me of your family heirs. I am not interested in the status of power. This kind of cold, ice-cold, family that can calculate and trade, I have enough. "Andre is tit for tat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre’s arrogant attitude angered Gonzalez, who stared at Andre, Shen Sheng: "The more you come The more daring, do you think that the law in the family is just good-looking? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big Brother, the law only works for the people who respect it." Do you really think that I will bind? I will never be your opponent on the battlefield and in politics. But if you think that you have just entered the fourteenth level of vindictiveness and want to keep me, it is really naive! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei still has some respect for David, the brother, not a word, just a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, Andrea, he is still not very sensible, this also blames me as a brother who has not disciplined him. There is such a thing, the first few Tian Rogge escaped from the church, and the church was very angry. Even Karajan and Chrisma were convicted. I heard that the Pope personally ordered Kara Yang and Chris Mar to bring two hundred holy knights to hunt Rogge. If you don't complete the task, you are not allowed to go to the Muslim court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old marshal meditated and the church valued this Rogge very much. You have always recommended Rogge with me before, we must pay attention to it. It stands to reason that such a small person is not worth the church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gonzalez added: "The hunt for Rogge is the meaning of the blood angel Augustus. He insists very much and does not know what the reason is." By the way, I heard that Rogge fled north to the area of ​​the Central Mountain Range. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old marshal turned to ask David: "You suddenly said this, do you have any thoughts?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father, I think we should also send people to participate in this search. Rogge had been in contact with Elysses for so long, and maybe there was something in the church that was not worth the treasure or knew the secret. Whatever the reason, we should all participate and try our best to find the opportunity to be strong. What's more, his nine-level magician in a district can be mixed with the powers of the world. If it wasn't for Orpheq, he betrayed the church, he would have become a party. Just look at this, we have to fight for this person. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old marshal pondered for a moment and nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of person, you are Don't you be afraid to betray you after you mix up? Andre taunted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David said faintly: "What can his little conspiracy use in front of his father and big brother?" As long as his appetite is not too big, we can still feed him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to the old marshal: "Father, the younger brother has dealt with Rogge and knows him very well." The younger brother’s sword skills are also enough to subdue the sly guy. I suggest that this time the younger brother will be assigned ten family warriors to fight for Rogge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rossie thought and nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre blew a whistle I will just say it when I leave, I just don’t want to stay here anymore. Those warriors don’t have to, and many people are wrong! Dear father and brother, if you have nothing else, I am ready for this. It’s late. This dirty city full of conspiracy, I don’t want to stay too much for a moment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wait!” David came over. To Andre said: "I used to have a magic mark on Rogge, but I was afraid of him, so it was very weak. I have a special magic mirror that can receive the information of this person's magic mark. Give it to you. Also, I have a space wrist wheel, you bring it. The wrist wheel can give you an opportunity to move instantly every ten days, within five kilometers. Be careful all the way, Rogge It’s not a good person to deal with.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his voice again: “Now The church has decided to officially come forward, and your Juggernaut teacher is afraid that there will be no more time. You have been rampant but have nothing to do in the past few years. Is it really your own skill? People are nothing more than the teacher who is avoiding you and the background of our family. Remember. Be careful in all things in the future! Let you do this, and don't want you to meet Froya on the battlefield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Andrei suddenly felt a little moved, and David has always helped himself in the family, either explicitly or implicitly, but he has added countless troubles to him. The space wrist wheel is the best of the military! He actually gave it to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t express it, and he didn’t want to express his feelings in his heart. He just nodded and walked out of the hall with David. He didn’t say goodbye to the old marshal and big brother. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central mountain range stretches for thousands of miles and has always been a paradise for demons and adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days of galloping, the huge, blue mountain range has been swaying in front of Andre. The holy knights had entered the Central Mountain Range two days before him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
