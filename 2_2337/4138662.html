			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella jumped up and ate, saying, "Sorry, dirty your stuff, I didn't mean it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s smile and the spring breeze: “It’s okay, give it to you. For more than a month, if you don’t have it, Et. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surprise of the girl: Know Mr. Etter? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, not only know, we are the best friends." The fat man paused and looked at the courtyard. Every detail was never let go. Although the small courtyard was simple, it was elegantly laid out, and even the common objects such as Rogge felt a quiet body and mind. The voice said to the girl: "Can I see your grandfather? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was hesitant, whispered: "Grandpa... It’s getting angry now." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "It doesn't matter, I just want to meet him." It’s Ett, you still have to look at it first, get familiar with the environment, and work. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what about Grandpa? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, I will help you explain to him, rest assured, what medicine your grandfather needs, can be said by Et." Even if your money is good, you will get a bonus. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, those medicines are expensive! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, you have to do it well! "The fat man laughed at the wolf's tail and swayed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will definitely! The girl nodded hard and then walked away cheerfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge saw that the sun was already a bit westward, and the old man was still sitting in the house and angry. Then he laughed and kicked the door open and got into the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old-fashioned voice immediately rang: "Who are you!" Can't you even knock on the door? Come to be an aristocrat. The country courtyard of this little old man does not welcome you! You can't afford to get rid of your shoes! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's smiling face looked at the room. The room was very small, and a bed was added, a table, two chairs, and it was packed. There is another small door that looks like a kitchen. The fat man has pulled a chair and sat across the old man. He also took the teapot in front of the old man and poured himself a cup of tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s face turned from red to purple. If he didn’t see Rogge as a nobleman, he would have taken something out and fell out.<br /><br />&nbsp ;################################################################################################################# I only heard the same gasping sound as the old bellows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fog Master! The fat man sighed in the ear of the old man like a thunder, and he jumped up and the teapot was brought down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge Light With a bang, like an invisible hand in the air, the teapot turned over in the air and returned to the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is again Quiet for a moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you afraid of? "The fat man is somewhat ironic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sat down heavily, and it seemed to be a few years old. "Fog illusion, fog illusion for more than ten years." People mentioned this name. The master of the fog magic has already died. You aristocrats forced the fog to break the family, that is, he is still alive, and will never again contribute to the nobility. If you have nothing else, please come back. The old man is old, and there are not many days to live. In the end, I hope to be quiet. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is so wicked, all the roads are blocked first." Rogge thought indignantly, "I will not let you be happy!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man turned his eyes and took a small teapot and observed it. After a while, I shook my head, and it was like a fog. Looking at this teapot, I know that the life of the city has been more than ten years old, and the foggy eyes have long been coated with sewage sludge. It seems that I am white, but it is better to go to the Principality Painting Garden and find a few artistic authorities to help. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a slogan, Rogge does not believe. The crime of the European aristocracy can be big or small, and Rogge does not break this point. The fat man turned his eyes and looked at the sky. He didn’t understand anything when he snorted. He also knew that this art word was awesome and skillful. Art, everyone, not in the environment of quiet and beautiful creation, can you find inspiration in this place where the sewage is full of land and stinking? What are you carving? Aunt can't beat a child? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is shaking, one is asking for nature, and it is about the charm! Every time this knife goes down, don't follow the nature, fit the heavens, not much One point, a lot of one, just right. A knife is falling, its god is self-evident. Everything in the world is not natural. There is also a university in the sewage, and the children crying can also enlighten the spirit. You are the nobles who only know gold beads. I can understand?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German is interested, humbly said: "This has never been heard, but also ask."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is angry, only to train this kid to take it orally, let him know that the art word is broad and profound, and there is no other world, those art authorities who are famous for their reputation, but they are deceiving Rogge. A vulgar person. This time, the old man said that the old man could speak with his mouth and feet, pointing his fingers and feet, until the sky was dark, or he was still trying to do it. I didn’t know how to drink a few pots of tea in the middle of the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the opening of the courtyard came, followed by the sweet voice of Isabella: "Grandpa! I am back." , calm down. The old man is not finished, and Rogge is suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man stood up and said it again. He snorted again, whispered: "You told me for a long time, I don't know much. If you are really profound, how can you tell me? I know, but I can't teach, this master. The word is er, oh, oh." The old man was very angry, and he wanted to theory. Rogge went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the fat man appeared again in the foggy small courtyard, and was confronted with Isabella’s red eyes and walked out the door. Rogge immediately asked: "What happened? Is Etter bullying you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s tears almost fell again, gently said: "Grandpa said that he would not take medicine, saying that he would rather die than eat aristocratic things. He also smashed me. Hey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fat man is also furious, although he is going to work, this old East... Mr. I have to deal with it! "The girl went out and went out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time to deal with the fog, the nobles have spent a lot of effort. Franco has the highest artistic talent, but first Was smashed down. The reason is that his artistic taste is higher and higher than fog. The old man is eccentric, can he still put him in his eyes? As for Rens, Ete is firmly opposed, of course, the five big three thick Etter It is also inappropriate to come out. The old man saw the nobility seduce his granddaughter, and did not take him to eat? Only Kate and Rogge looked like a good person, and only Rogge was able to adapt to the situation, and the words were eloquent, and the letter was open and unconventional.<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to use rogue means to deal with weird old man, it should be the most correct way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like yesterday, Rogge kicked the door into the house. The old man was waiting for the big man. When he saw him, he was refreshed and he was going to talk about it. I didn’t expect Rogge to be the first to ask: "I originally respected you for a few years, I didn’t expect it. Still like a child's temper! Isabella doing hard work, making money to buy medicine, what is wrong? You are pouring the medicine, so good, how can you only make it to the little girl? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know what, I am rather not touching the dirty things of the nobles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rog snorted: "I have to ask, how is the aristocratic thing dirty and dirty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These nobles, none Good things, even you! I want to be in that year..." This cherished past, I can never turn off the gate again. One old and one young can't stop bickering, and in a blink of an eye, one day has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day after day, every morning, Rogge comes to report on time, and screams with the fog. The small courtyard was no longer quiet, and the two yelled and sometimes beat each other. Fog illusion has long forgotten why Rogge came to this quarrel every day, and later, the fat man left today, a little bit sad. I turned over and over in the night, just thinking about how to refute the boy's convictions tomorrow, and also calculated his own bad breath for many years. Rogge quarreled in the day and was not idle at night. Anyway, his mental strength is tyrannical, he only wants to meditate for a moment, and he is full of energy. It is so hard to study at night and night, from ancient times to the present, the Tiannan Haibei, the gods and the gods, the philosophers and the philanthropists, all in one, all read. I hope that the old man can understand as soon as possible. After more than a decade of unheard of the world, his fog is nothing but a frog at the bottom of the well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the people’s heart has been fixed, the foggy days on the opposite side of Rogge are not much better. The neighborhoods began to whisper, and later secretly pulled Isabella to ask her to persuade her grandfather. The girl is ashamed and anxious, but there is no way. After waiting, the neighbors heard the two quarrels during the day, and when Rogge left, they simply went to the theory of fog. The aunts and grandmothers have their own rules. They are quite unreasonable and unclear. They are much stronger than Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Master of the Fog is arguing with Rogge during the day and noisy with the neighborhood at night. The look of the granddaughter is also getting more and more dissatisfied, and the bowl of medicine is brewing day by day. For the granddaughter to go to work at the home of Aite every day, the fog can only be a few words of dissatisfaction, and has not dared to make irresponsible remarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate between the two is also the prevailing role of Rogge. First of all, in the point that "the nobility is not a good person", Rogge defeated the fog and lost. The fat man’s means of buying people’s hearts is increasingly ruined, and often at night he becomes a living example of the neighborhood’s refutation of the old fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next conclusion is naturally "Aristocrats have good or bad, is it much better or worse?" Rogge did not entangle with him too much, the topic turned When it comes to "the nobles are good or bad, the things of the nobles are not all dirty." That is, there is a foundation in front, and the fog is quickly defeated. Rogge did not let go, and then "regardless of the source of the matter, as long as it is hard work, just to come, it is good." This question has won for a while, since then the fog can only be honestly drinking medicine every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fog illusion sees his position increasingly loose, his heart stunned. However, Rogge never let go of the dog, and soon recognized the vow of "not for the nobility" vows. Effortlessly, Rogge let the fog realize his own partiality. The small size of the chest is too inconsistent with the name of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, the two of them sit in the small courtyard and sit on the chopping tea. It looks like a leisurely mood. I don’t know how many enemies are broken. The hard-working people of the military service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fog magic in the hands of the axe flying, such as a knife to cut the tofu like a neatly fine wood. Rogge did not show weakness. He was as strong as a cow. At this moment, he gave himself a "powerful bull". The ten fingers were like colorful flowers, tearing wooden piers like torn chickens, and emptying out a piece of firewood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are fighting at the most important point, that is, what exactly is this god, and whether it is worth the oath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge swears at the wood, and sees the fierce light. Doesn't there be God in this world, even if there is God's existence, then what? In fact, Rogge knows that there is a god, and those angels are not coming out of the air. The fat man continued: "Is there a lot of bad things on earth? Is it still less?" Since there is God, why does it matter? If it is said that it can not be managed, it also shows that its ability is limited, even if it is God, it is not omnipotent. At best, it is much stronger than you and me, but the essence is no different! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fog illusion does not agree: "The reason why God is called God is because he stands at the top of everything in the world, overlooking all beings." What God sees is not necessarily what we can see. What God knows, we may not be able to smell it. This earthly world is nothing but the work of the creation god. It took me a whole life to realize a little bit of God's rules. That is, the mysterious Oriental Big 6 is called the Tao. In the name of the highest existence, the vows have the highest effectiveness and are worthy of life to obey. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge secretly said that this is a god, Rodriguez brought to him a little poor knowledge about this description, just call it heaven and earth The root of all things is the source of the gods. So how can people understand this, it seems that this old guy is unclear during his lifetime. With the strength of old things, across the obstacles, to mystery It’s not impossible to turn around in the East. It’s just that he was too anxious. He killed the Temple of Odyssey early, but it led to the light of judgment. Think of Rodriguez, I don’t know how it has been this year. No, I can't feel his activity anymore, as if it disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man wants to think back, but his mouth is not idle: "Even if it is true It has the highest power, and it is because of our own limitations that we cannot see the world beyond God. Just like a bug that only touches and crawls, there is only the concept of length and width in its world. Let it understand what is high, is it difficult to be afraid? It seems that the ants will not understand your work. Let this old antique understand the world beyond God, hehe, hey! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand, can you understand?" "The old man is angry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am really embarrassed. These days, I seem to know more about the rules of operation in this world than you. Rogge speaks a lot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s head sweats and bites his teeth: “I swear in the name of the High God, let’s say it!” I thought to myself: “Make you a big ghost. The name of the High God shuts me down, and the wood is better than you. Lao Tzu has other methods! You have such a lot of old things! It’s just your old thing. It’s been a bit of a door for me to be stupid with me for half a month. Let’s walk!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Rogge saw the fog slashed countless times. The fat people use all kinds of detection methods in the past, see the old man has no grudge, and no magic, he puts his heart down. But at this moment, I saw the thin arm like a stick, waving a rust axe, and being weak, but it was easy to cut down a few pieces of firewood. The fat man felt that the big thing was not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge picked up a piece of wood, and looked thin, slowly and coldly sweating up and down, seeing that the fine wood is neither straight nor Well-proportioned, but the whole body wood texture, there is no half-break, it is natural. Rogge took a rust axe and hugged the wooden pier. It was also a light axe, but he heard it, and the wooden pier did not even have a mark. Rogge took a deep breath, more than a hand, a spell, and a few different halos flashed on his body, but he gave himself the "power of the cow", "the agility of the cat" plus an add-on. He once again transported the axe, still learning the fog, slowly falling, the rust axe into the wood, and surely did not go in one minute, the straight no wooden pier does not exist. It’s just that the fat man bites his teeth and the whole body is blue, and the axe flies across the sawdust. If the fog magic axe is a full smokeless fire, Rogge's move is to burn the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy to get a piece of firewood, Rogge is going to take it up and look at it, the finger touches it, but the fine wood is a bang, turned into a sky Sawdust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger wants to cry without tears. More than ten days of hard work, stuck in the last level, but was fooled from the beginning to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the fog did not expect that Rogge had a hand, called paranoia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge never waved an axe, but just holding a wooden pier in the yard, thinking about it and not listening to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark, and Isabella calls for Rogge, but the fat man is like a stone sculpture, and does not move. The girl was helpless and had to put the food next to Rogge. In a twinkling of an eye, it has frozen into a hail, and the soup bowl has cracked open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the snow of the goose fell from the sky, and Rogge, who sat still, became a snowman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Isabella exclaimed, took out a soft cloth, and carefully wiped out the snow from Rogge’s body, turned and left, a drop of crystal The tears have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family foggy tea, the girl came in and pleaded, the fog slowly said: "I also advised him not to return to him, he has entered a dead end Besides, these nobles, one of them died, is one." The girl angered: "Grandpa, you were deliberate from the beginning! Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Fog illusion did not speak again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the girl left, the fog whispered to himself, and the voice seemed to be old for decades: "Grandpa is not a god, how can I expect it?" This is the end of the hot man, I am afraid that I will be tired of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the night, Franco, Lens, Kate, Et, fee Si Si came to the small courtyard, and saw Rogge, who did not say anything at all, had no choice but to deal with it. The people did not say a word, but stared at the foggy eyes, and there was a more bitter sin. The old man was not afraid of it, but when Isabella came back and saw the eyes of the nobles aiming at her, the old man began to be scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark, the thunder of horseshoes sounds in the alley, the golden glory shines in the small courtyard, and Orpheq walks into this almost station Not a small courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fog illusion is amazing, never thought of an ordinary lower-level aristocrat, actually shocked the arrival of the only son of the Principality of the Principality. But this is the end of the matter, and everything can only be resigned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officrock frowned and sat quietly opposite Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sitting is one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Orphey Roger stood up and ordered to give Rogge a small shed, leaving two gold lion knights to guard the safety of Rogge. Then they left with the scum of the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella still works in the home of Ette every day, but sees Ete's face thinner, the beard grows longer, and only drinks every day. The girl sneaked in tears and never talked to the fog again after returning home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes the nobles I met that day will come over, and everyone in the room just silently drinking and drinking, and looking at the girl’s eyes made Essabella fearful. That night, the nobles clashed fiercely in the study room of Etter. The girl faintly felt that things were related to them, and they were about to eavesdrop, but they bumped into Ette and opened the door. Etter stunned, just waving the girl to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dull night. The thick lead clouds have already covered the moonlight in the sky. Ishabella saw that it was going to snow again, carrying a quilt out of the house and trying to cover Rogge. Just opened the door, a plastic wind almost frozen her. She was so easy to bite her teeth and step out of the house. Suddenly, her lips were big and the quilt fell to the ground, but she was scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog filled the small courtyard, and a silent walk out of the fog. This twilight is dark, and it would be impossible for a girl to see it if it wasn’t the purple light that swayed in the week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two golden lion knights in the hospital feel different, just about to turn back, then the whole body flashes, the two black shadows hit in the hand The back of the knight. The two knights snorted and fainted to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the flaming fireworks of the purple, the scenery in the small courtyard is like a human world, and that is the demon from the depths of hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella’s extreme fear, but it’s not moving at all. She only felt a flower in front of her eyes, and two golden lion knights had fallen. The next moment, a huge sickle appeared in the air, quietly resting on her snowy white neck, the blade body, almost all of her high. The knife was irritated, and a thin red line appeared on the girl's neck. A drop of blood slowly dripped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was so scared that she was already numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quilt that looked at the slide, the sickle disappeared quietly, and the next moment appeared in the hands of the cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;骷髅A hand in hand, Rogge’s tightly held wooden pier floated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the squat is full of bones, the whole body is full of electric light, and one hand will erect a huge sickle straight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instantaneous purple electricity illuminates the entire courtyard. The scythe never scored, and a knife shadow fell, and the wooden pier in the air was divided into two halves and rolled to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The break is curved and the wood grain is completely broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black mist rushed out, slammed into the fog. Before I left, I looked at the girl and the girl felt that she seemed to understand the meaning of the gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tonight, don't say go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Roger moved One move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, he smashed the dust off his body and gently picked up the wooden pier that was divided into two pieces on the ground and merged into one place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently patted the door, asked the fog to come out, and asked him to cut the firewood again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of a foggy phantom took a wooden pier, and the hand fell from the axe, and a fine wood fell on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Rogge’s spiritual world, a faint glow of green light flashed on the fog, covering the wooden pier, the axe and himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled softly and said softly: "The ones that exist are phantoms; the eternal ones will eventually be destroyed; all things in the world, colorful colors, are The blinded heart is gone. One day, the heavens and the earth, the mountains and the green waters, exist only in my heart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reaches for a finger, a wooden pier light Flirting in the air; the fingers are like a bullet, the wooden pier is like a spring flower, and each of the tiniest wood filaments is separated and dances in the air. Finally, the sleeves of the robes are smashed, and the sky is full of silk. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the master!" Rogge turned around and stunned the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
