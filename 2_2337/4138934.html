The overall composition and coloring of this painting is good." Rogge stood up and pretending to be an insider. He reached out and said, "But you see, this place is obviously different from your own, indicating that his level is average."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, in front of the fat man is a portrait of Fu Luoya. It can be seen that this painting has poured a lot of effort into Miro, and straightens the style of the little goblin into the bones. From this point of view, Miro is no worse than any master of painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger pointed out that Froya’s hips and long legs, but this little fairy saw, and even smiled: “I recently dressed More, he didn't look like me, and it was normal to draw it. When he saw it, he would naturally draw perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty knows himself It’s a layman, and I’m sure to say a joke just now, but Froya’s reply is more than a sentence that makes him fill it up. For a time, Rogge also did not understand, Fu Luoya intends to be interested in him, or really what kind of Miro is a bit interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has seen Miro, the boy is indeed taller and handsome than him, and the innate extravagance, beauty and coldness of his body. It's all he doesn't have. In terms of strength, the strength of Miro can be described as unfathomable. Although it is still unknown, it is certainly better than the fat man. Being pursued by such a person, it is a girl who will not be indifferent, even if they are not tempted, at least they will be happy. What's more, Fu Luoya is a little goblin, and his mind is as deep as the northern ice. It’s never been that Rogge can guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogers in this battle, he can use everything. The biggest advantage is that he first started to be strong, and he has already collected the little goblin. The next step is that his power in the empire is hot, and Miro, the unseen character, can be said to have nothing in the empire. Of course, with his strength. In the demon world where the strong is king, it is absolutely impossible to be in a position to do so. This is the fat man who has scruples. The reason for delaying to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro and his men’s hands appeared, and Rogge immediately discovered their identity as a demon, and Miro did not mean to cover up. Rogge is very strange, why the mainland's Mozu was revived after a long period of silence. For a long time in this, what have they done? However, at that time he was not divided with Miro's enemies, and the fat man was not willing to provoke the enemy of the Mozu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just fat people didn’t think of it. Miro was so entangled in Fu Luoya. He always intends to give Miro a lesson, but he is forced to bear it. After all, it is really inappropriate to erect a strong enemy at this time. Perhaps no one except the heavens is willing to be an enemy of the Mozu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the price of Miro is high enough, then the fat man will really change Froya out? Such a problem may only come to the right answer when it is really faced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Robsky asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the room, he handed a new seal to the Rogge. Dao: "The villain has seen the Minister of Security and conveyed your meaning to the truth. The Minister of Security said that you can rest assured that this little thing will be completely done according to your wishes. Now the wanted order has been printed and distributed. Just wait for the adult's instructions, you can pass this guy all over Richelieu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the wanted order and printed it It is the head of Miro. Looks alive, this guy who draws portraits is also a master. The key to the Tongluo Mi Luo is that the following crimes are all kinds of crimes, but it is mean, dirty, sloppy, and all kinds of things. It is really unsightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria also looked over and looked at it again. At first glance, he couldn’t stand it anymore and smirked. The vivid color of that moment almost made Robsky look at it. He immediately bowed his head and did not dare to take another look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little goblin is also dressed as a gentleman in front of people. She has a place where people hate it. Only the fat man has the deepest experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are here for a while." Rogge told Robsky and turned to appreciate the painting of Miro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge said: "Very good, Robsky, you run the garrison minister again and tell him that he can send the wanted order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robo Skies took the lead. The atmosphere in the room suddenly looked a little different. Androni and Froya looked at the side, and no one looked at each other, but they refused to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge saw the difference between the two women, but the fat man just smiled and thought about his own plot, he did not see anything. Anyway, there is any entanglement between Androni and Froya, and in the end it will only be cheaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing?" Froya smiled and broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s tone is also somewhat unnatural, replied: “I went to kill a city defense general son, and then threw the body in your crazy pursuit. "Miro's place to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it turned out to be a blame! But, is this useful?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I see the fat man's original intention, just tell Miro, we can completely grasp his whereabouts, so that he should not be too mad." Androni said. Just in front of Rogge, her words are full of disrespect, and she will never leave any face for this fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria frowned slightly. Unlike Androni, she has a political sense of temperament in addition to her magical talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about it at the beginning and immediately dropped Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat man, Miro is good, and the power behind him is also very big. At least for now, we are still very likely to win him and become us. The helper. Do you not give a potential friend out of the door?" Fu Luoya asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not." Rogge smiled. "Make sure you all see it. Miro is a demon. The devil is a very strange race." Every time I meet strangers, they are used to getting up and kicking. If you don’t slap in the same fierce way, they won’t be friends with you. This is the Mozu. A race that respects only the strength and the strong. Of course, in other words, it is also a somewhat awkward race."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Andreoni left, Rogge also Go to your own meditation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is increasingly feeling the importance of his strength. After all, there are many things that cannot be faked by others. When his sight fell on the kingdom of God, he immediately discovered the weak nature of worldly rights. of course. In some cases, secular rights are still essential, but what really matters is strength. Although there are a lot of strong people gathered around the fat man at the moment, these strong people can not follow him for a lifetime. Once they are relaxed, they may be assassinated by powerful enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this woman, there must be life to enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. The fat man is now ambitious, far from the so-called achievements of the Millennium hegemony. He has already defeated a god, is fighting with the same god, is still playing another god's idea, and his ultimate enemy is the supreme god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in all things related to God, the most fat role is to help from the side, a little insignificant role. But this does not prevent the fat man from convinced that one day he will become the protagonist of the stage. Although the day will come, even the fat man does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halfway, Robsky ran in a hurry and stopped Rogge. Road: "Roger, the general order has been done. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say!" Rogge frowned. Robsky is knowledgeable and has real skills. He is good at everything, that is, he is more courageous, and sometimes he is more worried about excessive, and he seems to be a mother-in-law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Serena is coming again. She has been waiting for you for a few hours. The villain has told her that you are not in the house many times, but she Stick to waiting for you to come back. Look..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s brow wrinkled deeper, he slowly squatted in the place for a few laps, some hesitant . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only Rogge who considers that there are more than a hundred thousand soldiers of the Hutu behind Straw, and the huge network of people and potentials that Straw himself has cultivated in politics for many years. He believes that things are not without turning. Therefore, although the fat man has always been on the surface with Straw, he secretly helped him to remedy the political crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although the voice of the Emperor in the request for the disposal of Straw is not strong, the attitude of the Emperor is very interesting. Just a few days ago, the boss managed to invite Rogge into the Imperial Palace and concealed him not to go too close to Straw to avoid getting burned. The great aristocrats of the Imperial Capital have always been keen on the political sense. In the past few days, all the officials associated with Straw have made a clear relationship with him and cut off the exchanges to show their position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Straw still occupies the phase at the moment, this situation makes the fat man believe that this empire’s dictatorship for decades, I am afraid that the fate of the downfall is already impossible. Avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is a bit strange in the dark, just releasing two Bata devils, causing confusion to the emperor, so the reason is not enough to make the emperor give up such a heavy minister. After all, Straw's ability in the internal military needs and military training is unparalleled. As long as he is there, the combat power of the Imperial Army can be improved a lot. Compared with these talents, the imperial death of thousands of people in the district is simply a trivial matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it seems that Straw must have other things stalking Rogge, and it is precisely these things that exceed the limits of the great patience of the Great, so the Emperor is so obvious Set out to deal with Straw. Today's imperial prime minister has gone. If he does not resist, the great emperor and other political enemies must at least give him a charge that will make him lose his authority and exile in the frontier; if he leads the Hutu warrior to rebel, how many people will be willing to follow him, from this alone In terms of a crime, it is enough to spread the whole family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Emperor is going to do it, it’s no longer a crime that Straw has committed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, talking with the boss, Rogge immediately cut off all dealings with Straw. Only he decided to suffer from Serena. The little girl ran every day, and then she was told that Rogge was doing business outside and didn’t return home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She always waits for the sunset from sunrise and then goes back down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, for the little man, bluntly, everything that is related to Straw now, it is all overwhelmed. What about his daughter?" Robsky shook his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded in a blank expression. The stakes in this are naturally clear. It’s just that he didn’t understand, and what Straw had angered the Emperor. It was the anger of the great emperor who had always played a balance between the two factions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge stopped and said to Robsky: "You go to Serena and say, I have always been there, just don't want to see She. Let her not have to come again in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The adults acted decisively, really wise." Robsky immediately retreated after a round of ass. He knew that Rogge had a bad mood. At this time, it is not a big shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands in the courtyard, looking up at the rolling clouds in the sky, and thinks that the emperor is a political place for change, and suddenly a heart is born. The meaning of exhaustion, I do not know what it is for the struggle for power in the camp this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sound of the wheel fainted at the gate, and gradually went away. Among the carriages, presumably the young and true girl has been heartbroken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She already knew that she could not escape the torrent of politics. Therefore, I only want to find a better home for myself in this torrent. However, the final outcome was that she was still swept away by the ruthless flood. After thousands of years, maybe Straw may still occupy an inconspicuous corner in the history books, and who is a weak girl like Serena who will remember and care about her destiny? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious bells of the afternoon floated to all corners of the Imperial City. Remind people that the New Year’s carnival has not yet passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new year has begun. It’s just that such a New Year’s reign is a thousand years of prosperity, or is it a bloody city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything in the world, chaos, every new year, there will be people happy, some people are sad. For those who are sad, it is not important to have a mess, because it makes them sad. It is already the whole of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro looked at the hand-to-hand command, and the face was getting more and more angry. He finally got his hands wrong, and he made this wanted order into a fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge! I want to kill you!" Miro gnashed her teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miro, anger does not help to make a wise decision. Your decision was even more ridiculous." Nod Hart said, he said The sound did not fall, the sound suddenly slammed, and then coughed fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But a little injury, why haven't you recovered yet?" Miro frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sword he used is too powerful. But I don’t care if I don’t worry about it. Just a little longer, these curses will I disappeared." Nord Hart said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the door to Miro’s residence was suddenly kicked open, and then the man was thrown into a body. Noorhardt was immediately chased out, and Miro stayed behind. At the moment when the door broke, they all felt that the intruders were good, but they were not enough. So it was enough to have Noord Hart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nod Hart was chasing a lane, there was a fine sword shining in five colors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of battle between life and death is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nordhardt sent the other party a grumpy impact, and he was stabbed two swords. The terrible killer didn't want to fight, quickly retreated, and Nordhardt did not dare to pursue. It’s just that the two swords have only scratched a bit, but it’s definitely not good. The strength of the samurai's own anti-drug and anti-curse is not weak, but the curse on the killer's fine sword still makes him sad. Until the migration of the hiding place, the samurai still failed to drive away all the negative effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro certainly has this ability to help him, but Nordhart knows that the relationship between the two is not bad, as long as he is not in danger, then Miro is absolutely not It will be helpful, and it is useless to ask him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After moving to a new hiding place, they were affixed with two wanted orders outside their home. At the sight of Nod Hart, he immediately sneaked a piece and gave it to Miro. He really ruined Miro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Miro has been ruined by an overnight order, but the piece of it is woven on his image, and the viciousness has been extremely guilty in his heart. Almost all of his years of elegance and ruin are ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's **, swindling and killing stray boys more! What is this, Rogge, you give me waiting!" Miro hates. He could hardly imagine what it would be if Froya saw this wanted order. Even if she doesn't believe it, then she will laugh a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miro adults, this is not the devil world, others don't have to act according to your mood, so please calm down." Nordhart reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro was shocked and finally calmed down and said faintly: "I understand, in fact, he wants to demonstrate to me. It is with the body to blame us. Tell me that he can find our whereabouts. The wanted order is to show us his power here. Very good! I have to see how he plans to fight with me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just another thing, both of them intentionally ignored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of Richelieu, a woman in black is standing in front of a wanted order, quietly watching the wanted order of Miro The appearance and the various crimes under Luo Zhi. She was wrapped in a dark black traveler's robes all over her body, and even her face was hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just the faint ripples under the black robe are enough to make people feel excited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost dark at the moment, and the streets are crowded. The wanted plaque in front of the woman was in a big bulletin board, with a guardian guardian guarding each other on both sides. At the time when the cold wind began, only she was watching this wanted order alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She soon finished watching the wanted order, silently, suddenly laughing. As she moves, the veil also floats gently. The lower jaw, which is hidden under the veil, is the tenderness and whiteness that is deplorable, and the lines are faintly stunned by the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
