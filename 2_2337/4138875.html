			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the nine chapters under the circumstance<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick lead clouds gather in the Moonlight Dragon Over the city, the lower and lower, there will be a thin lightning bolt connecting the clouds to the spire of the Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in Moonlight Dragon City is as suppressed as the sky outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All adult warriors are gathered in the Chamber of Cranio at the moment. They are ready for everything before the war, and are now praying to the Dragon God with Cranio, even though their prayers will not receive any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio is very heavy. The battle between Yinlong and Don Kebala is destined to win. No matter how powerful the tyrant of the flame is, it is impossible to compete with the ten silver dragon warriors. However, this battle is bound to have the return of the Silver Dragon to the Dragon God, and more than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze passed by the soldiers in front of him, and sighed again and again. For her, the war dead are more than just two or three abstract figures, but a living life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are her uncles and elders, as well as brothers and sisters who grew up with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the flame tyrant who believes in the dark gods and the light and holy moonlight dragon city are not only peaceful, but also have some mutual help and symbiosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cemetery of the dragon is on the edge of the abyss gap. If you want to enter the cemetery, you must cross the territory of Don Kakkara. In addition to the higher dragons such as the Silver Dragon, the Flame Tyrant generally does not allow any creature to enter his territory at will, whether from the sky or the ground. Even the dying dragon will choose to enter the dragon's cemetery from the edge of the flame tyrant's territory. Will not approach the abyss gap. To a certain extent, it can be considered that the flame tyrant has been guarding the tranquility of the dragon's tomb for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the existence of Moonlight Dragon City, will be a considerable part of the powerful creatures that threaten the flame tyrant to block outside the dark forest. The proud silver dragon can ignore the weak creatures that cross their territory, but never allow any powerful creature to enter the control of Moonlight Dragon City without authorization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subtle symbiotic relationship is broken with the altar of Donk Bakala. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the battle with the flame tyrant, the silver dragon had less than one day to rest. The Frostman Giants will march into the Moonlight Dragon City after destroying the Golem Legion. Just do not know the remaining water in the Longchi, but also enough to treat a seriously injured Silver Dragon Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkened chamber suddenly became bright. The faint sacred breath is quietly dispersed. In the gaze of the silver dragons, a huge faucet was explored from the void. Its savvy, huge dragon eye presents a strange dark black with a strip of gold stripes on it, and it doesn't reveal where its pupils are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it only explores half of the body from the void, the breath, the majesty, the unique noble form, has clearly shown that this is A sacred dragon that rarely appears in the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Dragon stands proudly in the center of the Chamber of Deputies, looking around for a week. Only slowly said: "The noble silver dragons who are in the upper ranks of the dragons, I am Glorious Gregory, who is your king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong They look at each other. The power they felt from the sacred dragon in front of them was surprisingly weak, even worse than the weakest silver dragon warrior. If you barely make a comparison, this legendary sacred dragon may not even have a low-level green dragon. However, its mysterious way of appearance also represents a deep understanding of space and strength, which is beyond the scope of any silver dragon in the Chamber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio moves forward, saying: "The sacred dragon above the dragons. I am the current king of the Silver Dragon. Can tell me your Do you want to offend? But Moonlight Dragon City is in a special period, I have to be cautious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As you can see, I am just A very ordinary sacred dragon. When I was flying on the edge of the dragon god, I heard your prayers. So, I am here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a stir in Cranho’s heart. Her voice is therefore trembling slightly: "So, the Dragon God has heard our prayers, ready to forgive us generously?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio was in a tight heart and immediately asked: "What are the black dragons praying? Are they preparing to attack the Moonlight Dragon City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, young Silver Dragon King. Although I can hear their prayers, I can't reveal the content to you. If I do this, it is invading the exclusive area of ​​the Dragon God."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio was disappointed. She knows that the sacred dragon is not bad. But she still asked with half hope: "So, is the dragon god sent you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory shook his head and said: Unfortunately, as I just said, Dragon God has no response to your pious prayers. This time I came to Moonlight Dragon City is my own decision. I don't want to see the elegant and noble Silver Dragon fall into the dark. The abyss, do not want to see the beautiful Moonlight Dragon City deserted in the sand. So I came, I want to provide you with a little help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..." Cranio hesitated, not knowing what to say. Just two older Silver Dragon wise men have told her through spiritual fluctuations that the power of the sacred dragon in front of us is indeed insignificant. Even if it is added, it will not help the situation of Moonlight Dragon City. But Cranio knows that if you tell the truth, it would be too rude. Regardless of the strength, this sacred dragon has a much higher rank in the dragon than the silver dragon. At least it is the sacred dragon that serves the dragon god. To some extent, it can be said that it is the messenger of the dragon god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to flying in the glory of the Dragon God, Gregory apparently did not lie. Otherwise how can it be heard that the silver dragons are praying and know the crisis of Moonlight Dragon City? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory suddenly smiled. It is gentle and authentic: "I understand that you are questioning my strength. By the standard of the dragon, I really have no fighting power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio and two The silver dragon elder was shocked, and then it was a shyness, admiring for a while. They did not expect that the exchanges with spiritual fluctuations would be heard by this sacred dragon. A few silver dragons could not help but put away the faint contempt, and from this moment they really became humility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do they know that Gregory’s power is not good, but it has been since this time. The uneasy heart made it all the time to intercept the spiritual communication between the two masters. Although it has never been successful, Yinlong’s superficial mental communication skills are far worse than its two masters.瞒瞒 Other silver dragon warriors are still okay, how can it escape the spiritual detection of Gregory everywhere? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory will take the reaction of the Silver Dragons to the bottom of his eyes, and it continues: "I don't have any strength, nor can I get other sacred dragons." But fortunately, I got the promise of two very strong existences, they are willing to help Moonlight Dragon City to survive the immediate crisis. However, there is a price to pay attention to. In the middle of the sacrifice of the individual and the fate of the whole family How to choose. It is your own decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Gregory’s words, two blurred images appeared in the air, and then became clear It is the gentle moon of Wella and the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio was suddenly taken aback, she quickly increased her strength, slowly flew up, staring at the wind and trembling and said: "You... you are the dragon god Prophecy in the Devil! You killed Nicholas!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Dragon Warriors immediately moved and they took off. Can not help improve the power. For a time, the raging Dragon Power made the entire Chamber of the Chambers shudder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes on the mask of the windy moon opened slightly, and the silvery eyes looked at Cranio quietly. The young Silver Dragon King suddenly felt a chill in the bottom of her heart, and her whole body suddenly disappeared without a trace! With a bang, she fell to the ground again, no matter how she struggled. Can't fly to the sky anymore! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the Silver Dragon Warrior who entered the battle stance more than ten, Gregory stood without a word, and did not treat them as one thing, but it The tail tip that kept vibrating quietly revealed the coziness in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fingertips of Wella’s tail flashed a little faint light, and a small stone that was shaken in the air suddenly accelerated, hitting heavily in Gregory. On the tip of the tail! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain caused Gregory to immediately recall the fear of the two masters, which is far stronger than the embarrassment of the powerful silver dragons. It immediately calmly and calmly said: "Young Silver Dragon King, you are very rude now, and your reasons are very ridiculous. If you can correctly interpret the dragon god, the Moonlight Dragon City will be as dull as before. ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coexistence of demons and angels is indeed confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are all equally powerful and equally beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory sighed heavily and said: "The destruction of Nicholas is a sin. In addition to your perception, Nicholas has committed many unforgivable Not only that, but he also pushed the entire Moonlight Dragon City to the brink of destruction! Otherwise, why are the most powerful enemies around you gathering under the Moonlight Dragon City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is impossible! Nicholas, though... although...but I believe that any silver dragon will not do anything that would harm the whole family!" Kraño retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other silver dragons remembered the weird behavior of Nicholas destroying the altar of Donkabakara. If he was not trying to blame the moonlight dragon city, then it was It is impossible to explain. Did Nicholas really fall into the sea of ​​hatred, and want to retaliate against the Moonlight Dragon City that drove him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that true?" Gregory still gently asked: "So, the young Silver Dragon King, who cares about the wrath of the Dragon God, insists on helping Nicholas, which makes the Moonlight Dragon City so bleak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio was dumb on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of stepping out of the Temple of Dragons, she did consider love as above all else, including, of course, her people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory continues to pursue: "Young Silver Dragon King. Obviously you have rejected our help. Before leaving, I am willing to help you again." The Golem Corps has already withdrawn from the path of the Frost Giants. One day, the giants will come under the Moonlight Dragon City. At that time, you may have to face the Donk Bakala and the Frostman Giant Warrior at the same time. Attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute!" Cranio stared at the glory of the wind, full of anger, but she reluctantly suppressed her feelings, saying: "Gregory adults. If I ask for your help, what is the cost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory, who wanted to leave, turned around. Road: "Two great gods... No... they... need a servant. If two young silver dragon warriors are willing to give up the freedom of this life, sign the soul contract and become a servant... No, it is a servant. Then they will solve the crisis for Moonlight Dragon City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon is another argument, they are very aware of the gains and losses in this. If there is no help, at least half of the Silver Dragon Warriors will be attributed to the Dragon Tomb after the War. What then will they take against the Black Dragon's offense? If you get help. Judging from the power of their power, they have been able to compete with many powerful enemies, and at most they can only gain the tragic resort. Moonlight Dragon City will have an overwhelming advantage in one fell swoop, and the outcome of the war will be completely different. After the war, there may be at most two silver dragons killed, plus two silver dragons who become servants. There will be several adult warriors in the Moonlight Dragon City, at least some hopes of resisting the Black Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only signing a soul contract means forever losing dignity and freedom. This is for the proud silver dragon. More difficult to accept than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The character of the more violent swell suddenly jumped forward, Shen Sheng: "I am willing to sign a contract!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other small silver dragon warrior immediately said: "No! Ston, you are now the most powerful warrior in Dragon City, the soul contract is still let me!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina whispered a spiritual wave to the windy month: "I saw no, he is not as useless as you said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she appeared in front of Rogge in the image of Serrafi, she had questioned the feasibility of this plan. In her opinion. Yinlong's personality is arrogant, tenacious and unyielding. Even in the face of a strong enemy that cannot resist, it will die and not surrender. But once I can eliminate many of the powerful creatures that can't be a man, Wella thinks this ending is justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Rogge smiled and said: "The silver dragons are noble and holy wisdom creatures. There is no such thing as surrender in the soul. I also believe that in the Moonlight Dragon City. Yinlong Ning can choose to fight all the deaths, and it is impossible to accept our help at the cost of becoming a servant. But the same thing, from another perspective, the result will be completely different. Don't forget that the most noble of these holy souls One of the qualities is called sacrifice. If a few silver dragons can exchange their own sacrifices for the whole family to survive, then they will not hesitate to choose to sacrifice their own land. As for us to get a few silver dragons from it. The enemy of Moonlight Dragon City is strong. The more desperate the situation, the more sacred and noble the sacrifice will be! Of course, the enemy can't be too strong, because we must convince them that your strength is enough to help Moonlight Dragon City out. Desperate. So you must find a way to let the goddess O'Reilly show the miracle, this will be the most crucial help. And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a very disrespectful act to suspect that the servant is! It seems that you should be punished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Everything is as expected by Rogge. In the face of desperation, the soldiers in the Moonlight Dragon City are willing to sacrifice their dignity and freedom in exchange for the peace of the whole family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the clouds above the Moonlight Dragon City suddenly stained with a layer of bright red, and the lead clouds in the sky turned into a burning cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning glow also reflects the room of the Dragon City, and the faint red moment becomes the main color of the Grand Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange faint snoring in the chamber of the room. Under the attention of many silver dragon warriors, Wella’s image suddenly became a bit fuzzy. It seems that every line in her body is no longer clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every adult silver dragon has the power to overwhelm the first human being into the sanctuary. At this moment, several powerful silver dragon fighters have seen that it is not The faint red blurs the image of Wella, but at every moment, Wella will change its position a few times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint red in the hall crossed Weina, leaving no shadow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Chamber of Deputies, there was only a heavy nasal noise of the Silver Dragon Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t understand what Wella is doing, but they all know what it means in battle! Silver Dragon Warriors simply can't lock Wella's position! In the ever-changing battle, if you can only rely on your eyes to capture the position of Wella, the only result is to bear the attack of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon in the demon lotus clenched, and with her sharp increase in power, countless tiny purple electric lights appeared in her boxing week. The improvement of the strength of the wind and the moon seems to be endless. In the twinkling of an eye, the power that condenses in her right fist is far beyond the full power of ordinary silver dragon warriors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy month just stood quietly, she did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement is the space around her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the wind and moon on the right fist is too strong, so that the space around the body is completely distorted, forming a strange mask, covering her whole body inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint red flows through the hood as it flows, and re-assembles in the wind and moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud glow in the sky slowly restored the lead color, and the moonlight dragon city's chamber returned to darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is gone." If the wind and moon have no spiritual fluctuations, only Wella can perceive it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly said: "Well. It’s not so easy to lock my position. If he doesn’t have any skills in the outer plane, it’s the first. If you lock the position, he will feel good. Anyway, there is not much space around the Moonlight Dragon City. I will fight with him to understand the time and space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue suddenly said: "He appeared in the north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is in a very special state, I can't determine his position. He... What do you want to do?” Weina frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north of Moonlight Dragon City, dozens of Frost Giants are marching at a thunderous pace. Looking out from their position, you can only see the rocky mountains that are almost exactly the same. Moonlight Dragon City has not yet risen from the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless clean little sandstones on the wilderness that suddenly reflect very light red. It is impossible to discover these changes without careful observation. The screaming giants are burning with endless fighting and anger, and of course it is even less likely to find these slight anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the giant knows that he is not far from Moonlight Dragon City, so every step is more powerful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he didn’t know that this huge team that was enough to counter the entire Moonlight Dragon City had actually begun to take a huge circle on the wilderness, and it would not last long. They will fold north and set foot on the way back to their hometown. When they are not expected to appear in the vast expanse of the wilderness, the moonlight dragon city will not appear, it will be a day after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
