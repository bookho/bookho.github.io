			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Heaven in Heaven, Chapter 10 Life is like a play<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon King mourns another A dragon language magic, bursts of silver smoke from the body constantly rushing out, large and small wounds are constantly squirming, blood has stopped flowing, it seems that the injury is rapidly recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the magic, the damage of the Silver Dragon King does not seem to get worse, or just started to recover. But after this breathing time, Wella seems to have completely restored the power of the early battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Dragon King suddenly stopped treating himself and instead launched another dragon language magic. The already bright ‘wind anger rift’ was once again dimmed. This time, the thick clouds appearing out of the sky covered the sun that had already slanted west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly had a small cockroach and his hair was erected. He knows that this is due to the resonance of the overwhelming magic in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Dragon King, did you find that it is not feasible to engage in a war of attrition with me? Now I want to die, it is already late!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Dragon King just concentrates on the dragon language magic. This time its opponent is regaining power, so there is no magic to bother it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon language magic is almost finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon king's wings are unfolding, a huge mouth, and spit on something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at it, in the horrible mouth, there was no silver star flame at all. Could it be said that the Silver Dragon King has been preparing for so long, just to breathe a sigh of relief? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding to the action of the Silver Dragon King spit, a group of condensed dragon flames appeared out of thin air. Only the position where the dragon flame appeared, just right on the demon lotus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of dragon flames is obviously different from the beginning of the dragon flame. At the high temperature of Yinlongyan, the leaves of the demon lotus roots are softened and melted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light on the demon lotus is bright and dim, but she has just left a group of dragon flames, and the new dragon flame is generated endlessly, attached to the demon It started to burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly turned to look at the Silver Dragon King who was still in a spouting position, sneer, and gradually disappeared into the void. Only in the original place left a large piece of dragon flame that is still burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, she has appeared above the silver dragon king. The Silver Dragon King seems to feel something. The huge body suddenly sank down, but still kept in a spouting position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a large piece of dragon flame quietly appearing around the demon lotus that appeared in the sky. Under the burning of the fierce dragon flame, the leaves of the demon lotus stretched out have completely melted, and the black wings behind it have melted into a group of scrap iron! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina rushed to the Silver Dragon King as electricity! She panned lightly and landed on the back of the Silver Dragon King, then inserted her left hand, and even half of her arm did not enter the body of the Silver Dragon King! At her fingertips. A small group of gravitational balls containing hundreds of crazy gravitational pulls have been bounced into the body of the Silver Dragon King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flew up quickly, and in her original place, she suddenly burst into a tall fountain! It is only the fountain and the flower that contains the blood and flesh of the Silver Dragon King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unbearable pain caused the Silver Dragon King to twitch and his body suddenly fell nearly 100 meters. It flapped its wings quickly, and it stopped the fall of the body. It takes a deep breath and squirts the dragon flame again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon lotus with the silver dragon flame like the bones of the bones, once again passed behind the silver dragon king. This time the place where the fountain rises is a hind paw of the Silver Dragon King. This fountain is much larger than the previous one, and a hind paw of the Silver Dragon King has been cut almost entirely from the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both sides have found each other's weaknesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon power of the demon is unquestionable, but in the ridiculous, cold world of death, Feng Yue did not consider the issue of defensive flames when he built it. Under the amazing high temperature of Yinlongwang, the silver dragon flame ejected by the life energy, the demon lotus was melted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, with the injury of the Silver Dragon King, even if the duel ended, its life, in fact, has come to an end...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the far-reaching sky, a face is stood The tall elf of the ancient singer. He closed his eyes. Only the spirit senses the distant situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while. He shook his head slightly and turned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elegant silver dragon that always floats behind the elf has stopped him. "Nicholas! Are you leaving like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king has lost." Nicholas faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the battle is not over yet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cranio. Don't be naive. Do you think that the king might defeat the demon who can kill the ancient emperor in a hand-to-hand battle?" Nicholas said lowly. "Wang... I knew this result before I went out."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio stayed a bit and lost his voice: "In this case, Wang Hao is not coming to die? Wang... Why must I fight with her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not good at fighting. If the king compares magic and fighting art with the demon, it will be defeated...and will be faster..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But! Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the glory of my family. I have been sealed into the body of the elf, and the ancient emperor also lost. If If Wang dares not to fight, how can Yinlong face other dragons in the future? It will at least let other dragons know that if they enter the Moonlight Dragon City, they will Will pay a heavy price! Surely this is the king ...... intention of it! "Nicholas sighed heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nicholas! Come back, come back to take over the position of the king. I will also go to the Dragon God to sin. Moonlight Dragon City can not lose four silver dragons at the same time!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas sighed long and shook his head in desperation. Turned away and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio called out: "Nicholas! In your heart, the fate of all the tribes is not as important as Cris Ferrena?! I I have paid so much for you, and asked you what!! Now the king... is about to leave. You are not willing to temporarily put down hatred and guard our moonlight dragon city that we grew up in childhood?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas looked up at the dim sky, and the sky was already densely covered with clouds, and the clouds were filled with strange blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally, slowly. Shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been sinned by the Dragon God, so in the Moonlight Dragon City. There is no way for me to revenge." Nicholas's voice gradually became firm, "Dear Cranho, I have to leave. Because...Cris Ferrena is in me, it is the meaning of everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Nicholas In the distant figure, Cranio screamed angrily: "Nicholas! You are just a selfish coward!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle has come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon lotus has been damaged, but the dragon flame is still weaker, and it can no longer hurt the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before her. The dragon wings of the Dragon King hang down on both sides of the body. More than ten meters of the path is nearly half a meter long. The horrible wounds that are not at the bottom of the body can not absorb the blood. The seriously injured Silver Dragon King is close to no blood. It has only two front paws that are still intact, one hind paw has been broken, and the other is connected to the body by a layer of flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong King’s absolute defense enchantment suddenly ignited, and finally dissipated under the gravitational pressure attached to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle has been fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s hands just took a shiny arc of light in the air and hesitated. He also forcibly stopped the ‘disordered cut’ that had just been launched. The energy of the disorder is turned into a silk electric awn, which is constantly moving on the surface of the demon lotus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong Wang seems to smile. Its gentle voice has been extremely weak: "Yes, I lost, and under the testimony of the dragons, I lost... And there is no warrior in the Moonlight Dragon City that can defeat you. However, the young silver dragon They may lack strength, but they never lack courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina nodded and said: "Yes, the courage and nobleness of Silver Dragon have won my respect. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Dragon King struggled to expand the wings, slowly hovering and turned to the direction of Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is at this time. A strange dragon scream suddenly sounded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart trembled. He turned his head and saw that he was condensing a group of dark blue, dark red and purple electric balls in front of the three dragons of Istarazze! The three electric balls are connected by a beating arc. It looks like a huge magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Rogge to react, a deep blue light wave bursts in the triangular arc, and in the center of the light wave, a dark blue light beam suddenly blasts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light column silently penetrated the body of the silver dragon king in the sky, and hit the front of the demon lotus, in the blink of an eye, the light column is behind the demon lotus Wear it out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time, at this moment has been condensed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is close to the devil There is a terrible hollow, she is like a fallen leaf, and it falls freely in the sky...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-headed dragon Istarazer acts as a ghost, almost speed Looking straight into the wind, it is not like the clumsiness of other dragons. Its huge body has appeared in the blink of an eternal silver dragon king, and a dark red faucet bite the throat of the silver dragon king! The other two faucets spurt a deep blue and purple dragon's breath, and the drop is the slowly falling demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;通! Rogge’s heart jumped and he went quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt a emptiness in his chest, it was a feeling of incomprehensibility and unclearness, just as all memories disappeared in front of the eyes. The fragmentation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful dragon Tedelia, who has been silent, suddenly has a dragon, and the transparent body exudes a beautiful seven-color light. A huge crystal shield appeared above the demon lotus, blocking the two-color dragons that had been hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tedreia! Do you dare to control me?" Three-headed Istarazze growled threateningly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of Tedelia’s body is moving faster and faster, completely ignoring the threat of the three-headed dragon. The unprecedented amount of magical energy is madly merging toward the transparent body, and in a blink of an eye, a tornado is formed by pure magical energy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ista Laze has a huge mouth. The body of the Silver Dragon King fell straight down. Although it threatens Ted Rey, it does not seem to be ready to face this mysterious colorful dragon. The three faucets screamed together, and a huge space door instantly formed in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, there was a wave of undulations in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the black and silver enamel is floating like a ghost. She stepped barefoot and the whole person appeared on the tip of the Istara Zedi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the wind and the moon are just like the steps. Stepping on the back of the three-headed dragon, all the way up, and finally jumped up. Rush to the most central faucet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her right fist, she has lit up a storm of energy that is enough to destroy everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three faucets of the three-headed Istarazer swayed together, and the six longan eyes stared at this petite disproportionate windy moon. But I don't know why, in front of the incredible silver plaque, it felt a little uneasy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful dragon Tedelia suddenly screamed, and the space door that Istaraz had to complete before was fluctuating, and there was a tendency to disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santou Long was shocked. The two faucets immediately swivel and maintained the space door. The third faucet tried its best to spur a deep blue dragon to the flying windy moon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a moment of flashing light...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santou Long Istarazze made an earth-shattering scream, its huge body passed through the space door like lightning And it disappears. The double-pointed long gun whizzed past the direction of the space door and stabbed it. Immediately after the death class and Androni couldn’t stop, they passed by the space door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreamlike beautiful figure was then worn out from the deep blue breath that was condensed and not scattered. She has a body. Then I planted it down until the pair of white wings were fully unfolded, and it was stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Fengyue falls is just below the demon lotus that is slowly falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the right hand are loose, throwing a huge blue dragon's eye with a square rule, and then catching the fallen demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the beautiful mask of the demon lotus, the eyes finally illuminate a faint glory, and Wei Na’s spiritual fluctuations reveal the weakness that cannot be concealed: “Really Oh, this time... finally fell into your hands! Fengyue, you...will not take the opportunity to report private enmity? We...return to the abandoned land. I need to... immediately...coming...and then. Come back and find these dragons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Moon holding the demon lotus, struggling to vibrate the wings. Dissolved into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the ground was filled with a dull roar and a strange snoring. The dragons who have not recovered from the accidents in their eyes turned their heads and suddenly found that Rogge had already stood in a place with a sleek blue light and a steel war nearly ten meters high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this horrible steel war that is enough to destroy a low-ranking adult dragon, the Green Dragon can’t help but retreat to the distance. Although the Red Dragons can remain calm, But the 'red anger flame' that has been hit hard is not as strong as the green dragon at the moment, so when it comes into contact with the bloody red eyes of the steel war, the heart can't help but panic, busy with the wings, even Escaped the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a little silver light is getting brighter in the distance, and an elegant silver dragon is flying all the way, and flies to the sky above the rift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel war was immediately attracted to this new silver dragon. He stayed for a while, and suddenly there was a roar of shaking, and the two feet slammed into the ground, and the hard ground immediately cracked a few cracks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body that flashed the blue light flew into the sky and flew to the silver dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering the accident in the distance, Cranio, who was rushing to the scene, has not figured out what happened, and he saw the horrible steel smashing I am close to myself! And she has been able to see the brutal smile of the steel giant's blue face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio screamed, his wings stretched, and he hurried upwards under the traction of magical power. However, the steel war broke hands, and the ten-meter giant axe that was originally in his hand flew out and flew to chase Cranio! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the silver dragon body is stronger, and it is impossible to withstand such a huge axe. Cranio was almost scared. She has been completely deprived of the power of the prophet since she abandoned the dragon god. Now she is not as good as an ordinary silver dragon warrior. How can she cope with this terrible war? Magic weapon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful dragon Tedelia is a loud dragon in the sky, and the seven-color brilliance suddenly appears on the flying axe. The trajectory of the spin has also changed, almost sticking to it. Cranio's body passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class and Androni did not stop the iron war. They watched the retreat while watching the movements of the other two silver dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the double-pointed gun of Xiusi suddenly flew back from the sky and slammed into the steel shackles. The huge steel smash was so hit, and finally stopped the momentum of flying, and turned to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth of Xius’s mouth sheds a trace of blood, and he fell to the ground in the sky, and it took him half a day to climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the time limit of the magic scroll has passed, the steel war has disappeared, and there is only one rogue in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
