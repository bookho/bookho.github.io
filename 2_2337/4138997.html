			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book of the seventh day of the last day (four)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I’m afraid of Rogge Majesty, still knowing his destination, quietly throughout the Great Temple of Light, all the way, Rogge did not meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked to the door of the Purgatory Angel Hall, and then stopped, turning back to the wind and Nai Fei behind him: "You are waiting for me here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, and waiting for them to answer, Rogge entered the Purgatory Angel Hall. The main entrance of the main hall has never been opened. But in front of Rogge, the two majestic gates fluctuated like waves of water, swallowed him in, and then returned to the cold and solid look, eleven imagery purgatory angels seemed to be Looking down at Fengyue and Naifei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge’s back disappeared, the face of Fengyue finally changed a little, seemingly confused and somewhat uneasy. Nafi snorted and spit out his tongue at the door of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is slowly flowing, they don’t know how long they wait, but the two doors have never shown signs of opening. Unconsciously, the light of the hall gradually dimmed, the temperature was getting lower and lower, and occasionally there was a chilly wind blowing. I don’t know where to come from, and I don’t know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you said, will he do anything bad in it?" Naifei suddenly said. While saying that she was subconsciously trying to pull the sleeves of the windy month, the wind and moon drifted back silently, just letting Nafi’s hand open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie glimpsed, looked back at the windy month, frowning: "Don't be so stingy? According to the rules of this plane. I am his daughter. Well, that is to say, although we have nothing to do with it now, it seems that there will always be a relationship in the future. You can’t say anything to me like this. You throw me to Donk Bakala, I have nothing. I care about you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...what will I have to do with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Windy moons live. Then frowning, thinking about it. A pair of frowns slowly unfolded. Nephi watched the expression of Fengyue. When she discovered that her eyebrows began to condense quickly, this smiled and jumped into the door of the Purgatory Angel Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue finally wants to understand, immediately angered: "Nefie! Do you want to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But at this time, Nafi’s figure has long disappeared into the door of the Purgatory Angel Hall, and the ripples have not yet been leveled. The wind and moon figure flashed, and Nefery entered the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Victoria. Would you like to think about it again?" Rogge’s loud voice echoed in the main hall of the Infernal Angels. It is not like a voice that people can make. In addition to Hong Liang, there is a strange feeling in his voice. It is neither cold nor intense. It sounds like a completely lifeless object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no room for consideration between faith and destruction! Even if I fall into this plane, I will not trade with you. Great Cetinis Tolia must give you the punishment you deserve!" Victoria's voice was a bit cold and painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s voice said again: “Maybe you should think about it. Why does Andreoli’s want to destroy you in this plane? This is the deity of the Lord of Destruction. The relationship between the Lord God is not something I can know. But can the Setanistoria be changed by the demon of the Lord of Destruction? Maybe there is such a possibility. There is some kind of deal between the two gods, and you are just a victim of this transaction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is never possible!" Victoria The secret of the gods is not something you can know about this evil and low heresy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge still has that waveless sound Dao: "The secrets of the gods are nothing complicated. The Lord of Destruction and the Lord of War have their own divisions and their own classes. They can't intervene in each other's fields, that's all, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria suddenly fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria is cold and cold: "The Lord of Destruction has violated the rules of heaven. It is falling into the infinite abyss. The order of the heavenly power is about to change. From the end of destruction, I am just one step ahead of you. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally. Rogge had a slight change in the cold, saying: "What is the relationship between the heavenly power and the order of us? The noble Victoria, since you have made a decision, let us start! This process is painful, but It’s not long.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Victoria’s painful cry filled the entire Purgatory Angel Hall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be tired, and it seems to be unsatisfied. Her yelling soon fell down and became awkward, and then the intermittent snoring slowly Disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie, who had been hiding in the hall, had a chill, and his face became pale. She hurriedly licked her hoe, as if she could throw out some very terrible things. Nefer was physically moved and quietly drifted back. However, she had just stepped back a bit, and she had a hand stretched out, grabbed her back neck and lifted her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the wind to speak, Nafi has a look of emperor. Suddenly she broke free of the hand of Fengyue. Instead, she hugged the wind and dragged her into the void, leaving behind only a ripple of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piece of ripples has just dissipated, and Rogge walked out of the main hall door and walked to the deepest point of the Purgatory Angel Hall. Out of a short walk, he stopped. Looking back at the place where the two girls fled, then they continued to move forward without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge finally stood before the statue of the Twin Hall. He stood silent for a moment, suddenly said: "Don't hide, come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue and Naifei appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Fengyue is still cold and cold, but she looks at Rogge’s eyes more strange, doubtful, and a little fear . Nafi is not as sensitive as her. The trail complained to the wind and said: "I have said that I can't follow it. If I follow it, I will find it! You see it. Now it's caught... Hey, are you listening to me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is not listening, she just looks at the statue floating in the air, the silver cymbals constantly fluctuate wildly, for a time, it seems to be crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned and looked at them. The ice in the eyes finally melted slightly, and faintly said: "You go back and wait for me, I will go back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie immediately said: "Since Soon, then we are waiting here!" After that, she put on an innocent and ignorant look, looking at Rogge with her big green eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guy who grows into a girl in just a few tens of days and carries the power of the natural goddess will be innocent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge certainly won’t eat her. He pointed to the empty hall at the other end of the Twin Temple and said, “You don’t want to leave. I want to Is there a place in the empty Purgatory Angel Hall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie's face immediately became pale and shook his head desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't you going back? No matter what happens, you won't be here!" Rogge's tone is harsh, but it's better than just The metal-like lifeless sound is much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie snorted reluctantly, stretched his hand and pulled the wind, and said to Rogge: "If you don't come, you won't come. Is it amazing?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wind did not move, she still looked up at the statue in the air, suddenly said: "Where is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, there is a trembling in her voice. This is the first time Rogge heard her speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face changed slightly, and he walked in front of the windy moon, blocking her view of the statue, and gently said: “That’s just a statue. Ok, You should go back, this is not where you should come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge finally sighed. Dao: "This is a very troublesome thing to say. Go back first. I will tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefira pulled the wind and whispered: " We are gone, he is already angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon suddenly silently followed Nephie to fly outside the Twin Hall, just a moment before leaving the Twin Hall She suddenly looked back and looked at the statue again, and there was no blood on her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge watched them leave, and then turned around, looking at the statue's eyes also had a touch of gentleness. He smiled a bit and said: "You see, now you have an independent consciousness in your body! Oh, it’s really troublesome. But it doesn't matter, soon it will all end, I won't let you suffer anymore. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Rogge extended his right hand, and from his palm, a small statue slowly emerged. Look closely, this statue portrays an angel, a chain wrapped around her naked body, her tightly tied, and a few fine chains through the two wings behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the day is extremely painful, she struggles and screams, but every struggle will bring her more unbearable pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small, almost transparent golden statue, solidified is the most painful moment of the day, even with a root on her back Feathers erected by pain are all faint! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the statue and hesitated a little, but in the end the palm of his hand leaned forward slightly, so the little statue flew away from his palm. Xu Xu drifted to the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes are drooping and he begins to recite spells. At this moment his spell is completely arbitrary, there is no rule. What kind of results he wants to see, he will immediately know how to recite the spell and how to drive the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of the spell, the statue of the angel is getting brighter and brighter, and in the middle of the journey, the entire twin temple is reflected as white! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It flutters and rolls, and the enormous power that cannot be imagined inside is pouring in the spell. This force is like a water drop at first, and then it becomes a trickle. In the twinkling of an eye, it has become a big river with waves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suddenly lost balance, swaying and falling, drawing a curved arc in the air, falling directly below the statue. As soon as the crystal clear figurine touched the ground, it broke into more than a dozen pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang, the golden frenzy moment is filled with every corner of the twin hall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tide is like a thunder, the tide is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the pale gold rushed back in an instant, and gathered away from the statues floating in the air. In the twinkling of an eye, it was completely sucked by the statue. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood still in the hall and looked up at the statue. Just a burst of golden power frenzy is enough to turn stainless steel into nothingness, but it can't hurt Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the golden frenzy disappeared completely, there was only a little sparkling embers in the flames of the temple. It seems to be very reluctant to flash a bit, and it is extinguished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the statue had a trace of anger, and a touch of silver began to float from her eyes. Rogge’s heart gradually jumped faster with the lingering silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon swayed and looked at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stepped forward. He wanted to call her name, but his mouth opened without making any noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed a little bit by self-deprecating, and he has experienced many moments of life and death hanging on the front line, but how can he still be so nervous now, so suffering? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not yet waiting for Rogge to speak, the silver in the eyes of the statue actually retreats like a tide! In an instant, the twins once again became lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
