			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crime of Punishment and Punishment on the Tomb of the Seven Dragons<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tomb of Zhang Qilong<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northern country of the wilderness, the peak of a dangerous peak, slowly lit up a milky white brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak seems to be a small explosion, and then a large cloud of white clouds emerges, constantly tumbling, shrouded the entire peak stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cloud, there is a group of white things that come out through the clouds and go straight into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After flying a thousand meters to the sky, it finally stopped, then began to stretch the body, gradually extending the head and tail from the milky white sphere. Four claws and wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon slowly opened his eyes. In the moment when the dragon's eye opened, there seemed to be two small lightnings shot from the blue eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's head and neck gracefully stretched out, and the wings slowly open, so the huge body glides like on the ice and flies away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon suddenly accelerates! Then suddenly stop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon that settles in the sky still maintains a majestic and rapid forward posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is open, its voice is low and magnetic, just as it tells the eternal philosophy, although the content and philosophy of the discourse are not at all Side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacred Dragon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon bowed its head and saw that The soft, lustrous piece of dragon scales flashes, and it whispers again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the sacred dragon..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suddenly, like a well-trained horse, stepping through the tiny steps, trotting in the invisible horse farm in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the Holy Dragon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is posing in the sky The posture, the low dragons reverberate repeatedly. It is like a mysterious song. If there is a sage who has a deep understanding of the world of the dragon at the moment, he will surely find that many poses belong to the iconic movements of many legendary dragons in the dragon epic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon suddenly flew into the sky, spurting a thick sacred flame, and then in the fire and smoke, it flew out with endless majesty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright dragon is as if to declare its arrival to the whole world: "The dragon of elegance. The dragon of the highest, the dragon of invincibility. The dragon of legend, These titles can only be owned by the sacred dragon! Ah! Ah! Ah!..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory circling in the sky, spraying More flames were produced, and a large cloud of clouds was created with dragon language magic. The huge dragon body that is hidden in the clouds and fires is indeed full of majesty and sacred feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It growls! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, the Holy Dragon. The Glorious Gregory, has been born again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the barking, Gregory’s voice turned to solemn and solemn: “From this moment on, all the glory of the world will be returned to Gregory...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Although Gregory has given dozens of different qualifiers to his name in the dark or in the clear, in terms of practical effects, the prefixes of invincibility, supreme, sacred, brave, and wisdom are far away. Not as lucky as it is. At least fortunately, it has changed the trajectory of Gregory's fate many times and saved it from the edge of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time. Still lucky has worked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory, who was just born again, suddenly recovered all the memories. At that moment, all the past events were crushed in the deepest part of consciousness, only the gray robe The dream figure of Jubilee remained in place, and for a time she became the focus of Gregory's full attention. Beside her. There is also a beautiful woman with blond hair. It’s just that the blonde woman’s figure looks much darker than the black-haired woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being lucky, you often need the role of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory took a deep breath and looked like a natural interruption in a complete roar, then picked up the previous scream: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and he will devote all glory to the glory of the beautiful, the wisdom and the strength of both the Moon and the Vena. Whether it is the sacred Gregory, Gregory of wisdom is still Gregory of courage. All these names have the only end point, that is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sucked again Breath and then use the power of the soul to scream:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory of the goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark forest is covered in thick clouds all year round. So even at noon. The entire forest is also at dusk. The sun in the sky looks like a dim round disc, and the dim light penetrates the dense foliage. Drop the spotted patches on the forest floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is lying comfortably on the top of a giant tree, snoring and sleeping. Opposite him, sitting a little bored with Androni, black boots in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a faint sorrow in her eyebrows. During this time, the maroon short hair has grown a lot. At this time, she is scattered on her shoulder, occasionally in the breeze. Fluttering. Now Androni still looks handsome and almost fascinating, but she seems to have a little more feminine between the unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire dark forest was trembling slightly, and a looming bounce came from far away. However, these did not quarrel with Rogge's sleep. He still leaned against the big tree, and his mouth was slightly smiling, as if he was doing something good dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge opened his eyes, stretched out, and then jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snoring, a slap is the size of a fierce insect like a mosquito that has been magnified many times, flying out of the tree, a two-inch sharp tip The mouth screamed at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is ready to fly the magic of the flight, this weird and fierce mosquito just approached his five-meter range, was flashed The silver ray is smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the emperor, this mosquito has always been called an ant bee, which is regarded as a major disease in the dark forest. They are incredibly fast, sharp and sharp, and can pierce thin armor in one fell swoop. At the same time, they also spit out very powerful paralyzed saliva. The most troublesome thing is that they are always in groups, and the number of ant bees will reach tens of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However. For the ant bee, whose soul ability is extremely weak, Rogge's wide-ranging mental shock is precisely their nemesis. The big tree that the fat man slept was originally a giant nest of ant bees. After two mental shocks, tens of thousands of ant bees were blown out of the fire of the soul, and they all died. The only bee that was still alive was turned into a crystal carving by Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Androni flew in the air and looked at the other side of the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the far horizon, there is a very tall and fiery figure that is gradually moving away. He is even taller than the ancient trees in the dark forest. Every time you fall, the earth will tremble accordingly. The trees on his side will suddenly start to burn. The blazing flames illuminate the dark forests that have been dark for years. The trees that are on his way are much more unlucky. When they are burning, they will be knocked down by his unstoppable body, and then they will be ruthlessly stepped into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants of up to tens of meters are the flame tyrants who have been sleeping in the gaps of the abyss all the year round, Don Kakkara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful presence in the dark forest, the lord of all dark creatures in the forest, the flame tyrant Donk Bakala. Already out of the abyss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crossing the entire dark forest. Behind it, there is a long corridor that is still burning, and in front of him, it is alone in the moonlight dragon city on the wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are far apart, Androni and Rogge can still clearly feel the violent temper of the flame tyrant and the overwhelming horror . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Androni asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head and said, "Nothing, just the first time I saw such a horrible guy. Something surprised."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around at the terrain and looked down from the sky. The endless dark forest seemed to be exactly the same. In the dark and gloomy forest, only the flame corridor left by Donk Bakala is still burning, and it is particularly eye-catching in a dim forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go. Let's just go back along the flame corridor it left behind, and we won't encounter any danger. After bypassing the abyss, we The destination is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge removed the flight, landed on the ground, and ran to the distant flame corridor in the forest. . Androni was behind him without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many unknown fierce creatures in the dark forest, many of which are unknown creatures. If two people fly in the sky, they will easily become the target of a large number of beasts in the range, and more likely to cause attention like the horror of Tang Ke Bakakara. Therefore, be cautious in the forest floor, although the speed is slower than the air flight, but it is much safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism exists at this level, such as Donk Bakala. Everything you leave will leave your own breath. And it won't last long. Dark creatures that are weaker than it, as long as they sense its breath. They will instinctively feel fear, and they will lose their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge and Androni are already in the flame corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning flame is just an ordinary fire, and it has no effect on the two people who have already transferred the power to protect the whole body, but the rich atmosphere left by Donk Bakala Let Androni feel the discomfort, and the stomach can't stop. Looking at the towering old trees, which are still burning all over the place, looking at the huge footprints on the ground, Androni’s face began to turn white again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several old trees that have left the ground and seem to remain in a state of escape. But they have been completely burned, and even the flames are not taken, and the blackened torso is only a light smoke. These trees are tree demons that are not weak, but they move too slowly and have bad luck. They grow on the path of the slow-moving Donk Bakala, so they cannot escape the flame of the flame tyrant. Breath range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every foot print on the ground is a huge deep pit with a depth of more than two meters. The four walls of the pit and the earth and stone at the bottom are melted at a high temperature to form a black crystal. It can be seen how hot the flames of the flame tyrant are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge urged: "Come on! The road is still far away. Now I don't know if the flame tyrant's breath can stay for a few days. This convenient and safe passage can be sufficient. Use, don't waste it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he jumped over a footprint left by Donk Bakala, and the figure gradually drifted away in the flames. Androni also suppressed his discomfort with Donk Bakala. Go with Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge’s hand suddenly appeared from behind Androni, and took a lot of notes on her ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said nothing, the blue sky with a beautiful and deadly blue brilliance, lightning in the back directions in all directions eight. The strength of these eight swords is just right, the power range covers the various positions behind her, and the speed is very fast, the lines are very different. It is impossible for Rogge to avoid it. Rogge’s strength is bigger, and ** is stronger. The speed is fast, he is just a magician, and the understanding of martial arts is only a smattering. If even the eight swords of Androni can escape, the fat martial arts are not too far away from the sanctuary, at least on the wind butterfly, Rumsfeld. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the fat man let one of the swords explore his whereabouts, then dozens of stars like a sharp needle will pierce Rogge’s body and let him be good. Experience what it means to be painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Androni is also very careful. In addition to greatly enhancing the power of the starry sky, the blue sky is also very sharp. Even if the fat skin is rough and thick, it is as weak as tofu in front of this artifact. She was afraid that one would accidentally cut the fat arm and what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all eight swords are lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here, don't look for it!" Rog smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing under Androni, the hand that took her ass is still high in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni thought he was standing behind him, so the eight swords that he stabbed were all based on this, and the result was passed over his head, of course Not anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is angry and angry. The black boots flashed and he kicked Rogge from the air. Since she let her know the position of the fat man, the gap between the two sides of the martial arts appeared. Rogue looked at the black boots flashing in front of her eyes, and she could not judge the point. She was already hesitant when she was hesitating. The feet kicked off the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and jumped from the ground and caught up with Androni in the rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just swayed and ran away, and ignored Rogge at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you. Are you still afraid of the flame tyrant?" The fat man smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni. She has just been ashamed and confessed, and she has forgotten the atmosphere of Don Kebala. Looking back now, it feels too much better than just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she just snorted and said that she had never been afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s mood was chaotic, and she was afraid of the power of the flame tyrant, and she was seen by Rogge. If that's the case, then that's it. But after Rogge had just teased her, it was completely beyond her expectations. If Rogge was malicious, it would probably kill her. Although she was not focused at the time, she never thought that the counterattack against Rogge would be lost! This simply means that she will let Rogge kill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant Androni is not willing to admit that this strength has always looked beyond her. Therefore, although she is silent, she has quietly used all the induction to detect the power and magic of Rogge. That's right, Rogge hides a lot of magic, but even if he counts these hidden forces, he hasn't reached the level of the big magister, and naturally it's impossible to be Androni's opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni quietly breathed a sigh of relief. She really does not want to see Rogge surpass herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Androni did not speak for a long time, Rogge smiled and said: "Compared with the ordinary sanctuary, the power of the flame tyrant is strong. Too many, Silver Dragon Nicholas is also true. In fact, there are too many powerful people outside of human beings, but the power of absolute superiority does not make them rule the mainland, but the living space of human beings is expanding. Because they all have weaknesses, Very obvious weaknesses. But too strong individual strength often makes them not face up to their own weaknesses. It seems that weak human beings are different. Even if it is a powerful dragon, thousands of people have come up with countless thousands of years. The method of killing dragons. Because of the small size, human beings are constantly exploring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pause, the fat man smiled and said: "For example, I can't beat you, So I have been studying your weaknesses, your mode of action, and the instinctive counterattacks. Hey, as long as you are persistent, there is nothing you can't do. You see, I just took your ass just now?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De Luoni furious, she immediately wanted to give this a dead fat unforgettable lesson. But when she was just vindictive, she saw that the magical radiance of this fat man could not shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of magic, the fat man is extremely light and quick, and in this blink of an eye, he has escaped far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni screamed and swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chased each other all the way, along the flame corridor left by Don Kebala, and quickly went to the depths of the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temper of the flame tyrant is very long-lasting, so the two did not encounter any powerful creatures. This trip is safe, but not boring. Along the way, Rogge was always looking for an opportunity to attack Androni, and the pattern was endless, and Androni was tricked into chaos. Naturally, in the process, the fat man took up a lot of cheap. Androni was angry and raging, and she couldn't help but crack the fat and sneak attack of the fat man. Unconsciously, there were many gains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
