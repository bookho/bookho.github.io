			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如如梦章二二上上#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West Coast of the Longines is nearly a thousand kilometers long from north to south, something More than five hundred kilometers is a complex and rich land. The transportation here is convenient, the climate is rare in the north, and although the Longine Sea is dangerous, but the products are abundant, it has raised a large number of people and races. In this land, there are countless strange races, almost all races settled along the Longines coast can be found here, even some races that live on foreign islands and are considered foreign bodies in normal human countries. Undisturbed life here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusiveness is a common feature of all business countries, as long as this tolerance can bring gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Asrofic empire, accustomed to ruling the territory with strong force, is not interested in tolerance and gold coins, and the great emperor cares about the territory. Of course, Rogge, who already knows the dark essence of the Emperor, does not think that Feuerbach’s purpose is simply to open up the territory and to keep his name in the history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the initial gathering of believers, Rogge’s eyes turned to the aliens who lived on this land. These different races have their own characteristics, and most races also have their own religion. There are religions, religions, sacred objects and gods. These are the goals that Rogge is interested in. And he is interested in the culture, talent and survival of these strange races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the day was not dawn, Rogge sighed softly and stood up from the reef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, he likes to sit alone and meditate at the beach. When he came to the beach, his hands were full of bloody moments, and when he left. The hands that have been washed will soon be covered with thick blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of any country in history is based on countless bones and blood, and religion is no exception. In this turbulent era, the small country can only survive the breath of the great kingdom, and the small sect will only be like a bubble rising in the sea. Rogge, who has been smothered from blood, fire and conspiracy, knows that in this world. If you don't step on someone else, you will be stepped on by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, there was no chill in the sea breeze blowing from the sea. And a little more moist and warm. Rogge walked slowly down the reef and his ears suddenly moved slightly. In the sea breeze, there is a faint voice, which is the sound of the beast eating. But Rogge smelled a hint of metal from the sea breeze. He converges on the breath of the whole body, leaps from the reef and sneaks to the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a leeward beach, several giant lizards are eating together. They are all tied with rough wooden saddles. It does not seem to be wild, but someone is being kept. Not far away, there are several trolls hiding behind the reef and looking around. These trolls are much smaller than the usual trolls, but they are very agile and fierce. They are very good at throwing a poisonous javelin on the back of a lizard. It is a very dangerous service in the orc team, fighting power and The elite werewolves are also very few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard, which is being used as a mount, is eating more than a dozen human bodies. From the point of view of clothing, two people wear the clothes of the Holy Church. Next to the trolls, several elf women were bundled into a string, sitting on the ground with a sluggishness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands on a reef that is a kilometer away, with a brow that is slightly wrinkled. He did not expect to see orc warriors in this place. The West Bank of the Longines is thousands of kilometers away from the orc empire of the Central Mountains!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like this The task of the little orc army is to transport the elves, but how can they ship the elves here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eyes fell on those elf women. Rogge’s doubts were immediately replaced by raging anger. The elf women were undressed, bruised and bruised, and the face was gray and gray, and it was obviously tortured. Their original beauty is full of criss-crossing scars, the appearance has been completely ruined, the sharp ears are also notched and broken, and even the ears of two elves have completely disappeared!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have a lot of races, and in the eyes of some orcs, the elves are ugly. In the eyes of other orcs, the charm of the elf is irresistible. These troll knights in the eyes of Rogge belong to this category. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See here. Rogge no longer hesitated. Jumped down the sea reef and strode to the trolls. Rogge just showed up. Immediately discovered by these perceptive trolls, they pulled out the javelin behind them, jumped onto the monitor lizard, and screamed at Rogge. But when these trolls, known for their fierceness, roared and wanted to charge, the lizards that fell under them slammed on the ground and stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge smiled and walked forward. The magic of his hands could not shine. In an instant, the reefs on the beach indirectly illuminate several magic chains, and the tall wolf warriors hidden in them are firmly bound to the original place. Then several hot fireballs flew to the werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf warriors are tall and strong, and their extremely tough outer skin is enough to harden the fireball cast by the human mage without being seriously injured. It’s just that these fireballs that Rogge popped up are not big, but they are lit with lavender flames, and they fly extremely accurately against the wolf’s most vulnerable nose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sounds, the wailing of the wolf's painful moments resounded throughout the beach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are black and black, the hard skin is burnt, and the huge wolf nose with black luster is gone! The seriously wounded wolves are insane, they are helpless and frantically biting and grabbing everything they touch. The nose is the key to the werewolf, and the werewolf who was blown away from the nose could not survive. But the mighty vitality of these werewolves has now become a source of pain, and they will struggle for many days in pain before they can be relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge kept his feet, stretched his hand and grabbed it, and pulled out a strange dark wolf from the shadow of the side. The werewolf swallowed his throat in the hands of Rogge, his limbs softly hanging down, and there was no room for resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at the werewolf and was slightly surprised. Self-speaking: "It turned out to be an invisible Tibetan Werewolf. This is a rare breed. Well, it is worth staying to study." He broke the limbs of the Shadow Werewolf and threw it on the ground, and his eyes fell on those. The body of the troll knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, and the left eye of Roggen’s eyes. The roar of the trolls immediately became a whimper, and they desperately urged the monitor lizard to escape. But how can the trolls sip? The giant lizards are just lying on the ground. The troll knights themselves are also very agile, but they are completely overwhelmed by fear at the moment, unable to escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is leisurely, but a few steps have crossed the distance of hundreds of meters and came to the troll. His hands and fingers suddenly stretched like tentacles, slowly inserting into the eyes of these trolls. I have been exploring them in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Rogge’s fingers have returned to their original form and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory fragments that were forcibly extracted from the brains of these trolls show that this orc small force patrolled the border of the Central Mountain Orc Empire not long ago, this time The task is to transport these elf women who have just been thrown out of the Beast Temple to another orc camp. But somehow, they suddenly came to the Longines Coast thousands of kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Green Sea battle, tens of thousands of elves have become captives of orcs. These elves are taken to the Temple of the Beast, every once in a while. A group of elves will be sent out of the Beast Temple to serve as playthings for the orc tribes everywhere. After the elves can't stand the torture, the body is also a delicious food for the orcs. And when each batch of elves was sent out, like the elves in front of Rogge, they completely lost their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trolls don’t know what’s going on in the Beast Temple. However, Rogge, who is good at all kinds of haze magic, has faintly felt from the traces of the elf women. The orc's great sacrifice, Ogan Heller, used the elves to do cruel experiments in the orc temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he is doing to the people on the West Coast of the Longines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge indulged, reaching out to the elf women, a breeze holding their body and throwing them far into the night Under the sea. He then mentioned the Tibetan Werewolf and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, a small piece of reef in the distance quietly moved up, and the gnome from the shadow of the bottom of the gnome jumped down from the sea reef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the wolves who are still on the beach, Gregory whispered strangely: "How did these orcs come here..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s words are not falling, and a fierce hand is coming out of the void. He grabbed the back of his neck. Pick it up. Subsequently, Adrienne's entire talents came out of the void. She did not stop at all. The blue-gold double-eyed eyes flashed and they wanted to return to the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, the dragon soul gun with a soft, pale silver halo suddenly appeared, and the tip of the gun pointed to Adrienne’s eyebrow! If Adrienne wants to continue to penetrate into the void, then her forehead must first be worn by the dragon soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to move me again." Wella was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne smiled a little, his hand was loose, and with a bang, Gregory fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where, I have returned this strange sacred dragon to you, I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and said: "Your courage is getting bigger and bigger, is it easy to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aidelei Ni turned away and completely ignored Wei Na’s threat. She flew away from the distance. While flying, she smiled and replied: “I am really helping Rogge now! Do you still have to deal with me? If you really have nothing to do, you may want to figure out why these orcs will appear here, but I don't know why. Anyway, if you really beat me, I will stop helping him... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner is furious, and the dragon's gun has a little light on the tip of the gun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But until Adeline flew far away, she did not stab the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and finally hated the Dragon Soul gun and turned to the wolf on the beach. But she couldn't find any clues, she just had to frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Gregory, who had been squatting on the ground, jumped up, and the little eyes of the gnome, the big eyes of the beans radiated the brilliance. It murmured: "Your Rogge... your Rogge..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must be something! Gregory screamed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mordes Church is a small church that advocates peace and avoidance. There are only a few thousands of believers. The Mordes believe in the moon god. Its totems and religious rituals are all related to the Blue Moon. It took hundreds of years for believers to build a temple dedicated to the goddess of the blue moon in the mountains not far from Ludan Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of Ludan Port is very important and has a large population. It is very easy to supply the church in Mordes. For the same reason, the Imperial Temporary Palace was chosen here, and the Temporary Great Shrine of the Holy Church is also located here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the day was just lit, Rogge, who threw the Tibetan Werewolf in the Temporary Great Temple, stood outside the gate of the Temple of Goddis. Look at the statue of the Blue Moon Goddess above the gate of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy to build in the mountains, so the Temple of Mordes is not tall. On the side of the temple, the believers built a small village to maintain a basic and self-sufficient, poor and peaceful life. At this time, the believers gradually came out of their homes and shrines, and looked at Rogge with a look of suspicion. When there was not much, the old man in the priesthood was removed from the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they went to a group of believers, they gave Rogge a courtesy and asked kindly: "This adult. What made you come to us?" What is a simple and poor place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled kindly and said: "My name is Rogge, maybe you have heard of me and my little The small sacred church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of Mordes believe in screaming, and there are many arguments, and it is full of fear in Rogge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is not alone. There are several ice and snow mage behind him. One hundred ice warriors stand on both sides of the Mordes. In addition to these, there are hundreds of imperial soldiers like wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Mordes in front of you. Rogge stepped forward and smiled. "I heard that there is a Luna badge in it. I want to borrow it. I don't know if it is possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Madris's face is changing. The Luna badge is the sacred object of their church, the mark of the Blue Moon goddess, with incredible magical power. I just don't know how the news came to Rogge's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be answered by the Mordes. Rogge waved his hand, and more than a dozen ice temple warriors rushed into the temple under the leadership of the ice and snow mage, and began to look east. Everyone in the face of Mordes has a sorrowful color, but they are never known for their strength. Even if they are ten dozen, they may not be the opponent of an ice warrior. If you do it, it is completely equivalent to suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
