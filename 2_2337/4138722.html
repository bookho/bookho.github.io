			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Rogge was surrounded by the 'flying seven-color deer' and the Sala people’s brigade, and began to visit the home of the elders and the Great Temple. : Elf City 'Green Sea' enters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he enjoys the treatment of the gods. The seven elders of the two races were all dispatched, accompanied by Rogge, accompanied by Rogge to talk about the land. All the elves are talking about Rogge secretly, looking to his eyes and respectful and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that battle, Rogge’s unpredictable power completely conquered the proud elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of Rogge's seal of the bone dragon and the flame bone demon has completely out of the common sense of the elves, they can't tell whether this is martial arts or magic, even the bone dragon The most powerful undead can be sealed by a finger, which can only be described as miracles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the battlefield was cleaned afterwards, the place where the orcs led the fall also made many elves unable to go, and they were awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning spear is the power of the two strongest warriors, Huron asked himself, and knows not to block, that is, hiding can not hide. He is thinking about the strong people in the elves, and it seems that no one can have this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** The power of the 'Lemon's Spear' is enough to pierce the green dragon, Trinity Hugh, and now she has swallowed Karajan and Chris. The power of Ma, the small test knife, the natural pressure on the audience. Only she deliberately made a glare, no one could see her, so that some elves actually thought that Hilo personally came to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders are not so naive, but they all know that people who are especially religious and devout, such as gods and gods, often communicate directly with the gods. Correspondingly, it has a special magic or magical skill. Now, in the eyes of the elder elders, Rogge is indeed a god. As for why Hilo chose a Terran as a god ambassador, the elders and some of them slowly chatted with him and they got some understanding. God makes the adults talk, and they are knowledgeable and unrecognizable. They tend to be underestimated. They point directly to the elves' long-standing disadvantages, and often make the elder elders feel awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Rogge showed "big power", in the eyes of elder elders, this ordinary fat face is more and more wise. . God has also let the adults put down their restraints, and occasionally describe the prospects of the elves with the elder elders, and more consciously or unintentionally have many vague effects on the future status of the two races. The seven elders are very excited, especially what God has pointed out to the adults, and will be of great interest to open up a new era for the elves. The old guys have lived for too long, and they are not particularly enthusiastic about the power. They value whether they can stay in the annals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With God making adults together, this chance is greatly increased! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni rides in the ‘Longma and the Elves’ little beauty to tease. Although she always feels weird about this dragon horse, but the dragon horse is really pulling the wind, too suitable for her personality. In the pursuit of the orcs, her whole person turned into a blue lightning, like a ghost, for a moment, dozens of orc warriors fell under her sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword method, such a look, so that she immediately became the object of countless elf girls hot pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The art-loving Sala girl is ashamed and ashamed, and the fast-moving ‘flying seven-color deer’ tribe is much more enthusiastic. A group of elf girls are surrounded by Androni, and they are all graceful and graceful. It is really beautiful. When Rogge occasionally sneaked over the past, he always thought about it, and he wanted to raise his fire. He needed to work hard to control it, so that he would not reveal the tail of the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the far side of the mountain, one person and one dragon are looking at the elf team that is marching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory people stand and boring their tails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Standing in front of it, the gale blew her grey robes, occasionally revealing a white, creamy skin. She is as long as a mirror, but if she has a thousand weights, there is no flutter in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the huge and terrifying bone dragon, the *** is so petite, soft and soft like a flower bud that has just blossomed. But Bone Dragon is respectful to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! When the woman rarely has a single order, we have been with them for two days, and have not found a chance to start. Master, not her ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! I really don't understand, can you give me some pointers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, you will understand when you are. The bones must be smarter, and learn more from this world in the future, so that you can get me faster. Go back! Right, you tell the flames, let him look at the black warriors, see if they will There is something to come in contact with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I heard a lot of praise for 'Green Sea' on the way, but when I really stood in this magical Before the Elves Capital, Rogge knew that these praises were so pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees are towering together to form a natural wall that spans more than ten miles. Natural tree walls up to tens of meters can only be described by the word grand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Green Sea’ has been built by the tribes of the past few thousand years of history. The Presbyterian Church and the Great Temple of the Elves, which were established after the defeat of the Elves, are also located here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Green Sea' gate opened wide and a team of elf knights greeted. For the Cavaliers, the elders recognized that he was the leader of the elders' guards. He said in a cold, uninteresting voice: "The elders have heard of the news that the elders and Rogge have arrived in the Green Sea. The elders of Elvin are very pleased with the arrival of the elders. This Mr. Rogge has also been The Presbyterian Church is invited to attend the special meeting of the elders in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and the elders of the elves looked at each other and the cold attitude towards the Green Sea was a big confusing solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Philippine have already sent a notice to the Green Sea’s elders’ home. They thought that there would be a grand welcoming ceremony. As a result, the elders only sent a guard. Come, this makes him very difficult to come to Taiwan. What made him and Rogge feel that the atmosphere was wrong. The ‘Green Sea’ was a heavily guarded look, and the name was also Mr. Rogge, not a god. This faintly shows that the Green Sea does not recognize Rogge's status as a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fei Li, Sarah and other seven elders who witnessed Rogge 'miracle' burned in anger and looked blue. In the heart of Rogge, he was uneasy and realized that something must have gone wrong. Even if the elves of the elves compete for power, their own gods should belong to the party that should definitely be wooed. It is impossible to give yourself such a look and come up with an enemy for no reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of the 15-meter-high city facade of the 'Green Sea', Rogge hesitated. It can be different from the territory of the Sala people. Once you enter the city, it is not easy to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old saying is how to say it? If you don’t enter the tiger hole, you won’t be able to see the little tiger!” The fat man bit his teeth and bite his head into the green The door to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy city gate slowly closed behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green sea is full of flowers, everywhere is grass, trees, flying butterflies. In the center of the city there is a splendid ancient tree of up to several hundred meters, which is said to have been growing for thousands of years. The elves and old trees slowly transport the huge and unparalleled magic to every corner of the green sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green sea is always the spring of the seasons, spotless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Temple of the Elves is built under the elves. At the same time, the Elf architecture is generally formed by the natural growth of plants. The Great Temple is made up of white marble, elegant and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Presbyterian Church was built next to the Great Temple of the Elves, but it was built of dark brown boulders and looks solemn and oppressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate's Chamber of Deputies is very broad and is an extremely standard round. There is a circle of seats around the hall, which in turn rises. Eighty-one elders sat in it, seemingly sparse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat down with seven elders, including Philip and Sara. More than a dozen elders around have come to say hello, apparently have always been good with the two races. However, most of the elders' faces have disguised surprises, and they are surprised at how the ‘flying seven-color deer’ and the Sala people will sit together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Horde is weak, the status of Sarah’s elders is high. This stems from the respect that everyone insists on preserving the cultural heritage of the Elf. It was the first time that the elders of the elders from the 'Light of the Forest' tribe, Elvin, announced the special meeting of the elders. He immediately stood up and embarked on the podium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders have been talking about it, and a considerable number of elders are puzzled to see the angry Sarah elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Elvin are dressed in white robes, graceful manners and demeanor to be a model for any elf. He obviously knows what Sarah is referring to, but he still asks: "My dear Sarah brother, my belief in Hilo has always been as firm as you are. What makes you so angry?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sala elders sighed: "As we all know, our Sala people have had a disagreement with the 'flying seven-color deer' tribe, and it has been very difficult to resist the orc tribes over the years. The battle between Sarah Pass and the orcs four days ago was the first time that our Sarahs fought side by side with the soldiers of the seven-color deer. Although we dispatched the gryphon, the seven-color deer also dispatched all the wet dragons, but this time, It’s still almost lost.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a buzz in the Chamber of Deputies, and obviously there are many elders who have not yet got the news of the Battle of Sara Pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elder asked with a loud voice: "There are lions and wet dragons, why can't they deal with dirty orcs? Is the orc so bad?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippine elder stood up and said: "Yes, my brother, this time the orc attack is different from the past. They not only have the collar, they have the organization, they have The shamans, they also had an agreement with the devil. The orcs even summoned the bone dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hilo is on! Really a bone dragon "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bone Dragon!" The elders in the Chamber of Deputies cried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Elvin screamed a few silences before they regained the order of the Presbyterian Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone is quiet, Sarah Elder said: "Yes, it is the most evil undead, bone dragon! It killed three wetland dragons in an instant. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another exclamation in the elders' home. Although most of the credit for killing the three-headed wet dragon should be recorded on the head of the flame bone demon, but where it has the high popularity of the bone dragon. Elder Sarah is an artist, literature is also a part of art, literature allows exaggeration, and Sarah Elder is a good player in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we finally won!" Sarah Sergeant shouted: "It is precisely because of Rogge, the distinguished hero of Hilo, who demonstrated the power of God. Power, sealed the bone dragon and killed the orc collar, we finally defeated the orc!" He also showed the poet's temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time, three elders witnessed the miraculous manifestations of the gods at the scene. However," Sarah had a meal and angrily yelled: "When we led the noble gods to the Green Sea, the elders only sent a guard to the squad, and arrogantly informed us that we would meet in the Senate in the afternoon! Dear elders, are you so honored, Even the shrine of Hilo can't let you move the noble body and come out to meet it? Your piety, your faith, where!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now The elder Sarah was completely transformed into a fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge observed carefully that there were more than twenty elders with a gloomy look, and most elders were stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there such a thing? Elder elder, there is nothing in the notice that you give us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is God already here, which one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is noisy in the Chamber of Deputies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara’s old face was so excited that he pointed to Rogge and said: “This is God, the noble Rogge!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood up in a timely manner and gave a slight tribute to the elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elder stood behind Elvin and screamed: "Mr. Rogge, it is not certain that he is a god! How is Hilo? Choosing a Terran to Serve as a God? How can the Terran lead the noble Elf? This is simply awkward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elder Felix also stood up and angered : "Camamara Xiu! Are you doubting the wisdom and judgment of our seven elders? Is it possible to make a joke about the return of the millennium and the identity of God? The 'Light of the Forest' is the eldest of the elves. The tribe, but not everything can do whatever you want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kamaras! You are too mad, you dare to doubt the identity of God to make adults!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have any doubts, just saying that this big thing has to be done with caution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solemn elders had a quarrel, and the elegant elves lost all their manners at this moment. They argued loudly that many tribes among the tribes were turned over and became an excuse for mutual attacks. Only Rogge sat calmly and smiled without saying a word. Now that his passionate believers are charging for him, where can he use him to take the lead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The morning light of the forest' is the most expensive restaurant. From the elegant room on the fourth floor, you can see the tree of life, the elf temple and the elders. hospital. The room is surrounded by a magical array of flowers and trees. Although simple, it is a natural skill. Under the power of magic, the gentle breeze smashed through the room. No matter what the weather is outside, the house is always the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron pear wood dining table placed in the middle of the house is a precious and ancient art piece, engraved with reliefs that celebrate the glorious history of the Elf before the millennium war. The entire table was magically blessed, revealing a faint dark red glow. Valuable magic is used to keep the table for a long time. If the magician of the family sees it, it will be painful to waste the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room has always been prepared for the most noble characters of the elves, and sometimes used to entertain very important VIPs. In the room at the moment, Frey leaned back on the back of the chair and leisurely tasted the old wine in his hand. Sitting next to him is a veteran-like old man, singular and luxurious, with a look of glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freak adults, as you might expect, the fake god made him actually come to the Green Sea. Since this time he came, it is not so easy. Going. According to our observations, the false god is only a magician of level 10 or so. I really don’t think he has such a great courage, but dare to start to count the real gods. However, Frey adults, Carmela Even if she was killed, is she really a god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frire stunned and said: "Mr. Prague, your suspicion is not without reason. In fact, I have been skeptical about this for a few days. However, Carmela has seen my father, submitted evidence of adherence to the gods, and asked the Northern Druid Alliance to provide her with shelter. The identity was confirmed by the father, although I don't know what the evidence is, but the father will never be wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think "Prague carefully selected the words, after all, the wrath of the sky is in their minds, it is like a god. In. In the glory days of God, there has never been a situation in which God made it to be killed before the completion of the gods. "Will it be the wrath of the sky? Is there any other arrangement in this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freaked a sigh of pro-adults who have left the Central Mountains and returned to the clouds The city is gone. So, now I can't find him to ask. But in any case, we can't let this fake god make the fish in the Elf family! It took us a few hundred years for Druid to gradually control the elves, this time absolutely cannot allow this person to destroy! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it seems that this fake god is not easy! He has at least controlled two elves. Mr. Prague, what do you think about this? Frei looked at the old man intently and waited patiently for the answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prague slowly said: "From the intelligence in our hands, the Sala and the seven colors Although the deer are only less than 7,000 people, there are more than a dozen elves in our mastery, with a total population of more than 60,000. So, the worst case is that this fake god will hold the 60,000 elves in their hands. Now, we still don't know what purpose this god has, and we must not take it lightly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fried nodded, looking at the elders and sipping a handful of wine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The elders of Prague, soon we will know what his purpose is. I have Frey here, he wants to fish in troubled waters is not so easy. However, if he is smart enough, we will let him make this god become false, and there is nothing wrong with it! Now the elf's elders' homes should have been quarreled. I didn't expect that the elves who have always claimed to be firm and temperament will put their gods aside in the face of their interests! Hahaha! Although we have provided them with enough excuses. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prague caressed the neatly combed beard on his lips and slowly said: "The millennium returns to this road is not easy to go." Judging from the tone of the dead ghost Carmela, this holy place is likely to be in the Chichennaco Mountains to the west. It is a hundred miles away from the Central Mountain Range. It is not easy for the 200,000 elves to be able to get a holy place for ten thousand. If I am an elf patriarch, I am afraid that I have to think about it. Is it for a vain legend, I will put the life of the majority of the tribes into it. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freak adults, although according to the detection, the fake god makes only about 10 magic, but you still have to pay attention to your safety!" Prague is clearly insincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten-level magician?" Frehaha laughed. "I will pay attention not to hurt him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid's magic system is very different from the magic used by the magician. But unlike the weak body of the magician, Druid's magic resistance and force are much higher. Such as Drey, who has reached the 14th level of Druid, will wear a whole set of magical protective equipment, which will make most magicians have a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves’ elders had a whole afternoon in the elders’ home and there was no result. Although Sarah and Philippine are at a disadvantage, they are gradually gaining an advantage in the debate. They have too much evidence that Rogge is a god. The fat man is exactly the same as described in the prophecy, and all the features mentioned in the prophecy are quite the same. There are also many elves who have witnessed the miracle of the forest that he displayed. The tribe is also well-informed. Although it is gradually falling behind in the truth, it is still unacceptable. The whole afternoon passed quickly, and finally Elder Elvin had to announce the end of the meeting and discuss it tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders 66 continued to come out of the Presbyterian Church. There have been many such intense and wonderful debates in the Presbyterian school for many years, and all the elders of the elves are very excited. After leaving the home for the elderly, the voice of Gao Song’s debate still sounded from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is surrounded by Philip, Sarah, etc., and is dedicated to the use of the elves of the elves. The fat man’s heart was filled with emotion. “I really didn’t think that the elves were such a well-defined creature!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s not to say, for the superior, you can Does the subordinate ask a lot of unreasonable demands?" The fat man couldn't help but think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fryer stood on the side of the road and talked casually with the two men. His sharp eyes, from time to time, look at Rogge who is heading in this direction. In the eyes of Frey, who has always been clean, this god makes the face look ugly and bloated, and the flashing eyes in a pair of small eyes are clearly the fascinating light. If you don’t know that this swindler is doing something earth-shattering, he will really look away and put Rogge into the incompetent generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger and his party have four or five guards in addition to the seven elders. The 'Green Sea' has always been a land of peace. The guards are only used to show their status. They don't need much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, this group of people came to Frey. Frey Yang haha ​​laughed a little, stepped forward and reached for a finger to Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the blue shadow flashed in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Androni saw Rogge coming out of the elders’ house, and he pulled out from the elf girl’s pile and silently followed him. Behind the grid. The elf girls were unwilling, but they saw a number of elders walking with Rogge, spit out their tongues, and dared not offend, and said loudly to Androni, who jumped away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak was struck by lightning and was on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at Frey strangely. The man is tall and handsome, and with a bit of a sense of desolateness through the vicissitudes of life, to a simple and simple station, majestic and self-sufficient. Just somehow, he laughed innocently, and then stepped over, suddenly became a cocky, ugly look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighs, how can such a hero, an idiot? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and others went far, and Frey was still an idiot, not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Freak Master! Frey Daren!" Frey's men were extremely worried and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder suddenly came back, he grabbed his own hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just saw the ghost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult! How come in the elf city?" Undead creatures appear!" Frey was very strong, and he was a little breathless. The 14th-level Druid is definitely a very powerful warrior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have any eyes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, you The eyesight is just as good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fried nodded and laughed a few times. He suddenly remembered something and reached out and twisted his hand under his hand. The man screamed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it painful?" Frey asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The grown-up is dead." The face was purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I am not dreaming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not a dream, you are sober Very much! "The words were squeezed out under the cracks of the hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak stayed for a while, then suddenly laughed. After a while, I laughed, surrounded by At first glance, there are already many elves around, and his old face is red, low-covering, crowding out the crowd, and regardless of the two men, the foot is rushing away.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men also covered their faces and hurriedly chased Frey until they were no one, only complaining in a low voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the adult's fault has been committed again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, hey, it hurts me." Adults want to know if they are dreaming, why should you marry me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this adult will not be mistaken for the big Druid adults. However, I did not expect that there are such beautiful men in the world! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he puts on a women's dress, that's really a shame!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Ah, even I have a little bit of movement! You said that if he took off his clothes, these two big white legs would stretch like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night, Frey hurriedly hit the elders of the 'Land of Light' tribe who came to the secret talk, regardless of the resolute opposition of Prague and the crowd, to go to the night to explore the home of the elders Said that it is necessary to talk to the false gods. Now even Prague knows what his purpose is to find Rogge. Naturally, he is afraid that he will be ill and will break the big thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Frey was so extreme that it was too big, and Prague couldn’t, but he had to take two powerful men and go to the night to explore the elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven elder elders are sitting in Rogge’s room, and they are screaming at the 'forest light' with their own indignation, the 18 elders in the tribe Regardless of whether or not they were in the elders' court in the afternoon, they were not spared. Even some old and ugly things were revealed. It is proof that these old guys were not good things hundreds of years ago. Sarah and Philippine blamed, but knew that the elders still held the ‘forest light’ and their hand in the hands of the tribe. If the 'light of the forest' insists on not listening to the gods, I am afraid that only the priests who have found the Great God Temple will help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, among the thirteen sacrifices of the Great Temple, the two groups only had the sacrifice of Zhao. Elder Sarah proposed that Rogge display another miracle in the Great Temple of the Elves, and naturally let the other twelve sacrifices identify the identity of Rogge. If you get the approval of the Great Temple of the Elves, ‘Light of the Forest’ will not be able to make an adult in the elders’ home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara’s suggestion was immediately rejected by Rogge. There are no strong people in the Sala people, and no one can see the fat people. But if you go to the Great Temple of the Elves and play this one, you can play with fire. Not to mention whether the trick will be dismantled, and he has killed the hero of Hilo, pretending that she is not counted, but also going to the temple of Hilo to swindle and lie? As long as Hilo has a little temper, he will not blame himself. Rogge knew that God existed.
