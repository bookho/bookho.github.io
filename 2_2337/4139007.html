			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh Day Book Volume 6 Redemption (3)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon sun lazily shines In the beautiful Elven Valley, a layer of warm redness is applied to the surrounding lush forest. The surrounding mountains are very quiet, but the elves in the valley are rushing to and fro, seemingly busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the floating temple in the center of the valley, hundreds of giant magic symbols with a square meter have been cast. These magic symbols work extremely finely, with different magical brilliance shining in the sunlight. Each magic symbol is made of different rare metals or magical materials, not to mention the value of this magical array design and the incredible handwork that is used to make these giant characters. The material itself, but also the value of the city can be described? Even the three empires, it is impossible to have such financial resources to create such a magical array of luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, every magic symbol sits with an elf. These elves have men and women, old and young, and they all wear plain robes, meditation, and motionless. It’s just that many elves are exhausted and obviously have been meditating for a long time. Occasionally, an elf can't hold it down, and the elf will be carried away, and a new elf will come over to fill his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every elf who has been carried away is dying, not simply tired. Their vitality seems to be close to cognac, and even some elves have closed their eyes forever on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are not sad, facing one fell down companion. The land on their faces is only reverence and holiness, calmly facing the departure of their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fate of these elves, and in their long, hundreds of years of life, everything they do is for the moment of today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magical sign is like a huge mouth without a bottom, endlessly swallowing the vitality of the elves, and through the invisible The network, the collection is transported to the temple floating in the air. The temple of the air exudes a faint radiance, and the faint glows are soft and flowing, appearing mysterious, magnificent and solemn. It emits a low and pleasing scream It seems to be singing this sacred and solemn moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Elven Valley surrounded by mountains, in this tragic and holy moment, there is still a corner of the valley. A corner that is not harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small building in the Elven Valley that is not eye-catching. There will always be a scream of screaming in the inside, as well as a sound of metal knocking. However, the small building was covered by an invisible magical enchantment. There was no sound that could be passed outside, so the shackles in the building did not disturb the sacred ceremony outside the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor of the small building is an empty hall with a red crystal table in the center, which is locked with a handsome, tall and youthful body. The young man's body is red luo, the hands and feet are carved through the steel nails with heavy inscriptions, and they are nailed to the crystal table, but the nails are worn. There is no trace of blood at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the crystal table, there is a busy elf girl. Her long hair was arbitrarily behind her head, and the beautiful face was covered with fine sweat, which looked extremely attractive. She was busy, and there were a lot of messy magic materials piled up at her feet. From time to time, she leaned down and turned over from the middle. In her right hand, she held a small hammer of white gold forged, and her left hand danced like a butterfly. No matter what she found out from the pile of debris at the foot, she just took a look at it, and the material would immediately become an exquisite little chisel of the same material. The magic of its creation is really amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved a platinum hammer and couldn’t stop chiseling on the juvenile’s cock. The strange thing is. The juvenile body is not like a flesh-and-blood body. When it collides with each of the small chisels, it will make a smashing metal impact. As the small chisel continues to move, the juvenile body continues to splash metal-like powder. As soon as these powders leave the body, they glow and then burn out in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager is twitching all over the body and can’t stand the torture that the Elf girl has tortured him. But he seems to be extremely afraid of the girl, clenched his teeth and did not dare to scream. But the pain that is imposed on him seems to be unbearable, so every time. He couldn't help but scream a few times. Then, under the gaze of the elf girl, she shut up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he made another scream. The girl finally couldn't stand it and slammed it on the boy. It hurt him that he almost closed his breath. Then the elf girl was angry and said: "What is it called! Can you not endure such a pain? If the gods who have nothing to do, know that my son will be so good, where do you let my face go?! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl stared at the teenager and looked at it from the left and muttered: "It looks like he is not like him... Hey, if you have half of your father's enthusiasm, I can take you and those who are free. The panicked gods show off and show off! Now it’s good, I have to find a way to stare at them!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the teenager wants to say, but with the eyes of the elf girl Contact, scared and closed his mouth again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl carefully looked at the boy’s body and suddenly sighed and said: “Don’t blame my mother’s heart, your body is strong, but still Can't resist the tearing of the void between the planes. If my heart is softer and your body pattern is not engraved, then you will be shattered by the storm in space one day in the endless drift. Mom knows that before you drift to the next site, you still don't know how long you have to endure. It doesn't matter, my mother will leave this hammer with creative power to you. When you can't stand the loneliness, you can try to make some Something came out to accompany you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man took the courage and asked: "Mom, why do I have to drift? The space storm is very cold!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl was silent for a moment, then slammed the locals and sighed: "If you don't, how can you escape the final trial?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mom can not accompany me? "Young sheepishly Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl shook her head and sighed quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound insulation enchantment of the small building seems to be only used to prevent the sound inside the building from leaking out, and the sound outside the building can still be introduced. The slaps of the dangling and the occasional dull pains intertwined, and the elves outside the window sang a low hymn. The combination of two completely discordant sounds inside and outside the building makes people feel an unspeakable sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Elf girl engraved the last line. She prayed silently for a moment and pulled out the nails nailed to the teenager's limbs. The wound left by the steel nails healed quickly without leaving a trace. However, the boy also seemed to run out of strength, lying on the red crystal stage, unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl put the platinum hammer in her hand on the juvenile's chest, reaching out in the air, the fibrillated fingertips touched, and there were countless water ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved her hands, and the young man’s body rose and floated to the piece of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t move and look at the Elf girl helplessly. His eyes were full of fear and embarrassment at first, but when half of his body had fallen into the water, he had already swept away, and only the attachment and disappointment left in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl suddenly stopped her mouth, and her life was sobbing in her throat, but her tears finally came out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youngster has no space in the water. The wave of water ripples is getting weaker and weaker and disappears quickly. In the empty hall, only the red crystal table was left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley, among the elves that rushed to and fro, there was a figure that walked leisurely, it was Hughes. It’s just that his sullen look is out of tune with the solemn atmosphere of the entire Elven Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses suddenly felt something, turned to look at the small building in the corner of the valley, but quickly walked to the small building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Hughes has already boarded the second floor of the small building. He saw the red-looking crystal table, the magical material that was scattered all over the place, and the elf girl who stood there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Effie!" Hughes reveals the color of surprise, saying: "How come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie quickly wiped away the tears in her eyes and turned to say: "Why, I am an elder, can't I come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes said: "Of course this is not. But you read the book of Hilo, I thought you could not come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie frowns : "It turns out to be like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
