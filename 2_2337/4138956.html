			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如一梦卷章一魇下魇<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cloudy weather in the world, only the heavens are brilliant . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramis is nearly a kilometer high in the temple. At this moment, there is a radiant reflection of the essence, which is particularly dazzling. They are so strong that hundreds of angels who sing hymns can't keep a neat formation and have to fly away to avoid these strong radiances that are enough to evaporate them completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheng Hui is like a sea rushing, and does not live in the temple. At this moment, the main hall of the Lord God is no longer the place where ordinary angels can accommodate. Only the light angels created by Tilatemis can stand calmly in this holy glow of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel has no feelings, and God should do the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the laws that bind ordinary gods and angels are not imposed on the shining gods. Angels who focus on escaping the sacred glory and carrying out the sacred priests don't know if the great Tiratemis is angry. They don't have enough time to sing God, so they can't understand what it is like anger. But they know that the emotions of the Lord God at this moment are not stable. This has been a very rare thing in the past millennium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple, the high-altitude Tilatemis can’t hold a strong sacred glow, it seems that he has completely changed A hot sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of him, there are two rows of light angels with golden wings, they stand quietly in the air, seemingly endless patience Waiting for one hand to create their Tiratmy's shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space in the middle of the temple suddenly experienced a wave of water fluctuations, and then four difficult to describe its radiant light beads floating out of space fluctuations. They are surrounded by each other. Flying slowly in the air, but no matter how you fly, the distance between the four beads will not change. The light beads form a virgin regular tetrahedral apex, the center of the regular tetrahedron, and there is a small group of glareous light flowing in the faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regular tetrahedron is only one meter square, which is insignificant in front of two rows of tall and majestic light angels, not to mention the Tiratt Compared with it. However, all the light angels are facing and retreating toward this imaginary tetrahedron. Tiratemis, who is high above, also moved. Slightly lean forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imaginary tetrahedron flashed a bit and appeared in front of Tiratemis. Then an invisible breath of invisibleness enveloped the entire temple. At this moment, the nothingness of the tetrahedron suddenly has the breath of existence. It is like an incomparably huge beast with one eye and an indifferent look at everything in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great Tiratemis, your troubles are not over, but are expanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;From a virtual tetrahedron, such a message. The power contained in this message is so powerful that the wings of all the light angels are involuntarily fluttering. It is like falling leaves in the wind. They had to retreat a certain distance before they stabilized their position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirathus said: "The great Setanistria, there will be no worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main god of battle, Setanistoria, did not really appear in front of Tiratemis. This imaginary tetrahedron is just one of his incarnations. The glory of belonging to the Lord God is too strong, so when the two main gods are too close, it is only the mutual radiance of the sacred Hui that may tear the space of the heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is an invisible wave that sweeps through all the light angels present, and then Setanistoria said: "The great Tiratemis, There is nothing wrong with the light angels you created. But are there other different angels who fight in the outer plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilat Sri Lanka replied indifferently: "All of the glare angels, only O'Reilly and Achilles are different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this happening? Everything in the light angels fighting in the outer planes should not be as good as your great knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiratims paused this time After a moment, I replied: "Until the last moment, there is nothing wrong with all the thoughts and actions of Achilles. The deepest part of his soul is as pure as ever. In fact, I still don't know. Where did he hide those rebellious thoughts and how they were retrieved at the last moment? And the final result came too suddenly, even Even I could not stop in time "<br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;At this time, a little red rose from the chest of Tirartemis. The two gods watched the bright red light and silenced for a moment. Tiratemis said: "You also saw it. Achilles. Si may know that I can't resist my recall. So he erased his mark at the last moment and became the source of energy. I don't know how he did it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setenistoria seems to be thinking for a moment. Slowly said: "Maybe he has left his memory there before. It seems that the plane is slightly sloppy, but it is enough trouble. It seems that we should look more at it. Kazis consumed too many sources of faith in that plane, and now neither my combat angel nor your light angel can come to a sufficient number. The only good news is that Achilles sent back Mike. Evidence of white fall, so that Frian Mill can't blame you for the time being. I am going to the dark world, I am afraid I can't help you more. But I will leave the thirteenth intellectual angel to completely solve the trouble of the plane. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirathus said: "Indeed, the trouble of that plane cannot continue to expand. If it attracts the attention of Desmasson, it is true." The trouble..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imaginary tetrahedron gradually fades, and the consciousness of Setanistoria still echoes in the temple: "Diss Mason only knows the destruction, let it know this Things are really not easy to deal with. The great Tiratemis, please give some attention to the slight position. After I came back from the dark world, I hope that there will be no change in the order of the heavenly power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absolute darkness, suddenly a little radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a glorious moment that tears the infinite darkness and ignites the whole world!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge snorted and suddenly sat up, only to find another nightmare. It’s just that the dreams he has made recently are very real, and the truth is that it is indistinguishable from reality. At this moment, he was sweating and his eyes were red and swollen. I couldn’t help but shed tears, just as I was stabbed by the brilliance of my dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his eyes. This restored vision. Beside Rogge, there is a pair of shining stars watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "Effie, nothing, I just had a nightmare."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently stroked Effie's smooth skin, and when the hand fell on her flat, firm belly, the fat man smiled slightly unnaturally. Road: "Effie, it seems that the elf is really a race that is not good at giving birth. You see, there is no point here that can grow up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effie said: "God makes the adults, and the human race is not strong enough to give birth to you. Obviously this is not all my reasons, certainly there are reasons for you. There is an old saying saying this Those who are too wicked will be punished by the gods, and they will lose the ability to have offspring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "Nonsense! I am Hilo God makes you say me like this. Hilo is disrespectful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie said again: "You want a child so, maybe find some fertility more. Try a strong race, maybe it will have an effect! Well, let me think about which races have the strongest fertility... Goblins, gnomes, orcs, ogre, certain demons, trolls, kobolds ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie’s crisp voice with a hint of power, she The name of a race. Rogge’s mind would involuntarily emerge the image of the race’s female, and each one was springing up and screaming at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face became more and more ugly, and he grabbed Effie’s mouth and pressed it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night passed, when the day came, the west bank of the Longines rose again. On this day, the sea was calm and numerous fishing boats sailed out to sea. No matter who the ruler becomes, the simple fishermen have to rely on fishing to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West Bank of the Longines has a vast territory and a large population. Race and faith customs are very complex. Although the Asrofik Empire occupied this area, it wanted to consolidate its rule. It also takes a considerable amount of time. At this time, tens of thousands of prisoners of war, under the threat of whip and guns, are cutting trees and building roads in the endless virgin forest day and night. Although dozens or even hundreds of prisoners of war died every day because of overwork, Feuerbach was still dissatisfied with the progress of the project. The generals under his opponent roared and asked them to find more hard work. To speed up the opening of this virgin forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asrofik Empire treated the inhabitants of the occupying powers with a cruel and ruthless reputation. Not long ago, Rogge held a bloody double flag when he was fighting in the Delaware Empire. Every city’s practice of massacre was deeply regrettable for the West Bank of the Longines. Since joining the Holy Church can get a chance to survive, those civilians will naturally not have too much hesitation. Later, even the residents of the whole city joined the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods are based on faith, this is the third page of the book of Hilo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s fashion does not believe that a large section of the words is just this meaning, just after reading this sentence, he suddenly said what is faith I understand a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the header of the third page, as usual, there is a saying: "The gods are not omnipotent, and Hilo is omnipotent."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that hundreds of thousands of Protestants who joined the Holy Church for their survival are not at all devoutly devout, and there are even many hatreds for the Empire. People exist. But the fat man is not so easy to be deceived. The purpose of his creation of the Holy Church is for the power of faith. Rather than the number of believers who are half-hearted. Therefore, the Virgin Mora led the Snow and Ice Master and began a city tour of a city. Under her eyes, those who are not only not convinced, but hateful are invisible. And these identified believers were handed over to the Emperor's team for treason. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the military law of the Asrovic Empire, after being convicted of treason, the man of the prime year was to be executed, and the wife and the daughter were accepted as camps. The child is sold as a slave. Here, these young men are not going to be executed for the time being. Instead, they were sent to the Southern Forest to do hard work. There, the harsh environment and heavy labor will usually take their lives in a month or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God shines on you, but you abuse it. In the face of Omni Rey, all lie will be like the shadow of the sun. "Nothing to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before thousands of people who were identified as dishonest, Rogge was solemn and sacred, and said in a majestic manner Some words. Then he ignored the crying, swearing or shouting of the believers. With a scepter of the scepter, thousands of empire-like imperial forces waiting to be on the side immediately swarmed and dragged these false believers down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s foothold is an unnamed small town. More than 30,000 inhabitants of the city have joined the Holy Church. However, in the subsequent grand religious ceremony, these believers could not Sustained by the radiance of the hands of Mora, is considered to be dishonest. What Rogge is doing now is just to stand for his own status as a pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time the Great stood on the west bank of the Longines. It has been a month passed. During this period of time, the above-mentioned scenes were repeated and repeated, and the number of hard work in the Kailin road in the south gradually changed from 20,000 to 150,000. But in this blood-stained years, Roger's sacred church believers developed rapidly, adding more than 500,000 new believers in a short period of time. As time goes by, the number of believers who join the church is increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty believes. There are realistic benefits in front of us, and there is a promise of the future in the distance, and there are blood-stained knives behind them. In this case, most people know how to choose. Except for a few people, those ordinary people who are ordinary people will not donate their lives for the royal family or the country. The fat man intends to recruit at least two million qualified believers in the West Bank of the Longines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His only regret is that only the Mora, who has a natural charm, among all the clergy in the church can turn an ordinary believer into a devout believer in an instant. However, the Holy Church has developed too fast. It is only the faith that stabilizes the most core believers, and it almost exhausts the energy of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has long been used to war and killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his position. People, believers, prisoners of war and dead and wounded. To some extent, it’s just a number of numbers. No matter how many hundred thousand or one million lives are fallen in the war, there is not much difference. The famous Feuerbach will not be able to put a million lives in the eyes. And the leading Alexander was in the Western Front. After many massacres of hundreds of thousands of prisoners of various ethnic groups, although Pompey was limited by the size of the Poseidon Corps, his hands were less blood-stained, but on the battlefield, his ruthlessness would never be worse than anyone else. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood has already dyed the West Bank of the Longines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he is free, Rogge always likes to walk alone by the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, the fat man walked alone on the reef's coastline as he used to. He looked up into the distance, the sky was gray, the sea was calm, and the cool sea breeze came. However, Rogge suddenly felt a dizzy stun in his head, his body swayed and almost fell off the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has long been accustomed to this, set his foothold and set his mind, and this will slowly stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his foothold is no longer the familiar Longines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the ground was dark red, and the waves in the sea turned into thick, thick blood. The sky is also red, and it seems to be red by the earth and the ocean. But looking closely, Rogge found that the flowing red in the sky is actually a burning flame!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is bleeding, the sky is burning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the distant horizon, there is a bright radiance rising. This scene is so familiar, Rogge immediately closed his eyes subconsciously!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A soft but hot wind gently stroked his face. The skin then has a stinging sensation, which is the tingling caused by the intense light that shines on his bare skin. Although Rogge had closed his eyes, the strong brilliance still penetrated his eyes, and he was dizzy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge had to turn his back and try to avoid this too strong light. But when he turned around, he was still as glaring. Every corner between heaven and earth seems to have been filled with blazing light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind that whizzes past has been suffocatingly hot, and from time to time there are strange sounds coming into Rogge. Although it is invisible, Rogge knows that the sky, the earth, the ocean, everything is burning at the moment!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is true, the illusion is only an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge forcibly opened his eyes despite the unbearable pains. Sure enough, the present is still the lead gray sky, the dark reef, the quiet sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled, the hallucination is the hallucination, it can only suppress those who are not strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there seems to be something falling in front of his eyes. Rogge reached out and took a closer look, his face changed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his palm, it’s a hair that has been burned to gray! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea breeze immediately swept away the few fly ash with almost no weight. Rogge raised his hand on his head and immediately felt a burnt hair on his fingertips. He only felt that a chill came slowly from the bottom of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the illusion just now, or is everything in front of it an illusion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and slowly looked around for a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the scenes reflected in Rogge’s eyes seem to be somewhat different. But Rogge knows that the world is no different from the past. The difference is his own. There are already some unclear changes that have quietly happened to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether in the beautiful city of the gods, the cold but artistic art of Richelieu, or the Longines coast full of gold coins, Xiusi The room is always simple, elegant and clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roger was alone at the beach, Hughes didn’t know where to get a whole set of exquisite tea sets, he was cooking himself, ready to enjoy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment, the boiling water from the hot water bottle does not scatter, which is quite different from ordinary steam. In the middle of the turbulent water vapor, there is a long table with six mysterious figures in dark gray robes sitting on either side of the table. One of them stood up and bowed to the side of Xiusi. He respectfully said: "The omniscient shadow of nothingness, this time is a big thing, so I have to disturb your peace."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is hoarse and with a metallic rubbing sense. Once you hear it, you know that it is a false sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes snorted and said, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
