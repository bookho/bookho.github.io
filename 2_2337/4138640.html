			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred Liege. Otta Rivers has been in the Rhine School of Magic for four years, and his talent is still smart, there are two more In the year, I can walk out of this magic school and become a formal magician.In this turbulent age, the magician is very popular because of the well-known destructive power.At the same time, due to the weakness of the equally well-known magician, poor physical strength and long curse, the protection of the magician in the war became the first problem to be considered.Even so, even if it is a big six, it is still difficult to completely avoid the casualties of the Master.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastering magic requires talent, and it takes a long time to become a qualified magicianThis also makes the number of magicians on the Big 6 quite rare. Correspondingly, the status of the magician is much higher.At the same time, most senior mages are also very wealthy characters, because all kinds of gems, magic silver, black iron magic materials are worth a lot of money.Advanced magical props often make it possible to cross-level battles between wizardsIt has been said that the magician’s mana is directly proportional to his wealth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s father, Viscount Rivers, is a lower-level aristocrat of the Rhine-City League. The fief is just a small town and several surrounding villages. Thousand peopleIn any case, as a nobleman with a fiefdom, Rogge is still qualified to put Ota in the middle of the name, a symbol of the lower hereditary nobility of the Rhine Union.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Big 6 is very strange, basically there is a name in a country.In recent years, with the rise of the Holy Church and the expansion of the right to teach, the countries gradually accepted the name of Gloria as the Big 6, meaning the hymn of God.The Rhine Union is located in the southeast corner of the Big Six. It is a combination of more than ten large and small Principalities. Compared with the Big Six Powers, Dro, Austro-Hungarian, and Astrofico, the national power can only be regarded as a second-rate country.However, the ratio is insufficient, more than enoughThe king of the Confederate Louis XIV in front of the remaining thirty small countries, especially the neighboring Ron Principality, Kedo City State, will often show off the forceHowever, the King’s interest in art, beauty and immortality is far greater than that of the opening of the territory. During the ten years of his reign, he spent most of his time with neighboring countries.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compatible with the status of the Rhine Union, the Rhine School of Magic is a second-class secondary school in the Big Six, located in the northern part of the Rhineland LeagueThe teaching style is better than the level, which directly leads to more than 300 years of school history.Because of the need of magicians in various countries, the School of Magic is often the most equal place on the 6th hierarchical system. At least there is no such thing as a civilian magic apprentice being killed by aristocrats.And the civilian students who often graduate successfully, after a period of experience, also have a great chance to become aristocrats.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s family is a bit degraded, with only four servants in the family, which is embarrassing for a sealed aristocratOld Rivers has no financial skills other than temper, and income is still decreasing year by year.However, this does not prevent Rogge from learning all the bad habits that nobles should have, arrogance, arrogance, lust, temper, and insidious blackmail that ordinary nobles do not have.In the 14th year, when Rogge became a man for the first time in his family, the more he made the little territoriesOld Rivers had to send Rogge to the magic school a year later, which consumed only a few pieces of ancestral jewelry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog does not expect the father to give him any more funding, he needs money for the usual play.So * sweet mouth, Ba Jie got a middle-level mage in the college, Fiss, managed the magic laboratory for him, and did some work that Faith did not work.At this time, Rogge is studying a bead in front of the inexplicable magical laboratory.The beads are dull, pale, with a few cracks on them, which don't look like valuables.The only thing that makes a difference is that there is a faint white and black radiance in the beads.Rogge’s eyes widened and carefully estimated the value of the bead, but he never thought that the bead was studying him.Suddenly the beads cracked, and the black gas went straight to Rogge’s forehead and fell into the brain.Rogge is like a mollusk, creeping up.From time to time, a piece is bulging here, where a piece is trapped, and black blood is ejected from the skin from time to time.Finally, Rogge slowly opened his eyes, his eyes were pale, and a low-pitched laugh sounded: "The soul of this soul is not bad.Rogge looked at the fragments of the Fazhu on the ground. At this moment, the white gas struggled to fly out, but said nothing could fly too far away from the beads.Rogge’s eyes brightened, and the fragments of white gas and the bead were also sucked into the forehead, and a scream of the sacred voice was heard in the lab.Rogge’s body is like boiled water, and it will only calm down for a long time.When I open my eyes again, I have already recovered to the appearance of ordinary people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gas is the soul of Rodriguez, using the artifact soul beads to isolate the power of all souls, he successfully escaped the light of judgment, and I have escaped the tracking of the heavensHowever, the power of the light of judgment cannot be countered. The so-called artifact cannot naturally be compared with the power of true God.Moreover, the light of judgment is moved by the heavenly gods to destroy the evil that is too powerful in the world.After the World War I, the Soul of the Gods has exhausted all power.The Necromancer did not destroy Rogge’s soul, but chose fusion and inherited all Rogge’s character.Due to the limited energy of the Soul Method, and most of it is used to ban the soul of Wella, the Necromancer only chooses to bring in the knowledge of the origin of the magic when he merges the soul, and gives up the huge specific spell knowledge.At this time, Wella’s soul has only left a core energy, which is called the source of God’s origin, and all its consciousness has long since vanished.This little source of God has also been brought into the soul.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
