			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Heaven in Hell for Eighteen Heavens<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, when Rogge stepped in When the Emperor's study was discovered, it was discovered that almost all the dignitaries of the empire had already stood in the study. When the fat man saw this battle, he immediately quietly stood in the darkest corner of the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach’s study is not big, and after crowding more than 20 ministers, the present is quite crowded. You are crowded with the power of the crowd, I squeeze you, barely stand out from the appearance of the two factions. They are also reluctant to show such obvious gangs in front of the emperor, but at this moment Straw and Pompey, Alexander and others have become a fire, and the ministers of the Empire have almost chosen to stand on one side. At this moment, this place in the study room, crowded in the hostile faction pile, always makes people feel uncomfortable. Only those ministers who have suffered from the position and neutrality are not on either side, but if they are standing in the middle, it is opposite to the emperor, and it is a disrespectful act according to the imperial law. Anxiously a few people turned around in the room, sweating like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a mess in the study, and Feuerbach’s emperor leaned back on the back of his chair, his eyes half-closed. It seems that it was too early to start, he still did not fully wake up. Behind him, the boss is also a sleepy look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know why, Rogge suddenly felt a strong taste from the boss. This is a taste that can't be said, the taste of the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ministers push each other, the fire is getting bigger. After the bloody night, everyone knows that the last warmth of the veil between the two factions has been torn away. From then on, there will be endless attacks, framing and assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strao and Pompey, Alexander, these people naturally want to maintain a graceful image. But the officials under their command are pushing themselves to compete. In this respect, because Pompey has a large number of military commanders, everyone’s martial arts far exceeds the civil servants of Straw’s faction, so they have the upper hand in the infighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach’s eyes suddenly shouted like a lion roaring: “Everything is enough!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence in the study room. The ministers who had just struggled to sneak up were still stunned at the moment, and even had a glance at the great anger of the great emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several elders who are qualified to be old enough to suddenly save. When Emperor Feuerbach was young, he used to be called the "Dagger Emperor" in order to consolidate the murder of the emperor. In the past few years, the emperor has grown older. The bravery and enthusiasm of the young have been increasingly gone with the years, and the ministers have gradually forgotten the bloody means of the great emperor. At the moment, with the roar of Feuerbach, the former majesty reappeared in an instant, and the ministers only shook with trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You all have the ability," the emperor's tone eased a bit, but the chill of the group's heart was only stronger. "You played very well yesterday night." Even the army has been mobilized. Very good, very good! I have watched a wonderful street fighting in the Imperial Palace. I have to say that your commanding art and resilience are very clever and completely worthy of the empire. The title of the best soldier!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great looked at the quiet ministers and suddenly asked gently: "This kind of fierce and fierce street fighting happened in the Imperial Capital. , can anyone tell me what it means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a quiet in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great will look around. Suddenly a thunderous roar: "This means rebellion! I haven't died yet, can you wait?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of statement has Who dares to pick up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor looked a little too excited, coughing for a long time, an unhealthy blush on his face, this said: "Okay. About last night, I Now I want to hear your explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Prime Minister Straw’s most ruling power, by convention, should be his first speech. At the moment, he is also welcome, step forward, Shen Sheng said: "Your Majesty, it was supposed to be a peaceful night last night. But in the middle of the night, I suddenly got a message, someone was daring to assassinate the city defense commander General Riddle! My first thought was that someone wanted to rebel..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Straw opened his mouth, he never stopped. He knew that the Emperor was not energetic, and other people could not interrupt his speech. Therefore, he said one more minute. Pompey’s time for defending himself was one minute less. It seems that if no one interrupts him, Straw It is prepared to sue for a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have done it!" The emperor finally couldn't stand it, interrupting Straw's endless long story: "Pang Pei, Alexander, you are coming too Talk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey and Alexander are full of military style, speaking many times more than Straw. However, the sharpness of their resignation is not in Straw. In the words, Riddle is not only stabbed as a conspiracy of Straw, but also accused him of mobilizing the army privately and storing a large number of warriors in the Prime Minister’s Office. Just want to rebel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it’s time for the powers to comment on the dispute last night. Since the two faction leaders have opened the door to attack each other, these followers are naturally unable to idle. Everyone has added fuel and vinegar, and they testify against each other. The ministers who stand neutrally have racked their brains. On the one hand, they should say what they know as objectively and truthfully as possible, lest they be misunderstood by the great emperor as a mediocrity, and on the other hand they cannot offend either side. Most people who remain neutral when the factional struggle is almost white is mostly to make choices when the situation is clear, so as not to choose too early, and choose the wrong direction to recruit themselves to kill themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Rogge was able to stand in the study, he was among the most powerful ministers of the empire, but compared with other people, whether it is history or connections. Still a force, he is not as good as it is. Therefore, he was happy to hide in the corner, and the audience members of the audience were quietly screaming in the smile. Trying to put the opponent to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Rogge finally had a new understanding of the political situation of the Empire. Although the North Warriors are straightforward and rough, the political undercurrent of the Great Emperor is no worse than those of the Southern Powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of where the attack originated, the final focus will definitely fall on the recent major mistakes of the other faction. The Straws took the seal of the Abyss and the seal of the Abyss was broken, and the Poseidon and Alexander factions accused Strau and Druid of their great merits and did not understand the military. However, the Great Emperor went out to the dark forest, and Druid, who had the title of King of the Jungle, did not play any role in the dark forest. Eventually led to the loss of the army. From the perspective of the war process, even if Druid and Straw are not conspiracy, they must at least bear a sinful incompetent charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Snapped! Feuerbach had taken a few tables in succession, which put the quarrel down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze slowly swept through the three of Alexander, Pompey and Straw. The three powers are all a glimpse of the courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough! I have heard enough of this quarrel!" The Emperor didn't have a big voice this time, but anyone can hear him. Wrath: "Everything happened last night has exceeded the limit of my patience. Now is the time to break the dispute between you. Straw!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The imperial prime minister was shocked. But still a bit on the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great looked coldly at the veteran who had followed him for more than 20 years and said: "Don't you always say that Pompey's gate to the abyss is weak? Well, from now on, your Hutu warriors will replace the Poseidon Corps in the gates of the abyss, and you will be handed over within half a month. Within half a year, I will see that the seal of the Abyss Gate is completely reinforced, ensuring no The same problem arises again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straum was shocked, but his face was still quiet and he took the order of the Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander and Pompey looked at each other. They did not think that the problem in their hands was actually handed over to Straw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the seal of the Abyss is extremely fragile and can collapse at any time. And behind the gates of the abyss, I don’t know that there are abyss creatures that are less powerful and scary. The last time Roses spiders appeared, and if the seals were destroyed again, maybe even the legendary Nalakaks would appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of prevention, Alexander returned to the Emperor this time with a total of 30,000 troops and 50,000 dwarf slaves. He left 20,000 troops and 40,000 slaves in the abyss to help the heavily damaged Poseidon Corps stay there. If there is no help from the Glacier Legion. If the seal breaks again, the remaining Poseidon Corps may not be able to withstand the impact of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
