			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon sun shines through the dense forest and shines on the grass. In the center of the grass, there are a lot of rocks, and three young two-legged dragons nearly one meter long are sleeping in the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula has a loud noise and awakened the three little dragons. They excitedly climbed to the side of the rock pile, hooked the stone with the claws on the wings, tried to stretch the neck and opened the mouth with a half foot length. Although young, but a sharp tooth from the birth of the birth is still chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A four-foot-long adult Wyvern flying through the woods, a pair of powerful and powerful hind paws holding a fat Wild boar. It circled the stone pile and threw the wild boar. The three little flying dragons immediately rushed up and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adult Wyvern is hovering for two more laps. It always feels that the number of small dragons is less. It suddenly sees a young biped lying next to the rock pile. Flying dragon. The neck of Xiaofeilong was cut open and the blue blood flowed to the ground. The adult two-legged dragon sighed and fell on the ground. It sniffed the surrounding ground carefully, suddenly screaming at the sky, screaming screamingly, and the screams echoed throughout the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short while, the vibrating sound kept ringing, and one after another flying dragons flew from everywhere. They sniffed for a long time on the side of the dead little Wyvern, and they went to the sky and flew away. The adult Wyvern was screaming screaming until the last two-legged dragon flew away, and it rose in the air, hovering in the air for a week, and chose to fly in one direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the small bipedal dragons that have not been opened by the three eyes have already smashed most of the wild boars, retracted the pile of stones, and prepared to sleep beautifully. I feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the forest, the two figures moved very agilely between the forests. They hold a long green sword, and from time to time they stop to look at the surrounding environment and the ground before moving on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older one came to a big tree and carefully observed the thick trunk, and finally he found a scratch that was unknowingly. He looked at the ground around the big tree and closed his eyes and sniffed in the air for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another young man came over and whispered: John, what is it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old John opened his eyes, you are still so anxious! This is not a performance of a jungle parade!" The ground to the left front should just leave in this direction. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fass hurriedly engraved a few magical attachments on a large tree on the side, then put his hand up and began to mutter. The green light came out of his hand, wrapped around a few rounds, and fell into the trunk. The magic symbols also lit up and disappeared into the trunk after a while.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashion clap his hands and smugly said: "Old John, look, my spell is faster? In fact, a ten-level magician deserves such caution? In the forest, who is the opponent of our jungle parade? The name of my god Arrows is not white, waiting for us to catch up with him, let him try the taste of my seven snake arrows. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old John frowns, don't you feel it? These days, the forest is not very calm, the wind is blowing a violent breath. Especially now, this breath seems to be getting stronger! Let's be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashhaha smiles in the forest, even if there is any history Warcraft, with our two 12-level jungle parade, can't you still run? Ok, don't talk nonsense. Hurry up and chase, get rid of this task early. Two hundred gold coins, enough for us to live a comfortable life for three years! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, a drop of small drops descended from the sky and fell on the neck of Fass. He didn't care, wiped it off. In the first place, Fass saw Old John staring intently at his neck. He asked strangely: John, what happened to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old John said a word No, I glanced up and quickly climbed the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fasm is strange, he suddenly appears to be blue in his hand! He put his hand close to the nose, sniffed the smell, and exclaimed: "It's a two-legged dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old John has jumped down and carried a The body of the young Wyvern, the face of the dragon. He hurriedly said: "Flee! This is a trap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of this young two-legged dragon is just right here. Besides who is the fat pig, who is so wicked? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fass groaned in his mouth, but he didn’t dare to stop at the foot, and quickly followed Old John to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gale came from behind the two! The jungle patrol's responsiveness is well-known, and the two are rushing to the sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cry, a huge bipedal dragon with a length of five meters is almost past the ground, and the powerful two hind paws are plowed on the ground. Two deep ditches, the stench in the mouth made the heads of the two slightly dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fascue turned over half a squat, throwing a long sword in his hand, picking a bow and taking an arrow, and three arrows are shot in the blink of an eye! The two-legged dragon is too large to dodge, and the three arrows are shot solidly on its left wing. At the middle of the arrow, there was a chill, and a piece of ice was formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fass knows that this short-tailed dragon is highly toxic, and the anti-virulence of the poisonous things is inevitably weak, so he did not come up with his own pride. The arrow of the seven snakes came, but instead used the ice arrow, hoping to reduce the action of this huge but very agile Warcraft. The result was a hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon flew a few wings and finally slammed it on the ground. Old John saw the machine, swiftly rushed, and a sword stabbed the back neck of the Wyvern. The Wyvern's turn is a bite of lightning! A one-and-a-half-and-a-half-throw giant bite the old John's long sword and lifted his head and threw him away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black long arrow hits again, this time nailing one eye of the Wyvern. It was extremely painful, and then a scream rang out in the distance and quickly approached here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a two-legged dragon group!” Old John’s face changed. The two-legged dragon was still struggling with a slap in the face. He pulled out a short sword and slammed it on the side. He shouted: "Fas! You are going away! Remember to take care of Mary and Xiaolan for me. Nie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fass hesitated, this moment of the two-footed dragon in the dragon, the old John a sword, but also bit his left arm. Huge mouth, in the scream of the old John, it hard to bite an arm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashion has tears in his eyes, grit his teeth, and sprinkles a gray powder that can cover his breath and quickly disappear into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a cliff, there is a small shed, which is nicely disguised by leaves and vines. There is a small fire pit in the center of the shed. The burning in the pit is obviously a magical flame, without a trace of smoke. There was a stone pot on the fire, and a pot of dark purple liquid was cooked. From time to time, a few mushrooms were turned up. Rogge sat in front of the can, carefully holding the four venomous glands of blue-stained Wyvern. He did not dare to squeeze directly, but instead took the psychic force to pierce a few small holes, and dropped a drop of blue and black poison into the can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four venom glands were taken from the young short-tailed dragon. The younger the short-tailed dragon, the stronger the toxicity. This allows the fertility of the bipedal dragons to have a greater chance of surviving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silently counts the time, puts a dozen feet of wood, and puts a finger-thick wooden arrow into the can. When the sun is setting, these wooden arrows are good, and the whole body becomes dark blue. He took the wooden arrows out with great care and lined them up. The silver light in Rogge's eyes was getting brighter and brighter, and the wooden arrows floated in the air, and then the wood powder fell like rain. One tiny magic symbol was engraved on the arrow by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a word in his mouth, a bright red light flashed through, and these wooden arrows turned into strange bright purple, falling on the ground. Three arrows burst into a cloud of wood in the air. Rogge counted a total of eleven magic arrows. In any case, he is also a rumored disciple of Faith, and the technique of refining some basic magical equipment is still a pass. The recipe for refining poisons learned from Froya is also very useful. No, it is used now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venom of the Wyvern can directly act on the victim's heart, allowing it to stop beating in an instant. And those flying star mushrooms can neutralize the role of divine mana. That is to say, the effect of detoxification magic will be greatly weakened, unless it is directly drunk. Finally, the small wooden arrow is attached with three magics of penetrating enchantment, adding and tracking. It is a pity that the material of the wooden arrow itself is not good and the lethality is not strong. Fortunately, these arrows can be fatal as long as they pierce a little skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately smiled bitterly, and he escaped. It is impossible to say that the hammer of the god of war is not involved. I only hope that the brothers and sisters will be flexible in their wrists, and they will draw a clear line with themselves and get rid of trouble at an early date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However," Rogge thought arrogantly. "With Lao Tzu's ability, where is not the black crow like a fish, the profiteers of the world are almost the same." As long as you escape the chasing and killing of the rabbits, the old man is a hero! Waiting for Laozi’s rich and powerful hatred is not to be reported! This hatred...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, who had a strong spirit, suddenly remembered the pope and couldn’t help but fight a cold war. He knew in his heart that with the unfathomable strength of the Pope, he was not expected to be able to defeat him in his life. I don't know if Rodriguez is a single-handed pope. Is the result a win or a loss? However, this Necromancer did not have the opportunity to single out with the Pope, but fled for four hundred years under the chase of the church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that personal strength is one thing. If you want to count on the church, it is essential that someone has money. Rogge thought evilly. He has long vowed to kill all the church people. If the insidious villain comes up, the kind of persistence is quite strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out of this temporary hiding shed and looked at the distant forests of a dozen of flying dragons that were constantly flying and swooping down, and smiled. Who are you, and get into such a large group of two-legged dragons, I think there is nothing to end up with? But this falling dog still has to fight. Now Rogge lacks equipment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of the two-legged dragon quickly subsided, and more than ten flying dragons began to fly to the nest. Rogge frowned, and he worked hard on his own. Didn't he pursue the chasing of the squad? Even the leader of the chaser who is more than a dozen people is not so bad. It’s hard to rely on these two-legged flying dragons, but his men will definitely hurt a lot. But what is going on now? It seems that the two-legged dragons easily killed the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge puts away the magic arrow and quietly hides it from the battlefield that has just calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under an old tree, Fass was sitting on the ground and gasping with a big mouth. He carefully unveiled his shirt, and a half-foot-length, deep wound was revealed. Fas found out that the wound was applied to the wound and drank a bottle of antidote. After doing this, he was already sore and sweaty, and his body was weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered cursedly, under normal circumstances, how is a two-legged dragon a rival to his high-level jungle parade? If it wasn't for the emperor's escape, he wouldn't be caught by a two-legged dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just finished the wound, and he couldn’t help but hit a light gray magic ball in the bush. A sense of paralysis spread quickly throughout his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fas is very calm, he is also a veteran, knowing that this numbness will not be too long under his high magic resistance, but he still pretends A panicked look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a fat man across the tree walked over and it was exactly the same time he followed Rogge. However, what Fasch did not think was that Rogge’s experience in the jungle was not too bad, and the things he did were not in touch with the aristocracy’s restraint and elegance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pulled out a vine and quickly tied Fas to a solid one. Then he tied his feet and hung it upside down on the tree, so that his head was about one meter away from the ground, just as it was convenient for Rogge to sit down and comfortably ask questions. After doing this, Rogge leaned against the tree and pulled out a rough handkerchief aimed at Fas. Although the handle was broken, the short arrow that shined with purple and black light on it made Fass shudder. He smelled a familiar taste...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two-legged dragons are yours! You are a despicable pig! You put old John Do you know if you die?" Fass was very angry and his face rose red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogger picked up a tree vine and slammed it between the legs of Fas, only once, let him no sound, even Can't suck in. Rogge once again raised the tree vines high, scaring Fas's face purple, and screaming for mercy. Rogge didn't even hear it, and it was a whip again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! He took a dozen or so whip in succession, and then stopped to catch his breath, and the grievances accumulated over the past few days have dissipated a lot. Looking at the Fas, it was already fainting, and there was a bloody flesh between the legs, but Rogge carefully avoided his important guy. Keeping this thing, you can still give hope to this Fas, lest he be bent on death, but can't ask for anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now are you calm down? Just these are just appetizing little desserts. The dinner has not yet begun!" Rogge smiled and looked at Fas, with his cane in his hand licking his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You demon! You are not a nobleman at all! Not a knight! Despicable! Tell you, I am a senior member of the 'Green Brothers'! Many people in the Brotherhood know me! If you kill me, you will be tens of thousands of jungle parade, rangers and even Druids! I advise you to let me go, so that in case you I was caught by the church in the future, I can help you find a love, and spare you a life!" Fass said, and some arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled, and it was a whip in the wound of Fass, and Fass immediately screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My patience is not good, so you better answer my question honestly. No matter what arrow or fairy bow you used to be, now it’s just an upside down Male. Maybe I will be the next time, the guy who smashed you is not necessarily. At that time, even if I let you go, you have no chance in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You devil said..." In the face of Rogge's arrogance, Fass still yielded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good! I said earlier, so I don't have to suffer so much, are you? Now let me tell you how you relate to me." The message is passed to the rear of the big team? Don't play any tricks!" Rogge intends to dance the whip in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fascue fascinated the magic and information content of the communication with the rear. During the period, he still fainted twice, and was awakened by Rogge with ice water. In some detail, Rog repeatedly questioned, and often jumped back to the beginning, let Fas re-narrative. It was not until seven or eight times that the details were completely correct, and Rogge was relieved of Fas's confession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also asked a very interesting thing from the mouth of Fas, that is, it seems that chasing himself is not the only purpose of the church. According to this Fass, another task of the pursuers is related to the elves hidden in the Central Mountains. What is the specific content of this task is not what the young person of Fas can know. Fas only knows that Chrisma has an ancient parchment in the hands of the elves that are hidden in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly realized. It is no wonder that the Doomsday Judiciary will actually dispatch two of the Big Three to hunt down this insignificant little person. It turned out to be another purpose. Rogge smiled coldly and thought gloomyly: "Although I can't clean you up, I still have the ability to make you bad and tear your legs! Let's walk!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge asked in detail about the strength, number, occupation and rank of the pursuers, which ended the torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge put Fass down, but he smashed his magical leather armor and all weapons, reels and potions. Fass, who was seriously injured, was very skeptical that he could not walk out of the forest alive. But at this moment, it’s hard to keep your life, but you can still care so much? It is better to leave this demon as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He barely walked out a dozen steps, suddenly heard the sound of a bowing sound behind the back, then the vest slightly hurt, the wound immediately numb. "Despicable! You promised to let me go..." He wanted to shout, but the voice stopped in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fass fell down and twitched twice, and did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just counted to fifteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man nodded and was very satisfied with the power of these poison arrows. Fifteen seconds to death! Unless the arrower immediately drank the magic antidote, otherwise, a little hesitation is sure to die! Having said that, I heard that there are still many bright Masters in the ranks of the pursuers. When they are now detoxifying magic, it is estimated that the Chinese arrow is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community of the two-legged dragons has to be used. It is a pity to leave this powerful and simple-minded Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Kara Yang, this hunt has suddenly become less successful. Rogge’s apparently after-seekers are already close, significantly speeding up the escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two days, Kara Yang led the team to level a village of a goblin, met two wolves and struck a swamp. . Three knights and one law enforcement have already been wounded, and one of the knights is still in heavier. Kara Yang has no way, there is no light master around him, and his primary recovery spell will not play any role in such a serious injury. He had to send a knight to escort the wounded back to the brigade led by Chrisma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kara Yang is well aware of the power of the five ‘Seven Snake Arrows’ of Fass. This kind of arrow not only has a toxin that can constantly erode the magic power, but also attaches a curse effect, which can greatly reduce the magician's casting success rate. It is simply the nemesis of the magician. Because of this, the Green Brotherhood will send Fas to participate in this pursuit. Roger could still escape with an arrow, which made Kara Yang could not help but use Fas and Old John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day without news, Kara Yang finally gratified to see the "Tianjing Roulette" finally showed the light point representing Rogge. He is actually less than 50 kilometers ahead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang was overjoyed and immediately led the remaining three knights, five law enforcers and a jungle parade to chase. However, in places he could not see, the two knights he sent back had forever become corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the way to gallop for more than an hour, Kara Yang has been less than ten kilometers from Rogge. At such a close distance, the specific position of Rogge has not been displayed on the wheel of the heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the horses under the karaoke seat suddenly grow up and stand up! Fortunately, Kara Yang's martial arts is extremely high, and his hands are slightly increased, and the horses are easily pressed down. However, the riding of his law enforcement officers was a little worse. There were two unprepared defenses and they fell off the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the horses are extremely uneasy, constantly screaming, desperately trying to run back. The jungle parade suddenly screamed: "Not good! We broke into the territory of the Wyvern!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are constantly beating in the woods and fluttering The voice, a screaming tweet echoed around. The jungle parade began to look white and cried: "It's finished! This is not a small community. It seems that there are at least forty feet of dragons!" After the words were not finished, the figure flashed in front of him, and then he smashed a heavy one. Slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang is advancing like a wind, and everyone in the room can't see how he returned to the battle immediately after he finished his slap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang is a cold-footed dragon, what is the history of Warcraft! There is me, the angel of the palm of the palm, here, how many two-legged dragons will become my soul under the sword! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said, he pulled the sword in his hand and whispered a curse. For a moment, his sword had a milky white light. Kara Yang lifted a sword. Was, with him as the center, the milky white light scattered to all sides. All the subordinates had a slight white light, and the strength and agility increased a lot. As an angel of advent, Kara Yang’s stunt 'group blessing' power Full of squad, the group warfare is very practical.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky flies over a shadow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hurricane blows After, a huge bipedal dragon swooped down. Kara Yang screamed, and the milky white temper was rolling like a real thing. He rose to the sky, a long sword waved, a half-moon-shaped sword light flew out, greeted the two feet. The dragon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kara Yang and the two-legged dragon are staggered in the air, and his backhand is a sword! Everyone only feels suddenly bright, just like a lightning flash out of thin air. I can’t see what happened again for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; The two-legged dragon swayed in the air, suddenly divided into four pieces, blue blood scattered all over the sky!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A star-shaped blue bloodball, Kara Yang vindictive Shining, slowly descending from the sky. The sword on the tip of the sword has flashed from time to time, and the sound of the sound is loud.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Kara Yang is so god-like, the subordinates Their courage immediately increased. At this time, the two-legged dragons continued to attack, and the scene gradually became chaotic. Kara Yang’s sword was designed to stand up and boost morale. Now he is surrounded by four or five double-footed dragons, although He continually stabbed his opponents, but he couldn’t kill them quickly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Knights and the law enforcers were also long-lived and gathered together to form a The small square array. The jungle parade is standing in the center of the array, and an arrow hits the key to the two-legged dragon. These people cooperate with each other and steadily defend under the attack of more than ten bipeds. The adults solve the battle and come over to help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Sen The shape is like hell, stinking and screaming, and whistling again and again!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feet of the dragons fly or flutter, or jump, one foot long and one foot The blue mouth rushed through the invaders.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
