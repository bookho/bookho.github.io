			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the eleventh look at the countryside<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the room does not look the slightest Different, but Rogge knows that one person has entered the room. The intruder uses an unknown ability, that is, non-invisible magic, nor is it the hidden power of the killer's specialization. It seems to be a kind of invisible ability of Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the strength of Rogge’s entire room, the intruder couldn’t escape the fat of the fat no matter which stealth method he used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly laughed: "I don’t say hello when I come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound of the unspoken, the fat man who has never looked up is placed in the left hand under the table and flashed out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point in his hand, there is already a magic blade made up of shadows. Although the magic weapon of the sixth-order magic 'Cass' claws' is far less than the eighth-order Mill's Blade, the power still exceeds the average fine magic weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-meter-long shadow blade cuts the heavy desk silently, sweeping through the intruder's waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a scream that is not expected in Roger’s ear, but an exclamation, and the exclamation sounds very familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sees people coming, his face looks extremely bad: "Elders of Xius! Are you busy with your big things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s not easy to deal with it! If it’s not going back in time, the consequences are simply unimaginable. Fortunately, my old man’s age is very big, the action is still very light, and it’s still timely and not delayed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man snorted and his face was even more ugly. In the dark forest, he can be said to be born and died, stealing keel grass, winning the dragon skull, and smashing the moonlight dragon city several things one by one. Now that all the dust has settled, this old thing has just come out, but it’s still a good idea to say what is coming back in time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not ask why Xiusi suddenly left for what was big. If the old fox doesn't want to say it, then he asks no use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes took a chair and sat down opposite Rogge. He has not had Zhang Huang and Wolverine some time ago, and he has always been calm and calm. It was only a half-length crack in the waist of Xiu Si's light blue robes that undermined his glorious image of being calm and always in control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rip is naturally left by the 'claws of Casas'. Although Hughes just walked into the room with greatness, Rogge somehow. In the perception, the position of the Xiusi was judged to be nearly one meter ahead! Therefore, the fat man thought that he could break the sword of the intruder and cut off the robes of Xiusi. In fact, even this gap. It is also the intention of Hughes to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Rogge simply stares at the door, he can directly see that Hughes comes in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat brows wrinkled, simply ignore the repairs, just thinking about the scene just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mediocrity deceives the eyes, the strong deceives the perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment of Rogge is like having just boarded a mountain. He thought he could look down on the earth, but he found it when he looked around. In the distance, the vast mountains are still in the distance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that he had a deep understanding of the soul world and he was confident in his own manipulation of the soul. But what happened to Ramfield shattered his blind confidence in ‘erosion’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that his spiritual search was everywhere, and even the strongest in the sanctuary could not escape his perception. But tonight, the subtle bias in perception has actually made him fall into the trap of his opponent. If the comer is not a Hughes, but a malicious killer, then at the moment when 'Cass's claws' fell into the open space, Rogge was already in the position of letting the opponent slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly remembered that when Hughes erased the power of 'erosion'. His ‘erosion’ is still at the initial stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rogge’s cognition of this new world is still blank, he still doesn’t even know how to get started, but he doesn’t worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly smiled at Hughes, smiled softly and smiled. Laughing Shusius was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate of the mountains is always colder than the plains. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the late autumn season of the North, despite the bright blue sky, the bright and warm sunshine kept soothing the earth, but the wind in the Central Mountains still began to shine. It’s chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of a cliff in the Central Mountain Range, a waterfall is rushing down from the top of the cliff and into the pool at the bottom of the cliff. In the bright sunshine, there are seven colors of rainbow in the rising water mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a beautiful elf sitting on the edge of the pool. Suddenly a breeze rolled up a faint mist of water and rushed in, wrapping her in lightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is chilly, and this group of water mist increases the chill of the late autumn. Her long, beautiful ears couldn't help but tremble slightly because of the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is in a cold pool of water. Although there was no trace of smudges on the snow-covered hands. She still washed carefully for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind swayed her long blond hair. Together with the surrounding environment, it forms a beautiful picture. The golden sun adds a touch of warmth to the picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another gust of wind, and the chill in the wind once again made the elf tremble. She took off the magical long bow on her back. Gently stroking by hand, it seems a little hesitant. This magic longbow is not the ordinary long-bow arch of the elf, but the bow of the Elf King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf King's bow has been swayed in the hands of Raphael and the wind butterfly, and now it is in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the elf hated to look deep into the depths of the Central Mountain Range, jumped up and ran to the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a night at night, and the dawn is often when people are least at the least. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excavation of the kings in the mountainside seems to be endless. Every time the three kings dig out the ground, they will see a large number of elf archers and wizard wizards waiting outside the cave. There seems to be an invisible eye that keeps the king's every move in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how hard the three kings work. It is also impossible to detect what methods the opponent has used in order to be able to act in depth in the underground. But hard fight is certainly not a wise move, so every time, the kings silently return to the ground, let the wizard wizard use magic to destroy the exit to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the mountain, the recovery of death power is very slow, in order not to waste a bit of power. The three kings no longer summon any servants, and they completely dig the tunnel underground. It didn't take long. The kings found that even then, the consumption of death power exceeded the speed of recovery. Therefore, the Lich Elgarh no longer digs, but instead uses the magic of slow recovery to bless the Emperor and the Black Warrior. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the three kings calculate their own strength in the dark underground rock formations, such as the most sinister miser, and constantly excavate The road to sunshine and freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn is finally here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bright sun, the blue sky and the distant mountains reappear in front of the three kings. They were surprised to find that they only stood in front of a thin elf girl. The long bow in the girl's hand exudes a beautiful dazzling magical radiance, and the powerful magical atmosphere that bursts into the face shows that the longbow is not an artifact, not far from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the power of the Elf girl is too weak. Although she is far stronger than the ordinary elf archer, not to mention that compared with the three kings, there are many of her own people, and there are many soldiers who are obviously stronger than her. Take her to such a degree. Don't say that there is only one artifact in your hand, that is, the whole body is full of artifacts, and it is impossible to threaten the kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Elf girl did not seem to have any fear at all. She actually opened the magic longbow and shot a dark black arrow to the king! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conspiracy! There must be a conspiracy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the kings who have spent a long time in the abandoned land are not good at conspiracy. They realized that it was not right, but they didn't know where the problem was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior’s hand stretched out in a hand, and held the dark black, strangely shaped arrow in his hand. This time, the three kings are stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graceful and smooth curves, the pale cyan pattern, the slow flowing dark black luster look so familiar, even though the kings have never seen those Golden ornamentation, but this did not prevent them from recognizing the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings face each other. It turns out that the enemies hidden behind all of this are actually the windy moon! Is she also in this world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings don’t know why Fengyue can command so many elves, but since she is behind the scenes. Then everything can be explained. She forced the three kings to dig deep underground. It seems that it is necessary to retaliate against what happened in the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seems that Fengyue just thinks of a bad smell. Otherwise, the three kings are in a state of weakness at this time, and the windy month before the ninth knight's power is absorbed is enough to clean them up. Where is it necessary to send some hands to block the door? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Warrior looked at the surrounding environment and finally said: "We... let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he said, he jumped up and flew to the depths of the Central Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the results of the three death monarchs will go without a fight. After Effie shot the demon lotus, he took the elf king's bow back. In her clear eyes, the figures of the three kings are flying farther and farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie suddenly remembered something and shouted at the backs of the kings: "Give me a stop! Return the things to me! Otherwise, you should consider it yourself." Consequences!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that her simple childish threat has worked, but the effect is to let the kings run faster. In a blink of an eye, the king’s figure disappears. Deep in the Central Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie’s face showed anger, she jumped up, lightly between the old trees and the rocks, chasing the direction of the kings disappearing Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie is chasing one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She won’t fly, and even the speed of jumping in the mountains is not fast. With her strength, don't say to chase three kings, even if they face Algra one. If the lich wants to kill her, even the spell doesn't need to be read. Any one of the silent and instant low-level magic is enough to instantly destroy Effie's weak body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she only remembers that before the departure of Hughes, 'must remember to bring it back', so this is paranoid in some respects. To surpass Rogge's elf girl, I will continue to pursue it all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie’s strength is insufficient. However, her perception is extremely sensitive. For her, the death of the kings is a bright lighthouse in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long. The three kings found that no matter how they hide their breath, they could not get rid of this persistent and sensitive elf girl. But they are also not willing to hurt Effie, because she seems to have a close relationship with the wind and moon. Bone Emperor and Elgra, who have always been guilty of deceiving the wind, have advised the Emperor of the Black Warrior not to have more trouble in this unknown world, or to return the demon to Effie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this has the suspicion of surrendering under the threat of Effie, this honour has long since not been placed on the hearts of the kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don’t know why, this time the Emperor of the Black Warrior said that he would not return the demon. Bone Emperor and Elgra had no choice but to be with the Emperor of the Black Warrior. Continue to circle with Effie in the Central Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, not long after, the cold of late autumn finally forced Effie to give up tracking. The three kings were relieved, and they were finally able to find an ideal hiding place in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
