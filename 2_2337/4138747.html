			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep, and the magnificent King City is greedily enjoying its last serenity under the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone is asleep. However, in a very luxurious large bedroom in the northwest corner of Wangcheng, it is a moment of glory and smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very large bedroom with a Victorian bed in the middle of the bedroom, and four large wooden pillars engraving many historically famous Characters and myths. The pale gold gauze hangs down like a stream of water, and the undulating fluctuations fully illustrate the preciousness and extraordinaryness of the ice silk that weaves the gauze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silk of the cloud is piled on the bed, carefully holding two, snowy, perfect entangled bodies. They constitute a fascinating picture that is inexplicable and incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sigh of softness rushed for a while, and soon climbed to the highest peak of happiness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nervous body stretched out like a stream, just like a flower, quietly opened...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them fell down, the arms stretched out lazily, and the chestnut color that was originally hardened became gentle. Her amazingly beautiful big eyes sat sullenly, and a sigh was gently sputtered between the red lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another golden woman softly fell on her body, her arms wrapped around her neck, and a little bit of water kissed like a rain. On her face, lips, neck and chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman with a short maroon smiles and hugs the gold woman, picking up her chin with two long fingers, looking like a smile She gently asked: "Froya, why, haven't you fed this little fox yet? Do you want to come again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fool Ya smiled softly, and her backhand tightened her neck: "Come on, are you really afraid that you are not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She moved, Looking deep into her eyes, "Androni, my baby! I thought I wouldn't see you again after I left that day! I didn't expect that you will suddenly appear here tonight, I I thought it was a dream!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said with a little sorrow, said: I don’t know if I should come to see you. After all, the people who led the troops to attack the Rhine League are my father and two brothers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, really stupid! Our family is fighting, and has nothing to do with us. Nie, these days, I have already hurt my heart in the Bourbon dynasty. The father and his sons were exactly the same as they were ten years ago. In order to preserve the throne, they wanted to give me to the Crown Prince of the Dro Empire as a little king! If they don't want to rely on my teacher's magic, and I am a big magician, my brothers will be the same as before... I want to try my taste! In the last sentence, Froya squeezed her teeth and squeezed out one word at a time. Her eyes were slightly picked up, and a cold glow flashed through.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiled and said: "And I, even thinking about fighting for such a father and brother, will actually separate them from your life!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni also sighed and hugged Froya, gently placing her head on her chest and gently stroking her. Kim. After a moment, she said: "In fact, both of us are stupid, aren't we? War and power are the games that men always play. Why are we suffering for these men to separate? If you are not a great magician, and I am not a Juggernaut disciple, we will become the chips and tools of political marriage in the eyes of the family. Why are we suffering for such a family? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya closed his eyes comfortably, almost whispering: "I am against you, you are not blaming me, will come to see me, I am so too Happy! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni tightened his arm and gently stroked Flora's smooth back, softly saying: "How can I blame you?" After that incident, you didn't dislike me, I am too happy to be there! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya rolled over and waved his hands in the middle of Androni's body, laughing with a provocative smile: "Really are you happy? Then look to see if you are sincere, come! say you Love Me! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered the black mirror, the silvery eyes and the natural, endless pressure.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that pair of cold, hooks A heart-wrenching, all-powerful little hand...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya is a crystal-clear woman, she looks at Androni, who is squatting, face The smile slowly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly woke up, looking at the sad face of Froya, watching a tear in her eyes sneak down, and Froya did not know . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni wants to comfort her, but suddenly all the words are so empty and weak, the little mouth is open for a long time, ah ah ah, actually Can't say a complete sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears slid down on Froya’s cheeks and flowed into her mouth. She tasted the bitter and salty taste of the ribbon, and she didn't know when her face had been covered with tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bowed her head, silently wiped her tears, then looked at Androni and asked bitterly: "Tell me, who is she?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni, I don’t know how to answer. In fact, she couldn't answer the dream girl. In addition to knowing her horrible strength, Androni only knows a name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it Rogge! Is it after you that time, you are... you are..." Froya’s voice was so cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Froja’s look, Androni’s heart was stinging. She quickly hugged her husband, Luo Ya, softly said: "How is this possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya suddenly laughed, it’s stupid, how could you Like him! Although this fat man is not small, but it is not to the point of fascinating my baby! You must be a beautiful girl on the road, and you are still in love! Forget it, forgive you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face began to be fascinating, and she said: "You just made me sad, how should I pay for it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni breathed a sigh of relief, hugged Froya, and kissed her on her lips...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit of a smack.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, it seems that the two have lost some indulgence There are more restraints and barriers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the fatigue is still.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although martial arts are as good as Dronie, there are some people who can't afford this indulgence. Froya's physique is much worse. She has already been so tired and sweaty that she is too lazy to move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Floria's fingertips slid gently along the beautiful curves of Androni's back, stroked...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Androni? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deroni's skin on her back is tight, and Froah has changed her name.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and Rogge that time... feels good? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is a little angry: "I will say it again, I can't possibly like Rogge!" At that time, I was completely comatose. What can I know? Can you stop mentioning this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is she very powerful?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, that is the sanctuary..." And when the words were exported, Androni suddenly stunned!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the back of Andronie, Froah’s low sobbing, her pointed nails subconsciously plunged into the skin on Androni’s back, Androni I didn’t dare turn around to comfort her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually," Froya finally spoke. "Rogge, I can't blame you at all." of. But I know that your heart is not as old as before. Don't ask me why, I just know. You must also know that our intuition has always been accurate, isn't it? ! Rogge..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly remembered that there would always be a familiar taste when she met **! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge bone dragon, she has seen it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge in the battle at Sarah Pass, the skull dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Gregory’s appearance has changed somewhat, Androni is already on the edge of the sanctuary, and his eyesight and feelings are extremely accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that these two occurrences are the same skull dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ***, must be inextricably linked with Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown, why Androni’s heart suddenly jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria has stopped sobbing, and she is clever and she is now Andrei. She has already vaguely guessed that the mysterious woman inserted between them must be related to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently embraced Androni from behind, gently stroking her incomparably beautiful curves, and a pair of thrilling long legs, whispered: "Annie, my baby... I don't want to stay here. I don't want to pay attention to the battle between men. The family, the dynasty, the throne have no meaning to me. Annie, take me away!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said, "Are you sure? Where do you want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where All the better, the farther the better. Anne, I want to go to the north to see, now the north, there will be an endless snowfield! You said last time, Rogge, the fat man is also fleeing to the north, maybe we can still See him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was shocked, but his face was cold, cold and cold: "I can't possibly like him!" You know, how can I like a stinky man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya knows it! You! However, Rogge’s fat man is still very powerful. Who is not around him, and is he strong? But this guy can always keep his own peace, and the people he is right with are nothing to end. With him, we don’t have to worry about a lot of things! So, if you meet him, it is a good thing for us! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were silent for a while, Androni turned and said softly: "Floria, then let me go!" Let's go to the north! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria hugged Androni, couldn't help but sobbing again: "I will go with you!" I don't want to leave you anymore, don't separate again! I am afraid, I am afraid I will lose you again! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her crying like a child, Androni was busy holding her and whispering softly in her ear: "No." How can you lose me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, that day, the dream figure that floated in the air and stood proudly, but once again flashed in Androni’s heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya wiped her tears, turned over and smiled: "Look, my eyes are crying!" I am going to make up a little makeup, otherwise it will be ugly tomorrow! Go to sleep first, I will be back soon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the picture of Fu Luoya disappeared behind her, Androni sighed and fell asleep on the bed. These were born too Many things, she is really tired.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the luxurious and spacious bathroom, Fu Luoya is standing in front of the ground, because of anger and slightly Her eyes were extremely dangerous, her fists were extremely dangerous, and her fists were clenched with both hands. Because of too much force, the pointed nails had pierced the palms, and the drops of blood dripped from the fingers!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly grabbed a bath towel, biting and tearing hysterically, and a pretty face became red because she was too hard!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s easy, she calms down, wheezes, hates and thinks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter who you are!" Dare to grab my Annie, I must want you to look good! I have to see how big you are! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever gloomy, dull aliens are now different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a vast plain, the two shadows are grazing at a height that is indistinguishable to the naked eye. They are so fast that they can only be seen faintly They are left with a faint shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure suddenly set in the same place as a nail, another huge figure can not stop for a while, rushed out a few tens of meters, this Brake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the *** and the bone dragon Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon is much smaller, only about five meters in the head and tail, and the whole body is covered with thick black or blue stripes. It double-winged, silently and quickly returned to the front of the ***, questioning: "Master, how did you suddenly stop? Are the king's men not behind us?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The hands are in the sleeves, and a gray robe is flying with the wind. The demon lotus armor has been scattered into dozens of nails, floating in her body around the virtual. The light in her silver eyes flashed a bit, cold and cold: "Someone wants to kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is a bit strange, these days, The master and the servant have been chased by the undead army of the whole world. No one wants to kill them. It is a strange thing. But the owner is always right. *** Suddenly said such a sentence, there must be a reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke is everywhere on the horizon. Gregory is now more eye-catching than ever. It sees that dozens of riders in the smoke are riding like ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the alien chain, the Ghost Knight's attack power is only moderate, but the victory is fast and the eyesight is good. Therefore, the kings of the other worlds rounded up the ***, and the ghost knight became the main force of the net. Some of the puzzles were that the ninth knight Heinrich suddenly disappeared and never appeared in this world again. Over. There is a spiritual connection between the kings. Heinrich lost its existence for whatever reason, and the use of the ghost knight by other kings was much worse. This makes the escape of *** and Bone Dragon not particularly stressful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***After drifting a few meters, I looked at dozens of ghost knights from far away, and said coldly: "Be prepared, kill them!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this distance, the ghost knight’s eyesight is not good enough to be able to squat and bone dragons, they just patrol astoundingly, searching *** traces. Anyway, the undead is not hungry, the energy is not enough, rest in the soil for a long time, and can run for a few days and nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s tail slammed and hit the ground! A dusty crater appeared on the ground. The flying soil piled up in front of the pit into a mound of more than two meters high. *** Falling from the air, standing on the back of the bone dragon. Gregory leaped into the pit and Anan ambushed steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of ghost knights have seen a small dust cloud flying in the distance, turned to the war horse, rushed over here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They spread out far and wide, and circled this suspicious little mound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang, the earth bag suddenly exploded! The explosion was so fierce that for a while, the diffuse smoke had covered a few tens of meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost Rider has no feeling of fear or fright, they have only doubts, but the hesitation of this moment is already fatal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint shadow rushes out of the smoke! It is so swift and unimaginable, even from the outer circle around dozens of ghost knights to hang up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of water blue brilliance sprinkled on the ghost knights. In a blink of an eye, more than a dozen ghost knights were caught off guard and became blue crystal statues. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the real fatality is a gray robe that looks like it’s all motionless. Her figure flickered in the ghost knights, but every time it was so clear, it was like standing in the air and never moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands are always caged on the chest, and black is not moving. But every time she appears in one place, the ghost knights within ten meters of the surrounding area will be smashed into pieces by the mellow black air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The volley converges above the corpse of the ghost knight, and the black air that flies around slowly slows down, finally showing the shape of the death sickle, and slowly immersed in the space in front of the *** . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon sneaked into the ground without a sound, lie in front of the body, and looked at the owner with a good look. Gregory is very satisfied with his performance in this battle, this is a rare perfect battle! It is a miracle to be able to kill 19 ghost knights under the master's hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the strength of the bone longan has also widened a lot, already know that playing deep, although to endure the urge to scream, right Lego is still very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a blue crystal knight statue suddenly exploded! The ghost knight trapped inside is dark and obviously much higher than other knights. It is slightly hesitant and does not run away. Instead, he leans back to the sky and prepares for a long shout! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Turned to look at the collar of this ghost knight, the light in his eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost Rider saw the silver eyes, and suddenly felt a big hammer slammed into his soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It swayed a few times, and suddenly disintegrated into a myriad of broken bones together with the Hummer underneath, scattered all over the place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its wreckage, the end is rigidly adorned with a thick iron breastplate...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*** Turned around and looked at the bone dragon coldly. Bone Dragon immediately lowered his head in guilty conscience. Regarding the left and right, it said: "Master, you just said that someone actually dared to kill your idea, wouldn’t you say these ghost knights? Just rely on them, you can only get a message. The role of it, not to mention that they should have not been us at the moment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Gregory suddenly remembered something and jumped up: "Master! Willn't that be the six kings chasing it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** faintly said: "Not a ghost knight, not an undead king. The person who killed me does not exist in this world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory tempted to ask: "Is it in the world of the master's master?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A little uncertain, slightly frowning: "It should be the murder from the world."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was taken aback again: "Isn't it...not the last person who injured your master?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;*** shook his head: "It won't be him. In that battle, he didn't have any murder. He is a terrible opponent, killing people, and there will be no murder in his heart." But this time, the desire of this person to kill me is too strong, so I feel it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone dragon is a sigh of relief! Except for the last time, the owner is invincible in both worlds! Which guy is so courageous? Next time you fight in the world over there, be sure to bring me! I have not turned him into a crystal carving! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** staring at the bone dragon, faintly asked: "Gregory, you feel that your breath is already strong, isn't it?" No longer need to make up a note? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has a guilty conscience, it has been pulling for a long time, just wanting *** to forget this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the bone dragon smothers the opponent with a starry breath, it will immediately fill a paw or a tail and completely crush the opponent. These days, in the endless battle of the bone dragon The power of the breath is getting stronger and stronger, and the undead creatures that deal with the ghost knight can be deadly. Today, it is inspiring and desperately trying to defeat more ghost knights to prove to the master that the dark dragon spent on it. The statue is worth the money. But it is not thought, but the ghost knight's collar strength is not weak, even after being condensed into blue crystal, it can still break free, and almost let it go out of the positioning signal!<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings of the world of death have a natural spiritual connection. With this connection, they can roughly determine the position of the ***. However, the power of *** also exceeds the interference of their expected divine power. This connection has been faded, and the kings can only judge *** Position, to reach more than five hundred kilometers radius error which requires men to use their vast undead carefully search every piece of land in this area <br <br /> & nbsp />;.. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;This is not a good idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of *** is the first recognized in the king, and the melee power is only comparable to the ninth knight Heinrich and the Bone Emperor. Her horror instinct in battle is far from the rest of the kings. In the first time, *** completely transformed Gregorian at the cost of a dark dragon statue, although the strength of the bone dragon did not improve much, even the beat is weaker, but the power of breath increased. The degree has been greatly improved, although it is still a lot worse than the ***, but still far from the rest of the kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the dragon of the abyss hovered in the sky, the master and the servant have always moved on the ground, and the degree is the key to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinister *** and the bone dragon have made the kings suffer enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***As long as you see the Ghost Rider, you will find a way to smash it. After dozens of battles, thousands of ghost knights have been killed, the kings The surrounding network is also becoming more and more vulnerable. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to count on zombies and squatting around to arrest them, that is, they will pass by themselves and there will be no feeling. As for the Wraiths, although they are not as fast as they are, they will fly, but as long as they are close to the ***, they have not waited for the reaction, and the natural gas of the king will tear them apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings are also a last resort to adopt this stupid way. Once the *** is out of the search range, the large-scale moving magic of Lich Elgar will instantly move all the kings to the vicinity of the ***, and the kings can mobilize all the undead creatures nearby to hunt. If the ninth knight Heinrich was also in the same place, the seven kings would join forces to narrow the range of the locked position to within one hundred kilometers, so that the possibility of escaping is much smaller. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the current range, the strength of the six kings is enough to shield the scent of the *** to enhance the power, not to attract the heavens patrol. As for the capture of ***, it is only hoped that luck is particularly good, just moved to the side of the *** in an instant movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 500-kilometer range you want to move randomly to the side of ***, this opportunity is really negligible. Just as the kings can sense the ***, *** will also know the general position of the kings, expecting her to come to the door, the possibility is very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community teleportation is a very wasteful thing, with the strength of the Lich Elgra, with only five other kings, within one day It can only move twice in an instant. If it is used for the third time, its magic will be consumed, and it will become that only five kings face the **, the kings can not block the breath of *** without much confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, another thing that the kings are worried about is Rogge, who was chased by Heinrich. Only creatures with strong mental power can grasp and use ‘erosion’, and Rogge’s strength is still deeply taboo for the kings. One day, Rogge will become the new king of the world of death. If Rogge and the two kings join forces, they can definitely break through the suppression of other kings and lead the heavenly parade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, there were only two ways in front of other kings: either compromise or destroy together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the kings are rushing to hunt down the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chances of being captured are small, not equal to none. Both *** and Gregorian understand this. Gregory is clear, I don't know when, maybe in the next moment, the kings may appear next to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master," Gregorian looked at the *** still standing in the air, asked melancholy: "The owner's master once said once The kings caught up with us, and he will come here. At that time, they will be able to attract the heavenly parade, and everyone will die. You said, if the kings know this, will they give up and chase us?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" *** replied sternly, "The king has the dignity of the king! If it is me, it is known that the end is destroyed together, and will swear." Maintain the dignity of the first law. Even if all the kings are destroyed, after the millennium, there will be new kings in the world of death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Sighing, we will always have a day that the kings have caught up with. It seems that only the same goes. Master, if you can be born again, you are still my master! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
