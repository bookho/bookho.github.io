			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth day of the book is destroyed on the fifth day (six)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one is standing proudly in the devil world The holy peak on the ground is already the last glory of the multi-faceted Mozu. Behind the Holy Peak, the middle of the blurred black fog that covers half of the sky reveals a fascinating atmosphere. Rogge stood in the air, his eyes crossed the holy peak and bet on the dark fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in Rogge’s eyes, whether in the sky, he is arrogantly staring at his wise angel, or the loca and the dragon that are fighting around the holy peak. Even the magician who always stands still and supports the magical field that covers the entire peak of the Holy Peak, will have some information flowing out and passing into his induction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a vast expanse of fog behind the Holy Peak, like a bottomless abyss that can swallow everything, no information at all, the fog of that layer Nor did it have any signs of opening in front of Rogge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, that fog is not in the hands of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after this understanding, Rogge just paled and immediately returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the black crystal left by Elysses, Rogge knows that in the middle of this vast fog, it is the most mysterious bottomless abyss in the devil . It is rumored that the infinite dark gods of power can live in the deepest part of the bottomless abyss. This is the only god among the gods that Rogge knows to leave the kingdom of the state in the material plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Rogge’s understanding of the gods, the Dark Devil’s practice is simply the same as a rich man’s opening his family’s door in a robber camp. The books of Hilo are written about the common sense of the kingdoms of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country opened up in nothingness. It takes a lot of power to reach and leave. Otherwise, when the body passes through nothingness, any tangible existence may suppress the pressure inside the body, thus breaking into the most subtle existence. Even the soul will be torn by nothingness and cannot be kept intact. Therefore, when a god wants to attack another god, other servants cannot walk in addition to themselves and the avatars that inherit their own power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also according to the book of Hilo. The gods have great advantages in their own kingdoms, so unless the gap between the gods and the attacking objects is too great. Otherwise it is difficult to lose in your own country. In the case of little difference in divine power, if one god wants to defeat another god, only by weakening the other's divine power by various means, the effect of weakening the opponent's kingdom can be achieved, and finally it is possible to completely defeat the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, any war between gods is often protracted. The battle is in a hundred years, and the battle of some famous gods will continue for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not know why he knows this, nor does he know that these knowledge about the war of the gods is right or wrong. This knowledge is derived from the book of Hilo, and floats from his heart at the appropriate time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, Rogge is even more incredible about the practice of the Dark Devil. However, although the position of the bottomless abyss is openly secret, but several people dare to enter the bottomless abyss, challenge the power of the dark gods to the existence of the heavenly gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the seemingly ordinary fog did not reveal a message to Rogge. Just imagine how powerful the Dark Devil is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the existence of rationality in the world seems to be always a minority, and the madman is never lacking. Now Rogge, he is a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite nothing in the Dark Devil, the breath brought by the Angel of the Wisdom, the Dragon King, the Locar, and the Devil has benefited Rogge. Endless. These tyrannical forces have their own strengths, and they all reach the limits that the plane can tolerate in different fields. Especially the high-pitched wise angels, the four wings of the sacred glory of the surging, with a single strength to firmly suppress the power of the many superior demons on the holy peak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of strength, this wise angel is almost the same as Victoria, but in Rogge’s feeling, although he is more arrogant, he always does not If Victoria does not know it, it will make people look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hot rush of breath broke Rogge's confused thoughts. He only remembered that he was still in the battlefield between the heavens and the Mozu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless days in the raging fire and the splendid Shenghui fight, the vast majority of the ground spread the blood of millions of Mozu warriors. The wind blowing in the face is full of rich fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Rogge, a fighting angel is showing his wings, waving the sword of the flame in his hand, and a sword bows to Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the devil can be much higher than the position of Rogge, at least the power of this fighting angel seems to be Far from reaching the upper limit of this plane. Because there is no limit, the power of this fighting angel has even surpassed the two power angels brought by Andreoli in the final battle of the South and North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the flame sword that fell at an incredible speed, Rogge flashed a blur in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How familiar is the flame...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sacred flame everywhere, In fact, throughout the life of Rogge, every big turn he made is closely related to this burning flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame that turned Elysses and Orpheco into a statue, the flame that awakened Wella from the slumber, and the burning of the endless The flames of the statues in the Temple of the Twins...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the devil world, the unrestricted fighting angels and the fighting angels that Rogge once saw are essentially different. . But Rogge was not Rogge at the time of the final battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands in the air, letting the flames of the sword fall. The distance between the two sides is so close that Rogge can see the expressionless face of the fighting angel through the heavy flames and the thick golden helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak of the burning flame of the flames roared over Rogge's body, but he still smiled and stood in the same place. It looks unharmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original battle angels smashed, just a phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the insane eyes of the fighting angels also flashed a trace of doubt. The flame is not just high heat, it comes from the extraordinary flames of the heavens, such as the removal of phantoms and invisibility. Fighting angels are different from other angels. Their eyes can be seen through hypocrisy. Their souls are hard and cold. Not tempted and threatened. This is actually a very practical and powerful feature in many plane battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Flame of the Flame has already passed the phantom of Rogge. Why can't it be broken? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the battle angel to figure this out, the wings behind him are tight, and then there is a sharp pain! For a time, he has not moved! The fighting angels had a severe pain and turned their heads, only to find that the wings had fallen into the hands of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Rogge, there was another embarrassment, the end of the battleday. He has been unable to tear off the wings that are in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a golden flower blooming in the sky, and a thick fragrance begins to spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden petals are blooming, Rogge flies out of the petals, and the flames of the fighting angels are in his hands, and the flames on the giant swords are not It has not weakened, but it has increased sharply. It has risen to a completely new realm, and the inflamed tongue has become nearly transparent. Only on the tip of the flame will reveal a strange blue color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the battlefield was silent for a moment, and more than ten eyes were bet on Rogge. In this demon power, the absolute power of Rogge itself is strong, but far from reaching the limit of the plane. What makes the crowd powerful is the breath that is slowly coming from Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath is weak, but it is cold, cruel, and arrogant. And decided! From this breath, both the angel of wisdom and the devil, read only one meaning, destruction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-spirited wise angel finally spoke up: "I am the great Setanista in front of the seat of the seventh wise angel, Nitoto Leah. My mission is to change the faith of the six planes of the devil world, so that it will be bathed under the glory of the Most High God. Who are you? I saw the great dissmasen breath from you, you should be The servant of the lord of destruction. But why are you destroying my fighting angels?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
