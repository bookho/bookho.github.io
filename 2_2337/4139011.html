			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh Day Book Volume 6 Redemption (7)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Dagong is not willing See Rogge. When he saw Rogge pushing the door, Dagong, who had always been angry and indifferent, also frowned slightly. Even though this disgust and disappointment is fleeting, it is still impossible to escape the eyes of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rog face is quiet and quietly stands on the other side of the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the Pope did not let Rogge leave, the Bavarian Grand Duke again frowned slightly. He hesitated for a moment and had to continue: "Your Majesty, this is not a trivial matter. I hope that you can think about it again. Although the source of faith is breaking down, the speed is not very fast. I think only you in this plane. If you have the ability to stop the collapse of the power of faith, even if you can't do anything, then you can also inform the heavens of the situation in the plane, and let the angels of the heavens stop the worst."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope, as in the past, sitting silently in the high-backed chair, seems to have been asleep, and has no reaction to the words of the Bavarian Grand Duke. Dagong waited patiently, but he did not wait for the Pope's answer, waiting for Rogge's sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Bavarian Grand Duke, are you so painstaking in protecting the food of the gods of the heavens, is it not redemption? In the glory of heaven, eternal life is indeed one It’s a very exciting thing, but I didn’t think that a hero like you didn’t look at life and death, and it’s so hard for redemption.” Rog’s mouth hangs a hint of ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandfather glanced at Rogge, his face was slightly angry, saying: "Eternal life is loneliness. Since redemption does not make sense to you. Is it so important to me?" Rogge, now you are single-mindedly enemies with the heavens, what is it for you? You are nothing but a moment of dislike! The heavenly gods are not you and I can fight. The source of faith has collapsed. Give us what can be brought to this plane? What can be brought is to speed up the destruction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke paused, and the anger was a little rest, turning Pope: "Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope snorted. Slowly opened the turbid eyes and looked at Rogge. I looked at the Dagong of Bavaria again and said nothing, and I looked out the window again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong strode to the window and waved, the scene outside the window changed immediately, and the mechanical and beautiful scene of the fantasy changed into a town. Mountain village landscape. These intertwined towns and villages have different styles and appear to be located in ordinary towns in various corners of the mainland and in various countries. People in the illusion seem busy and simple. They are working for a daily meal, and the North-South war that affects the entire continent does not seem to have much to do with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong to the illusion, Shen Sheng: "Your Majesty! Look, these are the people of our plane! They don't need pride, no need Glory, not to destroy for freedom! All they need is survival, just a peaceful life! These ordinary and ordinary people will not think about things after the millennium. For them, the heavens, the gods and us They are so far away. After the source of faith collapses, we will immediately lead to the judgment of the heavens. If you stop the collapse of the source of faith, these ordinary people can have at least a thousand years before the heavens clean the entire plane. Survival! Which one should be chosen between a war with no hope and a thousand years of survival, I think the answer is very obvious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The survival of the millennium? Rogge smiled coldly and said: "The survival of the millennial pigs and dogs? The only ending is to wait for the slaughter that will come soon. Is this existence called survival?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong Shen Sheng: " It’s just your thoughts. For most ordinary people on the plane, they don’t know the final fate, nor the life under the rule of heaven. Maybe they can live better. So I believe, The sentient beings will choose the heavens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the illusion outside the window and smiled lightly: "Respected Bavarian Grand Duke, I know what you said It’s all right. It’s a pity that the sentient beings have never had the right to choose. The big things in this plane are determined by the likes and dislikes of a few people. Of course, you are also one of the few people. All beings are ignorant, so they don’t know What do you want. It is up to us to decide for them. In fact, what you call a good idea for them is just what you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The fat man paused for a moment and looked up to the sky. After a while, he said: "Respected Dagong, just for Elysses, I have wanted to kill you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Dagong snorted and did not put Rogge’s threat on his mind. He only said to the Pope: "Your Majesty, can’t hesitate any more! Now there is still time, just refine it into the last purgatory angel image. Leading angels of the heavens, they have the power to stop the collapse of the source of faith!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Dagong pointed to Rogge and said: "He is enough Responsible for the requirements of the image of the purgatory angel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted, just want to say something, Dagong said: "As long as this plane can last for a thousand years, I am also willing to be incarnate as an infernal angel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope finally trembled and raised his hand, and the two who were about to continue the quarrel stopped immediately, waiting His metaphor. After the Pope thought for a long time, he slowly said: "I still need to think about it. I will talk about it later. Rogge stays, I still have something to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong looked helpless, but had to quit the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, you just heard it, when the last statue of the Purgatory Angel was formed, it was the day of judgment in this world. I am old, But you can still drag a little time for you, what else do you have to do. Just do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog nodded, but he Did not go, just staring at the Pope in the sunset. After hesitating for a long time, Rogge finally asked: "When did you... why must you make Elysses an angel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope faintly: "Because she is very suitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silently, finally turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the Pope is telling the truth, indeed, the mission of the Infernal Angels. The magic is extremely strong, and Elysses, who lives in this plane with the body of the Mozu, is no longer suitable. And the pope at that time would not consider him or Ophrod's mood at all. Just as he does not think about the sentimental sentiment at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that, the feelings of the year have faded away, but the brand is still in his heart and can never disappear completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the halls of the twelve infernal angels, there are already eleven statues standing at the moment, only one large hall is empty. Even today, Rogge is not fully aware of the role of the statue of the purgatory angel. But just now the Pope has reminded that when the Purgatory Angels are gathered together, it is the day of judgment, and he also knows that even if the Pope has the heart, it is impossible to delay the time forever. Once the gods of heaven are found to be wrong, I am afraid that a simple god can replace a new pope for the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the promenade, Rogge sighed. Ascending the sky, it disappeared into the clouds of the secret world in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has just left, the loneliness of the promenade is once again broken. In the sudden footsteps, Augustus's burly figure appeared at the end of the promenade, and hurriedly walked to the pope's prayer room and knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus opened the door. The same as the scenery of the secret. The Pope's prayer room has always been immutable. It seems that whenever he comes in, he will only see the Pope quietly bathing in the setting sun. Just don't know why today, Augustus suddenly felt the chill of the silk. In an instant, the blood angel seems to feel that he is a hurrying and ruthless traveler in late autumn. He does not know where the end of the journey is, nor how long it can last in the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a moment of embarrassment that has made the blood angels secretly alert, and this illusion should not appear on him anyway. What happened to yourself today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angels set their minds and arranged all their emotions out of their hearts. Then he said to the Pope: "Your Majesty. Recently, many parishes have changed a bit..." He hesitated and did not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope coughed a few times. Then said: "Is there a rumor that I have turned my back on my faith and become a devil's believer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pope glared at the old eyes of the dim, looking at the sunset outside the window with powerlessness, silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is standing behind him, patiently waiting for the Pope's instructions, just as he used to it in the past few decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of the secret seems to have stagnated. If the sunset of the blood is firmly nailed to the sky, it will not fall. Augustus is as usual, but the heartbeat is getting faster and faster without control. He even feels that there is a slight cold sweat oozing out of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long has it been waiting? A moment, or a thousand years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope finally moved, and Augustus suddenly released a heavy burden, and he took a deep breath, and he immediately found his own gaffe, but it was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Augustus, how do the light religions discuss the lesser believers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The whole light of the Holy Scriptures has existed in the heart of Augustus, and he immediately thought without hesitation: "If you are dishonest, you should be comforted. If you are not satisfied, you should be treated as a pagan."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope nodded and slowly said: "Can you still control the Holy Knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Augustus' heartbeat was getting faster and faster, and his palms began to ooze sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, how to deal with this matter, you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustus was a big jump in his heart, a drop of sweat oozing from his clenched fist, dripping, fell into a small splash on the floor, and made a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a slightly invisible light, now in the ear of Augustus, that is like thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, you seem..." Blood Angel raised his head slightly and stared at the Pope and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope smiled a little hoarsely, this time the taste of the old man on his body could no longer be concealed and began to rush out. The old man who has been arrogant in the power of the mainland for ten years has finally stopped staring at the sunset, turning his head and looking at Augustus. Since the rotation was born in this plane, Augustus has always followed the Pope, he is already familiar with the Pope's gaze. But at this moment, he finally found that there were some different things in the eyes of the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Augustus..." The Pope smiled. At this moment, he smiled like an ordinary old man: "It seems that you also found out, Yes, now my strength has been lost, and it is impossible to use the big prophecy again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... Why is this?" Augustus I just couldn't believe my eyes, and I can't believe my ears at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't use big prophecy? what does this mean? Can it be said that the old man who had made the strong man fall between the hands of the strong, the pope who mastered the secret of the gods, has really become an ordinary old man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Augustus almost dared not think about why the Pope could no longer use the Great Prophecy. Is it true that the gods that the prophets suddenly emerged recently are true? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence, Augustus’s fist finally picked up again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope has already turned around and looked at the sunset without a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you know, then help me Close the door.” The Pope was peaceful and amiable... At this moment, the blood angel suddenly discovered that from the time he came to this plane, this intelligent old man has been guiding him and guiding him to go with other advents. Angels have different paths. He is no longer a slave to knowing his life, nor a machine without feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, Augustus, learned to think, and since then has the meaning of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
