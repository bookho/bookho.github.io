			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;盛世年华卷章二下下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes is lying on the ground, carefully closing the ground Scattered tea leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few white cotton blotting papers on the table, which are covered with green tea leaves. Hughes stood up, carefully shaking off the dust on the tea leaves, carefully discerning their state, and then gently placing the tea leaves on absorbent paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hard work, regardless of the image of Xiusi, the tea in one place was finally rescued. He was so pleased that he just stretched his waist and the window suddenly opened silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew through, although there was nothing in the field of vision, but the remaining tea leaves on the ground made a slight squeak, clearly that something had passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the sound that seemed to be stepping on his heart, Hughes’s hands were shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly screamed, a foot, a small figure in the room suddenly appeared! It was immediately hit by a strong air. Xiusi once again volleyed, and the figure was immediately set in the air, not to go up, not to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Gregory who sneaked into the ground. Holding a large bottle in his arms, his body still has a strong alcohol, his face is full of surprises, I don’t know why the elders of Sousse, who have always been elegant and calm, suddenly become angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes glared at the bottom of the gnome for a long time, and this time he re-gambled on the ground. As expected, the few tea leaves on the ground have been crushed by the gnome on the ground, and there is no possibility to clean up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You suddenly ran, is there anything?" Hughes angered and stared at Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory hangs in the air. The bombs are not allowed, and the seemingly calm voice of Xiusi is chilling and sullen, and I feel a little cold. However, as soon as he mentioned it, Gregory immediately became excited. It struggled for a while, but his hands and feet did not move, he had to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnome mysteriously looked around. Trying to push the sound to a very low level, but the excitement of the stock can't be concealed anyway: "Respected Elders of Hughes. I... I saw it! I really saw it! Although I don't understand what I saw. Meaning. Therefore, I came to you for your guidance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you see? What?" The face of Xiusi Tieqing has not eased, and there is still a bit of tone. Evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw the owner of the Wella and the owner of the master..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rushed to cover the mouth of the gnome, and the rude action again shocked Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hius closed his eyes, carefully examined the surroundings, and carefully closed the window by the window, and doubled the enchantment on the window and the door. . This flashed back to Gregory. He lowered his voice and said: "What have you seen, you can't miss it, just tell me in order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, The plane of the prime minister's house in Trau opened wide, and under the guard of a team of knights, Rogge's carriage drove out from the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carriage. Serena was sitting quietly opposite Rogge, her hands on her lap and her fingers clenched. This lively girl is very melancholy at the moment. After all, she is still small, she does not know how to hide her mind, and all emotions are revealed on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is meditating, whether or not to help Straw completely remove the limitation of the abyss gap. Although these days Rogge has gotten a lot of benefits from Straw, though it seems. The prime minister of the empire has been unable to extract anything, but the fat man does not believe that the powerful minister who has been in the forefront for many years is only at such a point. Just look at him to find two Sanctuary strongmen to support the seal magic array, you can know that he is not as simple as it appears on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t push him to the road, I’m afraid that Straw will not bleed. The fat man thought about it evilly. He kept thinking about letting Wena move his hands and feet in the magic circle and expand the abyss gap to expand some possibilities. However, the danger of doing so is very great. If Wen has not mastered a fire, he has to pay a little more. If he really puts Casinaras out, it is not a joke. Once this happens, Straw, the biggest current political ally, will surely fall. By the time. Rogge, who is still shallow in the empire, can hardly face the alliance between Alexander and Pompey. Perhaps the only way out for the fat man at that time was to take advantage of the absolute number of strong people in the sanctuary. Suddenly launched a strike, the two imperial names will be sent to no return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the religious war has subsided, and in fact the fat side has won a big victory. The political struggle is still on the level of fighting for power and suppressing dissidents. The situation is not out of control. But if the political struggle develops to the point where you die, I am afraid that it will not be good for anyone. Moreover, the Great Emperor and Sara Wenger are the biggest variables in this game. How can they sit and watch the situation develop to the point where the foundation of the empire is shaken? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there must be no flaws in crushing Straw. However, Straw is also a savage savage. On the day when he was not sealed, he did not tell the composition of the Rogge Seal Magic Array. Although Winner's magic is much higher than Rogge, his magical control is not stronger than Rogge. Let him temporarily study the mystery of the seal magic array, and move between the quiet and the sound, it is simply impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich Elgar has this ability, but the sorcerer’s powerful evil spirit exists, and it is absolutely impossible to see the light. And Rogge also did not command the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the fat man is in a dilemma, and the forehead can't help but some faint pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge..." Serena slowly raised her head and broke the silence in the compartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted and recovered from meditation. He looked at the melancholy girl in front of him, and looked at her as she penetrated her eyes. Confused eyes. Serena suddenly felt helpless and felt that all her thoughts were invisible in this person's calm and peaceful eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two women today...who are you?" Serena asked. She has always been bold and straightforward. Thinking directly, thinking about something in my heart, a mouth is asked as it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled, and in the blink of an eye, he was ready for a pile of lies, and it was coherent and seamless. Deceived Serena, a little girl who is not aware of the world, he naturally has too much effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before he said anything, Serena sighed softly: "You don't have to say it. Actually, I know very well about their relationship with you." I also understand the meaning of my father. I know from the time I understand things. In the future, my marriage will be a bargaining chip for the family. For me, girls have no choice of freedom, love, romance, I have no chance with me. The stories of the knights, dragons, and princesses who are rumored by the poets are just legends. I have been working hard to practice martial arts, thinking that if that day really comes, I will not be helpless. ......You can fly away. But I know better, these are all delusions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat quietly, listening to Serena’s story . The fat man did not expect that her very young heart, there are also many things inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this time, although I am still a chip in my father's hands, but I... Lena raised her head. Staring at Rogge's eyes, Finally said: "I am willing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's smile is more gentle and kind, asks: "Celena, are you seventeen this year?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is still early. Don't think too much, practice martial arts well, I can see. Master Straw has placed deep feelings on you. He will not use you as a political chip. Believe me, he is a good father. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selena was full of confusion after a flash of an eye, which is not the answer she expected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She bowed her head and said softly: "Know it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "You, don't worry too much." Speaking of the political marriage chip, Straw adults will only be willing to send your sister out. She doesn't have the style of a noble woman at all, it is really a shame for Straw. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a big tree not far from the carriage, he was listening to the sound of the inside of the carriage, and almost fell from the tree. She was shocked. Uncertainty, I am not sure if Rogge is telling her. However, in her feelings, Rogge is very weak at the moment. The magic is absolutely no more than ten, how did he find himself?<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su hesitating for a moment. Recalling the last bizarre encounters in the Rogge House, I finally dare not follow it again. When the carriage passed, she floated lightly and fell on the street. The roof of the residential building, I want to retreat. But as soon as she turned around, she immediately changed her face and almost exclaimed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su is good at night fighting, that is, in the absolute darkness, the night eyes of the Soviet Union also see things. But now I don't know why, she just can't see the eyes of this swordsman. Xu is because she is facing the blue moon, so I comfort myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a strange instinct hit my heart, somehow Su felt that the swordsman’s gaze had been on her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the bundle is even tighter. You will now be able to install the trunk again, it will be more like." Her seemingly playful tone reveals the killing of Sensen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like a thunderbolt hitting Su, she finally remembered and said: "Is that day?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman seems to be smiling, said: "The emperor has not been peaceful recently. You have a girl who walks around in the middle of the night. If you don’t want to go anywhere, I’m afraid it’s not safe. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Serena in the carriage was completely unaware of the changes outside, but she kept her head down. Rogge’s ears moved slightly, revealing a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celena seems to have gathered courage, suddenly raised her head and greeted Rogge’s gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that a woman born in a big aristocratic family like me can't decide my future. But I still want to work hard. My father really treats me very much. Ok, he asked me in advance, I am... of course, willing. Rogge, can I ask you a request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog I owe my debt and smiled. "You are of course willing to help you," he said. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still not the answer Selena expects, but she is still brave. The land continues: "If in the near future, my father loses power, I hope... you can continue... marriage contract..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stroud "It won't lose momentum." Rogge comforted her and smiled and said: "If Master Straw really makes a marriage contract, I will do it anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Serena heard the last sentence, and her eyes finally glowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s carriage has gone all the way, but Su is standing in the same place and can’t move. The opposite swordsman is emitting an amazing murderousness, covering her body. Su was afraid that he would become a victim of the horrible sword. The more she looks, the more certain that the sword is the name of the world's artifacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the swordsman suddenly sounded an old and vigorous voice: "The emperor is not quite flat recently, you a girl who walks around at night, I am afraid It will not be safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su saw the majestic figure rising behind the swordsman, and his heart was over, her wrist turned over, and immediately added a handful The long black knife, the whole body arched, staring at the movement of the swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman couldn’t keep a blue starlight, apparently concentrating on tempering to resist the amazing vindictiveness of the old man behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is not afraid of the old man behind him, but at the moment plus a long knife that is not a good thing, the situation is not very good. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the end of the long street suddenly sounded a clear smile: "The emperor is not quite flat recently! You are an old thing to walk around at night, I am afraid it is more unsafe." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the laughter starts, the handsome and handsome Mi Luo just appeared at the intersection of Changjie Street, and his hand is actually a very big one. The hammer with a hammer of nearly one meter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long laugh, Miro stepped and appeared in front of the old man when the footsteps fell! The giant hammer that flashed the purple light with a faint scream, almost instantly reached the old man's face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A storm that is enough to level the entire neighborhood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in the moment, the old man’s coughing sound kept ringing and quickly went away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shang is in awe, Miro’s figure has appeared behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
