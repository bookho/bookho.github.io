The slight swaying from underneath made him understand that he was in a carriage. With a big sway of the entire body, the sting came from the wound in the body, so he couldn't help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the brush, the curtain of the window was opened, and the big head of Ett came in, "Wake up? Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this? How long have you been fainted? Hey!! This damn broken car! And this way! Are we driving on the field?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, you will return to Fort Worth in two hours. Then there will be a pastor. Now you can only use the pharmacy that you brought. Your wounds. You are really hard, so roasted, the brothers can almost add food at night, hehe." Aite smiled with a gloating face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, we are missing a pastor, and we have to get one next time. How is Feis’ medicine so bad! It hurts me. He does If the medicine has half of his skill as a magic weapon, how is it going to play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are hurt except you." The four brothers did not even want to get a patrol cavalry team. "Etter shook his head and continued: "We are winning this time. It is really a snow and silver fox, and it is an elite snow fox brigade. The number is not too much, there are more than 300 people, it is ten times ours. Mom, they are so small, they are an intermediate knight. Fortunately, the guy’s brain is not good, actually To be singled out with Kate, ***, Franco immediately gave an arrow to the **."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of the jungle, patrol cavalry captain The dark place was shackled, and it was a few rounds of torture. Later, Rennes licked his trousers, covered his words with honey, and found an ant, and asked for a confession a few minutes later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Snow Fox team occupied this small Selesburg, they blocked the lord’s house and arrested more than a hundred young men from nearby, day and night. Stop what is digging inside. However, this task seems to be quite confidential, and the position of the patrol captain has not yet reached the level of confidentiality. Luns’s sinful screaming of an ant on the already bruised squad, the patrol captain immediately screamed: "I said, I said! It seems that I heard that the lord had enshrined a Necromancer in the house, that The following is said to be the mage's lab! Point it to me!" Lens repeatedly asked again and again, convinced that he couldn't ask anything anymore, and he ended the knight's pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of many serious injuries, the only magician Rogge became a roast pig, and the most important thing is that these 30 people are not enough to cut. A few of the scum aristocrats, together, quickly ran. Anyway, there are still four months from the appointed time. This time, it is not all unproductive, at least understand the fact that the strength is still quite far away from the Snow Fox team. As for the spoils, "I am! What kind of first-class mercenary group elite team, poor with grandchildren. This body is broken and fun!" Responsible for cleaning the battlefield Kate has no knight image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged pastor who gave Roger a wound in the church in Fort Worth seemed to be not very strong. Roger's injury was cured by using six or seven replies in succession. The fat man jumped from the bed and threw him two gold coins. He ignored the tide and hurriedly escaped. He instinctively hates such places. If it is not the pastor's healing effect, it is really not covered. He is never willing to step into this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls. A few evils met in the most prosperous "Rhein Night" in Fort Worth. The name here is actually the gold nest of Falkburg. From wine to women, the Rhine night is said to provide the best of all the goods. Naturally, it is not a place that ordinary civilians can afford, but the merchants and aristocrats who traveled south to the north still make the business here flourish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rhine Night" is a towering three-story building, but almost an ordinary six-story building. In front of it is a wide square. At the end of the night, there will always be a huge carriage of expensive cars. There is a magical fountain with a diameter of nearly five meters in front of the door. The water blooms straight into the sky until it is five or six meters high. On the water mist, a purple magical flame in the volley burned around the clock. At the bottom of the fountain is a large magical array, and the colorful magical light flames shine on the mist, full of romantic and mysterious atmosphere. Light is such a magical array that costs a lot every day. Through the four-meter-high gate, the golden wall of the Rhine night's lobby is brilliant, and the magical glory is all coated with a touch of gold. Art from all over the world is scattered throughout the hall. The second floor of the Rhine Night is divided into compartments, decorated in the artistic style of the major 6 major countries, and is an important source of conspiracy. On the third floor there is another larger hall. Every weekend, there are often slave auctions, and occasionally there are other large events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the "war of the god of war" business became more and more prosperous, Rogge and others became frequent visitors here. Several aristocratic scums belong to the kind of people who are less ambiguous. Of course, this is compared with other nobles who have real power or pure bloodlines. This time, it will naturally be a bit temperament, especially Rogge. Even Franco can't be excused, and occasionally pretend to be inadvertent in front of outsiders. Heaven is too late on the night of Rhine, and there is no spirit yet. "There is a sneak peek at the eyes of the other person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, several scums are slouching in the corner of the lobby, and the second floor is a non-rich and expensive guest. In order to go up, Rogge and others are not very qualified.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those bones of the Master, I really don’t understand how anyone would be so interested, it’s worth sending Three hundred people come to risk. ***, the damn foxes are poor and poor, and the effort is really not covered!" Etter sighed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hundred people, let's How to do? Just look at the level of these 30 people, and you have to pull at least 600 people. According to the current equipment, our money can only be equipped with a maximum of one hundred people. Kate is also very depressed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lango sighed: "If this is not done, the money is small." At that time, it was impossible to get to the Duke of Bavaria. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be discouraged." We killed them a magician! And the level is not low! Such a person, the mercenary brigade is estimated to be one or two. It should be that they are afraid of us. In any case, the six cavalry and one mage are gone, maybe they panic in the same place. Hahaha. Rogge looked around and no one laughed. He had to turn haha ​​into two.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't just forget it!" Kate suddenly got excited. "My father was born and died for so many years, military martial arts, which is worse. Not because it was just a baron, it was put on the position of the deputy commander of the city defense army for more than ten years. Damn, the fifteenth-level high-ranking knight! Chambers, the fat pig, is not because it is an ear, is the nephew of the deputy minister of military affairs, only to sit in the position of the leader? Damn, if he can have the level of the eight-level knight, Lao Tzu gives his son a 舔 **! This opportunity can not be let go, in order to get the head, how can you get him!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not bad, at least you can inherit a baron. I haven’t been in your dad’s hands for ten years without moving? His baron, I still can't inherit a few of my brothers. It is a nobleman to say that it is a nobleman. In fact, what a mother's life is. In the kingdom, when you find a prostitute, you may be robbed. If it wasn’t for Rogge’s brains, he opened the ‘God of the God of War’, and we still can’t look at the place to do it. Can the night of Rhine come to us? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco interrupted the two knights: "Oh, brothers! Don't be dissatisfied, how do you grab those civilians?" Didn't you think that you are in a low position? Kate, you are stealing, and it’s not bad for your father and son to be regarded as Dark Knights. Anyway, this opportunity is hard to come by. Don't worry about why Orphey will look at us, but if you do it well, you can definitely get to the Grand Duke of Bavaria! Let's get together and what to do next!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge poured a bite of wine, with some inspiration: "First recruits to buy horses, how much can be recruited, this time do not need to prepare such a good equipment for them, stronger than those poor ghosts! It’s a weapon, and the horse doesn’t have to prepare so much. So how do we get people? Kate, Ette, you two of these two months will practice these grandchildren.瞧The mercenary battalion is poor, and at most one magician is at the end. This time we put Fissla up, and on his equipment, why not kill the magician? The hammer of the god of war will be the first to order ordinary goods these days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lens quickly touched the smack of the passing lady, who stared at her and walked into the back hall. The eyes are not going to play with them! They are running around and seeing the order. The morning and evening, they can’t stand it. When they come out from the tortoise shell, we will find some people from the thieves’ guild. The kind, then they are led to let them taste the taste. Right, get a little more, the bow is a little bit, with inconvenience, but the short bow is also OK, just rely on the armor of the mercenary, there are They got to cry. On top of the arrow, they have to be poisoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people have a great spirit, they have said that they are intriguing, and the scums of the same taste are never arrogant. . Several people have deliberated, ambushed poison, trapped horses, threatened to lure, pretend to swindle, all kinds of sinister tricks, I do not know how much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days are white, everyone is watching, the yin of the yin smiles, for a moment, everyone in the lobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl Wennington did not say anything after hearing about the adventures of the aristocratic scum. Only the next day, his fifty guards reloaded the gunmen and quit the military service and joined the mercenary group. Kate also picked out a hundred men from the mercenary group, matched with horses, wire chain armor and axe guns, and turned into a semi-light axe cavalry. For the next two months, Kate trained with these knights in the training ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 200 people of the mercenary group are led by Et. Etter, who has converted several professions, has recently decided to become a magic swordsman. It is no more suitable for him to train infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Franco, he said in an understatement: "My life is art." I was busy designing the mercenary flag and the group logo. The people were extremely depressed, until one day they accidentally bumped into the hand holding a fine thorn sword, and they were working hard on the humanoid target. The dense sword pits are all in the eyes, wrists, thighs, and even under the yin. Everyone only saw scalp, especially Kate as a knight, his face was extremely ugly. Franco's family-running swordsmanship is known for his footwork, which is considered to be a superior sword, and with such sinister and vicious methods of warfare, the power is greatly increased. Everyone thinks of the top-selling sword that Feis had created for him on the day before, and it was a bitter cold. As for quenching, that is all right, anyway, everyone has to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not meditation all day long, or is hiding in the lab to study magic, occasionally when the full armor is mixed in the team of Aite to practice the axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lab, Rogge muttered the spell, the smoke dissipated, and stood in front of him. At the moment, there is a long knife in the right hand and a ruined shield on the left hand. It looks more than the prestige, at least compared with the undead master's sergeant, not too bad. Rogge always researched where the knife shield came from. He tried to give some new equipment to the ***. After he was very obedient, he changed it and sent it back to the outside world. The equipment was thrown in place. The next call is still a long knife and a shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is looking for Fiss, and it’s confusing to know that the undead magic is at best. The magic on the big 6 is strictly divided according to the level, and the distinction between the departments is not very obvious. Most of the magicians who are proficient in some aspects of magic can display the magic of other departments, but only a few spells that are extremely opposite to themselves can't be displayed. For example, undead magic, most intermediate magicians can call out if they want. There are not many, the quality is average. Because of the limited combat effectiveness, a well-trained soldier can also deal with three or two squats, so it is not practical, unless it can be summoned in large numbers. The Necromancers are different. They dedicated themselves to the god of death and converted them into undead creatures. The magic of the undead is greatly enhanced. They are often paranoid and evil because of the erosion of death. Only a few people who have become the necromancers with the power of the great magician can keep their minds clear. The various curses in the Undead Magic and the Dark Magic are very effective in the war, so the rulers of various countries often acquiesce in the existence of such wizards, and only the Necromancer who is transformed into an undead is not allowed in the world. This is also due to the great achievements of Rodriguez. Since then, the Church of Light has begun to fully pursue the Necromancer on the Big Six. For more than two decades, this family has almost been extinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the biggest difference between "***" and the general , is smart. Rogge himself did not know why he knew this. The damn necromancer did not give him some magical knowledge, especially without leaving a little bit of knowledge about his treasure house. Every time Rogge stared at the ***, he always felt that *** was also observing him. One person at a time, often staring at the small eyes for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge was a little idle, he was able to transform his equipment little by little under the guidance of Faith. Now, the rich and powerful Rogge can already wear four good magical ringes on his ten fingers. In recent months, the more powerful he uses the mental power to control the magic, although he can only produce one level 3 magic as a five-level wizard. . But now it is easy to release three levels of magic. Rogge’s day and night study is not the most popular fireball on the list of magicians currently on the list of magicians, but the addition of surgery. After many trials, he is now a few syllables that can be shortened, and the time of the mantra is reduced by a third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot weather is slowly passing, and the strength of several scums is enhanced bit by bit. The "Dragon and Beauty" mercenary group also began to take shape. Winnington once secretly observed several trainings of the mercenary group, and then only nodded to Kay. The deadline for the appointment was getting closer and closer, and everyone’s heart began to feel dry. In the past month, with the growing skill of Rennes, he often took his thieves to reconnaissance near Sellersburg, bringing back a lot of useful information. Of course, the theft of Falburg has also increased slightly. I just don’t know how big the remnant of the Necromancer is, and I’ve dug it for half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is currently, a few scums are rare to get out of trouble, but they are working hard. Of course, their sinister tricks, quenching weapons, will never be taken out. Occasionally, fighting is a fight, and the face is also full of knightly spirits. Although a few people on the side would like to go to help the boxing, but under the crowd, the aristocratic identity must be maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
