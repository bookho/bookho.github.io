			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer of the North, sometimes there is an unbearable heat. In the midday sun, the military has always been a bitter for the soldiers who wear the heavy armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the avenue leading to the border area of ​​the Ayre Principality, a force of more than a thousand people is marching. This unit is dominated by infantry. There are only a few knights, and they all seem to be officers. In the sun, the soldiers marched silently regardless of the sweat of their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie rides in the battle, silently looking at the forest slowly approaching in the distance. If the Rebels have an ambush, then the forest in front is the most ideal place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent rebellious activities have become increasingly rampant. According to the latest information, the total number of rebel forces in Latvia has passed 5,000. One of the fastest-growing ones was led by a mysterious young female warrior. Until now, Horn only knows that the female soldier is known as the Bauhinia butterfly, and other backgrounds of identity are unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After living in the North for a while, Charlie knew that Bauhinia butterflies are a kind of plant that can be seen everywhere in the North. The vitality is extremely tenacious and can grow in almost any environment. The Bauhinia butterfly blooms in three years, and the flowers are flowing purple, very beautiful. Its flowering period is very short, only a few hours. After the flowering, there will be countless tiny seeds flying in the wind and falling to a very wide place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest, and then more than a hundred kilometers forward, you will reach a small town located at the foot of the Central Mountain Range. According to Horn's intelligence, the main rebel forces in the near future will hold a rally in this small town to discuss unified actions and overthrow the tyranny of the Ayre Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Charlie took the thousands of fighters and prepared to go to the rebel army. He knew that if he mobilized the big troops, Xia Shang would inevitably resist. As long as Charlie is going to do it, Xia Shang will definitely oppose it. Therefore, Charlie only brought more than a thousand of the most elite warriors with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rebels are scattered around the border. This time, the far-off rebel army will certainly only have a collar and a few followers will be present. Therefore, Horn and Charlie estimated that there were at most 2,000 Rebel fighters in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Charlie’s painstaking training and the baptism of many wars, Charlie is now confident in his soldiers. In his eyes, these rebellious soldiers who are full of blood and personal combat power are at best only a few rabble, and they will lose in battle with Charlie's regular troops. Therefore, Charlie has been looking for a time to fight against the rebel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rebels also have an advantage. They got the support of the local people, and Xia Shang, the administrative officer who spared no effort to fight Charlie, secretly helped, so he had an advantage in intelligence. They can often be turned into small units, run away or hide. Although Charlie thought of all kinds of methods, he could only catch a few disgusting rebel fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town is the base of the Bauhinia butterfly. This time against the military alliance, she is in need of a big victory to boost morale. Charlie, a small number of troops, was alone in the army and was sure to fight against the army. As long as the leaders of the Rebels have a little military mind, they will definitely be ambushed in the middle of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence in the distant forest, which seems to be sleeping in the midday sun. Charlie knew that there must be a lot of defensive forces in the area. After all, such a vast forest, a bird on both sides of the road could not be seen, obviously not normal. Charlie looked at the forest and sneered. He finally waited for the timing of the decisive battle, and it will be time for these rebel forces to know the cruelty of the frontal battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all the Spartan knights among the thousands of fighters. Except for the original Golden Lion Knight, others have given up the horse and changed to walk. . After the battle, once the position of the Bauhinia butterfly was determined, Charlie would lead the Spartan knights to attack her. He wants to kill the Bauhinia butterfly by himself, so as to endure the aftermath of the Principality. Even without the support of more than two hundred new Spartan knights, only relying on the original 30 gold lion knights, Charlie is also sure to kill the Bauhinia butterfly in the chaos. After all, no decent strong is the deadly weakness of the rebels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there have been more adventurer groups and some mercenaries in the Rebels, and there must be several magicians. To this end, Charlie deliberately brought more than a dozen elf magic shooters on the dark side of the moon. The elf's remote magical arrows are volleyed, and on the battlefield will be the nightmare of any unprotected magician. As for the Tikton warriors and other dark-faced warriors of the month, they are staying at this time. Their power has already been well known. If Charlie took these two troops, he would definitely not want to see a rebel fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still a few kilometers from the forest, and these extremely elite troops have time to complete the formation when the enemy rushes to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie looked at the forest coldly, and he had patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is slowly moving in the sky. Suddenly there were several long horns in the forest, followed by a noisy, thousands of anti-competition soldiers rushed out of the forest and began to line up outside the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie observed the process of the rebel army and slowly smiled. A knight next to him has already counted the number of the Rebels at a total of more than 2,700. Among them, nearly 2,000 people command unified, it should be the main force of the Bauhinia butterfly, and the remaining 800 people should belong to other resistance forces. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another knight continued: "They lacked knights and heavy armored warriors and could not effectively deal with our assault." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the Rebels have completed their array and started to move forward. Charlie called the leader of the Elf Shooter and identified the mixed magicians in the Rebels. Give him a fight together, the main task of the shooters is to shoot these magicians. Charlie and identify, while carefully watching the rebel army, every detail is not missed. Finally, his eyes lit up, to the side The two assistants said: "You pay attention to the female knight wearing the blue armor in the center of the left wing of the opponent. It should be the Bauhinia butterfly! After a while, you will attack me with me, I will kill her in the shortest time! As long as she dies, the rebel army will inevitably be in chaos. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Charlie has seen a Bauhinia butterfly on the battlefield, a knight estimated to be between 10 and 12.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the rebel army approached hundreds of meters away, it gradually accelerated until it screamed for charge! They were like a shocking wave, rushing to the seemingly fragile reef !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the reefs are not moving, but the waves are shattered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These elite warriors The role at this moment is undoubtedly obvious, how do the superior enemy attack, they are firmly holding the line of defense, tripping the enemy one by one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out the time has come, long Scream, pull the gun and rush to the Bauhinia Butterfly!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the brave Spartan Knight, the Rebel Soldier is like a thick cheese , was easily cut open.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie sighs, the guns flicker and smash, and the enemy in front of them stabbed one by one. His eyes are tight The Bauhinia butterfly was locked. The Bauhinia butterfly was still very calm, commanding the soldiers to block Charlie's assault troops. Charlie secretly sneered, and when he was closer, he would leave the assault troops behind him, single out and kill the man in one fell swoop. The leader of the Rebels.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is as expected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is full of anger, The whole person jumped, such as Changhong Jingtian, in the blink of an eye, it was less than ten meters away from the Bauhinia butterfly! The Charlie gun has been lifted, and a small group of dazzling milky white brilliance is lit up on the tip of the gun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bauhinia butterfly is still calm and indifferently watching Charlie.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie instinctively feels something wrong, But at this moment, he couldn’t hesitate. He shouted, and the guns took a piece of brilliance and flew to the Bauhinia butterfly!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rebel soldiers instinctively jumped and tried Use the body to block Charlie's guns, but the guns silently plunged into their chests and wore them from the back. Degree did not slow <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; moments gunpoint gun battle milky white light has lit up the breastplate Bauhinia butterfly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the gun suddenly condensed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bauhinia butterfly suddenly stretched out a hand and grabbed the gun that Charlie threw. When the hand touched the gun, the violent flame on the gun suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie was shocked and stared, and this is now a very tall and strong elf standing next to the Bauhinia butterfly. He wears a robes on his body and can't see any defensive equipment. He can only feel his extraordinary in the silver magic pattern that can be seen everywhere on bare skin. This tall elf sneered at Charlie, his eyes faintly disdainful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't waited for the ideal to understand this problem. The whole world in front of him suddenly turned into a silver, and the body lost control. All the power and vitality were quickly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last moment of his dying consciousness, his life’s experience flashed in his head like a thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this last moment, Charlie suddenly felt that his life was so empty...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sturdy mahogany desk was smashed by the angry Rogge, and the high-volume files on the table fluttered, and the paper fluttered like snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn lowered his head and crouched on the ground, not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed his eyes. If it was not easy, he suppressed the anger in his heart and slowly asked: "How many people have escaped?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn trembled: "No one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is silent again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the news that should be passed back from the Rebels, Rogge already knew the battle of the day. Horn didn't know who the mysterious elf was, but Rogge knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, in this matter, Rogge knew that Horn had tried his best. It is impossible to grasp the whereabouts of Nicholas by a more rigorous and effective intelligence network. In front of him, those elite warriors are vulnerable. On that day, in a short period of time, almost all the senior officers were killed by Nicholas. The command of the Bauhinia Butterfly is also good, making full use of the short-term confusion of the other side and completing the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who broke through the bloody war, who escaped to the heart of Nicholas? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a chaos that made Rogge’s dedication to the Ayre Principality. The death of Hilley, Charlie, the departure of Frey, the awkwardness of Auntie, this is what Rogge had not expected. Now that he has a vast land, millions of people, and a hundred thousand army, he can't find a person to worry about him. How can he not be angry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what makes Rogge even more annoyed is that although he succeeded in turning Nicholas from Silver Dragon to Elf, Rogge still had no way to take him. The silver dragon egg is indeed like a hostage, it can threaten Nicholas, but the use is limited. Once Nicholas ignored it, Rogge couldn’t do anything about it. Can you really make a silver dragon egg? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s anger is venting, and he has to anger his other goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Horn! I don't care what you do, within two weeks, I must make sure that the bottom of the damn Bauhinia butterfly is clear. Since we can't catch her, first grab all the people who have a relationship with her! If you can't do it in two weeks, Horn, you should consider the consequences yourself!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn’s cold sweat is straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge indulged, and said: "Xia Shang has been in the scenery for so long, it should be enough! It is time to finish."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn carefully asked: "Adult, how are you going to deal with the Earl of Xia Shang?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue Cold Coldly said: "He has smashed such a big disaster this time, the public anger is so high, of course, it is a genocide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn’s heart is cold, not dare to interject . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are also those who are not self-sufficient adventurers and mercenaries can not let go! In the future, all the adventurers who stand on the side of the Rebels will be Crucified on the stakes, then inserted at the main intersection to show the anti-military adventurers and mercenaries, we can also use! For those who see the money to open a reward! Let the adventurer to deal with adventurers, mercenaries Go and clean up the mercenaries! For the time being, you should do it right away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a big city bordering the Astrofic Empire in the Principality of Layton, The moving crowds gradually subsided until the night. In this city, the Cathedral of Wisdom’s Eyes has just been completed, and the Virgin Mora first came here to host the opening ceremony for the church. In order to witness the legendary goddess who was born in miracles, tens of thousands of people crowded the square in front of the church. The saints heard the voices of the believers, and they temporarily presided over the ceremonies for the gathering of believers and prayed for them to lead the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the entire square is a big magical array. With the support of more than a dozen intelligent eye magicians, the natural charm of Mora has been increased by several times. Therefore, as long as you participate in the ceremony hosted by Mora, whether you are willing or not, you have to become a believer in the goddess. Where do these ordinary people resist the natural charm of Mora? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curious and herd is the nature of most people. When people who have seen each other have become believers of the goddess after attending the ceremony hosted by the Virgin Mora, they will be curious, even those who hold the unbelief idea, and want to see what Mora is. What does it look like, what makes her ceremony different? However, every time Mora presided over the ceremony, the selected squares were not very large, and at most they could squeeze about 10,000 people. Most of this 10,000 people are already fanatical believers, and the position that can be reserved for those who want to see the lively is very limited. Every time Mora visits a city that has been visited, the competition between the old and new believers is extremely fierce in order to seize a position. There are even believers who sleep in the square a few days in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time after the ceremony, the fanatical believers are still reluctant to disperse. Until the eyes of wisdom teach the staff to persuade, saying that the saint needs rest at this moment, please go back. The believers left quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge prayer room behind the church, Mora, who is in white, is alone in front of the blazing flame. Since she was happy with Rogge, her temperament has become more holy and ethereal, and her power has become more and more unpredictable. Whenever you kneel before this altar, Mora’s body will have a faint radiance, and beauty will not be square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other important figures of the Eye of Wisdom, many people are ambitious. They did not take Mora in the early days, but she was the goddess personally resurrected and appointed. The saint, this reluctantly accepts Mora’s command. If Mora was a very powerful saint warrior with a little power, it is not that these people can see through it. Mora seems to have gradually separated from the world, her eyes are coincident with the eyes of the goddess. Although her vindictiveness is still stagnant, no one in the church has ever challenged her. The majesty and sacredness that she is increasingly exposed to, the best explanation is that she has become a theologian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different from ordinary priests and pastors, they have the ability to directly acquire divine power, which has always been a symbol of mystery. Their power is derived from God and is determined by God. The power of the oracle is not only determined by the magic that they can cast. Among them, they are as powerful as the embodiment of God in this world, and they are weak and vulnerable. Depending on the care of God, even the gods of the same god have strengths and weaknesses. Even powerful ones will suddenly become weak, and weak people will become very powerful because of God's sudden care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being enemies with the gods, there are always some accidents and variables. Attacking the theologian, in a sense, is tantamount to directly ignoring the gods that the gods believe. However, being a godsman is by no means a symbol of invincibility. Not to mention the number of gods that have been recorded and have shown miracles, many powerful creatures of other planes can also provide strength, and they are not afraid of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep, and sooner, it will usher in the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards at the door of the church are yawning bored. Their role is just to look like it, wearing such a gorgeous heavy armor, everyone knows not to catch up with any thief. However, at this moment, the church is home to the Virgin Mora and a number of magicians. There should be no such stupid thief to choose to steal at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bright moonlight, the two shadows quickly and silently approached the two guards. The two guards could not be said to have any strength, and they were still ignorant of such an obvious attack. Until the throat was cut open, they were so terrified that they were so soft, but no sound was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the church bell suddenly...when it sounded twice. The whole church was illuminating, and there was a noisy voice inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, a tall figure emerged from a huge old tree. He snorted and thought that they had such a brilliant thief, and they would install an alarm trap on the guard's armor. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another figure that looks thin and old is also coming out of the old tree. His wand in his hand is faintly said: "Levi, this it's not a big deal. Whether it is a dark attack or a strong attack, the result is the same. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levy said: "Now she is probably a magician, maybe we will be a little troublesome." Master Baroque, what do you think? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levi said: "Master Baroque, it seems that there are some talents in the eyes of wisdom. I will clean up with you, Mora. After all, she is our most important goal. You know, it is often difficult for the gods to cope. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baroque categorically: The main characters of the great man, the eye of wisdom are in this church, it is not easy to get them all done, your mission is no better than mine. light. Do as planned! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was said, Baroque’s body burst into a thick smoke, turning into a vine that could not be twisted and smashed into the ground.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levy sighed and took a huge double-edged sword from the back, pointing his hand to the church. A strange scream and shouts rang, and countless shadows were hidden from the body. In the same place, rush to the church of the Eye of Wisdom!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce battle unfolds in every corner of the church.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levy looked at a seriously injured magician who was escaping under the cover of the congregation. He snorted and screamed, and in a twinkling of an eye he became a four-meter, fierce dragon. The back leg of the dragon is so strong that it easily jumps from the end of the church hall, which is tens of meters wide, to the other end, and is in front of the magician.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In the horror of the wizard, the dragon's front paws flashed and shattered him and several of his entourage into pieces.<br /><br />&nbsp;& After a smog, Levi regained his human form, his huge double-edged sword swept backwards, and cut a soldier who tried to sneak into two segments.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is getting more and more intense.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levi’s brow wrinkles. The talent in the eyes of wisdom is far from his previous estimate. The planned massacre has now become a fierce battle. It seems that the decision of the Presbyterian Church is very correct. If the eyes of wisdom are allowed to go on, it will not be long before the situation may be unable to clean up. Unfortunately, here he is Only so many people can be mobilized. If he can give him another month, then the current battle will once again become a unilateral massacre. But who knows when Mora will come to the border again? The Presbyterian Church has repeatedly warned that you must not enter the territory of the Principality of Aray. The wise elders must be justified.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levy sighs, He has the confidence to kill the eyes of the wisdom of the public, but the loss of his men will not be too small. As for the Pakistan He didn't need to worry about it. As a member of the Presbyterian Church, his ability is unquestionable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby of the Guild Wars suddenly sounded clear and bright. Voice: It’s so lively!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the screams, roars and screams in the church hall are so loud, this voice is still clear Into everyone's ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levi’s heart glimpsed, looking at the sounds, and saw a blue-sworded swordsman slowly entering the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue clothes on his body broke a few mouths, but it seemed to have just been drilled out of the thorns. The short chestnut looks like grass and grass, It is not from the hands of professional teachers. He has a long sword hanging from his waist. It can be seen from the gorgeous scabbard that this sword is not a product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levi’s eyes were immediately drawn to his face. His face was so handsome that he was so charming. And the more you look at it, the more you feel that he is thrilled. Even though there were a few faint scars on his cheeks, it did not detract from his temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this swordsman has a strange feeling that Levi can’t understand and can’t measure. He couldn't even tell what it felt like to be, and where it came from. Will it be the same eyes that are as deep as the blue lake that never bottoms out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman walked straight into the church, and a pair of people in front of him who were fighting were suddenly separated by an invisible hand. As soon as he raised his hand, he put the soldier in the eye of the eye of wisdom in his hand. Levi was shocked. He only felt that there was a flower in front of him. He did not see how the man came to the swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye of the wisdom of the warrior has just been very brave, but at this time, I do not know why, scared and shivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are the holy ladies Mora hiding? "The blue swordsman shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman snorted and said coldly: "You refuse to say, I can't find her. Can't see it, you are still faithful, and spare you this time!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hand loose, the soldier immediately fell to the ground and could no longer stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid, who was still fighting with the warrior, was happy, and Levi was quietly relieved. Nadruyi cautiously said: "We are the wrath of the sky in the city of Druid, the wrath of the sky, come to clear the eyes of cult wisdom, what is your intention?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Swordsman smiles of course is to find the trouble of Mora. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was just a joy in the heart of Druid, and the voice of the swordsman turned cold: "But I haven’t counted the accounts of your city." Finish it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levy was shocked, just rushed to the side, and saw the blue light shining! Levi can only protect himself at the moment, desperately resisting The blue brilliance of pervasiveness. Fortunately, the other side’s violent storm-like offensive quickly stopped, and Levi was relieved. This moment of fierce battle has already made him sweaty and almost consumed all of it.斗气.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is quiet and unusual. Levi looked up and looked at it as if he had sunk into the icy lake.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the eyes of wisdom are standing there, they are still in a fighting posture. And the people on the Druid side have now become a statue of a blue crystal, not The dissipating of the residence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman faintly said: "Let you commit suicide, it is estimated that you will not. Still let me send you on the road! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levy has a flower in front of him, a swordsman who is still a dozen meters away has appeared in front of him, a hand that is too delicate for a man. It is slowly recovering.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of blue has inundated the consciousness of Levi...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the prayer room of the ministry, Baroque is squatting with Mora. The prayer room is full of traces of a magical battle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mora! Baroque laughed: "It's rare to have such a great skill at your age." Unfortunately, all your magic defenses have been cracked by me now, and your previous magical attack has no effect on me. Still give up! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora, standing in front of the altar, said quietly: "Are you going to the massacre of the goddess O'Reilly? Will it conform to the teachings of the goddess of nature?" Perhaps the goddess of nature should be renamed the goddess of death. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baroque shouted: "How dare you marry the goddess of nature!" Balance is the eternal theme of nature, and the existence of Rogge has seriously undermined the balance of nature. As a fellow party, you are also not allowed to seek a balance of Druid! Now it’s so quiet outside, all your men have gone to see the goddess you believe in, and you, you have to go the same way with them! Do you have any skills, use it as soon as possible, otherwise, will your goddess really come to save you personally? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora gently pulled the chaos and faintly said: "Why not?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when, the robes of a gray robe quietly emerged from the flames of the altar. Her expressionless silver cymbals are watching coldly. The stunned Baroque.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the central part of the thick door of the prayer room was suddenly dyed with a layer of blue, and the blue part disappeared and a small appeared. The door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Swordsman Shi Shiran stepped into the prayer room and smiled: "The outside is of course quiet, because all the Druids have been killed by me. Now! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, she lost the voice: "You really are here!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blue swordsman is Androni. Her eyes are bright, staring at the ***, pulling out the stars.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Block looks at the blue-starred Androni who is slowly rising in the air and can’t help but be horrified. He never imagined that he would meet here anyway. People in the Sanctuary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni struggled to raise the starry sky little by little, just like holding a heavy piece of weight, saying: "Let’s go in more than one. This time, let me meet you, you don’t want to run away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora was taken aback and looked at Androni in disbelief. In the eyes of the cherished eyes of the faithful eye, the people in the sanctuary are only the strongest of the world, and cannot be compared with the demeanor of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Emei wrinkles: "You are too bold. I will pack you up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In a moment, Baroque’s trembling hand could no longer hold the wand in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at Baroque and looked at something useless. He couldn’t run anyway. It wouldn’t be a big deal for him to live more. I am trying to cultivate, just to wait for the moment. Do you still accept my challenge first? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baroque trembled and found a magic scroll, and the result of the start of the spell was wrong. After several times, the scroll was successfully started, and the smoke was rising. Immediately turned into a group of green vines, they wanted to go underground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Silver 眸 一 亮 亮 ??<br /><br />&nbsp ;Break somehow, suddenly changed back from the vine to the human form, then slammed into the hard marble floor, and broke his head and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said with a clear voice: "Okay! Let's fight now!" She turned into a blue meteor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** One left hand, a silver light curtain will cover the Mola, and then the back wings will show up, Androni suddenly felt a The strong gravity of the stock has come from above, and it has been swept away from the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was shocked at the bottom of her heart, this is the first time she experienced the gravity control of ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s fighting spirit, his body shape flickering and swaying, and the blue sky swaying out of the blue brilliance, and rushing to the *** . But the powerful gravitational moments are hidden, the direction is uncertain, and every time Androni's body is involuntarily biased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Slightly dodge in a very small space, letting all the offensives of Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, *** was a little impatient, and her right hand punched Androni! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was shocked and hurried back, and at the same time laid countless blue brilliance in front of him. These blue brilliance have some hard gears, some cross-loads, and some more virtual ones disappear. Judging from this perfect defensive technique, Androni’s mastery of power is already superb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the power of that punch was completely resolved by Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but rejoice in her heart and shouted: "I can finally block your attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" *** The cold voice suddenly sounded behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was shocked. When he tried to escape, he had already caught the back neck. She was completely powerless at the moment, and she was turned over like a kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will be so rude in the future, I will kill you." *** Cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And although there is no resilience, Androni still does not show weakness that the silver plaque will not kill me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to die? "The voice of *** has a tremor, and her right hand is slowly gripping.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is smart and has seen *** Not in a good mood, but she still said: "Then you do it! "When you stop, you will close your eyes and wait for death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time lapses quietly in silence, the world in the prayer room seems to be solidified, nothing is born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
