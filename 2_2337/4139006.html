			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh Day Book Volume 6 Redemption (2)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you walk into the Purgatory Angel Hall Rogge will have a new experience. This mysterious hall, standing quietly with eleven giant statues, seems to hide the mystery of endlessness. Whenever there is a new breakthrough, or a new harvest, and then set foot here, Rogge will feel that he has uncovered a veil on the mysterious hall, and his outline is more clearly seen. However, when each layer of yarn is lifted, the Purgatory Angel Hall will be like the most shy girl, still hiding the true face under the veil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a cool wind in the gloomy hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge did not realize that the wind is different from the usual wind, but this time he noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind comes from nothingness, and goes to nothingness. In fact, these unpredictable winds are simply nowhere to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Rogge at the moment, these winds are no longer ordinary winds, but the gathering of countless secrets of information and energy flow. The wind blows from the void, and the tangible or invisible consciousness and strength everywhere in the hall produces a complex and incomprehensible exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space of the hall is marginal, but these winds seem to be completely unrestricted by these tangible margins, and they carry these new information all the way. Disappeared in endless distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment in the eyes of Rogge, the entire hall of the Infernal Angel seems to have come alive, every inch of earth and stone, every dust is full of endless secrets. It is like a omniscient and omnipotent god, looking down on Rogge coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog suddenly understood. This hall of the Infernal Angel does not belong to this plane at all. Its history of existence, perhaps longer than the history of the entire plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally saw the true side of the Purgatory Angel Basilica, but still has no understanding of the secrets it contains. In other words, the mystery contained in this temple is too much, and he cannot understand it all. Although after reading the book of Hilo. Rogge's eyes have been able to receive thousands of messages in an instant, but to understand even a little bit of information in this hall. Rogge also didn't know that he needed to spend tens of thousands of years to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, no corner of the Purgatory Angel Hall is in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge just smiled a little and walked to the end of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Hall of the Twins still stands quietly in the deepest part of the temple, and the empty temple is dead. On the other side, the statue of Fengyue floats in the air, and there is no gloss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s footsteps echoed in the empty hall. There is no trace of anger at all. It seems that there is no life in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am back, have you been waiting for a long time?" Rogge stood in front of the statue and stared for a long time before he murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly raised his hands and reached the statue of the windy moon, and then a low-pitched spell sprang from his mouth. Wandering around the statue. Numerous subtle pale golden magic symbols ooze out of his hands, turning into a faint golden mist that gradually envelopes the huge statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lengthy spell, the statue began to shrink little by little, eventually returning to the size of a real person, slowly descending from the air. Trapped in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the luster of the jade, it doesn’t even look like a statue, it’s just a sleepy moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stretched out his hands and fell asleep in the wind and slowly fell into his arms. He gently stroked the black hair of the wind and the mirror, for a long time, only sighed, whispered: "Feng Yue, I am back. You see, I have finished reading the book of Hilo, although stuck in the seventh page It's been a long time, but I still came out. There is also the ability to protect you. I know that you have been waiting too long and too long this day. Hehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge was silent for a moment, a mouth, a lavender starburst floating out of the mouth. Look closely, you will find that this weak star is actually composed of numerous purple halo. These auras are centered on a certain point and rotate according to their own rules. At the center of all auras, a mark can be seen faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Rogge smiled a little. He recalled the time when the wind and the moon were in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a happy memory...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Rogge finally Woke up in his memory, his eyes fell on the eyebrows of Fengyue. The purple mang moved with his gaze, and he slowly fell into the wind and eyebrows, slowly infiltrating into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a purple brilliance illuminates inside the statue, almost making the statue transparent! In this intense purple light, the edge of the statue began to blur, and for a moment, the image of another statue began to grow and gradually separated from the statue of Fengyue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at the image of the statue, and looked nervous, until the image finally became an entity, he was relieved and grew a Tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the statue is the same as the wind and moon, the only difference is that the face of the new statue is a blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new statue rises and returns to the place where Fengyue originally floated, and it settled down. And Fengyue, there is a trace of anger. However, her eyes did not open and she still fell asleep peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge seems to have foreseen the appearance of such a result, completely without a trace of surprise, just silently watching her face, seems to be everything They are all printed in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he sighed and said: "I really want to accompany you to leave this plane, leave all the troubles, and open up to a quiet place. It belongs to our plane. But I can't go now, sorry, for the next ten million years, I can only let you spend it alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Slowly and gently bow your head and gently kiss on the lips of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her lips are soft, cold, and greasy, and the indescribable touch does not only infiltrate Rogge’s lips, but also penetrates his heart, his soul. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment has been branded into his soul. But Rogge doesn't know how long this brand can last. He intuitively, it won't take long, and this brand will die out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because his soul will cease to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge raised his head, no longer hesitated, his right hand swayed over the windy moon, his hand over, and sprinkled the fluffy silver powder. The silver powder quickly condensed into a myriad of thin silver wires, one end of which was attached to the wind and the other end to the other side. There was a very large silver wire, and he was connected with her, and the silver silk was shining and it could not be seen. But somehow, this silver wire always reveals a sad sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These silver filaments that appear are the connection between the wind and the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved his left hand, the space of the hall immediately burst out of the wave * water pattern, the body of the wind and moon is like a leafy boat, with the water waves not swaying . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge raised his right hand, but his hand was as heavy as a thousand, and every time he lifted a point, he seemed so hesitant and so difficult! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he can't see, he can't hear. However, this farewell moment, where can he dare to see, where to listen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is still sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can’t see or hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not know that her body began to slide slowly on the water ripples, drifting toward the deep, dark space in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also does not know, that countless silver silk, has been turned between Rogge, turned into a beautiful silver flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, one minute and one second, it’s more than a thousand years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
