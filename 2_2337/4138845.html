			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Heaven in Chapter 14 on Bloodmoon<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 14 Bloodmoon<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister’s Office is already in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing a block and rushing to the creek-filled stream, Justin was safe. He didn't know that there was a god of death behind him. He was just anxious to find the therapist and exorcist in the prime minister's office. The high temperature of the devil's flame is still eroding his internal organs, and if it is treated later, the injury will cause permanent damage to his magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, he is very proud of his decision. Even the seventh-order magic ice gun can't penetrate the opponent of the body, and he is not willing to face it. Justin doesn't know what kind of magical equipment the robe of the fat man is, and he will have such a powerful magic resistance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! A dull scream, the fat man who let Justin escaped from the sky, blocked his way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justin clenched his wand and ooze cold sweat from his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a distinguished guest of the Imperial Prime Minister Straw! You know, one more neighborhood is the Prime Minister's Office. Rogge, if you kill I and Charles, Straw adults will never let you go. What's more, as long as I yell, you can't escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justin drives down The voice threatened Rogge. He didn't want to call people, but the magician's action was not agile. At this moment, he was seriously injured. Although there is still a magic for the last fight, but in the face of this extremely strong fat man, Justin does not know. Can this magic work? He was afraid that he would scream and shout, and the fat man who was angry and angry would immediately kill himself. At that time, even if I used the last magic to kill this fat man, it is not worth it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prestige of Straw is far from all corners of the empire, and even the most remote Ayre is no exception. Justin was delighted to see that the fat man obviously began to hesitate, but he still dared not relax his vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly shook his head and said: "No! If I let you go back, I am afraid that after a few minutes you will bring people to kill me." Not to mention that you still know that Charles is in my hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justin said immediately: "You can rest assured! I will never say anything tonight. The grudge between you and Straw, I will never get involved in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man immediately interrupted him: "How can I believe you? Well, we are all magicians. Unless you swear in the name of the god of magic, I will not let you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justin laughs Fatty stupid, the god of magic, Mistral, has never shown any miracles, and many great magicians even question whether she has ever existed. But what if you swear in the name of the Most High God? Regardless of who swears in his name, as long as he returns to the prime minister's house and suppresses the injury, he will immediately bring someone back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justin laughed at Rogge’s innocence in his heart. I sincerely said: "Okay! I, Justin Wilmer, the god of magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vowed not finished yet, Looking at the fat man who was standing ten meters away in amazement, he appeared in front of him and hit an elbow on his chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing that Justin heard was the sound of his sternum being broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge carefully removed the wand from Justin’s hand and slowly dissipated the powerful magic contained in the wand, which was played against the deadly Justin. One foot. Ruan said: "Play with me to swear this trick, with you also?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty carefully observed a wand, only to admire: "Sure enough ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately solved the wizard's robe of Justin, and for a long time, his face finally passed a burst of joy. This dark blue mage robe is really a sequencer robe, every magician will dream of a robe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sequencer robes have a magical 'enhanced magic sequence' attached to it. You can store one of the five or seven steps of magic, and you can instantly send it with the wizard's startup password when needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge immediately rudely put the robe on himself. Then, he searched Justin again, this time there is nothing worthwhile to find a magic note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and looked at the prime minister’s house at the end of the long road, hidden in the night, wondering what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark prime minister is like a monster, staring at Rogge quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly sneered, picking up Justin’s body. Exhale and open. Throw the body out with a bang! The body suddenly crossed the 100-meter long road and fell into the dark prime ministerial palace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was immediately hidden in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment. Outside a few blocks, Rogge kicked a window on the fourth floor of a residential building and jumped in and applied a silent magic in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of young men and women who are lingering in the middle of the room are sitting up, they scream loudly, of course, under the influence of silent magic, they have a little voice Did not send out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his huge axe, and the young men and women immediately hugged and hugged together, no longer dare to make a sound. The young woman looks glamorous and hot, and the fat man can't help but look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man removed the mute enchantment and smiled and said: "You continue, when I don't exist!" He said, he came to the window. From here, you can just look at the prime minister's house in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mute enchantment in the room has been withdrawn, but there is no other voice besides the slight tremors of the young men and women. The fat man’s huge axe shining in the blue light is still in front of them. They are scared too late, and how can they feel ‘continue’? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood quietly in front of the window for an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister’s office is still black and dead. Justin's corpse is like a small stone that has been thrown into the deep pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer you look at it, the more Rogge feels that something in the prime minister's office is calling him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is hard to say clearly, which is both kind, threatening, and tempting. Rogge is increasingly convinced. There must be something hidden in the depths of the prime minister's house! This thing can't stop calling his soul, and the sound is getting louder and louder. Almost every heart of Rogge beats once, and a thunderous call will blow up in his ear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s breathing is getting faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of examples of fateful calls in history books. But is this kind of thing happening to fat people tonight? What would it be like to call him in the prime minister's house? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge didn’t realize that the whole body had been soaked by cold sweat. His hand grasped the steel tomahawk. The giant axe handle of the Empire’s heavy infantry system began to distort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister’s Gate suddenly opened, and two teams of soldiers of about 100 people emerged. Under the leadership of more than ten different costumes. These warriors spread quickly and spread out in a fan shape, which seemed to be searching for something. Rogge knows that their search target is Charles. Looking at this style, the Prime Minister should put a magic mark on Charles on the track, and within a certain range will feel the existence of Charles, so the samurai will search for such a fan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the warriors were dispersed, Rogge finally jumped out of the window. As a ghost, rushed to the prime minister's house in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his figure disappeared at the other end of the high wall of the Prime Minister’s Court, the black behemoth suddenly came alive and laughed silently. Quietly in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, it is destined to be a calm night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon on the edge of the moon in the blue moon, quietly dyed the color of a bloody sample. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is supposed to be a very peaceful night, but Richelieu has quietly woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for a long time. These two figures have circled around the circle of Richelieu! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi’s beautiful face was covered with a layer of ice, and the blue eyes were completely turned into silver. Her blonde hair is flying, her eyes are so bright, her hands are holding the cross sword on her chest, and the trembled sword tip is far away from the distance and is madly fleeing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her speed is too fast, long after passing the ground. The dirt on the ground will burst open, leaving a deep ditch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locked by her cross sword is Hughes. It’s just that the elder elders are no longer calm and elegant at the moment. He is sweating and gnashing his teeth, and he is running all the way regardless of his image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old fox and Serrafi’s destination were both Richelieu, and as soon as Serafi arrived at the emperor, he immediately noticed the atmosphere of the old fox. She didn't hesitate for a moment, and in a moment she crossed the distant distance and killed it in the hiding place of Xiusi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes did not say anything, of course, immediately fled. Under Serrafi's arrogant cross sword, he will not have any opportunity to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just use the space feature to flash a few times. Hughes found that every flash would be close to Serafila. He immediately changed to use the vindictive low-altitude. It’s just that Serrafi is like a fish, and the speed is obviously much faster than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiusi secretly complained. He eventually changed to a stupid way to hit the ground, so the speed is slow, but the transition is very easy. If Serrafi is still plundering with vindictiveness, it is easy to overshoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, he changed this, and Cerafi had to change to this stupid way. It’s just the tip of her cross sword, still close to Hughes little by little! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of Richelieu, a blood that cannot be seen by ordinary people has risen, echoing the edge of the bloody blue sky. Both Xius and Serafi have noticed this blood, but Serafi has no intention of stopping to kill, and Hughes has to continue to run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that neither of them wants to leave Richelieu too far, so they circle around Richelieu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is getting richer and thicker, and it’s the Prime Minister’s house in Straw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi suddenly burst into golden brilliance, the speed suddenly increased, and the distance from Xiusi quickly approached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled a bit and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serahfi suddenly settled in front of him, the cross sword leaned to the ground, cold and cold: "Don't pretend, do it!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes looked at the blood of Richelieu with anxiety and whispered: "Welcome, God has made the adult just enter the Prime Minister's Office, and his situation must be dangerous. Now It’s really not the time for us to fight. If you must have a fight with me, would you say it again?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's more," Hughes added: " How is your interest so great for a battle that is destined to win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi is cold and succinct: "If I have the absolute grasp to defeat you, Then I really won't be interested in you anymore. But every time I meet you, there will be some accidents. I can't always explore your details. Since every accident is happening, then this will never be an accident! I don't want to use me. Remind, you also know that if I am stabbed with a sword, the strength will be greatly damaged. You are like ! Want to die, it would be best to fight it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; her eyes suddenly light up, sent bursts of melodious sounds of chirping on cross swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes screamed: "God makes the adult dangerous! You don't save him, what if he is killed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Serafi Cross Sword brings a faint ripple and cuts away from Xiusi. She calmly said: "He is not so easy to die. Not to mention that he is dead, no big deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xius looked at the path of the cross sword Ripple, the number of faces changed, and the sweat on his forehead was like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
