			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of Bora City spent a few days in tension and uneasiness, but the legendary undead army never came, and the Latvians shrank in Leipzig. It seems that I am not prepared to continue the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Latvian army on the front line is equally awkward. The king’s special envoy had rushed to Leipzig to find out the necromancer who had never seen it before. The four magicians in the military are the most suspicious objects, but the messengers can't be too embarrassed. After all, the magician still plays a big role in the war, and can summon many undead creatures and even summon the bone dragon. The Necromancer is not the messenger who is willing to offend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Latvians frustrated is that they don’t say that they have not borrowed from the undead, and even their soldiers have a lot of damage on them. . The Latvians are now suffering heavy losses and their strength is less than 30,000. Going to attack and defend the sturdy Bola City, it is fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Rogge is also not interested in counterattacking Leipzig. What he does in Bora City every day is to strengthen training and consolidate city defense. In the middle of the night, I went into Androni’s room and tried to go wrong. But every time the ending is that he was beaten up and thrown out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warcome with Androni in the narrow room, even if his magic is longer than three or five, it can never be her opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man is not tired, and he has repeatedly defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni lived well and couldn’t suffer, even in the military camp, he brought a few nightdresses with him. When Rogge sneaked, she was often in a state of ignorance, but she could beat Rogge by instinct. Only when she raised her hand, the nightdress fluttered, and the beauty of the scenery at that moment was really different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is thick and thick, and there was nothing to beat her. However, Androni attacked every single leg, and more than a dozen sacred and starry airs were intertwined, and his lethality was extremely great. Rogge would be knocked down to the ground in a few moments and then thrown out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, after the first night attack, Rogge moved Androni’s bedroom from the fifth floor to the second floor. As for the selfishness of the bread here, it is a digression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being hit by Androni, the pain is far more than the knife and fire, Rogge initially wanted to give up. But as soon as I remembered Androni’s saying, “If there is such a day, I will recognize what I have!”, he can’t hold back a lively heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is gradually showing that this nightly routine sneak attack and embarrassment are actually rewarding. A few days later, Androni’s fist was not as painful as the first day. She has no mercy, but Rogge has the same physique as Warcraft. Under this daily hell, it is becoming more and more rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another benefit is that Rogge’s body is finally fully adapted to the permanent effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits don't stop there. With Androni's close-fighting melee, he has become more and more aware of the magician's melee tactics, and his strength has improved. He has made slight progress in the degree, accuracy and control of casting low-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is strong and the darkness can't affect his vision. Every night, Androni, who was exposed to clothing, was close to me. Once he made a mistake, he would be beaten and unwilling to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost the only highlight of Rogge’s military life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night is deep and quiet, and the black wind is high. It is a good time to kill and set fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of people who like darkness and conspiracy will be dispatched at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat at his desk in a ruthless manner, studying hard under the magic ***. Intrigues and tricks are the fate of the fat man, and the military strategy can be worse. Although Charlie, who is familiar with the military strategy, presided over the overall situation, Rogge could not lose without knowing what to do. However, there are always more advantages than the evil weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sat across from Rogge, and a pair of long legs were extremely indecently placed on Rogge’s desk, making the fat man uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had two slender fingers on her right hand crawling on the table, climbing up the back of Rogge's hand and gently clicking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart swayed, looked up and saw her left eye bowing to herself. The last time she had such a sly expression to Rogge, it was the result of Rogge secretly casting her charm after she had done evil. Rogge couldn’t help but sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at Rogge’s expression, Androni knew what he was thinking. She snorted and her face suddenly sank and turned her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s anger and anger caused Rogge to be inexplicable. He was about to ask, and suddenly there was a cold in the back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closed window suddenly slammed into the sky's sawdust, and a black shadow flashed into the room and landed on Rogge's desk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the shadow is light, it seems to be a woman, the martial arts is not low, the toes are steady on a high pile of documents, the body is completely No shaking. She is covered in black and dressed as a standard killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sneered at the night dancer messenger Nicole and came to meet Lord Rogge! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at Nicole with interest, this little guy is not weak, so young is already the killer of the 11th level, still very The future is just a look at the immature appearance of this great joy, knowing that she has just debuted. But the newcomer has this level, this 'night dancer', it seems really can not be underestimated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge’s expression is weird, Nicole smiles again: “You don’t have to be afraid of Rogge. Although I am a killer, my short sword will not hurt you. You are the VIP of our exhibition! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just don't say, I also believe that your short sword will not hurt me. However, the use of the hilt as a weapon killer is really rare! Rog laughed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie was shocked and looked up, and there was only one hilt in her hand. She was proud of it. Sharp short sword, I don’t know when it was cut off by people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This file is not neatly organized, it is not easy to stand still, or me Come and help you sort it out! Androni laughed and saw such a young female killer, and she was guilty of her old-fashioned problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nico's documents The pile suddenly disappeared and appeared in the hands of Androni in a blink of an eye. She arranged the documents in a sly and pretending manner, but Nicole screamed and suddenly lost her balance and fell back to heaven.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rush of a spell in Rogge’s mouth, reaching for a finger, a fire column shot from the fingertips, burning to Nicole. The pillar of fire was falling, it was the face of Nicole’s black scarf. If this is burnt down, even if it doesn't hurt, the face will definitely be ruined.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! "A sudden scream came out of the window. A tall, equally black-faced killer rushed to Nicole and wanted to push her away from the fire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the eyes of Rogge, the silver light flashed, and a silver magic light shield suddenly appeared in front of the killer. He couldn’t catch up and hit the magic light shield on the road! The killer’s momentum was too fierce, just listening to the big bang He slammed into the air and fell heavily on the ground. He was dizzy and couldn’t climb anymore.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the pillar of fire, it was burnt to When Nicole’s face suddenly fell and went up, it rushed two meters before it disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer who rushed in has already cultivated to the thirteenth level. However, he was too concerned about the safety of Nicole, and this was the robbery of Rogge, who was easily knocked down to the ground. It was hard, he struggled to stand up, and he helped the shocked Nicole to step up. Still a little vain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sprint is full of slamming on the wall, It’s so good? He didn’t stun on the spot, it’s already a physique.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light breeze blows out of the window, Nicole’s masked black yarn suddenly turns into a number The butterfly that fluttered. It turned out that this gauze had just been burnt by Rogge’s Yan Zhu. Nicole’s little face was covered with a lot of black ash, but still not obscured, seeing Androni’s eyes One bright.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge looked at the two murderous killers and smiled. "Now we can talk about the night dancers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male killer Shen Sheng "Roger, you have a lot to do, and you can become a VIP of our night dancers. This time we are here to let you know the existence of the night dancers and the way to contact us. My name is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge interrupted him impatiently: "I am not interested in your name, say something right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The man killed almost fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said: "If I lose so much, it will not be self-reported. It is not an important person to see your skills." There is no need to say the name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male killer was not calmed by the blood, and the two men repeatedly spurred, almost a blood spurted out. He snorted and he was going to fight hard. Nicole quickly took him and whispered: "This is not a good thing. We can't tell you when we go back!" The killer had to suffocate his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole Steps Up Night Dancer is the largest underground force in the dark world of the North. In fact, you can understand us as a guild of killers and thieves. Only those who have passed the review of the Presbyterian Church can become our VIPs and get our services. Our VIPs are not the lords of one party, the rich enemies, or the high-powered ones. In the past few hundred years, among the people who sought the services of the night dancers, there have been many strong people in the sanctuary! As long as you have a need, no matter what kind of strange task, the dark night dancers may be reached for you. You see, this is a rare opportunity! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Androni looked at each other and wondered. It sounds like this dark night dancer is a terrible organization, how to send it out These rookies, and the self-promoting rack, are just like a merchant who is desperately selling fakes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Rogge, Nicole Put a boned delicate whistle in front of Rogge and ask you to blow this magic whistle. The night dancer will come to respond to your request. Well, that's it! You have no problem? Then we "Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First wait, I haven't promised yet." Rogge called Nicole and asked: "The night dancers can do anything. Can you get it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course not. But if we can’t do it, you can also use our channels to see if anyone is willing to take this task. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What tasks are all right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter how strange the task, as long as the cost When, the night dancers can serve you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no free lunch in the world. How is your price?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Depending on the content of the task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly said: "If I want to be a very beautiful and profitable woman, How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole's face suddenly turned red, she still insisted: "This is not without precedent. It depends on the woman's interest. To what extent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 16th-level female swordsman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andro Ni's face changed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike is ashamed to say: "The precedent was to get a 14th-level female knight, 100,000 gold coins. According to the practice of the night dancers, every time the vindictiveness increases, the price turns Double. The 16th-level female swordsman should charge 400,000 gold coins. But except for special circumstances, we are not enemies with the Sanctuary. So the service in this area ends here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart is very happy, haha ​​burst into laughter, and the magic whistle is in the arms. This is the case! When I need it, will you whistle to find you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike is a VIP, you can designate a contact. I am very willing to be your contact as long as you like. As long as you blow the magic whistle Even if they are separated by a thousand miles, I will know immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly remembered something and cried, "The next time Nicole, you will come alone. As for who, you don't have to be embarrassed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man The killer is very angry, and he will be desperate to go back. Nicole was in a hurry and worked hard to pull him away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the whistle and suddenly smiled secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare!" Androni looked cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forty hundred thousand gold coins, I can't afford it." Rogge smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have more money? Then give me some, Miss Ben has no money recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You really have more women, this is Miss...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really have itchy skin, don't hit you to vomit blood tonight, I am not Androni!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight? Is this an invitation?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni immediately knew his own language, was shy and angry, and said: "As long as you dare to come!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled so hard to help you hook up the little beauty Nicole, you just repay me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Nicole, she has some heartbeat: "How did you help me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the one who has no name, and it seems to be very interesting to Nicole. Nicole, this little girl must have liked the heroic character. After I humiliated him, I forgive him and no face again. When I summoned Nicole, I was afraid that I couldn’t get it by your skill. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is obviously a little heart-warming, but she still snorted and said that she did not care, and said: "Do you have the task to hand over to others?" The night dancers seem to be unable to take on ordinary tasks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mission of 400,000 gold coins can't be said to be a small task." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to die again!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the bitterness of Rogge, Froya's life can be described as a new life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of the gods is like the spring season, the little goblins enjoy the sunshine every day, and the day and night are idle, the only contribution that can be said is to help Xiusi take care of his tea garden.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day is bright, she will get up. When she dresses up, she goes to the elders of the Hughes, puts on a few snacks, and talks about drinking morning tea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For morning tea, the little goblin doesn't even sleep late.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria was born in the home of the emperor, teacher From the world of Yello, she is known for her richness in her own body. She is also a fusion of artifacts and paradise. The taste is not comparable to the average person. No matter what good things, I want to see her eyes. The tea that Xiusi personally planted is not unique. It is also rare in the world. These days, it has been made by Froya, and it has been a lot of people. For example, in addition to daily morning tea, Luo Ya said that the sun was the warmest time at three o'clock in the afternoon. When I was tired for a day, I should rest and relax. The little goblins made a lot of snacks and asked Shusi to drink afternoon tea.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old foxes are all concentrating on putting a 'historical dust' on their baby tea, but when they think of tea, they can’t stand the test of time, they sigh, they only have to sigh. Nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, two tea parties in the morning and afternoon, the elders of Xiusi can no longer escape.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon's tea party, the old and the young are discussing the magic masters who have been through the past and present. Fu Luoya suddenly turned pale, suddenly fell on the table and burst into tears, choked and said: "My master, he... he died. ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes sighed: "Your Highness, don't be too sad." Everyone will have such a day, just time sooner or later. Master Jero has a rich and colorful life, but he does not say anything. Among the top ten magisters today, dare to plan the tomb of the emperor, except Rodriguez, that is him. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed: "Which dynasty will have a process from happiness to death. Your Highness, are you going to take revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria stunned? What kind of hate is reported? I have nothing now, how can I take revenge? What's more, my uncles and brothers of the royal family are probably the most embarrassing people to me. Even the father, at the crucial moment, I want to sell me. Revenge for them, hehe! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wiped her tears and smiled reluctantly: "I just... I have no relatives at once, so I am saddened." You don't have to worry, I will be fine soon. When I was most sad, when I lost my mother when I was young... Hey! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is desperate, tears do not know that it has flowed again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she suddenly shaking to cry, to Jiyu halo. wept freely after a while, Fu Luoya suddenly admitted to cry out mirror, looks to rush from finishing. <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t call my Highness again!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's alright. Fu Luoya, what are your plans for the future? "At this moment, Hughes is a kind and wise elf elder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Hughes, Froya’s tears can’t help but flow down, she Immediately wiped away the tears and smiled: "I don't know what I should do. In addition to cheating your tea, I have nothing else to do. If it is... If you don't want to take me, I will find someone to marry. You see, I am not too ugly, should I marry it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: "According to my old man, God makes the adult's side is your world." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiled bitterly: "I have nothing now, I am no longer a princess, and Master is gone." Rogge... He is now leaps and bounds in the magic, and he is in the power, and the beauty around him is like a cloud. How can he see me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes adults not such people." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria shook his head and said: "I know him." He is realistic and cold. Now I have nothing but a little color. But the wind butterfly was around him for a long time, and Rogge had never touched her. Although I can't completely understand what he is thinking about now, I know that beauty in his heart will never be a very important thing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Xius smiled and said: "You misunderstood." I mean, God makes the adults mean, shameless, greedy and lascivious, and they are greedy and fearful of death, and do bad things. With your peerless attitude, how can you cheaply like him? These days, watching you have a lot of energy, my old man thought that after a little rest, you have to regroup and vow to be divided with him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya screamed and smiled and fattened more and more powerful, can harm people in the quiet, I have already eaten enough, How can you provoke him again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes said: "God’s conspiracy to make adults is indeed mean and shameless. In my opinion, his There is no limit to the future. In fact, your love and hate can fall on him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only plan for myself, how can I consider my business? Moreover, I still want to kill him not long ago. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes pretending to mysteriously lower the voice: "I heard that God made the adults in the south very beautiful, and later because of a woman, this Only indignantly left everything and went to the North. It can be seen that once he is ruthless and unrighteous, once he has moved the truth, it is no different. I heard that the woman is dead, talented with your looks, and has a great chance to replace her position..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is so excited. Geine Elysses and her betrayal of the Church of Light is very clear to her, and what Hughes said is very reasonable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she does not want to avenge the Bourbon dynasty She hates those uncles who have passed by anyone. The little demon thinks about it completely, it is another thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn *** looks very Tight Rogge... You robbed my Annie, then I will grab your Rogfolia when I will easily admit defeat? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
