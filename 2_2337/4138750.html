			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the temple scandal, the city of the gods suddenly calmed down for a few days. All the elves are secretly rumored that God is experimenting with a new horror spell in order to save the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani is now on the same day. She is waiting for Rogge to appear every day, but Rogge has kept himself in the bottom of the temple, no one knows, just keep doing magic experiments. She squatted at the gate of the water prison several times, sensing the magical fluctuations in the strong and weak, and the heart was getting heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Xiusi moved a full set of tables and chairs, brought a jug of small pots, and kept themselves at the door of the dungeon every day. If you are drunk, you will take a nap on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time Ajani comes over, he will be drunk and drink a few cups and eat a meal. The elders of Xiusi are highly respected, and Ajani will not fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day she couldn’t help but go and see if Rogge came out. As a result, she was caught by Hughes as usual and poured a few glasses of wine to let Her pale gold cheeks reveal a seductive crimson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ajia Ni! Your recent thoughts are very heavy! Are you afraid of Rogge's accident? Don't worry, he won't have anything. This kid, If you die, you can live. What are you afraid of?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Shusi..." Ajani wants to say something, but she wants to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the child has moved into the room of God's ambassador? Oh, good deed! Are you not good friends? Just be a companion ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani slowly lowered her head and said softly: "Elder Sisters, this is not the case. Wind butterfly she... she hates now I hate God to make adults. You said that God is doing the right thing for adults to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The butterfly is so proud of the child, She is determined by one thing, she will do it with all her heart, so you don't have to worry about her. I am very worried about you! You are a good boy, sometimes it is easy to turn around and bend. God makes the adults It’s not all that glory, I know it very well. However, we should believe that Hilo’s choice of the elves is not wrong.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and drank a cup of sprinkles, which satisfied the authenticity: "It is good to have an adult to make an adult! Nothing is going to be used by me." Ajia Ni, you and the butterfly will take care of God's life in the future! Oh, this is the old man's selfishness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni Some are anxious: "Elder Sisters, this is not the case! I feel, I don't know why I know, God made the adults do a terrible thing to Rumsfeld. He and the wind butterfly are my most Good brothers and sisters! And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani hesitated for a long time and finally said with courage: "God makes the adults against anything against him. People, always have no mercy, although they love him very much, but I also know how terrible it is to be his enemy! This time I was rescued, I don’t know why, I suddenly felt that he was too The darkness and the breath of death. Elder Chess, I am afraid that there will be something in Rumsfeld..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Xiusi have a whole face and ask slowly "Aka Ni, do you think the sacrifices and Rumsfeld are wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani had some doubts and thought: "The loss of the traditional elves is no longer an elf. They can't say that there is a big mistake! So...so God makes adults use such means." Is it too much to deal with them?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Shusi’s surprisingly serious spiritual family were formed in the glorious era before the millennium war. At that time, the long-lived elf glared at the entire Gloria Grand 6 with the incomparable magical civilization. Culture and tradition are formed on the basis of civilization, but once they are formed, they tend to self-consolidate, self-reinforce, and exclude the things that will lead to change. The glory days of the elves lasted for more than four thousand years. How much progress did our elf civilization progress during this period? And how many other races have progressed in their civilization under various pressures of survival? The end of the fiasco of the millennial war elves is actually a necessity. Even if the battle elves win, the next war will also fail! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Ajani’s face, Sussex sighed and went to the traditional elf. It’s really not an elf. But all the traditional elves are doomed. It will be erased from history. The traditional thing is like a snake that constantly devours its tail. One day, it will embark on the path of self-destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani seemed to understand and nodded. The words of Xiusi made her feel more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hius looked at Ajani, and looked pity, and said: "Any change will come at a price. Sacrifice and Rumsfeld are the price. The life of the thousand elves and the life of the dark-faced warriors of the four hundred months are also the price. The price is far from being paid for! Good boy, don’t think too much, there is God to keep the adults in front, we can just live easily Something! Ok, let's go back! Waiting for God to get the adult done, I will let him come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani sighed, Yingying stood up and went upstairs like a little bit of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the gait of Ajani’s departure, Hughes smiled and thought: “It seems that Ajani’s child still doesn’t know that she has How much better can you have this effect? ​​Rogge has a good background! It seems that I have no eyes on the old eyes! Oh, it is still the most wise of my old man!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani returned to the third floor, was about to push the door, the door quietly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly stood behind the door and leaned slightly, waiting for Ajani to enter the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani’s face was awkward, she didn’t look at the wind butterfly, she slammed into the bedroom and burst into tears in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly was completely expressionless, gently covered the door, returned to the maid's room, stood still, his body flashed, and began to practice again Fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the early morning, Roger went to the trial of Rumsfeld, the wind butterfly moved his things to Rogge's room. But no matter how Ajani blocked, she insisted on moving into the maid's room. Since then, whenever I met Ajani, Wind Butterfly would greet her with the most respectful tone, but there was no cold feeling in the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani cried for a while, wiped her tears, came to the door of the wind butterfly's room, and gently pushed the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly slowly opened his eyes, Yingying came to Ajiani and bowed: "Dear Aga Ni, what do you want to do?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani held the wind butterfly and looked at her eyes deeply: "Wind butterfly! Don't be like this again? You don't understand God makes the adults, you and him are so cold confrontation, it will only be you who suffers! And, I always feel that God has made the contract signed by the adults to have another mystery. He will never say that your sacrifice is very good. Stupid. Wind butterfly, we are the best sisters, and the same is true in the future. As long as you and Rumsfeld promise not to be right with God, I will ask him to let you go!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly stunned and raised his head, and a beautiful mist of water flashed through his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the water mist soon disappeared. She gently and firmly pushed Ajani's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aga Ni sister! I will call you a sister again, thank you for thinking about it for me! It is you who really don’t understand Rogge. You think Will he let us go because of your pleading? We have followed him for so long. Have you seen the one who has let him go against him? Not only will he not let go, but he will kill him and leave behind! From the first day I was determined to overthrow him, I already had the psychological preparation to accept today's ending. Rogge is a man, not a god. I don't believe that he will have no mistakes! I won't give in, Unless he kills me immediately! I will let him know that leaving me with a glimmer of hope will be his biggest mistake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the wind and the butterfly, sad And a firm face, Ajani's heart can not help but sorrow and grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few nights later in the night, a burst of ice and cold suddenly swept the entire city of the gods, and almost all the elves were frozen from the warm blanket. come. This cold weather came quickly and went fast, very incomprehensible. The elves cursed the bad weather in the north and went back to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gates of the temple’s watertightness were quietly opened, and an icy cold wind rushed out silently, everything in the hall outside the gate They all hang a thick layer of ice in an instant! The two elf guards were completely sealed by the dark blue weird ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the entire hall, only the one-meter circle around the elders of Hughes was all the same, but suddenly the ice and snow piled up a meter high around him. Snow wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes looked at Rogge and looked at the empty space behind him, suddenly sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still somewhat uncomfortable with the sudden changes in the hall, and he can't help but see two elf warriors who are sealed in the blue mysterious ice. His mental strength was swept away and he knew that the two warriors had been frozen to death. He frowned slightly, compared to a gesture. There was a faint light blue light flashing behind Rogge, and a very cold ice wind blew. The color of the black ice on the body of the Elf Samurai was immediately deeper, and then it became a full-scale ice powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small magical array flashed on Rogge’s hand, and the gentle wind sent the snow and ice in the hall to the gate of the dungeon. in. Rogge hesitated again, another magical array of red and black colors lit up on the right hand, the temperature in the room rose sharply, and in a blink of an eye, the blazing flame ignited in the dungeon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fire is coming too fast and going fast. In a moment, there was only one black residue in the dungeon, and the ashes dyed the clear springs in gray and black. No one can ever be born in the water prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge patted his hand satisfactorily, went to the small table of Xiusi and sat down, took a dish of dish, ate it wickedly, while vaguely Say: "Raphael! Come out and meet the elders of Hughes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Roger was originally empty was suddenly lit with a faint blue light. The blue light is getting thicker and thicker, and finally it condenses into a fuzzy figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure becomes clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a handsome, evil and tall elf. He only has a few pieces of dark green fabric around his waist, and most of his skin does not seem to feel the coldness of the northern winter. His skin is strangely purple-light blue, and many places, such as the chest and lower abdomen, have tiny black scales that glitter and shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the swaying candlelight in front of Hughes, his eyes are constantly changing color. When the candlelight is dim, his eyes are faint green, and when the candle is bright, it turns golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes took a deep look at Raphael. The Elf Warrior couldn’t help but smother the chilly bones, and a silver swelled slowly in the cold. He could see a little shadow of Rumsfeld in his eyebrows, but his eyes were much deeper and his nose was higher. He lacks the original sunshine and handsomeness, and has more evil charms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elders of Xius, Rafael has just awakened, and he does not control his strength. I am too tired to notice this and accidentally freeze to death. Two elf warriors." Rogge said while eating, it looks like he is really starved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed to make an adult, the length of your strength is really beyond my expectations! Even the horrible dark creatures of the Shadow Knight can be tested in such a magical way. However, the power of darkness and death is powerful, and it is very easy to use, but using them is not without cost! You need to control the use and dependence of these two forces. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked up and tried to swallow a whole piece of green vegetables. This said: "The use of any power comes at a price." Bright power, elemental power, and even hidden space energy all come at a price. These costs are not necessarily less than the use of darkness and death power. Although I still don't know what the cost of these forces is, these forces can never be used for free. On the contrary, it is clear that the darkness and the power of death will bring me something. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, thought for a moment, and said: "Elders of Xiusi, most people will choose an unknown future, so they may pay A bigger price, but there is hope for profit. And I am different, I prefer to pay a known price. I know that I can afford this price. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes is low and low: "I am afraid that you think you can afford it, but you will regret it in the end!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Rogge didn't understand clearly. He was busy dealing with the half-pot of the Hughes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes said: "If I guess correctly, would you like me to help you train Rafael?" The Shadow Knight is born with invisible ability and is indeed a natural terrorist killer. How much is the child’s fighting talent left? What level do you want him to reach? How much time do you give me? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Completely retained?" Hughes lost his voice: "This is impossible! In all the secret secrets, the most effective way to transform an elf into a dark creature can only retain half the wisdom. How do you do it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge 嘿嘿 笑 笑 e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e If you really don't know, the collection of the ancient Elvish will not become your own? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes snorted and his face turned red and slowly said: "If I have such a big skill, I don't have to hide more than four hundred in the Central Mountain Range." Years. After four hundred years of staying, the wise elves will become stupid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge poured a swig of wine and gave a sigh of relief, and asked: "Elders of Shusi, don't be humble!" If you are modest, don’t scare me away! You look at Rafael's choice of equipment and the right martial arts. I don't know anything about martial arts. These can only be up to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hughes nodded, Rogge said again: "The city of the gods is quite calm these days, but you must not be idle, before The composition and goings of the Terran coalition forces that have been besieging us for some days must be well known to you now? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes caressed the neat beard and replied with ease: "That is of course!" My old man has been a grandfather for more than 100 years in the Darkmoon tribe specializing in military and martial arts. Is there any common sense? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally ate enough, he patted his stomach with satisfaction, and smiled: "Elder Sister, your recent life is very leisurely!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where! Am I not always looking at you as a janitor? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? It's really hard for you to let you do such a small thing. But there is something big right now that you have to go out! There are a few 12-level magicians in the City of Gods? Rogge smiled and asked to Hughes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes instinctively felt a little bad, but still replied: "There are two. One is an elder Sarah and the other is an elder of the seven-color deer tribe. Do you have any thoughts? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! You must know that ‘magic curing needs this, I don’t want to be killed again! With this, my chances of living will be a little more. Rogge replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses was immediately embarrassed, he was indulged for a long time, finally made up his mind and replied: "No problem!" Elder Creed, the seven-color deer tribe, was able to cast this magic! I will convince him! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Magic Cure' is a six-level magic that permanently cures a low-level magic to the caster. This powerful magic is also costly. The same huge: the magic of the caster will be permanently reduced by two levels. There are very few magicians of the 12th level. Who is willing to sacrifice this? Even the great magician who originally studied 'magic curing' has never I have shown this magic once.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and lowered his voice and asked: "So dear Sisters, what news do you have for the silver dragon that day?" No? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes reluctantly said: "I will know that your dark guy will definitely ask this question!" It inhabits the mountains of more than 200 kilometers in the east, and has not yet left the idea. But I have to remind you that the silver dragon is the first adult dragon! With the current strength of the city of the gods, even if it is the city, it can not help it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog thought for a while and suddenly asked: "How many more magicians are we above 8? I remember that it was twelve, is there any damage? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, only one person died." There are still eleven, what happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought for a long time and slowly said: "I need to know more about Yinlong, I will know if my approach is not feasible." Elder Chess, you have to worry about this matter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes nodded and nodded, and then he was horrified to see that Rogge looked at him with hope.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elders of Xius! Rogge piled up the warmest and most professional smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed, unable to say: "God makes adults, you have something good to do." I am coming out? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
