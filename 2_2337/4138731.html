			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Rogge turned to the opposite side, did not dare to sleep, but nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Rogge, who was sleepy and tired, led the elves to continue to Dresden. The elf warriors saw that God made the adults so tired, and the concern was beyond words, but because of their identity, they were not easy to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian warriors looked at Ajani, who was also a weak look, and the expressions were very weird. Ajani was ashamed. At noon yesterday, she was almost crushed and eaten by Rogge. She slept all night and her hands and feet were still weak. But her red face, but strangely reveals a trace of grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge only has a boring loss. He didn't sleep all night, he was completely worried about the sneak attack of ***, and where is the mood to find Ajani again? Moreover, the elf's constitution is weak, and Ajani has not been able to withstand his second conquest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this cold season, people in the Northland rarely go out. On the avenue leading to Dresden, there is only a glimpse of the wind, the forest and the distant mountains. There is no smoke at all, and even the beasts are rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue all the way is calm, when passing through a woods, but faintly heard the sound of killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warriors were well trained and immediately took out the weapons and arranged them into a neat battle formation, encircling Rogge in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very gorgeous knight suddenly burst out of the forest! Brushing the ground, the elves have aimed at him with dozens of arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another commotion and scream in the forest, and several arrows shot out, fast and embarrassing. The aristocratic knight ran a horse and still did not completely escape. The horse ** got two arrows. The horse suddenly stood up and threw the knight on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility knight quickly climbed up and saw the Luo Ge and his party on the avenue. They immediately ran towards this side and ran and shouted: I am the second son of Carlos Carlos! Save me! I must reward you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s heart is a joy, I thought this time to come to the Principality of Aray Luck is too good, right? He didn't expect to be able to make a relationship with Dagong. What kind of character would it be just to publicly kill the second son in the Principality? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of masked knights 6 continue to chase out from the forest, these people are riding strong, unpretentious, obviously very strict training, are A brilliant knight. For the Cavaliers to see Rogge and his party, it was obviously a surprise. He hesitated and saw that Carlos was flying to Rogge and others, and he couldn’t catch up with it, so he sipped and threw his rifle in his hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle is like a meteor and is usually stabbed to the back of Carlos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the knight was about to take action, Rogge had ordered: "Protect that Carlos!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind butterfly removes the wheel saw on the back and throws it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge wheel saw flies and screams, and the screaming rifle is easily smashed into two segments and stroked in the air. It was a curved shape and flew back to the wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The martial arts of Fengdie Gao obviously shocked the masked knights. They were upset and did not dare to rush directly. Instead, they stopped at 100 meters. List the charge queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos rushed into the rogue's squad. Under Rogge's instructions, an elf knight brought a spare horse over, and the wolf-stricken Carlos turned over the horse, which made the shock a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge carefully observed the second son of the Ayre Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos was thin and tall, and because of the rush to run away, a light brown head was now cluttered to his head. His skin color is arrogant and pale, and there is still no horror in the pale gray eyes. He is wearing a very bright and gorgeous light lock. This is the favorite equipment for the nobles to hunt and beasts. It has enough protection to block the claws of the beasts and is light enough. It will not affect the nobles to show their skills in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it is to be brisk when you run away, and throw the last weapon of resistance." Rogge thought to himself, he had a preliminary assessment of the courage of Carlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Carlos," Rogge asked. Carlos was obviously still in panic. He was watching with fear. He suddenly heard Rogge’s voice, and he was so scared that he almost fell from the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness Carlos, don't be afraid, I am here, you don't have to worry about your safety." Rogge's calm self-confidence infected Carlos, he Only then decided to see the team of knights. The armor weapons used by the knights are all on the top, not to mention the material, but the manual value has passed the general military armor. There are also a few knights armed with armor weapons flashing a faint glow, obviously a very rare magic equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos’s gaze finally fell on the wind butterfly behind Rogge. The giant wheel saw held by the knight saw the green mangling suddenly and faintly, and the sharp teeth of the sharp edge shimmered with cold light. Although Carlos did not see that the wheel saw was so easy to cut off the knight's steel gun, he had no doubt that it could easily lick his waist. In the end, he only looked at the face of the wind butterfly, although the wind butterfly only had the lips exposed, but this beautiful line has already made Carlos suffocate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness Carlos, the person who chased you is well trained, not a mercenary or a robber, apparently a regular army. The Principality of Are is experiencing war Why is there an army that dares to chase you on the land of the Principality?" Rogge’s voice once again brought Carlos back to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the knight who had already sorted out the stormtroopers, Carlos was angry and fearful. He said, "I know who they are! They are My big brother Dan Luo's close-knit Snow Bear Knight! They ambushed me when I came out to hunt the snow fox, but my horse was fast, I just escaped! If I met you, I really want them to succeed. However, this gentleman has not asked your name yet. But the number of Snow Bear Knights is more than you. Is it better to retreat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My name is Rogge. Your Highness, you don't have to worry about your safety at all. However, since this matter involves your respected brother, do you think it is necessary to leave some living?" The fat man smiled lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, Rogge..." Carlos silently read the name twice, but there was no impression, and he couldn’t remember where the Holy League was. There are people in this family called this name. Looking at Rogge's ostentation, he is obviously not a small aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos is busy hunting snow fox these days, and has not had the chance to learn about the demon event in the city of Sayi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights across the street have already sorted out the stormtroopers, and after seeing the elf knights’ cold bows, they all raised the knight’s shield. in. Shouted for the knight: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outside the town! This is our own affairs of the Principality of Ade! You are best to give the young man to us, this It's a trouble that you shouldn't be involved and can't afford it! Otherwise, you will regret it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly is like a thunderous shock Living in him, this will be so polite to talk to those who are obviously from a foreign land. Although he is confident in defeating the same number of knights, the casualties will certainly not be small, and maybe Carlos will escape. This is a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge apparently did not regard his words as one thing, and talked to himself. The Snow Bear Knight was furious and shouted: "Prepare! Charge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than sixty Snow Bear Knights instigated the horse to start charging! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge whispered a spell with a slap in his hands, a huge flaming magical array appeared in the middle of the two armies, a one-meter-diameter flame column skyrocketed Up! The high temperature pouring melts the surrounding ice and snow. The flame column dissipated in a blink of an eye, leaving only a two-meter-high flame giant. It received Rogge's command, roaring, and rushing to the Snow Bear Knights with rolling flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is magic! Mr. Rogge, you are a magician! God, how gorgeous and shocking this magic! I dare say, Even the courtmaster Gennawala, who has never been seen in the eye, can't display such magic!" Carlos exclaimed, and immediately turned to look at Rogge's gaze, no longer the condescending, instinctive The finger of the gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-level magic ‘lower flame elf call’ is called by the flame giant, but the powerful magic creature. It has acted swiftly and has been blessed by Rogge and has become a massacre machine. In the twinkling of an eye, three knights were smashed by their heavy fists! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, eight knights have fallen to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excitement of the knights did not last long. In Rogge’s curse, they panicked as the second flame giant stood swaying again. Up, then two magical lights flashed on it, it is vigorous and add surgery! This is another new war machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the nightmare of the Snow Bear Knights is nothing more than that. After the second flame giant was killed by the elf's arrow rain at the cost of more than a dozen knights, the third flame giant appeared again and again! The magic of this horrible magician seems to have no end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just ten minutes of fighting, the Snow Bear Knights collapsed completely, and even the captain fell under the wheel saw of the flying butterfly. Only a dozen knights began to escape. Under the instigation of Rogge, the elves chased after a while, or let them escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the figure of the Snow Bear Knights who are gradually drifting away, Rogge’s heart is dark and happy: “I didn’t expect that the battle for the throne of the Principality of Ale is so naked. Okay! This Carlos is very useful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the snow bears lost, they calmed down a lot, and Rogge never got any Attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Carlos applauded Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to get the support of a powerful sorcerer like Rogge will have a decisive effect on the battle for the throne of Carlos. The performance of that battle alone, Carlos has no doubt that Roger's Cavaliers can match at least 500 Principality Knights! This is all the strength that his older brother is allowed to have! It was because he laid down the shelf of the son of Dagong on the road and paid attention to Rogge. This is in the middle of Rogge. The fat man immediately pushed the boat in the water, and the words in the words revealed implicitly that the second imperial prince was bold and was the best candidate to run the Ayre Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos was ecstatic, and asked Rogge to accept the receipt of the Count of Luck, and he did not want to, and immediately promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dresden is finally in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, the walls of Dresden are also tall and majestic, and the momentum is extraordinary. But the closer he is, the more disappointing Rogge is. The size of Dresden is not a small town among the Holy Alliance. It has a population of 200,000, but it is rough and dirty. It is far from the prosperous big cities in the south such as Rhine City and Lille City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dresden City suddenly horns, the heavy door slowly opens to both sides, the two teams dressed in celebration dresses from the city gate Out, listed on both sides of the road. After the ceremonial knight, dozens of gorgeous aristocrats came out. The musicians beat the deep and desolate Moldland drums, and the trumpeters blew the majestic welcome song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grand welcoming ceremony surprised Carlos. He couldn’t help but say to Rogge: "What is going on? The leader is not the Secretary of State, Shang Shuxi. Is the Marquis of Ley? This is a welcoming ceremony for the returning warriors. Why did people prepare?" He looked back and forth, and in the middle of the field, there was no other figure except the knights of their team. However, Carlos is still unbelievable. This welcoming ceremony was prepared for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saving Carlos, Rogge has not let him contact with the outside world on the grounds of his safety, and the elf knights will be The inn cleared the venue and was completely closed. Carlos, who was assassinated and scared of his courage, had no objection to this. He knew the elves' identity of the knight that night. Although the beautiful elves let him think about it, but when he was relying on Rogge, he was somewhat determined, and he would not offend Rogge as a big man who is important to his throne for his own color. Seeing that Rogge can have a large number of powerful elves guarding, Carlos's evaluation of the fat man is much higher. He seems to have seen the throne waving to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Rogge and his party greeted the welcome aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Roger, the great magician! Welcome to Dresden. May the Republic of Ale be honored to be your second home! My Grand Duke Crick has prepared a grand banquet for you, and all the celebrities in Dresden are proud to see your style! Tell me, your loyal friend Hilley, in addition to suppressing the devil In addition to such miracles, what kind of miracle will you bring to the Principality of Alai? Wealth, power, glory?" The sound of the marquis of the ancient Hiley is extremely bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos knew at this time that the welcoming ceremony was actually prepared for Rogge! And Rogge turned out to be a great magician who can demons the devil! Now listening to Rogge’s humility in the face of everyone’s face, he has shown his support for his position and can’t help but be overwhelmed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old-fashioned Marquis of Hilary saw that the person standing next to Rogge was actually the second Captain Carlos, and he quickly pleaded guilty to Carlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos is arrogant, where is this little blame? He decided to seize this opportunity to consolidate the alliance with Rogge, lest his big brother Dan Luo start. He cleared his throat and spoke loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marquis of Hilley, ladies! These days I am hunting fox, this is something everyone knows. But what everyone doesn't know is that I am at the hunting ground. When I met an ambush, all the loyal attendants fell under the mean sneak attacker!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos is not a trivial matter, the nobility who greeted immediately opened The pot has been discussed, and everyone knows that the dispute over inheritance has reached a point of enthusiasm. At this time, it is a matter of fact that the bet is placed on the side or the neutrality is maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, the Supreme God bless, I met the great magician Rogge and his Elf Guard! Faced with a large number of sneak attackers, ten Minutes! Just ten minutes! Mr. Rogge and his guards are all sneak attackers! Moreover, these sneak attackers are well-trained regular knights!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The second boulder has invested in the already unsettled lake. The nobles became a mess. This is not to be surprised by the strength of Rogge and the Elf Guard. After all, it is far from shocking to pack dozens of knights. But the sneak attackers are regular knights, but this is unusual. Explain that the sneak attacker is not afraid of identity exposure, and is determined to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Ayre Principality is a small country, and the court battle is almost universally known. Even a small person like Will can analyze Rogge's sectarian faction and the pattern of profit. This is not because the politics of the Ayre Principality is enlightened, it is because of the small country and the widows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son of the creek, Dan Luo, married the daughter of the court magician Gennawala, and naturally received his full support. In addition, Dan Luo and the head of the Guarding Knights, holding the military power, can be said to be the most powerful candidate to inherit the Principality. He has been declared the heir to the throne by the Grand Duke. It’s just that Gonawara is arrogant and good at all, means vicious, and openly rejects dissidents. In order to maintain their status, many great aristocrats had to secretly support the second child Carlos. As for the third-year-old Natala, who is less than 20 years old, like a poet who has more politicians, there is no ambition in inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tricker’s interest in state affairs in recent years is far less than the interest in women and longevity. In his view, the power of magic can help him to achieve longevity, which is why the court magician Gnawala is favored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos completely turned Rogge’s welcome ceremony into his own podium. In the end, he raised his voice and expressed his enthusiasm: Los Tikick, vowed here! I will find out the murderers who ignore the laws of the Principality and dare to ambush the members of the royal family! I will also uncover the black hand behind these people! Now, the attacker’s body is on the carriages behind me! The truth will come to the fore! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasped, his face was too excited and he was flushed, and he looked at Rogge and added: "The Rogge Magi The contribution of the Principality is obvious to all. I announced that not only did he get the friendship that I have never changed, but the elves also got my eternal friendship! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is even a surprise for Rogge. This Carlos seems to have some political minds besides being timid!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the excited speech of Carlos, a little unseen smile floated on the corner of Rogge. In the eyes of the fat man, now the Principality of Are is simply God gave him Gifts!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, Dresden has a lot of excitement and prosperity. The palace is full of enthusiasm, crowds, almost all celebrities have arrived. Competing for the style of the great magician and his Elf Guard. In fact, the goal that people pay more attention to is the glamour of the legendary elves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern architecture It has always been known for its grandeur. The main hall of the Gong’s Palace is a good footnote for this. The main hall is more than ten meters from the vault to the ground, and a dozen large stone pillars jointly support this temple, which is called a masterpiece. A fireplace, a blazing fire, is enough to warm the huge space in the temple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the high platform, hundreds of aristocrats with a similar status are standing in the hall. The maids hold a variety of food and wine, flowing through the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great magician Rogge is coming!" The waiter's sharp voice echoed in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark green cloak, Roger is quite powerful. He stalked and walked into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless attentions cast to him, and then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through him, It fell on the five female elves guarding the warriors behind the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man doesn't care. Most of the human nature is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke is not completely confused, he knows that after such a magician has invested in himself, the status of the Principality of Ayre in the Holy Alliance will be great. same. So he personally stood up and walked slowly down the high platform and greeted Rogge. But his gaze also fell on the elf behind Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the attention of everyone, Tikrick personally took Rogge’s hand and stepped on the platform with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this occasion, Rogge is naturally comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many heroes of the Ale Principality who came to him with Hilley, such a great magician is definitely a powerful force in the future of the Principality of Are, A chance to meet at a time, everyone does not want to miss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos stood tightly beside Rogge, talking loudly and laughing, trying to show his intimacy with this mysterious great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, Carlos has fully understood the feat of Rogge in the city of Sayi to seal the ancient demon Amaro. Although the Principality of Aray is a small country, after the original record of this matter has been reviewed, verified, analyzed and summarized, the ability of Amorro has been exaggerated several times, and the power of Rogge Magic has also increased several levels. The report in the hands of Carlos shows that this is a crisis that threatens the survival of the entire Ayre Principality, but under the courageous battle of the great magician Rogge and his Elf Guard, the demon was finally sealed. This seal is not complete, only the blood of the elf lives in this land, in order to suppress the seal of the Amorro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report to Carlos, Tikick and other major powers also have a copy. This report made Carlos re-recognize the great value of Rogge. He began to grateful to the gods from the heart, and gave him such a powerful boost at the crucial moment of the battle for the throne! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace feast has entered a more free time, and Rogge is surrounded by a group of great aristocrats, patiently satisfying their curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his own past, Rogge simply said that he came from a mysterious mage tower in the Central Mountain Range, where there are several powerful magicians. As for the rest, Rogge is concerned about him. The great magicians are very mysterious people in the eyes of ordinary people. Rogge knows that for these proud nobles, the extreme mystery and proper arrogance are like the signs of the great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Rogge, please forgive me, can I ask you a private question?" asked a vague old Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Marquis de Cari, who was the commander of all the armies of the Principality when he was young." Carlos whispered to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s my pleasure to answer the questions of an elder. After all, I am only twenty-five years old, spend most of my life in the Master Tower, my life experience. It’s too shallow.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another sensation in the crowd, the big magician who can seal the ancient demon is only twenty-five years old? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This question is asked by all the noble ladies on behalf of the Principality. Are you married?" The old Marquis’ voice was still very loud, all the time in the hall. The ladies' eyes were lit up and kept groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This question, because I spend most of my time in the Master Tower, all the ladies who have not had the chance to meet their favorite."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Rogge, you have such a beautiful elf as a companion, naturally can not see ordinary women. It is rumored that the devil's seal can only be shackled by the elves, is this the case?" asked the old Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elegant and noble, peace-loving elves are my allies and comrades, I respect them. Only the pure elf blood, will make the ancient demon Amoro The seal is unbreakable. This time, the Amoro that I defeated was not as strong as its original one because of the long seal. But when it broke through the seal again, I thought it was the big sixty magisters. One of them is hard to say that it will win. So, now the elf is our most wealthy friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, the elves live in our human society. There will be a lot of trouble..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beauty and value of the elf is the source of trouble. This is why I came to the Principality of Alei. I am willing to take me. The loyalty to the Principality is in exchange for the power of the Elves to be treated equally in the Principality. Dear Dick Creek, don't know if you are willing to accept this proposal?" Rogge is a gift to Tikick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a great magician like you who condescends to come to the Ayre Principality. It is the supreme god who cares about our expression! How can I disagree?" Crick was busy propping up Rogge and then facing the audience, holding up the scepter with a gemstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall gradually quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my name, Tikick, I declare! From now on, all elves can be equal to the nationals of the Principality in the land of the Principality of Are. The treatment! Moreover, the Elf slave trade will be completely banned! This decree will take effect immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Dagong echoed in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the presence of the public and the nobles, this decree has little substantive significance. The elf slaves in the Principality of Ale are counted in one palm. Northland is far from the wealth of the South. The expensive elf slaves can only be bought by Tikrick and a handful of great aristocrats. They can only be used for general purposes. What kind of ban can't be banned from these people. For ordinary nobility, the elf slave is something that you can't even think about, and there is no difference between forbidding and ban. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight's banquet is enough to make the aristocrats present for a few weeks. The beauty of these elf female warriors brought by Rogge has completely surpassed the imagination of most nobles. In contrast, the two elf slaves that Tikick loved over his life were completely eclipsed. But no one dares to play the idea of ​​these elves of Rogge, which is tantamount to publicly announcing the enemy with the great magician who has hundreds of Elf Guards! It is not difficult to guess the reaction of Grand Duke Creek to this kind of thing. He will definitely hand over the head of this nobleman to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly felt that two hateful eyes fell on him. He pretended to be inadvertently, sweeping through the crowds of the light. The little old-fashioned old man gathered in another aristocrat is staring at himself in a disgusting manner, and some bloodshot eyes are full of undisguised hatred. Standing next to him was a tall, awkward knight with a badge on the gorgeous armor of the Tick Creek family. This knight is the eldest son of Tick Creek, Dan Luo, who hastily introduced it at the beginning of the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old man around your brother?" Rogge whispered Carlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the court magician Gennawala."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog nodded, While talking and laughing with the surrounding nobles, he quietly extended the spirit and probed the truth of the Gonawara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out to be an 11th-level magician!" Rogge smiled. Although his magic has only just reached the eleventh level, but this kind of court magician who has been pampered for more than ten years, the fat man can still deal with three or five. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coincidentally, Gennawala is the same idea. His most proud disciple has quietly told him the results of the magic crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This Rogge is a liar!" he sneered and said to Danro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan Luoyang raised his eyebrows and looked at the other side of Rogge, who was talking and laughing, and whispered, "Are you so sure?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any ancient demon will not be able to deal with an eleventh-level magician. Your Highness does not have to worry, I will make this liar out of shape!" Vala said confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
