			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom floor of the main building is a hall with a height of more than ten meters. The crystal light hangs in the air, although there is no lighting, but the low-pitched and fine-cut surface is exquisite. Crystals sometimes reflect the faint moonlight that occasionally penetrates into the outdoors, and if there is no flash in the hall without light, it is like a soul in the dark night. More than ten meters deep is a large and luxurious rotary ladder, which is divided into two in more than twenty levels, hovering upwards. The steps of the steps are covered with velvet carpet and pressed with metal strips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked up at his goal, there was no trace of artificial light upstairs, and the rich death atmosphere blended with the darkness, covering the whole On the second floor, from the spiraling ladder, to the corner, like an invisible enchantment to defend the goddess who walked in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles faintly, the eyes of the kings are not as sharp as the guardian of the tomb in the tomb, which is already known in the world of death. Rogge silently jumped up the handrail of the stairs, then slid silently and stopped quietly at the corner. He flicked his finger slightly, and then the figure turned into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small group of dead souls in the lobby of the ground floor, like a flying insect with no direction, not only did not drift outside the door, but took a nap The zigzag, which is slanting and slanting, hits a crystal lamp in midair. The soul of this group suddenly seemed to be extremely dangerous. It trembled in the plexus, and then fluttered wildly up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Elgara guy, let a grief come out, too, today’s new soul is too much, can’t blame him, old witch The demon can't be too busy to rely on himself. ‘Bone Emperor thought about it, while walking down the stairs to destroy the raging souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finally arrived at the top floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge for a moment, repeatedly weighing between hiding and disguising, finally made up his mind. In a twinkling of an eye, a noble figure emerges from the air. Her face is slowly clear, it is Mora! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the gallery, behind the two tall, heavy oak doors, is the temple of the goddess, the end of the trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora went silent along the promenade, and she suddenly stopped. In a room that was not closed next door, Macbeth was sitting in the chair, staring at the floating light in front of him, his face was cloudy and clear, and apparently deep inside why he was struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no protective measure in the room, but Macbeth has no meaning to escape. His eyes are only floating in front of the group, to the outside world. No reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mola stepped forward and went forward, finally coming to the temple. She slowly pushed open the two heavy doors in front of him, revealing the mysterious hall inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the furniture and decorations originally placed here have been removed, including oil paintings, ornaments and tapestries on the walls. The hall now is very empty, and there is a mysterious and beautiful scorpion floating in the center. Although the angel guarding the scorpion can't see the appearance, the posture of the low-lying arms is sorrowful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black O'Reilly is facing the door and standing before the squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Mora, is there something? ‘She is cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘***... ‘The trembling voice behind it is just like a thunder that has never been seen before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The whole back is suddenly stiff and turns like a whirlwind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her silver eyes are wide open, and I can't believe the Rogge standing at the door, the small mouth involuntarily opens slightly, like a shock It’s like sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raging light of the raging hurricane immediately drowned everything in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night sky, a huge shrine of light in the main palace of the city rises into the sky! Suddenly there was a dragon in the sky, and the sacred dragon swooped down in an incredible degree. It flew two laps around the light beam, but there was no way to enter the main building. Gregory had the heart to look at the window of the temple, but the result was so clear. Between curiosity and destruction, there is endless embarrassment and pain. Gregory thought all the skills that might come in handy at this moment, and the last thoughts suddenly stopped at the final metamorphosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was so horrified that he had not yet responded, and the omnipresent glory of the goddess had swallowed him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly flashes to the point where he can’t see things, then the darkness, the darkness that devours everything...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The violent sting was not only from the eyes, but also from all over Rogge's body. The sacred atmosphere of the embarrassment is like the raging sea, and the waves and the waves are photographed to Rogge! In the face of the great power of this tsunami landslide, Roger's few magic shields were almost destroyed by the same degree of casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a huge wave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred atmosphere of such a strong and pure taste is no different from the flames for Rogge! His skin creaked and even began to smouldering. He fell to the sky, but then struggled to stand up, seven silver shields quietly formed, flying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the sacred glory is still endlessly elevating, and the light shield is like the snow in the early spring, melting slowly in the gorgeous sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge silently roared, the large group of water-like thick silver light emerged from his body, and in a blink of an eye condensed into a pair of silver light armor, number If there is a streamer with no roots, it will come out from the back of the silver armor and dance in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the raging waves, there seems to be a soft exclamation, and then all the rushing energy storms are back and forth, that round The sun shining on everything released the last round of brilliance, and then dimmed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is re-entered into darkness, only the faint brilliance of the shackles immersed in everything in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerial, *** and Rogge stand opposite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having spit out a word, there is no more sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall suddenly slammed, and the light of Rogge suddenly burst into a room of meteor shower, falling from the air and disappearing when it touched the ground. The last fall was Rogge's helpless body, and he fell heavily on the marble floor, making a dull bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted and swayed and stood up. Before he stood up, his body tilted and almost fell to the ground. Rogge took a deep breath and struggled to stand up again, just harder than the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The figure is invisible and has appeared beside Rogge. She held out her hand and seemed to want to help him, but the arm was not fully extended, and it was lightning-shrinked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Rogge took a half step, it was a big shake, as if he would fall again anytime and anywhere. *** slightly bite his teeth, his right hand finally reached Rogge. But the right hand that is enough to penetrate everything, but if it is through the most insurmountable obstacles in this life, every move is such a difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a long wait, there will be a moment to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short distance from the shoulder to the fingertips, *** seems to have experienced countless cycles. Her fingers finally stretched out unconsciously, almost touching Rogge's body. And the fingertips, gently twitching like the most delicate flower of the silk in the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the flower no longer vibrates, like the scent of the morning light, firmly gathers the petals into a flower bud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Retracted the slender hand, stood up straight, slightly raised his head, and restored the cold expression that stood proudly and ignored everything. Later, at the gate of the hall, there appeared the three kings Droni and the fuzzy figure of Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Rogge did not see the scene just now, his eyes closed, and a thin blood line flowed out of his eyes. Rogge finally stood firm, and he was slightly sideways, with his previous memories and inductions slamming toward the direction of the shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reached out and stroked the sly, and the wing guarding the sly angel. He is extremely patient and meticulous, and has not let go of every inch. Although he couldn't see it, the hard and cold feeling of the fingertips had spread to the depths of his soul. The touch, the incomparable familiarity, repeatedly told Rogge that this winged angel was the demon lotus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Are you talking about abandoned land? That world has been destroyed. ‘*** was shocked, she didn’t know why she suddenly said this in such a sacred, arrogant and indifferent voice, and it was also used in the voice of Wella. But the words have been exported, even though she is really a god, it is impossible to reverse the river of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘So... ** turned and faced the crowd, the face that ran a few blood lines looked terrible. Although his closed eyes are no longer visible, there seems to be an invisible gaze that scans the souls of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Dear death kings, why are you in this world? *** Where is it? Since the world of death has been destroyed, what is the outcome of the war between the kings, and where is the ***? '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people face each other, a silence, their eyes are quietly falling on the body that hangs in the air, although the *** at the moment is not condensed A terrible energy storm, but her position at the moment suddenly rose to a darkness, enough to devour all the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is even more horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘No one is willing to answer me? ‘Rogge broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When the world of death is destroyed, *** alone to challenge the heavenly parade..." The Black Warrior slowly said: 'She destroyed the Heavenly Tour Hunting, I also entered the eternal sleep. Before the heavens destroyed the world of death, the surviving kings came to the world together. This journey is very difficult. The oldest fire of wisdom, with its own body as a boat, has brought us to the other side of the shackles that are sleeping behind you. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness that hides the *** suddenly fluctuates violently, and the whirlpool restores peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Single challenge...' Rogge smiled coldly, really a group of noble kings...'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior emperor paused for a moment, after a moment, he sighed: 'We all have the power of death, only the *** that can control the divine power will not fear the flame chariot of the heavens. Therefore, only *** can challenge the heavens to hunt. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was silent for a while, no more. He turned and walked to the side of his arm, rubbing his hands on his knees for a moment, then gently pushing it. The wing guarding the sly angel seems to recognize his strength, slowly rises, and the wings also open. The angel's hands held the lid that was nearly half a meter thick and flew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;棺樽, it’s finally open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The darkness of the body that swallowed all the light was scattered at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure that her Zhuo’s condensed figure appeared again in the hall, but she was facing the door of the hall, and the strong people gathered at the door could not see her. expression. In fact, even if *** turned around, they did not expect to see anything from the face of the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** has completely restored her indifference, arrogance and calm, although the calm seems to be an invisible storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Waving a wave, the strong ones quit the hall one by one. Two heavy gates slowly closed behind them, and a loud bang was heard. The closed door isolates the light and sound inside and outside the hall, and also isolates all the senses of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful people looked at each other and distracted from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the thick and heavy cover slowly rising, the dim blue light shining through the sputum slightly reflected the temple. But Rogge no longer needs light at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge put his hand into the squat, explored, and then touched a warm, unswellable liquid. He dipped a little liquid on his finger and placed it on the tip of his tongue. The little drop of liquid couldn't change shape on Rogge's tongue, even moving on his own. His tongue suddenly closed and swallowed the drop of liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge tastes for a long time and asks: ‘This is the blood essence of the ice sea dragon? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold, unfeeling, crisp voice behind him replied: ‘Yes. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes. However, the blood essence of the ice sea dragon can only repair the wound on her, but can not wake her soul. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘How can I wake her soul? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘At least 100,000 souls. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge screams... you need war. '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this world standard, Rogge is already a master of the soul, he knows when a dying life, before breaking into the endless darkness When it is in a very strong relationship, this soul is extremely difficult to be accepted by the Necromancer. The reason is that its power is much stronger than it should be, so that it becomes extremely unstable. And war is undoubtedly the most convenient and fast way to make a soul. People who die in war, whether they die of anger, sorrow, terror or despair, will multiply their soul power by being in extreme emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark dragon statue that crouched on the four corners was used by the Lich Elgara to collect and refine the soul, although I don’t know why one of the statues is surprisingly powerful. Weak, but if there are enough souls, this defect can naturally make up for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the casualties in the war, it is less and less, not within Rogge’s consideration. Since the Nanzheng has begun, Rogge will never let it stop. If one day, he really can be stationed under the city of Marily, then the paved bones of this conquering road, how many million? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stretches his hands and slams on the top. The blood essence of the Dragon of the Ice Ocean swelled in a burst, and the sleeping Weina slowly floated up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s palm shook slightly and touched Weina’s face. He looked up, his face slightly nervous and anticipating, and he felt the touch of the fingertips from the fingertips of his fingers, and outlined her outline in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger's ten fingers swept, warmly passing through the body of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, is this the case? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took his arms and took the sleeping Willa into his arms. In the past, with the *** of the bit by bit, one by one into the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the rotten cockroach standing in the magical array.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, it was that The little cockroach that has been pretending to be dead............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after that, it is standing on the rock of the anger, listening to the dying giant question 'you have already got rid of the contract The bondage has become an independent existence, why should we obey... '******...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the abyss devourer who resolutely turned to the heap The figure of ....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came out of the dark dragon altar of Elgray, he greeted the sorcerer Elgra’s ***...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returns to the world of death again, what he sees is that even if he is desperate, he must quietly erase the soul of the Indians and face the seven kings alone. ***......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes hurt a lot, the blood line rolled down again, and one of them went back to the ventricle, pulling the internal organs, like the meditation There is an invisible giant hand in the middle of the earth. ** in the palm, like an avalanche grief flooded his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, with a sigh of sigh, Rogge's face was uploaded with a cold and soft. *** I don’t know when it’s standing behind him, and the hand gently covered Roger’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Want to see ** Rogge, O'Reilly has never had a feeling of emotion, at this moment, suddenly something more inexplicable . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge doesn't understand, can't understand, and doesn't want to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded, and then a strange feeling passed through his hand and penetrated his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been learned by Macbeth how to transform various forces into divine power, Rogge’s constitution is still dominated by darkness and death. *** At the beginning, the sacred light of the subconscious movement was too strong, and the attributes were opposite. It was extremely difficult to recover the damage formed by Rogge's eyes. Even if he was comparable to the troll's regenerative ability, he would not know when to see the light again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her warm and moist power ignited the magic of Rogge's darkness and death, and later even began to directly mobilize his spiritual power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the *** that is as strong as the spring rain, the blood of Rogge's eyes began to grow, and the wound was repaired quickly. After an unbearable pain, she took back her left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly opened his eyes, and the endless dark world finally lit up. What emerged in front of him was an incomparably exquisite face, and the sleeping face was soft as water, concise into a quiet beauty. The clear spring and the stone-like tranquility touched Rogge's restless soul, and the nerves of the goddess' constant pressure were relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hiding behind the devil, has it been such a woman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is *** already growing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s such a woman who looks so delicate and weak, once again taking him back from the line of death. And he is also used to relying on her to save lives at the moment of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly remembered that, on that day, Bone Gregory had said to him that *** was extremely dissatisfied with the growth of his strength and thought he It has been a very stupid act to immerse yourself in the struggle for power and forget to promote your own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has never had such a moment, eager for powerful power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked deeply at the woman in her arms, as if to engrave her in the depths of her soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his hands and slowly put the sleeping woman back into the dark blue blood essence of the scorpion. The angels formed by the demon in the air slowly lowered the cover and re-protected the wings with their wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was silent for a moment, looked up and stared straight at ***. From the silver eyes at the moment, he still can't see any emotional fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Great Aurele, what is the relationship between the three kings of the world of death? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘They are working for me until I wake up. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘That’s to say, after *** wake up, they will no longer get your wing protection? ‘Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Exactly. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is a goddess who is deeply polite to her, and you will soon get 100,000 souls. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the language, Rogge strode to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Standing in place, let Rogge pass by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing where the breeze came from, she quietly picked up her a trace of black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy temple door slowly opened and closed slowly. When Rogge stepped into the lobby of the ground floor, he saw that the strong men were all gathered here, seemingly waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Trail passed through the strong, and when he passed by the three kings of the dead world, he stopped and looked at the three kings. Sweep over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge slowly said: Come, the war between the kings continues! ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer cares about the three kings who are stunned, and walked out of the city’s main palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory, who was floating in the air, also looked at Rogge in vain. It instinctively feels that it has missed something important and can't help but hate it. Under the annoyance, all the wisdom of the sacred dragon is concentrated on the final metamorphosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main hall of the top floor, there is silence at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
