			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book, the second day of the sky,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looks gloomy and strode into The battle hall of the sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong magical atmosphere in the entire hall, and the magical arrays of layers and layers are now hidden. More than ten priests are in the magic circle. Maintain the operation of the array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the magical array, the sand table of the entire Gloria continent. At this moment, the clouds are filled with light and shadows. It rains in the northwest, and the snow falls on the peak of the central mountain range, while the southern land is clear and clear. The weather conditions throughout the continent have been evident for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart sighed slightly. Under the heavens, perhaps only the Church of the Light Church has such strength, and it can take turns with dozens of high-ranking Masters to maintain the continuous operation of such a huge magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved his hand, and a sacred mage immediately sang a spell and launched the deepest layer of magic. A faint glow was swept across the sand table, and dozens of areas shone slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge looked at the area in a region and looked very carefully. According to the piano, these magical arrays are sensitive to some tyrannical presence on the mainland and shine in the corresponding areas. She concealed that if Master Xinda is still there, then under his auspices, the sturdy strength and attributes hidden in it can be seen from the luster colors and brightness of those areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course this magical array is not omnipotent. The existence of too high or too low power will not be detected by this magical array, and those who know how to hide will not appear in the magic array. But even then, when I first saw this magical array. Rogge is also extremely shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man does not know whether these areas are tyrannical, but at least the area where the Moonlight Dragon City is located and the basin where the Black Dragons are accumulating are displayed in the sand table. on. But knowing where these dragons are not of much use. Even with the strength of the church, it is a very crazy idea to cross the mountains and waters to attack the Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Rogge seems to feel that there is a little bit of a sense of harmony in the area where the Moonlight Dragon City is hidden. When he looked at it carefully, this abnormality had disappeared. He stared at the area, but never saw anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's eyebrows are wrinkled. Now Moonlight Dragon City is badly hurt. The strength is not as good as it used to be, but there are at least dozens of silver dragons in the Dragon City. There are more than a dozen adult silver dragons. That is not the way the church can handle it. Feeling fat, it is not to pull the blood angel Augustus. As for the Pope, he simply couldn't see through the depths of the Pope. Although he had seen the Pope's two earth-shattering prophecies, Rogge always thought about the power of the Pope. But how could the Pope follow him to attack the Dragon City? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger couldn’t bring more people because of the distance. Of course, there is no problem with the high-ranking dragons who deal with the orders with his manpower. However, it is too little to deal with the dragons in groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless... there is a presence like Andreioli, the two dragon cities will be lost in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head and ejected this absurd thought. His eyes fell on other areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in those areas distributed in the mountains and mountains, there should be a lot of strong existence. These existing souls should be enough to help the wind and moon support for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the glowing areas and was speechless. However, in just a few minutes, the Templars who have reached at least the 14th and 5th-level magic are all sweating on their foreheads, and they will not be able to cope with the crazy crush of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is at this time. Fengyue suddenly pulled Larog's clothes and pointed his finger to one of the areas. The fat man looked a little and looked back at her. Fengyue pointed to the area, and all the silver plaques were firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie glanced at the wind and snorted and turned his face to the side with disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano agreed. The fat man once again looked at the Moonlight Dragon City, feeling that there was always something in his heart that could not be lingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man pointed to the Moonlight Dragon City again, frowning: "Prepare a small transmission matrix, I will go here to see."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When should we prepare the magic array?" Qin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sooner the better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge once again overlooks the vast land of the North, It is already at dusk. These days, I saw more beautiful scenery that has become unreal and the soft mountains and waters of the South. When I was able to look at the vast land of the Northland again, Rogge’s chest was once again full of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge identified the direction, and the figure began to flash in the air. In the twinkling of an eye, it disappeared into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is on the verge of flying. The fat man suddenly moved, suddenly stopped the castration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His below. It is a stretch of mountains. The mountain is revealing a little beautiful in the majestic, and the mountain-like peaks are covered with green. Between the peaks, there is a river squatting through. Against the backdrop of the evening clouds, there are thousands of golden snakes swimming on the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bit more legendary about this picturesque landscape. At the top of a mountain in the riverside, there are two elegant dragons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful dragon that shines with soft silver radiance is naturally the owner of the silver dragon family, the dragon prophet Cranho. And next to her, it is a sacred dragon with a small body, but full of mystery and majesty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s face has become a bit weird. The strangeness he felt was actually due to the addition of other dragons to the atmosphere of the silver dragon. And it is his very familiar atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The battlefield is always the best destination for heroes..." The dragon of the sacred dragon has a strange calm and elegance, and it is like a poem: "That It is also the dusk as it is now, the sky is like a cloud of fire. But the burning is not the sunset, but the glory of the Lord God! Yes. In that war, I faced not only the masters It’s only a million troops, and the tall figure of the Lord God! But the master is fearless! He stands alone in front of the million servants of the Lord God and the Lord God! Ah, in that epic war, how much he is Despicable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dragon can't help but scream, and this is how it feels its own gaffe, and immediately restores the poet's temperament. With a melancholy low voice: "No, in front of those despicable and shameless enemies. The master exchanged our lives for our escape. That is... courage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio heard the emotions, whispering low, should be with the voice of the sacred dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Dragon still wants to say something, but his heart suddenly swept a dangerous instinct and immediately turned his head and looked behind him. At the same moment, Cranio also felt that he looked back at the sky behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is slowly falling from the sky. Everything in the space around him is slightly distorted. Although there was no electric fire, the two dragons did not feel any pressure, but the invisible pressure is far more powerful than these tangible deterrents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! Are you not already dead?" Gregory jumped up and threw lightning at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man grabbed the dragon's horn of the sacred dragon and set it in the air. However, Gregory still did not give up, but sticked out his tongue and smacked him sullenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was caught off guard. Successfully attacked by the Holy Dragon. He saw Gregory still still unfinished, and quickly screamed, this stopped the next move of the Holy Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Gregory’s ecstasy, Cranio is steadily receding, her wings are fierce, but she can’t fly. She panicked: "You. You are the demon that the dragon god mentioned! Is the owner of Gregory adults you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looks at Kranj Ou, cold smile, said: "Give me a place to stay! Otherwise, then..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory trembled a little as he saw the slowly flowing black of Rogge’s left hand. But it still has enough courage. Whispered: "Great, wise and shameless master. There are so many silver dragons in Moonlight Dragon City, you... let's let go of this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man did not answer. Just ask: "Gregory, your Werner master? Where is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred Dragon Road: "Since the day of the Great War, I never got the news of the two masters. I have been hiding and recovering these days. After I have been wounded, I dare to come out and look for the whereabouts of the two masters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge nodded and stared at the dragon's eye of Gregory, and the silvery eyes penetrated deeply into his soul. After a while, the fat man said: "It seems that your injury has not affected your strength, and now the strength has grown very much. You are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want you to say that the taste of angel wings is really good." Gregory pretended to be plain, but the kind of scent in the tone was really unmaskable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: "Since you haven't found Wella, then her dragon soul gun should still be with you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am hiding in a very safe place! In addition, there is a giant sword used in the sky. Master, this is what I used to change back!" Holy The dragon always remembers the power of the table. How can it be just a little bit elegant and inscrutable? Cranio saw the eyes grow bigger and bigger, and almost couldn't believe what he saw at the moment, just the same dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glanced at Kranho indifferently, and a burst of cold ice drenched her whole body. The body of the dragon prophet trembled involuntarily. If you change an ordinary silver dragon, it will not be so bad, but Cranio is a prophet and is particularly sensitive to the spirit and soul power. Her strongest point is precisely Rogge, so the fat man hardly needs to be hands-on, and the spiritual pressure alone is enough to make Cranio difficult to resist. And she also sensed a few unusual scent from Rogge, which was very weak, but she was completely in fear and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You call Cranho?" Rogge asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rano’s heart is struggling. The shackles that Rogge exerted on her spirits were too strong, so her weak resistance to the will was just a flash, and she reverently answered Rogge's question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is a dragon prophet that is rare in the whole dragon family. Now she is the leader of the Moonlight Dragon City Silver Dragon." Gregory intervened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Rogge's temper, it is still very well understood, knowing that the higher the value of Cranho's use, Roger will not kill her. The sacred dragon feels very keen. It felt a powerful murderousness from Rogge. Of course, the fat man will not kill it, so the target of murderous targeting can only be Cranio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked at Cranio. Cold and authentic: "Very good, young silver dragon, now there are two choices in front of you, one is that the Yinlong family will follow me and fight for me, I will provide protection and corresponding compensation for your service. The other is to choose independence. Of course, I will destroy the Yinlong family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Cranio could not speak for a while. Her wings are constantly shaking. Yinlong’s pride made her refuse, but the responsibilities of the leader asked her to consider the safety of the whole family. After several wars, the number of adult silver dragons in Moonlight Dragon City has dropped to a very dangerous number. She can no longer afford the loss of any tribe. In front of this demon has once destroyed the silver dragon's pride Nicholas, the old silver dragon king also died because of him. And now his power is already strong enough to be incredible, even to let himself even resist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio has not answered for a long time, Rogge brows. Impatiently said: "The order of the plane is different now. I will give you a few days, think about it yourself. Gregory, let's go and get the guns and angel swords."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory snorted and glanced at Cranio, and followed Rogge to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master's master. Your power today is comparable to that of God! But can you really pick up the entire Moonlight Dragon City alone? But there are more than a dozen adult silver dragons!" Gregory sneaked and flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! It turned out to be like this! You are so despicable, too shameless!" Gregory has been screaming for two long sentences, and at this moment it is not smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gregory’s wisdom is not low, and he immediately asks: “But how do I feel that you didn’t want to accept the silver dragon as a man. I want to kill them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at Gregory. Sighed, said: "Gregory. You are very smart. You should follow me this time, but I am now working for the Church of Light, you can not stay with me. If you have the opportunity, you can find a way to bring The dragon prophet leaves the Moonlight Dragon City, the farther the better, the best to leave this plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Master's owner, you have Did you start working for the Bright Church? Your actions can be really fast! It seems that I should thoroughly bid farewell to the memory of the Dragon and concentrate on the life of the Holy Dragon. After all, the Holy Dragon is more glorious than the Dragon. Much more. But..." Gregory’s voice slowly lowered. "The two masters are gone, don't you even need me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "Gregory, the sacred dragon Known to fly only in the glory of the gods, you should work hard to break through this plane. If you can go, you will leave this plane as soon as possible, I will try to help you. Anyway, you should Try to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dead of night, Rogge appeared quietly in the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Fengyue and Naifei have already slept. The two of them grew up a little, just as they grew faster than who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and sneaked into the magic lab, then reached out and grabbed a giant sword that had nothing to do with his body. The sword of the Great Sword is burning with the flaming flames of the heavens. This is the great sword that the power angel used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently stroked the sword of the sword with his hand, letting the flame of the sword burn. For a long time, he opened his eyes slightly and squirted a thick black gas. Then the whole body radiates a faint sacred glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sword is like regaining life in his hands, the holy flame is blazing, and the sword is also making a pleasant tweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger bounced the blade, listening to the long tremolo, and then throwing the Great Flame into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky was bright, Rogge led more than a dozen churches from the transmission circle and stood in the sky above a huge mountain range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the main force of the church is still in the North. Haven't had time to come back. Therefore, what Rogge brought out this time is a sacred warrior. But here is located in the western part of the mainland. Not far from the borders of the Confederacy, so Rogge is not worried. These dozens of sacred churches are good at coordinating combat, and killing a few low-end dragons is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a small area on the magic map can actually be a few hundred kilometers. Rogge's eyes were slightly bent, and he scanned the mountains under the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deep mountain is indeed a strong and evil atmosphere, a very familiar atmosphere of Rogge. He suddenly understood why Feng Yue chose this area. This is the hiding place of the three dragons Istarazze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man can’t help but be discouraged, although Xiaofengyue is far from growing up. But the feeling of strength, has been faint over the fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly closed his eyes, distinguishing the scent of Istaraz in the space. The power of the three dragons is more than that of the silver dragon king. The fat man knows that it will be a big battle waiting for him today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the fat man opened his eyes and pointed to the northwest. The church was immediately listed as a battle formation, followed by Rogge to the shelter of Istarazze. on the way. After the fat man simply told the sanctuary about the strength characteristics and attributes of the three dragons, everyone has already entered the territory of the three dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge led the Church to a mountain. He screamed that the two churches immediately moved over a box with hundreds of powerful magic scrolls on one side and twenty magic arrows of different attributes on the other. The power of these magical arrows is very fierce, if a single arrow hits directly. These powerful creatures, giants and low-ranking dragons, will be immediately hit hard. The churches acted quickly and quickly armed themselves, and the wizards began to bless the help of their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
