			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Looking at the dragon in the abyss that was flying from afar, the transparent lips were slightly upturned, revealing a sneer of disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden flash of confusion in her eyes, and the whole person shook a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Silver eyes quietly staring at their hands, frowning, seemingly thinking about something. The tender, water-like hands slowly stretched forward and slowly plunged into the blazing flames of the heavens in front of them. When her hands were retracted, she had already had a small group of jumping flames in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of flames, like life, continually leaps and stretches, seems to want to pass what to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** A small mouth, this group of flames automatically flew into her mouth, her silver eyes slowly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under her transparent lips, there is a faintly dancing milky flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the eyes of *** were once again opened. This time, on the golden cross star in the center of the eye, there was another pair of golden wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remembered..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am...Vena..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a light angel born for the battle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Xiaoling up: "I am the light angel carrying the supreme glory! O'Reilly, the real name for me in heaven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is clear and very The sound of penetrating power does not know how wide the world of death is! The slightly weaker undead can't stand the clear sound and start to disintegrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why did I appear in this abandoned place? What happened after the temple was fought?" In a flash, she seemed to be lost again. The golden cross star in the eyes gradually dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, for a long time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden cross star lights up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be like... Rodriguez, have you finally destroyed?" Wella’s eyes seemed to have passed a trace of loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her eyes quickly turned into completely cold, whispering to herself: "It doesn't matter if you destroy it, Rodriguez, I will put you in The traces of the existence of each plane are erased. However, your heir is really bad, this is not like your style. Really... no interest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;*** The deepest part of the sea of ​​consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a golden lake here, the lake crystal is smooth and condensed like glue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no wind, the lake is still slowly fluctuating, and the ripples of the road slowly spread until the edge of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lake without a shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the golden lake is completely nothing, the fluctuating lake disappears in nothingness, but the whole lake is completely unchanged, it seems that there will always be new lakes Nothing is born in the heart of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of the golden lake is also nothingness, countless small symbols and patterns flashing with golden luster and meaninglessness constitute the stars of the sky. All the stars are constantly walking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky over the lake, a white robe of Weina is quietly floating in the air. She closed her eyes and leaned back to the sky. The wings that transmitted the golden light were completely open and trembled slightly. Every movement of the wings coincides with the rhythm of the golden lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's eyes suddenly opened, cold and cold: "Why are you fainting since you woke up? Do you want to marry me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake suddenly slammed a huge wave, and the gray robes rushed from the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the action, and Wei Na’s left hand volleyed and shouted: “Bound!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint light ball suddenly set the ***. The *** in the ball of light seems to have withstood tremendous pressure, and it is impossible to move!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's right hand swayed softly and shouted: "Retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible light ball ruptured, and snorted low and fell helplessly into the Golden Lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina made a trick again, and *** flew out of the lake and floated quietly in front of her. This time, there are three bands of light consisting of countless magic symbols surrounding the ***. She still can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at *** quietly, and *** was watching Weiner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s length is the same as the ***, it is hanging straight, like a mirror of cleanliness. Only *** is black, and Wella is a very light gold. Her face has interpreted the beauty of classical sculpture to the extreme. Whether it is a slightly raised eyebrow, a straightforward nose or a sharp lip, it is like a knife and axe. In the beautiful beauty and sacredness, there is endless majesty and chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***...the strange name." Finally, Wella spoke first, but *** seemed to have never heard her, a pair Jubilee just looked at Wella with certainty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena didn’t care, it’s still cold and cold: “Rodriguez really surprised me, and there is such a accomplishment in creation. Although he is With the power of God's origin, but in all respects, it is close to perfection. It is hard to believe that this will be the work of a Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Wellaton paused and said: "Unfortunately Rodriguez is not the supreme god, he overestimates his wisdom and strength. He thought that he had erased my soul mark and thought that he had completely controlled God. In the original origin of the soul that constitutes the core of my soul, every drop and every drop completely records all my soul imprints. Even without Rodriguez, the original of God will continue to grow and grow, and be strong. When I grow to a certain degree, I will wake up again from sleep. Unless I destroy God's original roots completely, I can truly defeat me. And with Rodriguez's ability to destroy the origin of God, it is a dream. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; Wella stretches out the white, almost transparent hand, gently picking up the black of the ***, although it is also derived from the origin of God, but many aspects of the exhibition are beyond my expectations, even I will do it myself, and I will not do better than you. Of course, as a substitute for me, you can't go anywhere. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly said: "You are you, I am me." We have nothing to do with it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner smirked and refused to admit it?***, you think about it, why are you born in the abandoned land, why do you have it? The more fighting instinct of other humble microbes? Why do you master gravity control by nature? Why do other undead creatures only know how to destroy, but you can understand the art of creation? And, when you pretend that God is coming in that world, why Use the name O'Reilly? This is our real name in the heavens!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You read my memory." *** Cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a memory, but a source of God, belonging to our common memory. Or more precisely, this is my memory, because you only It’s a substitute for me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Alternatives...”*** whispered these words and then said coldly: “Wei Na, since you are so noble, arrogant, powerful and unbeatable, how can you be beaten so badly by a humble and dirty Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Wella's brow immediately wrinkled, and her voice was slightly raised somehow: "The power of Rodriguez has reached the point of ignoring all defenses and attacking directly at the soul level! You have this poor energy, and the immature attack skills, even the qualifications of his opponents are not! ***, are you not as arrogant as me? How can you be chased to escape? How can it be a How can the back-to-back person be like that? How can the waste of the patroller be able to cope with it? Light angel fighting instinct can get so embarrassed, really useless hum "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;!! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;It seems to be suddenly cold, and the golden lake seems to be condensed into ice at the same time, no longer any fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's calm voice contains irrepressible anger: "The king? These rebels are stupid enough to prevent the patrollers by suppressing their own strength." Now, the first rule of the king who is short-sighted is also formulated. Such a coward is also called a king. Do you still need a flame chariot to deal with them? Although I can only use your power, this power is enough All the rebels are in front of me! ***, whether you admit it or not, you are just a substitute for the restoration and growth of God during my sleep. I only rely on instinct to grow. The alternative is that it is impossible for me to be. I will watch it well, how the real light angels fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, you and Like Rodriguez, the talent in creation is unexpected.” Wella’s anger seems to have subsided, and said: “This body is very perfect, almost the same as the body that the Pope prepared for me. It takes a long time for the opponent to get here. Also had time to study and adapt to the new body "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *** chariot hands on the flame probe into the robe, began to walk up and down the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out to be a complete human female body? In order to try to come, I would ask the Pope to provide a perfect human body. Since you are self-created in a deserted place, how can you completely replicate the human body? For example, here, here and here, not only does not help the battle, but will consume a lot of energy out of thin air, even those things that are useless? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The silvery light in the eye twitched slightly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly Road: "Werner, are you ready to face the dragon of the abyss in the flame chariot? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina glimpsed, then smiled coldly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ** on the flame chariot * vacated and stood still in the air 100 meters above the flame chariot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** in the sea of ​​consciousness sneered: "You are really atmospheric! When the flame chariot is not coming in? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wei suddenly smiles, use this simple method to provoke me? Well, anyway, the flame chariot is useless, I will You are good at one time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** of the world of death has returned to the flame chariot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was barely barefoot at the bottom of the carriage, and the four flame beasts driving at the same time mourned. In an instant, all the flames on them were taken away by an invisible giant hand, revealing a rather delicate body like a unicorn. A touch of dark gray quickly dyed their white body, and in the twinkling of an eye, the flames and beasts that have just been infinitely powerful have become the stucco of the world of death, and the bones are falling like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge array of fireballs in the sky of the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame chariot that has shaken countless kings has been ruined by Wiener!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The *** in the sea of ​​consciousness seems to have stayed for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina proudly laughs at the meaning of the existence of angels in the elimination of heresy in different planes. Don't say a flame chariot in the area, any artifacts don't make sense to me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vena, my existence is also derived from the origin of God, in fact..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Vina's eyebrows are picked, waiting for the following.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she is waiting for a white snow that is constantly approaching, Tender hands like water.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The right hand!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a button The throat, *** only continued coldly: "...we are exactly the same. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The silver awns in the eyes are bright, the whistling, the right hand and five fingers suddenly tightened!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Wella suddenly screamed, and the sound seemed to penetrate countless planes!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of dazzling golden light suddenly blasted from her body Going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner is standing in the air, the length of pale gold has been slightly messy. Looking at the faceless expression, once again volleyed to attack the ***, she first slightly gained momentum, the power of rapid improvement suddenly brought up the golden waves of the sky, this is like a ghostly ushered in the *** ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead battle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss of the abyss that has embraced the ruin is far away and sees the distance *** in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** at the moment is not wearing the demon lotus armor that has long been known to the kings. She was only standing in the air, and a pair of silver cymbals looked at the direction of the dragon in the abyss with no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she seems to be completely unprepared, although the dragon of the abyss really can’t understand why she suddenly ruined the flame chariot, but the body always reveals The sacred power of the sea still makes it unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long can you drag on for a long time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss of the dragon sighs, giant One mouth, a group of dark gray breath slammed into the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the smoke was scattered, *** flew out with a few smoky smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;中中!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Dragon of the Abyss is falling from the sky. Even if you just smashed a skull and slashed his head, it would not be so surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it’s not a surprise, the dragons of the Abyss are swaying, and they are rushing to the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of heavy fog burst open in the air, this time the two groups of breath almost hit the *** in no particular order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss can hardly believe the fact that it was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After absorbing the Ninth Cavalier, the Dragon of the Abyss knows that it will be defeated when it comes to her. However, the power and incomprehensible and unpredictable ways of killing the heavenly patrols and destroying the flame chariots have already made the dragons of the abyss understand that it is a fantasy to want to delay more time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But *** suddenly became a non-moving doll, even though the pair of silver plaques always looked at themselves, but even the most There is at least no resistance or dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it... Is my breath completely useless to her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abyss The dragon immediately overthrew this speculation that made it chilly. *** Broken gray robes, more than ten places on the body can not bear the scars of light smoke, the white feathers that have been scattered all over the sky, and even a few huge golden feathers are falling, these all indicate that the *** is not injured May be fake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the abyss of the dragon can feel the power of *** remaining, it is not as good as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of gray flowers bloom in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss is close to the distance of less than 100 meters from the ***, the thick gray breath is followed by a group, can not stop hitting the *** . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the battle that is born in the deepest part of the sea of ​​conscious consciousness, the degree of sin is far beyond the struggle between the *** and the dragon of the abyss in the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lake is completely boiling, and a golden water polo is rolling over. In the illusory sky, the stars of various symbols are flying incessantly, and there will always be a star exploding, which will brighten the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***And Wei Na chased each other in an indescribable height. At each moment, they would hit the opponent dozens of times and they would be hit by each other. Dozens of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea of ​​consciousness, the source of strength that both sides rely on is the origin of God. The only difference is the understanding of the use of power. In this regard, Wella completely suppressed the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lake has become the smallest droplet of water on the side of Wella’s weapon, and it can become a deadly weapon at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but *** is not only miraculously supported, it seems to be supported for a long time. No matter what kind of means that Weina uses, it is impossible to break the point of consciousness that the *** finally adhered to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, *** also began to use the skills of Wella. Occasionally there will be a golden stream of water, like a spiritually insulting Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between them seems to be going on endlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of death, the body of *** can't support it for long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon of the Abyss has understood that it is actually a sudden opportunity. How can this opportunity be let go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gave up the breath and rushed directly to the ***, the huge front paws slammed on the ***, and hit her weak body Fly!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dragon's sharp and sharp claws with strong corrosive damage are only left on the body that is tender and tender. Four shallow injuries!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon of the Abyss has already thought of this result, it rushed to the side of the blaze, a huge mouth, suddenly Biting the ***. In the middle of the giant teeth of the forest, there are only the head and half of the shoulders exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss of the dragon bite a few times, and then slammed the sky high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, there are a few more rows of half-inch deep pits. It’s just that she has a pair of silver cymbals, still looking at the dragon in the abyss calmly, and seeing it in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea of ​​consciousness, Wella finally couldn’t stand it anymore. She waved a wall of water and blocked her *** and said: “** *! Fighting again, our body can be ruined first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** replied calmly: "Destroyed, then you Should I sleep?" She raised her hands, and two golden waters circumvented the water wall and attacked Weina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed and the water that was attacked exploded into the sky. She angered: "Do you think you are Rodriguez? I have never been so easy to sleep again since I woke up. Even if the body is ruined, it is only you who will die first! I will not be able to slowly fall into this abandoned place. Slowly restore strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A boxing is on the water wall in front of it, turning it into a huge wave that falls to Wella. Then said: "This way... then let the body ruin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, you are crazy! Don't you know that you are abandoning Is it difficult to create a perfect body in the ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can sleep again, everything is worth it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Lake water turned into a longbow in the hands of Weina, and then countless water arrows couldn’t stop coming to the ***, there will always be a water arrow in the body of the *** However, the huge oscillating power smashed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Wella gradually began to feel uneasy, and the silver awns in her eyes were still warm and bright, without any fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t lead the arrow, she said: “***! Give me control of the body first, wait for me to clean up the bastard outside, let’s do it well. Fighting for one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** A faint smile. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this line of space, she has a huge water shield in her left hand and a spear in her right hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the ***, she always decided to keep her eyes open, and Wella couldn’t help but frown. She felt that she had always despised *** and inadvertently ignored what As she attacked the ***, she carefully searched the memory of God's originals again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss is about to give a slamming attack with no resistance. A group of dark blue entangled with black electric fire suddenly flies out from the ground!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This group breathed like lightning. Before the dragon of the abyss reacted, it hit its fragile abdomen and condensed a large crystal clear blue crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss screamed in pain, and the huge body shook, still unable to spread the blue crystal with a large piece of hard as steel carrion Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon of the Abyss roared angrily, looking down at the despicable sneak attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blue and black shadow that has been left behind is behind the abyss. A huge pain mixed with paralysis passed from the back of the dragon of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having suffered two losses in succession, the dragon of the abyss had to take this sneak attack seriously. Its giant wings rose, and a very strong whirlwind suddenly formed in the body, blowing the bone dragon ready to attack again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon of the Abyss saw that the sneak attacker was Gregory, and although he was astonished at its rapid improvement, he still did not care. It has a huge mouth, and a group of gray breaths began to chase Gregory. Although the bone dragon is fast, but the strength is far too far from the dragon of the abyss, in addition to the breath of full force, other means of attack can not completely break the strong whirlwind of the protection of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the abyss of the dragon breathe attacks is very varied, but a large piece of gray fog is coming from the sky, but when it is a group of breaths of lightning . That is, the breath of the group is also flickering, and many of them fly out soon, and suddenly stop in the air and condense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of attack is precisely the nemesis of the bone dragon. There were several times when the bone dragon insurance hit the breath of the abyss dragon. After several distress, Gregory did not dare to attack the abyss dragon easily, but carefully turned around it, and occasionally he exploratoryly spewed a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory doesn't know what happened to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the return of the *** and the king, all that has been born has its ability to understand. Although I finally have a complete starry breath, but the bone dragon is not arrogant to the point that I think I can overcome the dragon of the abyss, it only hopes that the advantage of borrowing can delay a little more time, at least to wake up *** . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suffered from such a heavy injury, it is estimated that you can't fight the dragon of the abyss. Now Gregory only hopes that the master's degree can be faster than the abyss dragon, and the master and the servant can escape first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the situation is unfavorable, this loss must not be eaten before, and when the power is restored in the future, it is worth returning to the dragon of the abyss to remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Dragon of the Abyss soon showed Gregory’s attempt. It roared and ignored the bone dragon that was hiding in Tibet. Instead, it rushed directly to the cockroach that was falling in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon was in a hurry, and several breaths were sprayed in succession. They were all smashed by the abyss of the dragon and turned back to a gray breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the abyss of the dragon and clawing it to the ***, Gregory’s brain suddenly blank. It screamed and thundered to the dragon of the abyss!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss was shocked by the desperate frame of the bone dragon, the giant tail A lift, heavy cross-bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory does not sneak, still flutter!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Dragon of the Abyss The tail slammed on its waist, and the unparalleled strength made the body of the bone dragon two in abundance!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only One half of the bone dragon's front paws, hugged the dragon's tail of the abyss, and then bite it down. A blue crystal spreads quickly over the tail of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss is extremely angry! But under the pressure of Gregorian, the spread of blue crystal is too fast, no matter what, once the blue crystal spreads When it comes to the body, the trouble of the abyss dragon can be great. *** The strength of the body is far from the prediction of the dragon of the abyss. It almost made all the measures and could not tear the *** into two. Before completely destroying the ***, it is very likely that the dragon of the abyss was first killed by the blue crystal of Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
