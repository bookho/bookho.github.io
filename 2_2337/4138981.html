			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream scroll chapter thirteen, such as a dream<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall of the air hall is deep and far away The film flies between the snow and the blue light belt, condensing the color, like a dream, blurred fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice crystal in the center of the main hall is still the same, the black-haired goddess in front of the ice crystal is also quiet, as if it has never changed its posture for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whisper of whispers is floating in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feng Yue, the world outside has changed a lot. You know, Androni was killed, and the person who started it was her own relative. But I don't know why, when I come back, I can't find her body anyway. I think you must remember Androni, she has my child, but she can't have time to give birth. Before she goes, she finally The wish is to be able to look at you... Hey, I know, these are no longer important to you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the main hall, Rogge Adjusted your posture so that you can sit more relaxed. He looked up at the windy moon in the air. After a long time, he whispered softly: "The wind and the moon have recently increased the number of believers in the church. You will be able to sense the power of faith and enhance it a lot!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, I know that in order to get these new believers, I have killed many believers in the Church of Light. Although most of them are not directly in my hands, no matter who is the hand, In fact, it should be counted on my head. The war has been going on for almost half a year. I can’t count how many people have killed, one million, or two million?” The voice of the fat man rang again, and the low voice was hidden. A trace of desolateness and helplessness, but more is determined. "But it doesn't matter. As long as I can strengthen my faith, I am not afraid to kill another one million. In fact, I will soon use a million souls to guide the dark gods into the world. I don't know this. It’s not right, maybe I’m personally introducing the source of destruction into this plane. But I can only gamble once, because only the dark Lord God can confront the bright gods behind the bright church! If you don’t attract the dark god, then The heavenly gods will destroy this plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is still silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while. Rogge slowly stood up and took a dark black long box from his arms. The box is made of unknown exotic metal. The blue pattern is used as the base, and the flower branches are decorated with gold silk. The box seems to contain a huge magical power, and there is a faint mist from the middle of the flower branch, dissipating in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several snowflakes fluttered down, silently immersed in the surface of the box, and then passed out from the bottom of the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently stroked it, looking up at the sky like an ice sculpture. Road: "Fengyue, I thought for a long time, it is better to put it here. You don't object?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue as always, said to him Everything is indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has long been used to agreeing to her silence. He raised his hand and threw the metal box to the huge ice crystal behind the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal box immersed in the ice crystal silently, and then slowly sinked down as in the water. Every one sinks. The buoyancy in the ice crystal seems to be a big point. Finally, it stops at the center of the ice crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should go, Fengyue, I will see you again in two days." Rogge finally glanced at the wind and walked out of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the sky hall and stretched out the tip of the metal lotus petal. Looking down on the country of the windy month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly found that there is wind in the gods, the cold in the wind, as she was in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiles slightly, rises into the sky, and disappears in the void above the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the mountains of the south, the four strong men are dying to fight each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of St. Lentini in the wind is not the same as the sword of ordinary magic. It has to be finely divided and half a meter long. It was like a poisonous snake driven by Lentini's fighting spirit. It’s not going to move. Sometimes retreat, sometimes lightning strikes. There are two soft winds on the sword's blade. Under their support, the blade will change direction halfway through the hit, and the placement will be unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross is cold and his swords in the hands will leave dozens of star marks in the air. He moves forward from time to time, and sometimes backs up, but only within a few meters. However, if you look at it as if the wind is fading, you can see that he is not worse than Lentini in speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great Juggernauts are known for their speed and ambiguity. Proscius’s starry temperament is sinister and sinister. And Lentini's beautiful appearance, acting in vain, the breeze brought by her long sword contains hidden and not vindictive, can hurt people invisible, insidious place is no less than starry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great saints are often fighting for a long time, and the long swords will not intersect once. If you look at their duel from afar, it is indeed an unparalleled enjoyment to look at the two people's grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other decisive battle not far away is far more intense than the battle between Prossis and Lentini. Kirbytian is surrounded by a sly brilliance, and the outline of the armor is faintly visible. However, his vindictive armor is much more blurred than the other martyrdom's vindictive armor. In the faint temperament, there is actually a battle armor that has already been solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Rogge is watching the game, he will inevitably sigh. Kirbytian's vindictive armor strength is not worse than the wind sword Saint Stendini, but the person who knows the details is right to the owner of this one-eyed tavern, it is easy to ignore his true power. At that time, the slightest defeat of the enemy was defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corbitian looked a bit embarrassed, solitary, staring at the Bavarian Grand Duke, the hands of the giant swords in the hands of the wind, like a sword, a sword Go to the big public like an axe! He walked heavily, and every step of the way, it seemed that he had to step on the rock under his feet to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the long sword in the hands of Rheinhardt is not obvious, except that the texture is particularly hard enough to collide with Corbetian’s giant sword without damage. I don't see anything special. Dagong pale gray eyes looked at Corbetian without expression. In the hands of the sword, the sword is as simple as the wind, the sword is unpretentious, and it is not seeking meritorious service, but it is not overwhelming, and it is not sloppy, and the attack of the one-eyed dragon is fierce and fierce, and it is impossible to break the defense of the Dagong Ruo Ruojin Tang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield is not only the splendid brilliance that blooms when the swordsmanship and the vindictiveness break out. There are also a little bit of blood on the splash. In fact, the four strong men have been fighting from the early morning to the evening, still playing hard to understand. The battles between the two sides are intricate. I will exchange opponents from time to time, or I will attack the other person. As time went by, the consumption of vindictiveness of both sides increased, and some minor injuries were hanged on the body. When the four strong men are in a melee, the weapons do not need to be in direct contact with the **, and it is possible that the defensive temperament on the sword front may cut the defense of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early battle, Kirbytian and Lentini could still have the upper hand. Kirbytian is very aggressive. The swordsmanship is wide open and powerful. The wind and sword Saint St. Lentini is a light and metamorphosis, and he just complements him. In contrast, the complementarity between Dagong and Prossis is not so perfect, and the cooperation between the two sides is also very raw, so they are in a difficult battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Prossis and Rheinhardt have patience. Although Proscius's starry temperament is slightly weaker than that of Brentini, his sword skills and starry spirits have long been integrated into one, and they are natural. There is no flaw at all. Although Lentini has the upper hand, it is impossible to completely defeat Prossi's guard. The Bavarian Grand Duke began to defend. It’s just that the Bavarian Grand Duke’s sacred spirit is pure and true, and other characteristics have not yet been manifested, but it is enough to prompt the primary treatment in the battle, to heal himself and some insignificant small wounds on Prosecus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, this fierce, sinister but very dull balance of the Sanctuary confrontation. It is quietly shifting to Procis and the Bavarian Grand Duke. Lentini and Corbetian have felt the subtle changes in the war situation, they tried to save the disadvantages, but the patience and resilience of Prossia and Bavarian Dagong are far beyond their imagination, firmly grasp the situation, and will The advantages are expanding bit by bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini suddenly stepped back and instantly stood at a distance of more than ten meters from Procys, and the long sword in his hand made a long, loud sound. Refers to the Starry Juggernaut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross stands up with the sword, calmly watching the crazy rising of the temperament of Lentini, the water in the hands of the long-sword of the blue light Huaning is mild. Not at all because of the vindictiveness of the opponent's climbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pross! Don't you have anything to do with the past?" Lentini shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini's voice climbed wildly with her vindictiveness: "You only remember the children of Kelly! What about the children in my stomach?! You don't even know the existence of this child! I tell you, throw in your heart. On the night I went, I knocked him out! Procis, if you throw me down, then I can kill your child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When I heard that Lentini had a child, Pross’s eyes finally fluctuated, but this was a sneak peek. On the side of the body, Kirbytian’s muscles twitched, and the two-handed swords that were waving in the air stagnate slightly, and this continues to be cut. At this time, the Bavarian Grand Duke suddenly retreated ten tens of meters away, his body was white and radiant, and several low-level treatments had been applied to himself, and he also gave Pross a cure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross looked at Lentini, but faintly said: "Lentini, the things of the past are long gone, now I am only interested in the sword in my hand. If you intend to continue this decisive battle, then I will kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini’s crazy laughter, vindictiveness has climbed to At the limit, many tiny wounds on her body squirted fine blood lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Pross, come kill me! See who can kill us among us!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lentini slowly raised the long sword, the soft sword front was smothered by the vindictiveness, and several light blue winds could not dance around the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corbitian looked at the ten-meter-meter, not as strong as the Bavarian Grand Duke. Slowly lift the two-handed sword over your head. Hey! His giant sword made a bell-like vibrato, and then a rag of flame quickly ignited from the hilt to the tip of the sword, and the hot air made his figure a little fuzzy. His roaring monocular slowly sheds a blood line, and the armor that has become vindictive has disappeared. It seems that all the power has been concentrated on the two-handed sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combionian screamed, along with the snoring, a few six-pointed stars smoldering in his body. Surrounded by his body, he danced slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed dragon suddenly jumped into the air, and the two-handed swords were like a mountain. When the head fell to the Bavarian Grand Duke. Dagong also changed his hands to hold the sword. If the long sword had a heavy weight, he slowly waved up and greeted the sword front of Kirbytian! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little flash shines between the swords of the double swords, and the moment is already bright to the point of capturing all the colors in the world! The sudden violent storm has nowhere to vent the violent energy, plowing a pit over one meter deep on the hard ground, and the outer edge is still unable to expand outward! In the center of the stormy storm. The chain armor of Corbetian has been torn and shattered by the frantic vindictive air. His strong body is quickly covered with wounds, and even flies out of the flesh! However, his bloody monologue still roared, desperately trying to vindict the temper, trying to bring the Dagong Lianjian into two! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sword can't move forward, because he wants to open is a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor of Dagong is obviously much better than the texture of Corbetian, and it is only covered with cracks in such a storm. It hasn't been broken yet, but Dagong's helmet has been smothered by the vindictiveness, revealing a huge amber gemstone set on the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light gray eyes of Dagong ignited the blazing flame, and the gems of the forehead were also releasing brilliant brilliance. The brilliance of the gem is getting brighter and brighter, and the intense amber brilliance in the blink of an eye overwhelm everything, filling up the vision of Corbetian...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenty Nie’s long sword silently greeted the prosthetic sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperament attached to her sword has suppressed the starry temper of Pross in an instant. And in one fell swoop, he smashed his magic sword. It was just that this shot was not without cost, and Lentini spurted a blood. However, she smiled almost insanely, and the sword of the long sword trembled, crushing the starry sword of the Starry Sword in an inch, and swam to his heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prossian handsome and strange face suddenly became transparent, revealing a faint aqua blue brilliance from the skin. He left the magic sword with only the stalk in his hand, and the right hand that also became blue and transparent, like a sapphire, even grasped the sword of Lentini! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini’s eyes are widened by horror, because her swordsman is no longer able to penetrate, and Pross’s left hand has a pure The long sword of the starry sky, a sword stabbed her heart unrelentingly! Lentini made a rush of anger. But in front of the starry sky that is as deep as the sea. Her raging wind and waves disappeared into the sea in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the swordsmanship of the starry sky was slow, but finally touched Lentini's left chest. Her gorgeous breastplate was quickly sunken, cracked and broken before the starry air, and then the shirt under the arm was also free of wind and cracks, revealing the white chest muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sound was crisp, Dagong slashed the sacred sword from the side and picked up the prosperous sword of Prossis. Then he hit a heavy punch on Lentini's back, and the slapstick attached to the fist smashed her defense with only one blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lentini spurted a spurt of blood, and the vest at the vest was broken. She shook a little, and she fell to the ground and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosisi brows slightly wrinkled, looking at Dagong quietly, the vindictive sword in his hand is still shooting a little star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the setting sun, the brilliance of the gem on the forehead is becoming softer and softer. He smiled and said: "Mr. Pross, you have already left the old feelings, so let her be handed over to me! The magical army of the Babylonian Empire is very popular with the secret."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross looked at the unconscious Lentini, sinking into silence. He naturally knows what Dagong means. I also know what happens in the process of forcing Lentini to reveal the secrets of the demon army. Although his heart is dead, Lentini’s relationship with him is unusual after all, so he is always indulged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong sees him hesitating, frowning: "So, Mr. Prossis, I know that you are very old-fashioned with the Juggling Juggernaut. I can say hello to the Pope, in this year's new children in the church. First, you will pick ten people to pass on your starry spirit. How do you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross fingertips trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, the Church of the Light Church will select a group of qualified children from all over the mainland. Corresponding training for their respective characteristics. Although none of these children eventually became a sacred place, the establishment of the Church of the Light has been established for hundreds of years. As the church is growing, the number of churches is increasing. The sacred church and the Holy Knights are the core of the light of the Church, and the growth of the Church in turn promotes the expansion of the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of today’s bright church, there are still more than one hundred children selected from all over the mainland every year. Naturally everyone has extraordinary martial arts or magical days. Share. If Prossi can pick ten people from it. With his current accomplishments, in time, a new Juggernaut will appear in his disciples. In the past ten years, among all the disciples of Procis, the only genius is Androni, so he will pass the stars to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross knows that Androni has arrived in the north and stood on the side of the sacred agreement. However, after hearing that she also broke through the sanctuary, the heart of the Starry Juggernaut is still more gratified than regret. After all, for the strong. Few people will value secular powers and disputes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosses did not answer Dagong’s question, but simply turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong looked at Lentini, who was still unconscious, and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the summer, after Rogge single-handedly attacked the front line of the Shenghui League, the battlefield that had been stuck in the rubber suddenly warmed up. On the night of Rogge and the strongmen withdrawing Oshniah, Pompei’s Poseidon Corps suddenly dispatched. The route along Rogge swept the front line of the Shenghui Alliance, and over the night, the three small fortresses and six towns were flattened, which caused the material accumulation and transportation hubs in the hinterland of the Alliance to be sheltered and directly exposed to the empire. In front of the army's iron ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hundreds of kilometers away, Alexander’s Glacier Corps also began to advance. The Northern ** god defeated the 100,000-strong army of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in a series of battles in the Maple Leaf Plain, tearing open a big hole on the front line of the Shenghui Alliance, and marching forward and marching deep into the battlefield. At this time, the situation of the Glacier Legion is very favorable. It can be attacked into the territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the west, or it can be turned south. In the back of the 300,000 allied army behind the ‘meat grinder’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the powers of the Allies are relatively weak east. The Shenghui League also launched a fierce attack. However, after the baptism of many wars, the face of the Drodi team finally changed. Although they were defeated under the attack of the Legion of the Bavarian Principality, they were able to achieve defeat and chaos. After a few tens of kilometers, they still maintained a relatively complete front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the late summer season, the number of casualties on both sides rose straight, and the mark on the map's front line continued to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the war on the Eastern Front, the Shenghui League is not always smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a summer afternoon, four thousand human face spider knights are following the road, they are preparing to intercept a light in front of the Dro Empire cavalry. Since the beginning of the war, the most devastating loss of the various armies of the Dro army has been the cavalry. If the squadron of more than 3,000 people is annihilated, it will be a small loss for the Dro Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire human face of the Knights of the Knights remained silent, but the hoofs rumbling, the horse's iron hooves made the earth tremble slightly. Suddenly, the earth's tremors were a little stronger. Although this change is extremely small, it does not mean the sensitivity of Gonzalez. He raised his right hand, and the adjutant who was riding next to him immediately issued a command. In a twinkling of an eye, the entire human face spider knight stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth's tremors are becoming more and more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gonzalez brows urgently, raising his hand to the side, the entire human face spider knight immediately moved, facing the direction of his fingers, cloth Good battle. Several mages in the Knights began to curse and bless their protective magic. It seems to have sensed the invisible tension. Many horses are humming low and uneasily swaying the ground with iron hooves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the hills beyond the kilometer. The enemy finally appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sword in his hand that shines with beautiful Blu-ray, Gonzalez’s pupils are getting tighter and tighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog stood on the top of the hill for a moment, suddenly raised his hand to Gonzalez, then took a big step, and suddenly went to the whole person The Spider Knights launched a raid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is this person? Does he want to attack us? It’s crazy!" A mage who just transferred to the Human Face Spider Knight pointed Roger, who rushed to the wind, asked incredibly to the knights around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not waited for the answer, he feels a sudden pain in his hand. The mage screamed. When I looked at it, I found out that my whole hand was actually melting! In his eyes, the whole world began to be red-hot, and the surrounding scenery was gradually distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Master feels a little, look up and see that it’s only a dozen meters above the head. I don’t know when there’s a dozens of squares of fire clouds, fire clouds. Exuding the amazing heat, the spiders and knights gathered to the bottom of the crowd are almost transparent flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flamestorm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master’s consciousness just came to the name of this magic. The blazing flame has swallowed him all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time as the formation of the fire cloud, Rogge has already rushed into the formation of the human face spider knight. A few blue brilliance suddenly illuminate, and the sharp and unparalleled blue sky has already cut several pieces of the unprepared knights into pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s shot, breaking the gunpoint of a stabbing gun, and then shouting, trying to get out of the cloud Gonzalez throws it! The fat man does not look at his own achievements. He turned to the distance and disappeared in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human face spider knight is worthy of the name of the elite, in this short moment, several knights have been blocked by Rogge and Gonzalez between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish that flows at the tip of the gun, silently enters the body of the knights, and wears them from behind them. The speed has not slowed down. Into the chest of Gonzalez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air hall, snow seems to never end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still leaning against the wall, looking up at the wind and the moon. Road: "This time Gonzalez should have no chance to survive. Unless there is any god who will save him. In fact, it may not be Anne who is hurting him, but since I only know that the murderer is related to the Roscio family, then simply All of their families have been wiped out. Anyway, even if they kill the mistakes, there is nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was silent for a while, said: "Time is not early, I should go back. I will come back with you in a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
