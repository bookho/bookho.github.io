			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream volume is destroyed under four destruction<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, a time-time reel! Actually The time is still scrolling to please people, the master of the master... No, he is really a rare master!” The gnome of the earth did not know when he slipped back to the side of Wella and was amazed. It has also read a lot of love rituals with Wella some time ago. Although it only seems to understand and understand, the vain Gregory has already considered himself a human race expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at the square and didn’t look back. It’s faintly said: “Gregory, kill the twins in the air!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is still not over. After knocking down the prophet of the earth, the powerful ones dispersed. Rogge ran to the other side of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden exclamation from Mora. Rogge was shocked and turned his head and looked at it. It was at this time that a striking light beam suddenly rose from the direction of the exclamation, which was the breath of Constantine. The fat man immediately let go of his heart and rushed to the ritual hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distant sky, the sacred dragon is hovering up and down, and fights with more than 20 bipedal dragons around the body. The sacred dragon that sits on the top of all dragons has a bipedal dragon with only a poor and bloody dragon. This battle is really no suspense. The characteristics of the Wyvern is a huge poison, but this is not useful for the Holy Dragon. On the lethality of melee, their minions are not as good as the sharp tomahawks of the elite orcs. After giving himself a heavy protection magic, Gregory is letting them bite, that is, more scratches. However, the counterattack of the sacred dragon was also surprisingly weak and weak, and it took half a day to kill two two-legged dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is afraid that he will kill too fast, and the owner of Wella will whipping the dragon. The new task is placed on it, although it is broad, but does not take the local dragon back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle in the Temple of the Beast is disorganized, and the strong and the strong are fighting each other, doing what they think is right. The only purpose of this battle is to level the entire beast temple. As for how to level it, there is no plan at all. Rogge knows that these strong people are not obeying others' scheduling, and it is in vain to work out a detailed plan. Anyway, the party has an overwhelming advantage in strength, and it is unexpected. Still not letting them let them burn and rob, maybe the efficiency can still be high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the temple. The Great Sacrifice is still fighting hard. If he is a tireless magical scorpion, like a thunder, the magic book in his hand is flipping fast, and countless magics smash one by one to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Ogan Heller is completely at a disadvantage. The dozens of flame guards that have wandered around the hall have been turned into scorch marks on the ground, and Androni's speed has reached its utmost, and the beautiful starry temperament draws a dazzling trail in the hall. She even greets the magic of Ogan Heller directly, avoiding it at the moment when it is not allowed. Then he stabbed a sword on Ogan Heller, and he calmly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she and the Death Class can’t completely break the defense of the Great Sacrifice, and countless attacks leave little scars in the blink of an eye. The recovery force disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-lost battle here has caught the attention of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne, Sarawinge, Miro, and Rogge are all on one side, frowning, observing the great sacrifices in the battle of courage. Just after they hit a few shots, they solved all the flame guards in the temple, and then attacked Ogan Heller respectively, but this time Ogan Heller's magic resistance is almost the point of immunization against all magic attacks! In addition to the physical attack of Milo, he can hurt him. The attacks of other powerful players with magical attributes are almost useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog has scanned the body of the Great Sacrifice with spiritual power several times, trying to find out what power is guarding him. However, no matter how hard he tried, he still had nothing to gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall suddenly dimmed, and the boundless darkness expelled the light and became the master of the hall. In the sacrificial hall, only the flame on the altar radiated a faint glow. The torch on the four walls is as yellow as a candle in the distance. In the darkness, like the power of thousands of scorpions, Roger was a little breathless. His spiritual strength rose sharply and his body was full of faint silver brilliance, which was able to withstand the pressure of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the majesty of the Dark Lord God, all hidden forces will be invisible." Sarah Wenger slowly said. The darkness of the darkness continued to flow from his body, and he rushed toward the big sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately re-scanned the body of Ogan Heller, this time it was discovered that there are three looming lights that connect him to the flame of the altar. The feeling of these three rays is very familiar. That is the breath of the natural goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly realized. It turns out that Ogan Heller has the power of nature goddess to protect, no wonder there will be close to immortal defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His strength comes from the altar!" The fat man yelled. Then he waved his hand and a dark pike quickly flew to the altar. However, the fast-moving magical rifle touched the edge of the altar, only to hear a loud bang, the magical rifle hit an invisible shield, and after a sizzling rain, it disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft magical wind swept from Roger's side and blew into the battle of Ogan Heller. Adrienne said in a hurry in the darkness: "The magic book in his hand has teleporting magic! He does not escape, he wants to drag us here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden burst of purple flames in the darkness, Miro’s giant hammer hit the head of Ogan Heller and knocked him to the ground. But the great sacrifice immediately climbed up, and the magic book in his hand uttered countless thorns and wiped a scar on Miro's arm. The darkness in the hall was all gathered on the altar at this time, and the invisible shield continued to blow out the dazzling flame, which was supported by the darkness of the press. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moments, the strongmen in the temple have already shot, the energy gathered from all sides is like a knife, and the flesh and blood will be a little bit Point to the ground from the big sacrifice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rogge slipped out of the hall. After a while, the ritual hall screamed in a row, and the orcs screamed before the death. Then countless orcs smashed their heads and flew in from outside the temple, and slammed into the great sacrifice Ogan Heller. Other bodies flew to the altar and burst above the altar, sprinkling a bloody rain like a waterfall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar's shield can block powerful attacks and magic, but it does not react to these unpowered corpses and blood. As soon as the blood of the beast fell into the altar, it was immediately simmered by the high temperature of the flame and the blue and dark green mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more corpses in the altar, and the flames of the altar have finally changed color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Doomsday Guard! Where is the Doom Guard?" Ogan Heller, who has been unable to support it, sensed the decline of the body's power. Almost desperately shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doomsday guards are sealed at the deepest point of the Beast Temple, and they have two passages leading to the ground. Ogan Heller sensed a strong breath at one of the exits. But no matter how he calls, the doomsday guards in the induction can't get out of this exit, and they are obviously blocked and bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the other exit, the horrible doomsday guards stepped one after another, one after another lost contact with Ogan Heller . They are like a step into an absolute darkness, and there is no news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short time. Ogan Heller did not know how many attacks were made in the strong, and the bones were exposed in many places. The magical energy of Adrienne's straight eruption even runs directly through his chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic book in the hands of the Great Sacrifice quickly turned over a page. He screamed and slammed into the giant hammer of Miro and knocked him Fly backwards! Miro's face was amazed, and he couldn't imagine why this orcing dying orc sacrificed so much power in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller, who was flying up, cast his head on the altar, and the fire on the altar was correspondingly high, and his broken body was rolled in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelene was wearing an attempt by Ogan Heller. Immediately exclaimed: "He wants to teleport!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved her hand and instantly cast a magical storm like a sharp edge. However, she did not think that the Great Sacrifice would choose to run away from the Miro's giant hammer, so the offensive was a slow step, and only had time to cut off one leg of Ogan Heller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face changed slightly, this orc great sacrifice that can attract the natural goddess of the goddess of strength, if it escaped, it is endless! As for one less leg. For a natural goddess who is well-treated, it is not impossible to regenerate a leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro's face is extremely ugly. What he did just was too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the powers were secretly annoyed, the screaming hall suddenly screamed with a sharp scream, and all the burning flames were extinguished in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantaneous darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a strong silver flash of lightning cut through the darkness and leapt over the hall! In the blink of an eye, the glare of the glare made the strong people dare not look straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dazzling electric light was scattered, the dragon's soul gun with a silver glow was inserted straight into the center of the main hall. An invisible wave of power spread to the four sides with the dragon soul gun as the center. In an instant, the entire beast temple was shrouded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this powerful and unmatched power fluctuations. The structure of all spaces has been slightly distorted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere in the Temple of the Beast, Ogan Heller screamed. Bounced out of the void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcibly interrupting the instantaneous movement that has been cast in a way that distorts the spatial structure. What kind of power is this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people are watching the dragon soul guns silently, with complex expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straight and sturdy dragon soul gun not only interrupts the instantaneous movement of Ogan Heller, but also proudly declares strength to the strong, and from In the flowing silver light, the strong even felt a little anger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne is pale. The dragon soul gun was almost past the tip of her nose, and at the moment the gun was still wrapped around her hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a response to the call of the soul, the dragon soul gun suddenly jumped and flew into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah Wenger suddenly sighed and broke the silence in the hall. He looked at Adrienne with a meaningful look. Turned out of the hall. Miro, Androni and the Death Class are also looking at Adrienne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was always a smile and Adelene could only barely smile at the moment, her eyes flashed and the figure disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps only she understands the full meaning of the Dragon Soul Gun. Adelaide’s proud skills will never be used in front of the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the call of Rogge suddenly came from afar, and the strong men kept silent and ran toward the direction of the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of a vast building, Rogge is struggling. The fat man took a double-edged axe from where he did not know where to grab it. Screaming loudly, struggling to kill in the orc warriors. Beside him. There will be instant fireballs, shock waves, and even ice cones. Anyway, all sides are orc warriors, how to put magic can be fried to a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge struggles, just because it is too late to kill so many orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, almost the orc warriors of the entire beast temple gathered together from all directions, one by one, and they rushed to Rogge! The first to rush to the elite warriors, there are some shaman and sacrifice, but Rogge later. It’s almost all the waiters and chefs who don’t have any martial arts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s eyes are full of splashing blood and internal organs, and the faces of countless orcs are swaying in front of his eyes. The double-edged axe in his hand had already disappeared wherever he went, and the magic was almost exhausted. But as long as the spirit is abundant, Rogge can become a killing machine. There are thin scales on his body, and his hands have turned into sharp claws. He almost tears open the chest of an orc by instinct, pulls out the heart, and crushes it. Then pounce on the next victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly felt the pressure was light. He looked around and found that the last opponent had been shredded by himself. On the square, hundreds of orcs were smashed, and more orcs were stubborn because of their vitality. They could not die for a while, and they could only helplessly scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge walked to the temple in front of him. He knew that something important must be hidden here. Otherwise, these orcs will not die like this to stop themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped, but failed to move, and his leg was stinging. Rog looked down and saw that an orc with a heart that had been thrown out but still not dead was clinging to his leg and biting his calf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled coldly, his right hand raised high, and the five fingers again extended sharp claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands are raised but not dropped. The orc was dead at the moment, but he was still so powerful when he dragged the arms of Rogge’s legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed. Bend down the waist. Pulling the orc's hand slowly, he reached out and lifted the pair of eyes that were still round. This came to the front of the hall, and pushed hard, and the two locked temple doors collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the temple door fell, Rogge, Androni, Ban, and Miro were all stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the giant hall of a hundred meters, thousands of young orcs are crowded together, showing the color of fear. In front of them, there are more than ten adult orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glanced at the main hall for a week. The layout here is very similar to the Terran Magic School. It seems to be a school for educating young orcs. Being able to learn in the Temple of the Beast, it goes without saying that they are all elites of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes fell on the young orcs of the temple. Among them are both childish little trolls and young, seemingly furry wolves. This age of orcs, no matter which race is not evil, only cute. And the young orcs here are obviously different from all the orcs that Rog has ever seen, and the light of wisdom can be seen in the eyes of their fears. At least just before, Rogge would never have thought that the orcs would build their own college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe their wisdom is really close to the human race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't hurt them!" With a hoarse howl, a magical shock hit the back of Rogge. In the midst of it, I don’t know who gave Rogge a magic shield that black flames condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned and saw Ogan Heller immersed himself in the blood, dragging only one leg, relying on the staff to support step by step and struggle. The magic book in the hands of the Great Sacrifice will take a long time to turn over a page and release an attacking magic to Rogge. But at the moment. All his magic is so weak in front of Rogge's magic shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three strong players did not start, just watching Ogen Heller step by step to Rogge. Behind the Orc's Great Sacrifice, there is a road of blood staining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you escape?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My family... my children are here!" Ogan Heller replied with difficulty. There is a terrible wound in his throat. Every time he says a word, there will be a large amount of blood flowing out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge extended his left hand and held the neck of Ogan Heller. He looked at the eyes of the orc's great sacrifice and sighed, "If you come back, there is no land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know...but I am a proud orc, It is... glorious beast god servant. I can't let the children down... run away.” Ogan Heller's voice is getting weaker and weaker, and blood has begun to emerge from his mouth, dripping down the two fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed, his left hand gripped, and the orc ritually headless body slowly fell to his feet. A breeze swept over, and the magic book and the staff of the Great Sacrifice were turned into fly ash, and went with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge mentioned the head in his hand. Looking at Ogen Heller’s roaring eyes, he sighed. At the last moment, Rogge did not tell him that there is no existence of the beast in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you set fire?" Rogge asked faintly as he passed by Miro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!" Miro replied coldly: "Do you want to burn those little orcs? Why don't you do this kind of thing yourself?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
