			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sin and punishment of the four chapters of wisdom <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the autumn sun, the gods The city has become more and more beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of the city of the gods grows rapidly, and after a day and night, it has grown several times. In addition to the side of the lake, the high walls have wrapped the entire city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking away, the city of the gods at this time is like a tulip blooming in the green grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the petals of the tulip rises with a burst of mist, and the faint magical lights make the Elf City look like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon sun, an elder old tree in the center of the city of the gods began to grow at a speed visible to the naked eye, a straight branch like a hand Lee sword, pointing to the sky. With the growth of the ancient trees of the elves, the petals of the tulip began to unfold one by one, and the flattened, revealing a delicate and soft core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the central elf tree stopped growing and turned slowly, and it turned out to be like a burning torch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint white light column suddenly rises from the ancient tree of the elves. At the end of the beam is a blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every elf in the City of God is busy. In accordance with the command of the wizard, they kept on and off, controlling the growth of various parts of the city of the gods, and instinctively affecting the magic of the flow in the plant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shrine of the central square, Hughes was frowning at the Amorro bound in the bush. At this moment, the Amorro looked sluggish and softly squatted on the ground. Its huge mountain body shivered slightly, allowing the source of blood-sucking thorns to constantly extract vitality from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Xius! No more strength can be extracted. Now Amaro has some support." The elf mage who is responsible for the operation of the temple is nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes brows tighter, he looks up and down at the Amorro, the sharp eyes are as real, see where, Amaro Where the muscles will tremble involuntarily. This once demon-like demon, at this moment in front of the silent Xius, but there is no courage to ask for mercy, only pity. Silently awaiting the verdict of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Increase the pumping force until you meet the needs of the main magical position!" Hughes is cold and cold. "At least half an hour. It definitely can't die!" I want to marry my old man. Your devil's rank is still a bit lower! I won't let you suffer a bit today, and I will live for four hundred years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! No!..." Amoruo immediately regained his anger and cried in panic, but Hughes’s free and easy back was already out of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard wizard is obviously angry at the fact that he was deceived by a demon. His sullen face adjusts the magical array, and as the blood-sucking thorns become thicker and stronger. Amorro is so soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it is really impossible to call it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Elf Temple has been completely remodeled at the moment. There is a deep magic pool in the center of the hall. Through the pool surface, you can see underwater. A grotesque world filled with bright bands of light and large blocks of meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is only Hughes in the big hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood by the magic pool, and there was an invisible wind around him, picking up his long hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Hughes are now like the pool of the magic pool. There are countless colors and ribbons that change the illusion. His eyes, which seemed to penetrate everything, passed through the waters of the magic pool, through countless heavy light curtains, looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a vaguely concealed light ball appeared in the heavy light curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Hughes was dignified. He took a silver short stick in the middle of his arms and stretched it three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiusi's hands slowly stretched out and hugged, just like holding something. The light in his eyes suddenly illuminates, his hair grows, and then he screams, and his erect hands finally move, as if he finally pushed the invisible weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich Hall is also full of changing light and shadow at this moment. The colorful blocks were passed by the three kings. A pale fireball floats in the center of the main hall. A beautiful world is displayed in the fireball. In the beautiful mountains and green forests, you can clearly see a beautiful elf city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich Ella is standing by the fireball. Carefully adjust the operation of the magical array of the hall, always lock the elf city in the center of the fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor of the Bone and the Black Warrior are standing on one side. They can't get it right. Looking at the elf city in the fireball, they feel more or less unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the decisive battle of the day, the defeated Ninth Cavaliers did hand over the coordinates set on Rogge. But in this world, he still has another coordinate. Before the decisive battle, this coordinate has been kept by other kings and did not tell the wind. This is the idea of ​​the fire of wisdom. At that time, the fire of wisdom has vaguely felt that the future of the world of death is full of clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the hunch of the fire of wisdom finally came true, and the last three kings of the world of death have used this coordinate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the hearts of the three kings are very heavy. This is not only because they are separated from the world of death that has existed for thousands of years, but also because they actually violated the promise of the wind before the decisive battle. The three kings succeeded in escaping from the world of death, at least in part because they deceived the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the kings who have never violated their promises, this is really an unbearable burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich Elgar did not think so much, locking the coordinates in the storm of time and space has exhausted all of its energy. In fact, he only needs to correct the direction. Other things, ‘space drift’ will naturally be dealt with. But simply locking the coordinates is such a simple matter that it has exhausted all of Elgra's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Lich Algra has determined to fight for the last bit of power in the soul, as long as it lasts for a little while. Space drift will be completed. At that time, even if its soul fire was extinguished, there would be a bone emperor and a black warrior emperor to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the Lich Hall will appear near the Elf City. As for whether it will bring great harm to the city's elves, it is not what Elgra can control. From the information brought back by the Ninth Knight, the creatures of this world are not particularly strong, with the strength of the kings. It is not difficult to survive here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the vicinity of the Elf City is a stretch of mountains. This kind of terrain is suitable for the kings to hide whereabouts and gradually adapt to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich is fully locked in the coordinates of the hall, and the Emperor Bronze and the Black Warrior are silently preparing for the possible battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two kings are now very shabby. The bone emperor was only covered with a rusty lock. This lock does not even have any magical attributes. It can only add a little insignificant defense to the body of the bones, such as the sleek blue light and the iron-like body. The main weapon that the Bone Emperor relies on to injure the enemy is the three-piece, one-meter-long bone blade on the left and right sides of the arm. The three bone blades are sharp and hard, and under the pressure of the bones of the bones, the spine of a skull dragon can be easily cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Warrior is still the dark black full body armor, only a pair of dark red eyes can be seen in the gap of the helmet. It seems that he is not as embarrassed as the bones. But the giant sword in his hands exposed his embarrassment. This giant sword is just a bone sword made from the remains of unknown giant beasts. In the midst of the battle, it still does not know whether it can withstand the black warrior emperor's full swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf city in the Cage Fireball is getting closer and closer and more and more clear. In the same city as Xianshan in the world, Elgar can even see the buildings of one of the buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the change is sudden! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale fireball suddenly slammed, the image of the Elf City was distorted, and then a bang, broken into countless pieces of light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if there are no coordinates? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergra does not dare to think about the consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Space drift’ When the magic is exhausted, it is the moment when the kings’ fate is pronounced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich Hall violently vibrates, dust and gravel do not fly from the top of the temple, the walls and the ground, flying in the air. The protection outside the hall is losing its effect. A strip of light began to pass through the temple, and everything in the hall was reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden shock in the hall, and all the light disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the power of the three kings disappeared in an instant, then the body flew helplessly, hitting the wall heavily, for a time bone Scraps fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the power returned to the kings, and the Lich Hall returned to the tranquility of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings have climbed from the ground, and their physical damage is serious, but as long as there is strength. The body can be repaired at any time. This is an advantage of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dark black in the hall. Only the crystals on the floor of Elgra's wand radiated a bleak glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple, it is a dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sky, sun, green, and mountains outside the temple. There is no such thing as an elf city. The result is far too far from what the kings expected, and it is not the world depicted in the coordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, there is only darkness, silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this?" The Bone Emperor broke the silence. Detection is not its specialty, and within its scope, it is endless heavy rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have reached the world marked by the coordinates..." The Black Warrior slowly said, he is still trying to explore the world around him: "We are now The place should be underground or...a mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algeria, who has been silent, finally spoke up: "The honorable black warrior emperor, The situation is worse than you expected. We are deep underground. Below is the endless rock, my strength is not enough to detect its end. In the range I can see, there is no lava, no On the top of our head, it is a rocky mountain of more than a kilometer. In short, because of the sudden deviation of the landing point, we have been trapped deep underground. Perhaps the only good news is that There is a crack between the rock layers pointing to the ground. This can at least save us hundreds of meters of digging distance. The road to the ground is difficult, but we can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;骨皇道: "The death of this world is obvious Foot, my strength is very slow. Dear lich, how are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergra Road: "My situation is not good. Death The recovery of the magic is several times slower, and the difficulty of manipulating the magic is also improved. The vitality here is too lively, which makes me very uncomfortable." He waved his wand, and after the smoke, he was wearing a cyan heavy armor. The zombie warrior with the shield and axe appeared in front of the three kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aergra carefully observed the warrior and then said: "It seems that in this world we can still form a small army. Just now except Outside of the wand. All my magical equipment is consumed in the space drifting, it is difficult to summon a powerful undead creature. Hey, if that space penetrates the crystal still, we can send it directly to the ground, use I don’t want to dig like zombies and cockroaches here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones of the bones have already flashed, and have already arrived outside the hall, and his spiritual fluctuations have come from outside the temple. "The rocks here are too hard. Now the subordinates we can summon can't help. Come, let's dig!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the underground of the kilometer, in the endless rocks, the three kings began to excavate the road leading to the ground. Even the Lich Elgra, after blessing the auxiliary magic such as the power of the bull, and summoning a magical weapon, also struggling to cut and excavate between the thick rock layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, in the long years, the kings had hope for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the high sky of autumn, whether on the ground or underground, the living people are fighting for their own hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a steep cliff not far from the city of the gods. This should have been a calm afternoon, but the bottom of the cliff suddenly dropped countless gravel and mud. Immediately after a loud bang, large swaths of rock fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fog has cleared, there is already a deep cave at the bottom of the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, dozens of zombie warriors wearing heavy armor stepped out of the cave with gravel. They are completely different from the lower-class zombies that are common on the mainland. Not only do they seem to be much more sophisticated, but they are also agile and alert, at least with a certain degree of intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These zombies line up in a line, spread out and search around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further black mist emerged from the cave, and more than a dozen dark gray crickets jumped out. These crickets are completely unarmed. But the action is flexible and fast. It is no longer a Warcraft like Monkey Leopard. They will jump over a distance of more than ten meters. The vigilant gaze could not search the environment around the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another shadow flying in the cave. This is an undead creature with two wings and two meters long. It looks like some pterosaurs. Subspecies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s obviously not as good as searching for friends on the ground, the forest slamming, a magical long arrow wrapped around a faint white light like a fly Out, easily shot through its skull. The white ray turns into a sacred flame that is full of sacred breath, and will instantly burn this unlucky undead creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡The bowstring sounds continuously, dozens of magic arrows fly out of the forest, one by one, and the undead creatures from the cave are sent In the sacred flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest suddenly moved, and several towering trees facing the hole did not grow, and finally turned into several tall towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many elf archers on the tower, and the long arrows on their backs are sacred, obviously apparently prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard wizards began to sing a spell. In the melodious spell, a magical array appeared in front of the cave. In the center of the magic array, a small splash was raised, and then a clear spring spewed out of the magical array and flowed down the cave to the depths of the underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave is winding down, not far away, is a rather wide cave. In addition to the three kings in the cave, there are dozens of different undead creatures standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp sound of the water immediately caught the vigilance of the undead, and the kings were worried about the faint sacredness of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of silence, the clear water flows through numerous undead creatures and flows deep into the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black warrior seems to be able to stand up for a long time. The footsteps moved a little, and it was stained with a bit of clear water...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water droplets have been blown into a violent flame, wrapped in black warriors! Under the burning of the Holy Flame, the Black Warrior made a painful roar and made a mad rush. It struggled for a very short time, and the purely burning sacred flame burned out all the deaths on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful black warrior finally left a pair of black iron armor on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior’s roar stopped. More undead creatures have just begun to call out the death sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of clear stream has now become the source of the surging flame. In the eyes of the three kings, the high temperature of the holy flame is causing a drop of water to boil and transpire into a mass of water mist. The mist will burn in an instant, turning into a very fierce flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a loop, in the blink of an eye, the entire channel has been filled with flames! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames come quickly and go fast. After the flame is extinguished. The entire passage is filled with a faint sacred atmosphere that upsets the kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is waiting for us..." Elgara spoke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His preparation is very good..." The Bone Emperor is very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Obviously, he knows who we are, so we will welcome us with pure divine power." The Black Warrior Emperor said that the bone sword in his hand is now There was only one hilt by the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elgra’s mental fluctuations are much heavier than the bones: “My magic is exhausted. In this place, the magic is recovering too slowly. I have one Feeling, no evidence, this is just a feeling that the hall will deviate from the predetermined coordinates and appear deep underground. It is his masterpiece."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Emperor of the Black Warrior nodded: "I feel the same. Although I don't feel any strong power outside, I can conclude that he must wait outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Elgara sighed: "This world... is really dangerous! It seems that he not only knows that we are trying to get out of the ground from here, but also that we have consumed most of the power in the long excavation."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone King said: "He is a terrible enemy... It seems that although he knows that we have little power, we still don't plan to enter the channel to fight us."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground passage. It is the place where the bone emperor who is known for his attack power is the most capable of exerting combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind in the passage is suddenly big, and there is a strong sacred atmosphere in the wind. Although these sacred breaths can't hurt the king, it makes them extremely slow to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings could not hide their fear in their hearts. The enemies outside seem to know clearly that they are doing everything, just as there are a pair of invisible eyes through a heavy barrier, watching the kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard punching out is by no means a wise choice. The kings know that the enemies outside are very good at shooting, and the arrows used are magic arrows of divine attributes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, even with the strength of the kings, how dare you fly to the sky? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the mysterious enemy outside will be equipped with a large number of magic arrows with guiding functions. And the strong magical fluctuations just described indicate that a large number of magicians are gathering outside the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the three kings fly into the sky, they will surely become the best targets for countless magic arrows and sacred attack magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long silence has been. The Emperor of the Black Warrior finally spoke up: "I will go out first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all the attacks are concentrated on the Black Warrior Emperor. Then at least the speed of the bones of the bones have a chance to escape. And Elgra, who is exhausted by the magic, has little hope of fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Warrior Emperor just took a step and was taken by the Bone Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Emperor sighed heavily: "He won't give us this opportunity. We finally came to this world. Don't say sacrifice. I see We still choose another direction and re-excavate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aergra sighed and said: "When we come to the ground again, there will be Countless magic arrows and wizards are waiting for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Bone King said: "We will change another direction! As long as we are not desperate We should not give up or sacrifice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an old fairy tree outside the cave, Hughes breathed a sigh of relief and his face was tense The color faded and began to show a trace of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully dropped a huge piece of amber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of amber is more than a meter high and looks like a mountain. There is a small red dot in the middle and lower part of the amber. If you look carefully, you will find a tiny temple there. In appearance, it is exactly the same as Ella's Lich Hall. There was a thin red line that stretched out from the Lich Hall, hovering up and going straight to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
