For five years, the old Rivers head has been completely white, and behind the single piece of gold crystal glasses, the eyes began to turbid. Although he had to carry a cane, the old Rivers was still straight, and the dress still managed without a trace of wrinkles. Old Rivers stood next to a tall, thin old man with a new dress. His face was similar to that of Old Rivers. Although he had not seen it for many years, Rogge still recognized this person as Uncle Brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was excited about the first two steps, but was chilled in the cold by the cold expression of Old Rivers. Brown eagerly came up and took Rogge into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the small living room of Rivers’ home, Rogge unloaded his body, and chatted with the old Brown while drinking coffee. Old Rivers had to sleep before going to dinner every night, and went back to sleep at the moment. Rogge was upset, and the coldness of Old Rivers made him feel at a loss. Mothers always hide from themselves intentionally or unintentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sudden hoof stopped at the gate and shouted: "Who hurts my brother and Laozi! Give you Blanc." Grandpa rolled out!" Rog smiled, but his hand shook, sprinkled some coffee, and then caught a hint of happiness in Brown's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small living room door was kicked open by the rough, a tall white, knight costumes came in, followed by a big man nearly two meters tall. It seems that the man in this knight costume is Blanc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two 'Dragon and Beauty' knights standing behind Rogge are blind to the two, but if Blanc really rushes up, I am afraid Immediately there will be an arrow on the throat. Rogge immediately evaluated Blanc, estimated to be a five-level knight, although his ‘Dragon and Beauty’ knights are mostly less than five, but the results in the battle can be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown said: "Blanc! Why are you so rude! This is your Rogge cousin, both of whom are self-families!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 'self-family' word, blocked in Rogge's chest, can not be dispersed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is still some time left for dinner, Rogge finds an excuse to end the unpleasant talks and ride to the old town mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was near dusk, Roger, who was in casual clothes, sat by the fire, holding a rust axe and licking the wood, while Lilith and the old mayor Feel free to talk. Since Brown came to the territory of the Rivers family, the original servants died and died. The maid who made Rogge a man was hanged in the woods outside the town on a moonlit night after Brown and his son came for a month. Rogge and the old mayor chatted about some interesting things when they were young, and sometimes laughed for a while. Almost unknown, ticking, a small splash of water splashing on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertently noticed this water lily Lilith, the chest was suddenly plugged in by a group of invisible things, after a moment, suddenly burst into tears. I remembered that Rogge was still in the territories in the past, and the days of harming people were like heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned his head and his face was still melting and laughing. When I came back, everything would be fine. "Speaking and pulling out a white silk handkerchief, gently wipe the tears on Lilith's face, but the river that opened the gate, a small handkerchief, how can it be blocked?<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robersky sneaked in, handed in two pieces of paper, and flashed his head out, saying nothing was seen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Two pieces of paper record all the information Rogge wants, the population of the town, the estimated size of the wealth, the size of the tax base, the possible range of taxes, etc. After that, Rogge threw two pieces of paper into the stove.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Rivers dinner, Brown and his son suddenly became very polite to Rogge, presumably to see the unlucky 'Knight' of the fracture. George saw Rogge timid Shrinking, only Blanc is still a bit arrogant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the rich dishes at the table, although he also contributed his own, Rogge still felt uncomfortable. So he mentioned In this taxation, Old Rivers suddenly became angry and said that these people were deceived and deceived themselves for twenty years. Produced, I have lost the face of the baron for many years. Rogge tried to explain that the townspeople had no overnight food, so they would starve to death, but the old Rivers just did not believe that Rogge was young and Know what?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Rogge is no longer polite, within a hundred miles, except for the big towns, which are the Allied military camps. What kind of bandits will not pick up the brain here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branke’s support for a moment, also said that foreign thieves must be guarded against this looting. Rogge was almost fainted, and there are more than three hundred miles from the nearest border. What foreign bandits can rush here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge’s rejection of Blanc’s body, Brown inserted it and said, “I’m also a Rivers family, is it not? I can't think of my own brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rivers took a heavy shot of the table and angered: "What are the bandits? These townspeople who don't know how to lift are the bandits! It’s not that these guards are there, the house may have been demolished!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s voice also improved: “Without these idiots, what do the townspeople do? Demolition of our house! When we have a guard in our house, has this house been demolished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Rivers is angry and blue, Roaring said: "This home is what I said! This territory, the people are my Rivers, my words are the law! If you want to be here, let me die before you say!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown hurriedly stopped the old Rivers father and son, why bother to do this? Rogge, not your uncle said you, it’s easy to go home once, don’t be angry with your father. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Brown's words, Old Rivers was even more angry and pointed to Rogge: "I know you want to mad at me!" Hello to receive these industries! Get out of here! Get out! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge never thought that things would be like this, only to feel the coolness of his head slowly to the bottom of his feet. He turned his head to look at his mother, now she is intentionally or unintentionally Looked away, a look of indifference.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge held the table, slowly stood up, looked at the dining room, and turned slowly Going out slowly. These steps are incredibly long, until he walks out the door, and Old Rivers and his mother don’t call themselves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dining room door Closed, a Guardian 'Knight' who stood in the hall snorted and laughed. The laughter did not fall, suddenly his eyes turned white, and two thin blood lines were marked in his nose, and he fell to the ground.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, time seems to stop in the dining room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Rogge stays in the old town Long family, sleepless night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dragon and Beauty' knights were also called back, let them change to find a home, and Rogge only allowed them to approach River House five hundred meters, everything else, "you figure! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, there were several fights in the town, and several 'Dragon and Beauty' knights were wounded, but there were twenty 'guards' I have to stay in bed for a month.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, Blanc’s snoring spread almost throughout the town. He was draped all over, with a few men rushing to the town. Come, Robsky took a smashing arrow and shot it on the horse's head. On the spot, he shot his white horse. Blanc was so embarrassed that it was cold and sweaty, and Robsky's arrow seemed to understand. Naturally, you can also shoot your head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the guards have seen the 'Dragon and Beauty' knights flashing, the knights are not too much, right The back is a few strokes of the middle finger, which is no problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day for a while, Rogge wants Robsky to discuss something. Although not avoiding Lily Silk, but the girl is very embarrassed, this time to go to the grandfather to chat. The rest of the time, in addition to chatting with the grandson and grandson, Rogge is in the town to go door to door, sit, chat will In the evening, Rogge and the clothes spent the night in the living room on the first floor of the old town mayor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the town had a rare time. A few days of quiet days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Lilith turned to sleep, the girl gently twitched, got up and went downstairs and saw the living room The chair was empty and empty. The girl Mo Ming took up her heart and hurriedly put on her coat. When she went out, she shuddered, but she decided to step out of the door.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith does not know where to go to find Rogge, why go to find Rogge, she just feels that there is a voice faintly pointing in her direction. Walking through the town in the winter night, there are countless monsters in the shadows around me, and there seems to be something behind me, staring at my back.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt that there was a warm and safe place in front of it. She ran faster and faster, and accidentally fell down on her skirt and fell to the ground. Lilith climbed up and the sleeves at her elbows had been rubbed. She refused to continue to run forward on the bleeding elbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning around a corner, the girl’s tears suddenly flowed down. Not far away is a favorite old tree of Rogge's childhood, when a familiar figure under the tree is smashing. The fat figure is not tall, nor handsome, but it is the only safety in the world at this moment, the only warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith flew up, like a moth, this moment, Rogge is her only end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned around and looked at the girl who was flying over with some surprise. Behind him, a small group of black fog was being blown away by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moth in the cold night finally casts a warm flame, that is, after that moment, the little moth has experienced happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quietly holding the girl in her arms, watching her work hard to get a comfortable position, then burst into tears, nose and tears Rogge squatted on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge 'hehe' smiled, gently stroking Lilith's head, the girl looked up, and the crystal clear little face still hung a few teardrops . Under the cold moonlight, the girl's skin that is as creamy as it seems to be covered in a layer of glory. Suddenly, a burst of tenderness poured into Rogge's heart, he could not help but sigh, bowed his head and kissed the girl's lips. Lilith's body was immediately stiff, and then it went like water, sinking into the stun of forgetting everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s kiss is oyster and sweet, she does not know how to deal with it, but she is instinctively desperate to let her indulge in the source. This clear and crazy kiss also ignited Rogge, letting him squeeze the girl more hard. Lilith gasped and writhed, and the two huge squeezing squeezing on the chest rubbed Rogge's chest muscles, and the heavy clothing seemed to be getting thinner. The blazing flame burned wildly under the old trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently opened the skirt behind the girl, struggling to take out a hand, under her clothes, across the obstacles, along the soft The skin all the way up, finally climbed to the top, barely holding a group of warmth on the girl's chest. When Rogge's palm crossed, the girl suddenly screamed, her eyes turned from frenzied to clear, and immediately the face ignited two rosy flames. Lilith grabbed the clothes behind Rogge with her hands, and her head was deeply buried in his shoulders. The body clung to Rogge and pressed Rogge's hand with his chest to prevent him from moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile smiles on Rogge’s face, his fingers are slightly tight, and he bows again. An inaudible exclamation came out, and in addition to holding it tighter, the girl did not have more resistance. Rogge sneered at the evil, using his other hand to force the girl's chin, let her look at herself, and the hand that held the girl's vitality suddenly moved vigorously. Liz wriggled and tried to get her head into Rogge's arms, but where can I? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger realized the girl’s helpless struggle in her palm, watching the rosy rose on her face, watching her eyes turn from clear to blurred With a slight smile, stopped the action and held Lilith gently in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quietly embraced each other for a long time, Rogge hit the cross with Lilith, disappeared into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Robsky and a few 'Dragon and Beauty' knights suddenly disappeared, but the guards 'Knights' were mostly lying on the bed. I dare not take the opportunity to retaliate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Lilith are much intimate. When no one is there, the two will suddenly hold a crazy kiss for a while. At night, Rogge will suddenly appear in Lilith's bedroom, and then the gray wolf will quietly come to the end of the bed and drill in with lightning. When the little white sheep has not responded, it has been firmly pressed in the claws. under. So the gray wolf drooled and began to enjoy his own spoils, Aries is still struggling, but only to make the wolf's interest higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days later, Robsky returned and brought back an old man, the original old housekeeper of the Rivers family. Rogge talked with the old man alone for a whole afternoon, only to get out of the room palely, and told the two knights to settle the old man for one night and then send it back. Robsky again presented two pieces of paper, which was originally a brief background of the Brown family. Rogge took it and went alone to the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep, Mrs. Rivers looks at the squeaking sound of the old Rivers, and quietly gets up and cloaked. She sat in front of the dressing table and looked at herself in the mirror. In the past few days, in order to avoid Rogge, Rivers’s chickens and dogs were restless, and they also hung two heavy bags under their eyes. Mrs. Rivers stretched her eyes hard to stretch the wrinkles around her eyes. A cold wind blew through and let her fight a chill. Mrs. Rivers reluctantly draped her clothes and went to see which window had been forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mother, this is not a matter of people." Rogge sat silently behind Mrs. Rivers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Rivers breathed a sigh of relief and glanced at the bed in panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, he will always fall asleep and won't be awakened by us. Your son is a magician, isn't it?" Rogge smiles Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter with you so late? Rogge, our family is already chaotic, you still go back earlier. Your father's temper and body Not very good, he doesn't want to see you!" Mrs. Rivers' voice is unstoppable and louder and louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mother, don't be so excited. I am here to ask you, who is my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Rivers stepped back two steps and fell on the dressing stool. How did you know that? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old housekeeper who was driven away by you has been found by me. He told me something, although not many, but it was enough to let me know that Baron Rivers was not my father. I think this should explain what happened after I came back. But these are not enough, I want to know the facts, all the facts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Rivers gasped a few breaths before he slowly said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two years ago, Old Rivers grew older and sick, went to the largest church hospital in the region to check his body. I never thought that it was taken along the way. Out of the symptoms of lifelong infertility. Old Rivers was shocked, with the certificate letter issued by the church medical officer, and returned to the teacher to ask for sin. Mrs. Rivers had no choice but to tell the old Rivers in the kingdom. When I was a small resident, there were several aristocratic lovers. Rogge was the result of her romantic affairs. The lover in the aristocrats was a commonplace thing, and the lovers of Mrs. Rivers were born from the famous family, not the old Rivers. Offended, it’s an old account, and Old Rivers can only stop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, somehow, Rivers’ brother Brown learned this. Immediately, I came with two sons. Old Rivers has since listened to this younger brother and is ready to take the title. And the land is handed over by Blanc and George. After all, this is the blood of the Rivers family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then my father, who is it?" Rogge asked in a low voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Rivers was stunned, and after a while he whispered the past. It turned out that there was Rogge. In the days, Mrs. Rivers’s life was quite gorgeous and crazy, and she also attended a secret gathering, so she was not known to whom Rogge’s father was.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So..." Rogge was silent for a while before saying, "You are my mother, why should you do this to me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Mrs. Rivers answered anxiously and quickly: "I am already a person who is almost fifty, if it is your father... If the Baron Foss abandoned, how do you want me to live? In the past few years, you have brought me trouble, but still trouble! I have been worried that he will know the truth someday, but I did not expect that the medical officer who should go to hell actually found this. But even then, if you don't come back, everything will go quietly! Both Blanc and George have the skills and the future is not bad. But when you come back, you will make everyone feel uncomfortable, and Rivers will blame everything on my head! God! What happened to me? Why is the devil always behind me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "I can't believe you, you are my biological mother." Here is some money, you have collected it, and you will be prepared in the future. You can rest assured that since everything is clear, I will soon disappear from the Rivers family. Goodbye, Baroness Rivers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gracefully bowed to Mrs. Rivers, laid down a fine leather purse and jumped out of the window. Baroness Rivers She rushed to the window and opened her mouth, but there was no sound. For a long time, she turned around and picked up the heavy purse and carefully collected it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith flipped over the bed lazily, and some of the upset clasped the pillow. What happened today, it was already midnight, but the wolf never appeared. The girl sat up with her pillow. Suddenly I saw that this wolf did not know when he was sitting on the bed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the girl’s heart, Rogge is mysterious, intimate and incomparably powerful, even tyrannical The Brown master and his two sons did not dare to provoke him; every night he came, he was silent and suddenly appeared. It is not surprising that he is not a magician, and the magician is not Is it omnipotent?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when the moth is in the flame, how can it last forever? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not the son of Old Rivers, my biological mother is not prepared to take his son." Rogge's voice was floating in the night. Lilith gently rubbed her face with Rogge's back neck. She didn't care who Rogge was. If he was not an aristocrat, perhaps the difference in identity between the two would be smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Baroness Rivers knows that I have been named a knight, do you say she will do this to me?" Rogge gently Yang, leaning on Lilith's body, said slyly. Lilith didn't know how Mrs. Rivers treated Rogge, but when he heard that Rogge had been sealed as a knight, he couldn't help but be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time, everything has changed, it has changed. Should I not come back? In the eyes of the mother, is it true that the nobility title is really better than Is blood more important than her son? What am I, is it just a code name, an identity?" Lilith was a little panicked, not knowing how to comfort him, only to hold tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge brother, I don't care if you are a noble knight or an ordinary person, Lilith will always have only one Rogge brother. In the future, no matter if you are Annoying, tired, or stuffy, Lilith will be willing to accompany you." The girl said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly turned over, grabbed the girl’s shoulders tightly, his face twisted and whispered: “I am not a good person, no longer There are parents and no family. If you are with me, there will be no results. Have you ever thought about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily The tears of the brush flowed down, but they wiped it away. Then the girl was a gentle smile on her face, gently lie in the arms of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the girl’s chest was cold, and the front of the white nightdress had been torn by Rogge. Lilith exclaimed, instinctively protected her proud hands. Rogge grabbed the broken hole in the nightdress and tore it. The nightdress was torn into two pieces by his whole body, and then he threw it on the ground. The girl fainted her cheeks, her whole body, helplessly covering her chest and curling in the corner of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't he want to come true?" The girl bit her lower lip, did not dare to look up, her heart was seven minutes panic, and three points shy. She was panicking, and Rogge had already plunged her down, and the relatives of her skin could not help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden and sudden pain drowned her. Lilith leaned her head and bit the pillow, her fingers twitching the sheets, and I couldn't stand it from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small building listened to the spring rain overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several zombies at the foot of the mountain are wandering, searching for food in vain, trying to fill in the hunger that can never be satisfied. Suddenly, as they heard the invisible commands, they looked neatly in the direction of the plain. One zombie in the ground was also drilled out of the hiding place, and the empty eyes were all staring in the same direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plain side, there is only boundless fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a real fog that is lined up by both invisible forces, and slanting the sickle out of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rows of zombie groups are surrounded by them, but as low-level undead creatures, they are full of fear of their own high-level *** instinct And retreat like a tide. Only a few zombie lords led more than twenty zombie warriors in front, but as the *** stepped closer, several zombie warriors couldn't help but start to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zombie lords slowly greeted them, one of which was not as dark as the other zombie lords, but a light brown, one-of-a-kind It seems to be filled with a majestic atmosphere. It greets the ***, and the mouth is one by one. *** Set up, two powerful undead creatures communicated silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is immersed in the tenderness of Lilith, and he violently squats under his body, as if to vent the many days of depression. In his body, a raging tide is hitting the dam, and occasionally a wave of waves can even flow over the long levee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly silently shouted, the wings behind them all slammed open, and the overflowing power forced the zombie soldiers to retreat. A few weak ones even started to run away. The zombie lord looked a bit strange, but he couldn't think of it. The knives of the *** had already broken into the air and slanted to the head and neck. Most of the zombie lords were slow to move, but this was not the same. It quickly covered the neck with his arms. The slap of the slap, the slashing knife left only one inch on its incomparably strong arms. Deep traces. At the moment when the arms crossed, a group of purple electric fires exploded. However, after the electric fire exploded, the zombie lords were completely innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the powerful zombie lord is still a zombie, and it is impossible to compete with ***. The bones of the *** are collected at times, sometimes galloping on the ground, sometimes flying in the air, and the figure draws a secret arc. ***The zombie lord circling around, and sometimes even suddenly flew off the ground, leaping over its head, and then being pulled by an invisible giant palm, squatting behind it. The trajectory of the arm of a zombie lord who can't avoid it can only be felt uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zombie lord is completely beaten, although it has only been exposed to a mark of two inches deep, but all the zombie lords around the body They were all cut down by ***. As for the zombie warriors, they have already escaped from the glory, and the general zombies have drilled back their own hiding places, and they will only bury themselves in the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***In front of the zombie lord for the body, standing still, standing still. All the zombies around have been cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge finally climbed to the peak of happiness, he screamed like a beast, holding the crazy snow in his arms, working hard The ground entered the deepest part of Lilith, and then with a burst of shaking, his tight body and nerves slowly relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly madly slammed into the zombie lord, it raised his arm, this knife exhausted the full force of the ***, cut off The zombie lord had a long piece of muscle on his arm, but the *** was also uncertain and took a few steps forward. The zombie lord seized the opportunity and immediately took a face to face the ***. *** But it seems that I can't see this palm. I don't want to avoid it. I try to get back to the knife. The blade of the sickle is hooked into the back of the zombie lord and inserted into the half-foot. However, this damage is not a problem for the zombie lord. It is shot on the sternum of the ***, in the sound of Kaka, the bones are flying, and the three ribs cannot withstand such strong and broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly only hold the file handle with the left hand, the right hand is caught, the hand bone can not be said to be the hand bone, but has covered A layer of black, shiny metallic material, like the devil's right hand. She screamed, her right hand was like a sapwood, and she was deeply immersed in the chest of the zombie lord. The zombie lord wants to dodge, but he can't move on the tip of the sickle. He can only watch the right hand of *** sneak into his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Take the heart of the zombie lord, and gently touch it, then tighten your hand and smash it and crush it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm has finally passed, and although Lilith is young and energetic, she is exhausted and sleepy at the moment. Rogge lay quietly in bed, enjoying the ease after indulgence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the field that had just been fought, the corpses in one place stood alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, *** turned and left, the fog seemed to be afraid of her momentum, and automatically spread into the fog, fog Only then, she closed behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger sat up from the bed and slowly put on his clothes. Lilith turned over and looked inside, as if she was asleep. Rogge gently stroked her head and wrapped it around her fingers. For a long time, it seemed as if she had made up her mind and the cloak stood on the floor. Lilith's back swayed slightly, and Rogge looked at the graceful curve on her back, sighing a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is infatuated with him, but in the heart of Rogge, she is just a station on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lily, I will leave here tomorrow morning and I will not stay here again. The territory of the Rivers family will soon be in turmoil. You Take Grandpa... Take Grandpa to Lille City, I will leave some money for you, and be careful on the road.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith did not look back, gently Said: "I am so tired, I want to sleep for a while. If you want to go, please be lighter, don't wake me up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated For a moment, Lilith couldn't help but cry out: "Let's go, let's go! Why wait for me to cry out! Go!" Rogge sighed and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day was just bright, Rogge took the rider and set foot on his way home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed to a small hill by the road, silently watching the town in the morning fog and Rivers home. The winter morning is the coldest time of the day, and the mist of the wind is blowing in the face, and it is unrelentingly drilled into the neckline of the knights. Some dragons and beautiful knights have been cursing this abominable damp weather in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
