At this moment, the two quiet villages are burning with raging fire, and the panicked people are running around. It seems that there are many people in the village who are martial arts. However, under the influence of Longwei, these people have no courage to resist. The only thing they can do is to go around like a fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon suddenly fell straight and almost stopped when it hit the ground, suspended in a space of one meter high. Its mouth has already condensed a group of dragon flames, and the instant dragon flame that has stopped its body shape is also ejected at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a farmhouse a few meters in front of the faucet. Obviously, the farmhouse could not resist the dragon flame of infinite power, and immediately collapsed in the flames and turned into a pile of ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum of its sudden stop is too fierce, a small milky white creature can no longer catch the dragon's horn, falling from its head, falling heavily On its back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's body retreats tens of meters in lightning and then soars. At the same time, several villages on both sides of the retreat route ignited a raging fire and were burned out in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dragon flame, the farmer in the cottage will not even have a chance to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scales of the dragon have a vague silver glow, but there are too many wounds on his body, and some of the wounds are slightly infiltrated with dragon blood. These mottled wounds concealed his original body color, and it seems that he is more like a brand-name dragon with less pure blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fall. But Nicholas still has some of the charm of the silver miracle of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of these attacks?" Nicholas asked modestly. However, this question has not been answered. As soon as he turned back, he discovered that the dragon god's messenger was hanging on his own dragon tail, and the four small claws worked hard together, so that he was not thrown out by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas immediately lowered the speed so that the dragon god's messenger could fly back to his head and place himself in the cluster of dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still some things in the next two!" The dragon god messenger applauded the earth: "Like the first few dragon flames at the beginning of you. Although it is enough to deal with these fragile humans, how do you know that there are not a few insidious guys in it? You must know how to deal with unknown enemies. Whether they look strong or weak, can you get the respect of your silver miracle, Go all out! Know the insidious guys, like the fat guys, the favorite is to dress up as a man with no skills, and then come to a nap when you despise him. Think about it, if they are When you play with the enemy to weaken this trick. You suddenly have a powerful dragon flame sprayed, what an evil joy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of people running below, are you going to kill?" asked Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory probes look down and see groups of people leaving the burning village and fleeing into the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shook his head and said: "There is no need to waste time here. The test of these two villages is to let you know how to deal with these seemingly fundamental It is not the threat to your weak creatures. Power is not the only condition that determines the outcome of a battle. Compared with power, wisdom and insidiousness are more important. As long as you let go of arrogance, your wisdom will not be worse than anyone. Your strength, how many other existences in this space can win you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas listens humbly to the teachings of the Dragon God messenger, and publishes himself from time to time. the opinion of. The two dragons on the other side exchanged with the spirit of the spirit, while gradually moving away, behind them. Only the valley that was carrying the smoke was left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the dragon is powerful, and most of them are born with Longwei, which belongs to the category of spiritual attack, but the power of too strong often makes them ignore their own skills. Therefore, only a few powerful dragons can use spiritual fluctuations to communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon God messenger itself has fully explained what is a deep understanding of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two dragons communicated their views on power, or exactly, when Nicholas accepted the dragon god's messenger to guide the fighting wisdom. The messenger often pauses for a long time. Then he will say something that Nicholas is impressed with. After several times, Nicholas found an anomaly. But this immediately increased his admiration for the dragon god messenger. Because it is very obvious. The messenger of the Dragon God communicates with the Dragon God. Throughout the entire dragon, there may be a dragon that overpowers the silver miracle in strength, but it is almost impossible to guide his dragon in combat skills and combat intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the object of this sacred ‘giant’ dragon communication is only the dragon god itself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger who can communicate with the Dragon God at any time, even in the era when the ancient gods displayed miracles, there are very few! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Nicholas lowered his proud faucet and allowed the dragon god's messenger to stay safely in the dragon horns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two dragons flew to the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proud Nicholas did not work hard to understand the situation of human society, and naturally did not know that this valley is the territory of the Babylonian Empire. The Babylonian Empire is not a large territory, and there are not many people and troops, but it has an elite or horrible Golem force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, these two villages are still the hometown of Lentini, one of the three great Juggernauts in the mainland, the hometown of the sword Saint Stentini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluestone Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Frost Giant is a descendant of the ancient Titans. They are able to throw ice spears and stones, and can use some simple magic. For the heyday you It’s a very easy job to eliminate them, but you’re not hurt now. The bluestone hills are a large tribe of frost giants. In my opinion, there are at least a hundred giants. But don’t worry, your The test is not to destroy the entire tribe, it is impossible. The leader of this tribe has a young son, your task is to kill his son without killing the giant tribal leader!" Gregory Announced a second test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the injury is gradually worsening. The mind is also becoming drowsy, but Nicholas still suffers from the whole body. Carefully observe the terrain and think about the strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather in the Qingshi Mountain where the frost giants live is extremely cold. It seems that apart from the geographical location, it is sure to have some relationship with these giants. Giants often use frost as a weapon, and their houses and the Emirates Hall are built with imposing ice, tall and majestic. But from the perspective of the human society, these buildings are very primitive and simple. Most giants have only one room at home. It is the most majestic and complex Emirates Hall, but it is only three inside and outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas thought for a long time and finally swooped down. This dragon god messenger floated in midair and did not personally follow Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon that suddenly appeared on the edge of the Bluestone Mountain immediately caught the attention of the Frost Giant. With the buzz of the police, one after another, adult giants got out of their homes. Some of them have huge copper axe in their hands, while others condense into huge ice spears of more than five meters between their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a descendant of Titan, one of the most powerful races in the ancient times, Frost Giants are not afraid of dragons, and Longwei does not work for them. In the hearts of these violent and militant giants. The only advantage of the dragon is that it can fly. Being able to fly means escaping quickly. This is the logic of the giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants on the mountain waved their weapons in their hands and threatened the dragons in the sky. And Nicholas carefully observed the distribution of the giants, secretly sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not an ordinary dragon, he is the silver miracle Nicholas! Even if he is injured, he will not lose to these widowed giants! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon in the sky has a double wing. Suddenly, he swooped down and fell down on a frosted giant at the foot of the mountain. The short and intense battle is over in the blink of an eye. The dragon has an overwhelming advantage in strength, agility and magic. With a long and screaming scream, this unfortunately frosted giant chest has been caught by the dragon's claws! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the giants' pursuit team was getting longer and longer, Nicholas suddenly fell back and threw down the first frost giant. At the opening of the dragon's mouth, a silver flame burst on the giant's face! This time. The screams of the giants are continually screaming. Reverberate throughout the Bluestone Mountains! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roaring roar in the top of the Bluestone! A frosty giant who is taller than the average giant has come out of the Emirates, and his body is covered with cyan heavy armor. In the hand, a hammer with a mysterious rune is engraved. It seems that this is the chief of the entire Froststone tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chieftain of the giant stared at Nicholas at the foot of the mountain, his eyes had become blood red. He lifted the giant hammer high and then squatted to the empty space in front of him! The rune on the giant hammer lit up, and a large lightning flashed to Nicholas at the foot of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas issued a low-pitched dragonfly, and the magical protection formed by the dragon language magic immediately protected its heavy dragon body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frost Giant is simply not suitable for casting magic. Therefore, the chieftain's lightning hit the magic shield, just like throwing stones into the sea, disappearing silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the giant screamed angrily and strode down from the Bluestone Mountains. It has to personally take down the life of this dragon and decorate his hall with the dragon's skull! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas fled and fled until the moment when the giant chief rushed to the foot of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a melodious dragon, Nicholas took off! He crossed the sky like a meteor, and in the twinkling of an eye it appeared in front of the gate of the Bluestone Summit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frost giants are very tall, and the gates of the Emirates Palace are enough for the silver dragon to easily enter and exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chieftain flashed a glare in the temple, then swayed and collapsed in the roar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two remaining Frostman giant warriors in the ruins. They are not dead yet, but they are seriously injured. Completely lost combat power. The two giant warriors could only watch the evil silver dragon clutching a young frosty giant and flying into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge scream of the Giant Chief’s collapse almost the entire Bluestone Mountain, the silver dragons hovering in the clouds are four claws loose, and the young giants are called from Falling high in the sky, and finally fell on a huge rock...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief curse of the chieftain is still in the sky above the bluestone mountain, but the sky The silver dragon has already flown far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time done a good job!" The dragon god's messenger does not always teach Nicholas, when the silver dragon does a good job. It will not hesitate to praise it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas immediately expressed humility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon god's messenger continues: "It seems that you have understood that you should concentrate on attacking the intended target. As long as you can kill the target creature, nothing else is needed." Take care of it. Well, this time you use the dragon magic very creatively, but I feel that there are still some flaws hidden in its magic system. It seems that your silver dragon family is too dependent on breath, teeth and claws. So the Lianlong language magic is ruined. What? Of course, I will give you guidance. But in order to understand what is wrong with your dragon language magic, you better put all the dragon language magic in the place. Tell me about it. Anyway, there is still a long time to go to the gap in the abyss, let's get started!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later. Nicholas and Gregory finally rushed to the abyss gap in the northern part of the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge horrible crack that stretches for several kilometers and is hundreds of meters wide. In the cracks, a cloud of dark green mist will be sprayed from time to time, accompanied by fog and the roar of unknown creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strange altar in the north of the crack. The center of the altar is a pattern of flames. There were several long guns in front of the altar, and each dark pist was wearing a dark elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a large number of naga warriors wandering around the altar. They are different from the ordinary sea-born naga, which is much larger than the body, and the scales are all strangely blue-red. Almost all of these naga warriors have well-prepared sharp weapons. In terms of the degree of wisdom development. They are far more than the Frost Giants who still maintain a lot of primitive habits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
