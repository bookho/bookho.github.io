			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the 400 top-ranking knights is not much, not too little. The more than two hundred thieves in training are certainly not expected. Daoer martial arts is good, but he is honest and kind, so let him not want to catch slaves. Qi Wei has now merged with Doyle. She and Rogge are as deep as the sea, so they can't take it into consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nobles and the wicked ones have firmly remembered the words that Orpheq said "it is okay to steal and rob," and prepare to play from him. Some ideas. Unexpectedly, in this case, Orphey was so happy that he promised to give fifty gold lion knights to Rogge, and he would meet with the ‘Dragon and Beauty’ knights before going out. But Orphey Rok’s words are also very clear: "I am the fifty knights, the combat power is at least equal to four hundred regular Knights. But I don't want to lose any of them, so if they judge the desperate situation, but If you withdraw yourself, you have to think clearly. I don’t think there is any problem with your cooperation with Steinic. Let’s go and do a little bit. What do you do, I don’t even know.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge understands that this is to warn him not to take advantage of the fighting power of the Golden Lion Knight. But even if the hand has absolute superiority, the positive attack is not in line with his character and philosophy. Yes, philosophy! After reading a few books like "The World of the Necromancer", Rogge also had some interest in philosophy. Of course, the fascination of the pure philosophy of the undead magic, money power and beauty is still not small. The "big logic" of a dozen pages has played the role of 'powerful hypnotism', letting him sleep for a night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Grand Duchy, Rogge is increasingly feeling that this winter in Lille is extremely repressed, and there is a thick lead gray between heaven and earth. Just like being in the opposite world of ***. Recently, I have felt more than once that I have had an independent consciousness, and I have had several times. I have also clearly experienced her emotions. This is inconsistent with the descriptions contained in all collections or the description of the pets of the Master. But to control him, he still likes to be like this, even if he doesn't listen to himself, it is better than a machine that only knows how to execute the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew, Rogge tightened his collar, could not help but think: "When in the outside world, will it feel cold?" Then he thought of the complicated procedures required to get the funds from the Ministry of Public Affairs. He couldn't help but sigh, got into the carriage, and greeted the driver to go to the military department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete these days is a spring breeze, and the attack on Isabella is also very progress. In his mind, the so-called progress is to occupy the feng shui treasure land of the girl. Thinking about it, Ete thinks that Isabella may be a good wife. Although the girl is not a stunning, but beautiful. Grandfather Fog is a master of the art world and a big money tree for the ‘God of the God of War.’ This background is also the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete also has some self-knowledge, knowing that this magical double repair to deal with some of the mantle is a prestige, it can be sensational. But what really is the master of the master, that is, those few friends, they are no longer opponents. So if you can deceive Isabella, you should be satisfied. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whenever he thinks of Rogge, Kate carrying a few hundred pounds of tomahawks, long guns, if nothing happens, Et is cold, and some Oh. I thought that at the beginning, my own kung fu magic was the boss among the people. It was Kate, and they all had the ability to win and win. With more than three years of hard work, how come you are getting worse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Etter is completely unable to put down the singer of the day and night, and sleeps at night. The prosperity of ‘God of the God of War’ gave him the extravagant life of his dreams, but he did not make much contribution to the ‘God of the God of War’. A few bad friends are very interesting. Never mind this. Every time they pay dividends, they will never lose one of them. He also has no one less than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is what makes him feel awkward. Nowadays, when people discuss matters and assign jobs, they will send him the easiest and least dangerous work. He also knows that other tasks are actually incompetent, and the friends are good for him, but he is also a man! He also has ambition and will be victorious! Why are the people who started together as a whole, so far the gap is so big? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Etter is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is when he is holding a beauty to sleep, other people are either tempted or meditative, and it is so day-to-day. For Kate and Rogge, hunting for beauty is only occasional, and the rest of the time is always busy. And myself, grinding on the meat grinding discs of countless women, the magic of fighting spirit has not regressed, it is already a miracle. Think about it, how many days have you ever had a vindictive or meditation? He smiled and shook his head. The time was already growing and he couldn’t remember it. How many times have you made the determination and how many vows you have made, from tomorrow to become a paranoid like Kate Rogge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, Etter has been unwilling or afraid to see these friends. Watching their strengths improve day by day, the world is full of life and stability, and he has a taste that can't be said. This is an upset that doesn't disappoint, and regrets the emotions that are not as strong as they are and a mixture of shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the saying about the slang on the prairie? "The eagle does not fly in the sky for three days, it will become obese; the horse will not run on the grassland for three days, and will run away from stupid cattle and sheep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Et, what's wrong with you? Why did you suddenly sigh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely Isabella in the arms raised her face and looked worriedly Et. Ett came back and said with a smile: "Nothing, I am just worried about you, I am afraid that I can't give you a happy life!" The martial arts double-educated Etter is tall and handsome, and his face often has a sunny smile. It seems that I never know what is sorrow. This is the most fascinating place for Isabella. In addition, Ett's mouth is always covered with honey, whether it is love or kiss is so sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete bowed his head and gently picked up Isabella's chin and kissed him deeply. He skillfully teased the girl's tongue and made her gradually lost in the kiss. Ett smiled smugly. According to this progress, it will not take long for Isabella to be in his own bag. At that time, I was sure to be much more stable in the position of ‘God of the God of War’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took one hand and bowed on the girl’s full chest, ready to reach into the girl’s chest collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage in the Mercedes suddenly stopped, and Etter and Isabella were caught off guard, rolled down from their seats and slammed into the front wall of the carriage. on. A scream of a driver came from outside the train, and it stopped abruptly, apparently being cut open. Etter knew differently and hurriedly climbed up, grabbing a giant sword that would never leave. Fortunately, he always shows his genius in the magic and double repairs. This sword is absolutely inseparable. In this critical time, it has come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is urgent, there is no time to recite the spell of the hammer of the size of the hammer. The boss used the first magic has never had a tradition of cursing, and the powerful opponent is crushed by gold coins. It is the creed of all people, so the evils of the rich and the rich are generally prelude to the battle with the reel. Et is no exception. He started a small white scroll, hurriedly mourned a few tones, and the scrolls burned. The spell of 'Bully Power' has begun to show its effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door was violently pulled open, and a glare of glare came into the compartment, if the person in the compartment instinctively looked out the door, I will definitely be blinded by this glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et. Although the skill is not good, it is not bad to talk about the blackmail. As soon as the door opened, he grabbed a mat and flew out. A few bangs, a few long swords pierced the mat, and the goose feathers danced in the sky, obscuring the glare. Ett followed and threw a mat, and there was an ambush outside the car. A long sword suddenly stabbed from the top of the car, and the cross sword light shone, and the mat was cut into four pieces. Ett came out of this, and a sword slammed into the ambush on the roof. The man stabbed himself and was shocked. He rushed back to the sword block, but couldn’t stand the sword that had been blessed with magic. I have to take a few steps and sit on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ette is not forgiving, screaming, holding a sword, and a sword. The man has not recovered from the paralysis, his eyes are showing a desperate look, and his teeth are slashing. Next to it, a machete was stretched over and the giant sword of Etter was held. The swords intersected and sparked countless sparks. The knife sank one inch and one inch, but it was finally settled at the top of the man's head. Etter was shocked and looked over. He saw a thin middle-aged swordsman with a knife, wearing a dark brown chain armor, and his body was faintly revealing a pale yellow grudge. The swordsman shouted, and Etter immediately felt that the sword had been vigorously transmitted, and the giant sword was provoked to rise upwards. Then the hands, shoulders, and legs were not covered, and he was weak. Soft fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood flowed down from the wound. At this time, Ett deeply regretted that he should not wear this slick lock for the handsome. If it is a boutique half body armor produced by the 'Knight of War,' with the sword and the skill of the swordsman, these knives certainly cannot help themselves. Regret is already late. The swordsman came over and stretched his foot and kicked it heavily on Etter. The wounds on his body were so painful that he couldn’t help but squat. The swordsman was cold and cold: "This guy is a magical double repairer, it's really fucking useless! Just send me out for this kind of goods, the boss is too big!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tearing sound in the carriage, mixed with Isabella’s crying and the tearing of the clothes. The swordsman's face sank and angered: "One-eyed Buck! Give me out! This little girl is the boss who wants to name the person who dares to come to him? Is it dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Snapped! The swordsman gave the one-eyed buck a slap in the face and shouted: "You can dare to talk back when you talk!" One-eyed Buck was taken aback and immediately became honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people cleaned up the scene under the command of the swordsman, and Et and Isabella were taken on the original carriage, and the swordsman personally guarded in the carriage. With. The rest of the crowd brought their own two carriages, and they caught the carriage of Etter in tandem, and they entered the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Rogge, Fog and other people gathered on the third floor of the 'God of War,' and their faces were extremely ugly. On the table in the room was Etter's dark green breastplate and a pair of broken white silk high stockings. The fog is fascinating and old, and he is breathing, like a bellows, just staring at the pair of white socks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two intimate clothes were delivered in the early morning. The aristocrats used a bit of lynching on the delivery, but now he knows nothing about it. He only asked him to deliver a masked black man. With two pieces of clothing, there is a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge is reading this letter: "The words Kate, Lord Rogge and Master of Fog. Because of the sincere invitation, your companion Ett and The granddaughter of the Fantasy Master, Isabella, is currently in the middle of the guest. The only regret is that there was a slight misunderstanding when the invitation was made, and the two VIPs were rude. Especially the rude, very disrespectful to Miss Isabella. Those who have severely punished the offenders, don't worry anymore. In the next three days, it is the full moon night, which is also a good time to enjoy the moon tea. I look forward to enjoying the moonlight with the crowds at the end of the night, and take a look at your store's wonderful products. Quan's and Master Fei Si, I don't know if I can enjoy the light. The meeting place will inform Ya's business separately. It is not suitable for many people. I hope to consider it carefully. Within three days, Guiyou and Miss Isabella will be entertained at the next meeting, but not after three days. I dare to guarantee the number of rituals.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying Dragons<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people have almost forgotten this so-called Dragon Dragon Because of the complexity of everything, Ignore the safety of Et and Isabella, I did not expect to be drilled by this dragon. . The other party named Fiss to the scene. Obviously, it is already known that Fiss is the soul of the ‘God of the God of War.’ I don’t know if it is the information excavated from the mouth of Et or Isabella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fog slammed on the table, angered: "Atte, this stinky boy knows to boast! Nothing is used when it is critical! My granddaughter must have Half-point damage, I have to live alive with this shit lizard boss and Etna idiot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate advised: "Master, don't worry, don't worry. Up, we are not the opponents of the dragon, so this thing can not blame Ette. In addition, the other side has a picture, there should be no adverse behavior for them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing unfavorable?!" The fog jumped into the chair and said: "The socks are all sent, and there is nothing wrong with it. You have to send the full set of underwear. "Well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fog Master! Now is the way to negotiate! Can you save your granddaughter with such a temper?" Rogge said. The fog illusion was tortured by Rogge, and it was only feared and respected by his mind. Since Rogge spoke, the fog would not sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the enemy is dark, I know that the other party has important hostages in hand, the dragon martial arts is strong, I don’t know if there are other magicians hiding in the side, especially against In the situation, I am still an enemy of the enemy, and I am extremely uncomfortable with the appetite of several people. A few people have been negotiating for a long time, and there is nothing to discuss. I don’t even understand why this Feilong boss is idle and has nothing to do with the aristocratic scums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the unscrupulous policy, on the one hand, Renns tried to find out everything about the dragon, on the other hand, to inform Orphey Roque, after all, 'The Hammer of the God of War' is his industry, forgive him not to let go of this money tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day, Kate, Rogge, and Franco discussed with Orfey Roque in the Grand Duke, and Orpheco asked carefully. Foresight and consequences, Shen Yu said: "The flying dragon is just a local snake. It should not dare to get the head of the 'Knight of the God of War'. There must be someone behind him. Just like this, I and Elysses will go with you. See and see what the dragons have in the end, dare to kidnap me in the city of Lille!” The anger of the golden lion made everyone happy, and Ophrod and Elyss were out, no matter the dragon. What is the skill, this time must make him grimacing. A few people think more about the long-term, and have already played the role of torture to torture this unopened dragon and the idea of ​​receiving all his forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreed time is coming soon. On the third day of the evening, another letter was sent to indicate that the meeting place was above the small square of the city in the southern slums. The time was midnight. A few nobles and a small number of Fiss, together with Fiss, were all plunged into the covenant, and the timid Robersky was forced into battle. Although mixed with a new and sophisticated equipment, he was not satisfied with this exchange because of his pale face. Orpheus and Elysses are hidden in the dark, ready to help. If he wants to hide his whereabouts, he will naturally not be seen by the hands of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and others waited for an hour in the square before they heard ‘haha’ a long laugh, a figure that was not tall but powerful and walked into the square, it was the dragon’s boss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the Dragon**!" His voice slammed into the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the Dragon!" There are countless voices around. A team of gray robes with a sword and a torch into the square, the uniform footsteps formed a huge invisible pressure. The aristocrats have some discoloration, and the dragon dragon can even train a group of cellars to be like an army. It is not a simple character. In an instant, the nobles and the aristocrats have been surrounded by more than a hundred big men in the square, and Robsky’s leg is soft. Rogge immediately slammed him on the shackle with the 'tethered soul' axe. Let him stand up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feilong Zhiyi is full, drink: "Bring up people!" A huge carriage rumbling into the square, with two wooden poles standing on the top of the carriage. Et and Isabella are being tied to the wooden pole. Behind the two men stood a big man with a black cloth cover, holding a shiny broken axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate emerged from the crowd and said: "Flying dragons, our brothers are doing business in Lille, and there is nothing in the past and the present that has offended you. Where is the place? Why is the Dragon King always looking for trouble with our brothers? Really think that we are a good bully?! You may not know who the real boss of the 'God of War' is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon King stepped forward and said proudly: "When I was in the city of Lille, you haven't been born yet! You are here to teach me to learn from me? It’s the management of the yellow-haired puppy and the old dog, but the boss of the underground world is my dragon! You are doing business on my site, that is, offending me! Last time you were shameless, now regret it? Hahahaha! Nonsense talks about Laoxianquan' and Faith handed over, the pair will be returned to you, and then I will get out of the Bavarian Principality!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate was furious and was about to go forward, but was stayed by Rogella. Rogge said coldly to Feilong: "Do you really put Orphey Rooke in your eyes, or do you dare to hide in the old nest and brag?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The dragon is a glimpse, and Orphee Rock is famous, how can he say that he is really not afraid? However, the big words have already been released. In front of many hands, he can't lose face anyway. He has to support the facade: "The yellow-haired puppy is standing here now, and my dragon dragon can also let him come. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge faint smile! How can these two people on the carriage compare with Fei Si, since Mr. Fei Long has taken a fancy to them, please leave it. If there is nothing else, we will leave. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying dragon was shocked and angry, and said: "Do you not have the life of your companion?" Can you watch them murder? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not true, killing them is the dragon dragon and not us." What's more, when it is time for Orfey Roque to avenge them, why should I come here to smash this water? Having said that, Fiss is also our companion. Oh, Mr. Fei Long, see you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying Dragon yelled: "Give me a stop!" Do you think that this will go? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rughaha smiles, we will help Mr. Feilong again! Franco!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Franco came out and held a long arch with a pale green fluorescent. He snorted, and two long arrows were placed between the black flutters, and lightning flashed toward Ett and Isabella's throat. The girl's eyes widened in horror, helplessly watching the arrow fly toward her throat. She thought she finally hoped for a savior, but she did not expect to kill the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying dragon was shocked, with a wave of hands in a hurry, two fine iron arm guards flew out and hit two long arrows. Before he could slow down, Franco shot four arrows, took the throat, and took the heart, which was extremely hot. The two big men on the roof stepped forward and showed off a steel light shield, which was in front of Et and Isabella. When a few sounds, four arrows hit the shield and bounced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon was furious and shouted: "You actually have a poisonous hand for yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Kate smiled and sighed: "How can this be harming us? Of course, the poisoned hand is the dragon dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One A small black ball sneaked into the sky and suddenly exploded. A strong wind slammed through the square, blowing everyone in the field, and all the torches were blown out in an instant. Along with this strong wind, the heavy black fog also spread, and the square suddenly reached out and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three groups of lights were lit up in the crowd, and the three magicians began to cast spells. There are many people in the dragon, and there are three light magicians. It is no wonder that his tone will be so big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden burst of colorful halo bursts out of the circle, the nobles are few people holding the scrolls, and the caster is naturally far beyond the magicians of the curse. The halo flickered, and the sound of a ghost crying in the dragon's hands immediately sounded. Finally, the three mages were only finished with the spell, and the wind and the wind blew away the fog on the square. Two red and yellow light balls slowly rose, and the small square was illuminated as bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a moment of chaos, the nobles and the wicked have already smashed the encirclement, and several people are in a circle. Rogge is the first, after Kate is broken, Franco With Robsky in the middle of the game, Faith was surrounded. Around the team, more than a dozen dragons have fallen. The three powerful hands of the Dragon's boss are trying to block the way out of the crowd. After blessing the "power of the bull" and "adding the shadow of the surgery", Roger, who is extremely powerful, is rampant, squatting in the ‘reincarnation’, depending on the sword and the sword. The heavy and incomparable ‘binding soul’ has a heart-wrenching humming sound, and no matter how light or heavy the weapon is, it has become a two-stage. For a time, Rogge was murderous and smashed several people. The seemingly slim ‘Bound Soul Crystal keeps flashing, happily absorbing the four scattered souls. Roger is more proud, the axe is even more unspoken, and it is purely chaotic. The faces of the three dragons are complaining, and the fat man is full of flaws. It is obvious that the martial arts are not very good, but the armor is extremely extreme, and no matter how he cuts the thorns, he can’t help. However, the power of the axe was shocking, and few people dared to touch a star and a half. This is purely a beating situation that makes the three big as big as a bucket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sword that makes the two-handed swords, and the thorns that look at the timing of the sword are under the ribs of Rogge. He thought that this sword would pass through. Who knows that the 'reinance' suddenly bursts into a flame, and this explosive force hits the tip of the sword. Then a strange wind rang in the ear of the man, and he was very good. When he made a decision, he was kneeling on the ground with a tiger fluttering in the same place. The ‘Bounding Soul’ then passed over him. He was about to look up, and the sound of the boom was loud. I don’t know who was calling out a fat wild boar, but the goal was not him, but passing by him. This wild boar has three or four hundred pounds, and the man is stepping on the air, but the disaster is not over yet. The three or four ice wolves that followed will be gone. The 800-pound violent bear is not his bone. Affordable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero often encounters the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is a ten-level swordsman, wherever it is a personal thing, who knows that this time is not good, accidentally lying on the main road The result is that the teacher has not died before the death, this kind of death, it is estimated that he will not notice in any case. Before the last breath of his hateful exhalation, the big feet of a soil element in the pupil could not expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, there are more and more summoning creatures on the battlefield. Thirty cockroaches, more than a dozen zombies, groups of ice wolves, wild boars and violent bears ran around in the battlefield. The scene was chaotic. No one knew which summoning creature belonged to the party. Fisna's four-meter-tall earth element was summoned, and immediately the wind and the wind, eight feet, kicked and flew the hands of two dragons, a giant palm wave, fan flying a brown bear. The bear was sorely rolled, a sword spider rushed over, and the two front paws were inserted into the belly of the brown bear. The brown bear struggled a few times and turned into a blue smoke and returned to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, a small team that Rogge called was a brilliant result. The team’s lowest level of sorrow has quietly eliminated six ice wolves, one general, and seven or eight dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden red light in the square, and the two elements of fire were summoned by the enemy's magician at the same time. These two creatures wrapped around the flames were agile, and they rushed over one after the other, surrounded the earth elements and took the wind for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, a group of blue-black storms converge on the battlefield, and everyone close to them was blown away by the storm. A storm elf up to five meters is struggling in the blink of an eye. Fiss's forehead sweat kept flowing, and he was concentrating on trying to control the elf, ignoring the earth elements in trouble. Because Fes can't move, this team can only struggle in the same place, and the situation is getting into trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon has been facing Rogge. He was armed with a steel shield and axe, cleverly using the shield's curved surface and capacity techniques to unload the shackle. Every time he cut an axe, he rushed to fight back and provoked a bright red flame. Rogge complained, but Kate, Lens, Franco and others were entangled in the enemy. How can they help? As for Robsky, it is a miracle that it can still stand without many times. There are many dragons under the dragon, and there are warriors around the three magicians. The three magicians are fighting against the magic on the one hand. On the one hand, they start to destroy the summoning creatures one by one, and they seem to have more strength, and the magician style is fully demonstrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
