			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a valley surrounded by mountains, there is a small village. The houses in the village are quite simple, but they have a natural taste and blend harmoniously with the surrounding environment. A wide variety of shrubs form a natural fence that encloses dozens of small courtyards. A towering old tree is scattered in the village, sheltering the hot sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a peaceful and warm atmosphere in the village. People leisurely shuttle around and enjoy the peace of the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has observed the village for two full days, and more or less familiar with it. It seems that there are not too many powerful people here. Their plans should be successful. Now just wait for the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but, why are you faintly uneasy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun rises, a pair of young men and women walk out of the village. The spirit of Rogge is a revival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair of men and women just climbed up to the hills where Rogge was hiding. They walked briskly, and the big stones that encountered obstacles often leaped. Although they are all mages, the Druids can be very different from the weak magicians. At this point, they are more similar to the bright master who is the assistant of the magic, that is, the pastor. After wearing armor and blessing magic, the Druids will also become brave warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One man and one woman are wearing earthen cloth clothes, decorated with flowers growing in the mountains, natural stones and rustic wood carvings. They walked briskly, the girls sang folk songs, and did not notice that there were individuals in the distance behind them who were tracking them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section of the mountain road went from early morning to noon before it came to a cliff. They took out the rope and tied it to the big stone on the edge of the cliff. The young man slowly slid down the cliff along the rope. The girl sits leisurely under a big tree, takes out a musical instrument made of bamboo, and plays it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a purple-red grass growing in the cracks of the cliff. In the two-day observation, most of the people in Rogge’s small villages were fixed to work on one or two. The young men and women will pick this herb on this cliff for two days. The environment here is quiet and there is no one in the wild. It is a good place for Rogge to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge entered the spiritual world and once again confirmed the strength of the young men and women. Judging from their spiritual strength, this pair of young men and women is still a low-level Druid, it should be six or seven. Rogge had never seen Druid before, nor could he evaluate the strength of Druid. He could only observe the energy they had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge whispered a spell and slammed the rope to the edge of the cliff! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden shaking on the cliff, and the big rock swayed a few times, and a young man’s exclamation came from under the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother!" The girl dropped the instrument and flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Rogge, the silver light flashed, and the gesture was nudged. The big rock swayed a few times, and finally could not support it, and rolled off the cliff! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long scream in the cliff. The heavy sound of the boulder rolling down the bottom of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother! "The girl fluttered to the rope quickly, but it was a step that was not caught!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cried and looked down at the cliff, only saw a cloud Wandering, where is her brother's figure?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on! Is anyone here! Save people! "The girl panicked and cried without aim. How could anyone pass by this wild mountain? Unless it is a caring person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl climbed up, While crying, I ran to the village. But the road was far away, waiting for her to find someone, my brother is afraid that it is no longer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with tears keeps on Running. Just two miles away, she already didn't know how much she had dropped, her clothes broke, and one knee fell bloody.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden flash of her eyes The girl was immediately surprised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl turned a blind eye to the sharp sword tip, rushed up and cried: "I beg you! Help me save my brother! Please help him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge's nervous face relaxed. He held the girl and asked, "What happened to your brother? Don't worry, say slowly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lost Going down the cliff! Please, help me save him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where? Take me there!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was overjoyed and turned and flew, but fell to the ground. Rogge frowned, grabbed the girl, put it on his shoulder, and strode away. The girls' clothes are broken and the large pieces of skin are exposed. Rogge held her hand just above the thigh. The girl’s face was red and she struggled a little. Rogge seemed to be afraid that she would fall and catch it tighter. The girl is no longer struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain escaped in recent months, Rogge has been much thinner. The fat face of a smile was also stuck, adding a little wind and frost mark. At this moment, he is holding a young girl and still flying on the hills. It seems that the girl has no weight at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s heart was amazed. Looking at the degree and power of this person, it seems that the most venerable Grub in the village is no more than him. Is he a knight? Look at his costume is very similar. When the princess in the book of the village chief’s family is in trouble, there will be a knight. Is he, my knight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s face suddenly turned red, and she was secretly swearing at this time. How could she still think about it! Fortunately, she was sitting on Rogge’s shoulder. Will not let him see, otherwise, it is really shameful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quickly reached the cliff under the guidance of the girl. He looked at the bottom of the cliff and turned his head and said, "It seems that you have to look down to know your brother's situation. You are here waiting for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl Pulling Rogge's arm, nervously asked: "It's very dangerous... Is there a problem with the rope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and patted lightly I took the girl's hand and solved the problem with the long sword backpack. After all, I am a knight. How can this mountain cliff survive me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was said, Rogge turned and climbed the cliff. The girl fell on the edge of the cliff and watched Rogge move gently between the rocks until He disappeared into the clouds. She breathed a sigh of relief, and now she was already sweating the clothes of her body. She just clenched her fists and nails were stuck in the flesh.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge easily jumped between the cliffs. He was always in power, and he gave himself a feathering technique, and he could easily drop a few tens of meters. What's more, this cliff has long been familiar with him?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge jumped down and fell lightly in the bottom of the valley. Just now he jumped at least. More than 20 meters, which is a knight's performance? But he is not afraid of the young Druid to see, if he has not fallen to death, and saw his own skills, he can not take him to the top of the mountain, and then throw it down It’s just a drop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the valley is a dense forest. At this moment, many trees and leaves have broken. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "It seems this kid is not bad luck! There are these branches, and maybe they haven’t fallen yet! Rogge thought. He quickly found the unfortunate young Druid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was covered in blood and fell to the ground without moving. When I saw it on the grid, it was still not dead. Druid’s body was really strong. If I changed to a magician, I didn’t wait to land, and I was drawn by the trees on the cliff. It’s estimated that half of my life would be gone. Rogge simply dealt with his wound, tied him to his back, and slowly climbed up the cliff. Naturally, all the way above, he I intentionally scratched my clothes and wiped out some wounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounds don't have to be heavy, as long as they are more. This kind of easy thing seems to bleed. The sweating ability was originally Rogge’s masterpiece.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the figure emerged from the fog, the girl’s heart could not help but jump faster and faster. Rogge climbed to the top of the cliff and gently placed the young Druid on the ground. Seeing that the young Druid fell to the ground and did not move, the girl was flustered and immediately rushed up. Vigorously shook him, burst into tears: "My brother! what happened to you? say something! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl stood up with red eyes and some did not dare to look at Rogge. Rogge also injured the young man on his back and I could only deal with his wounds a little. Where is your home? Is there a pastor there? Or a doctor can do it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our village is in this direction, about twenty kilometers away." The village chief, Jason, is a big Druid, and he must have a way to cure my brother! But we need to hurry! "Speaking, the girl trots up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Rogge, but I still don't know your name." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Amy, my brother is Cooper." We are all Drew still low-level Druid. However, among the hundreds of people in the village, there are only 20 people who are eligible to become Druids. The brothers and sisters are all Druids only us! "The voice of the girl is full of pride.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really amazing! Druid is mysterious and powerful. I have never met Druid yet. I didn't expect to see two at once. Rog smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy had a blush on her face and said softly: "I just became Druid." The village chief, Jason Grandpa, really has a history, he can even become a dragon! Mr. Rogge, must you be a very senior knight? Otherwise, I can't save my brother from the cliff. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an ordinary knight." Rogge showed a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge followed Amy without hesitation, chatting casually with her while carefully observing her at close range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy is quite beautiful, it is the kind of slightly beautiful beauty. She is very tall, only half a head lower than Rogge, and her long-term movement has given her slender legs, sharp hips and slender waist. Her skin is slightly beautiful in bronze and looks very radiant in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chatted slowly and talked about a lot of things that made Rogge interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amy, why do you live here and live a life that is isolated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Our Druid likes nature. The village chief said that the world outside the mountain is too dirty and complicated. Those people do not care about nature and animals. They will burn the entire forest and kill animals for their own enjoyment. Outsiders will also deceive or even kill their companions because of money. Every war between them will die thousands of times. Grandpa Jason said that it is not a world suitable for our Druids, those people will only want to use our virtues. The power of Ruyi to achieve their own dirty purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has some silence, this Jason old Druid is really extreme! But he is right, he is a person who wants to use the power of these Druids to achieve dirty purposes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amy, there are not many Druids in your village. What if there is a World of Warcraft attacking the village?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warcraft? Our village has been guarded by the children of Trillen Hutt since ancient times. Is there any Warcraft dare to harass our village? I remember when I was a child, there was a lot of food in the mountains. The demons came out of the mountains. They wanted to occupy our village, and they angered the adults of Trillen Hugh. They were torn into pieces by the adults, and they were buried on the hillside and turned into forest fertilizers." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s heart is happy, but he casually asks: “Is this Trillhuw’s adult a big Druid? He is more than Jason’s village chief. Still suffering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman suddenly realized that she said: "Grandpa Jason will not let us talk to outsiders about anything about the children of Trillen Hught. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this way, then I will not ask." Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that meaning, not that you are... you are an outsider! I really don't mean that! Amy hurriedly cried out. Yes, he saved his brother, but he also regarded him as an outsider.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is getting more and more Uneasy, I finally made up my mind: "Actually, Trillen Hught is an adult..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stretched a hand and gently held it Amy’s mouth, smiled and said: "Okay, needless to say. I don't want you to be embarrassed by the village chief. He must be very fierce. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge did not notice the strangeness of the girl, he was thinking about the meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the village of Druid was in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go back and ask someone to help you!" said, the girl flew back to the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, there was a burst of people in the village, and dozens of people followed Amy out for a tall, handsome young man and an old man. The old man’s legs and feet are not at all under the youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge put Cooper down and gave it to the tall young man. The strange thing is that the young man is obviously hostile to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandpa Jason, brother, will he have something?" Amy asked anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully watching Cooper, the old man looked up and said: "Do not worry, child. Cooper, he just broke a few small bones, he will be fine. After two months, you will have another brother who is alive and kicking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man turned his head and looked up and down at Rogge, frowning slightly and asked: "This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandpa Jason, his name is Rogge, who saved my brother." Amy replied rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you suddenly come to the depths of this mountain? I am more curious, no one has ever penetrated into this place before." The young man suddenly interjected . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gruuba! What do you mean by this! He saved my brother, but you have to ask him why he came here!" Amy cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger dressed up and smiled and replied: "I am just a regular knight who just passed by. Because there is some trouble outside, I will go deep into the Central Mountains." I have no intention of disturbing the peace of you. Since I have sent people, I should leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! Let's take your troubles first." 'Description, you already know the location of our village, can't just go like this!” Gruba stepped forward and stopped Rogge's way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s smile on his face didn’t come to mind, saving the person actually fell so much! Is this the Druid who claims to love nature and peace? Today is really an eye opener. Laozi is crawling out of the dead on the battlefield. Do you want to leave Laozi? Also, come up with something to do! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at other people in the Druid village and said coldly: "If you think that one person is not enough, you can do it together." "When he said, his sword was squirted and his body was faintly white. He shouted, and all the people present felt a slight dizziness in his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grub's face changed greatly, and he couldn't help but take a step back. I heard that it is a very high-ranking knight who can release the brilliance with vindictiveness! One-on-one, he is probably not an opponent. But he is the highest among the young people in the village. Druid, can only hold the scalp to stop Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Grandpa Jason! Gruba, he is not sensible, how can you do this! Is this the way you usually teach us hospitality? Rogge saved my brother, and Grubar treated him so rudely. Is this the truth of Druid's heart? Amy shouted excitedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason hesitated, and he instinctively felt the darkness from Rogge, which made him very Uneasy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge’s sword swayed gently, and a white brilliance poured out like water. Grub only felt that his eyes were bright. Time could barely see anything. Then his abdomen felt a huge impact, and his whole stomach was picked up. He fell to the ground and retched.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold shower came from his neck, and Gruba immediately froze and didn't dare to move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge put the sword on the shelf On the ground of Gruba, smiling at the people in the village. He suddenly smiled and said: "Your secret Laozi is not interested in knowing! This is just to let you know that it is not so easy to leave Laozi! Good intentions are not well reported, and I will never save any Druid anymore! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Rogge, please stay!" Jason shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a very druid, do you want to leave me alone?" Rogge frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to leave you, but not in the way of the enemy, but in the way of brothers and friends! I have doubts, but you are A person who respects life, that is our friend of Druid," Jason said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge still looks at his life? You may know that every knight returning from the battlefield has dyed a lot of blood. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War is the most stupid act. But you have not only saved Cooper, but have spared Grub, who has offended you, and will be bandaged for an injured deer. Yes, I have peeked at your whereabouts, but you need to understand that in this mountain, caution is the principle of survival. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded and his face relaxed. "Since you have learned about my whereabouts, you must know that the people who chase me are very powerful." I will leave unnecessary trouble to this village, so I think I'd better leave. I will go north and try to pass through this central mountain. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason smiled and said: "The strength of the pursuers is strong, but we also have a way to survive in the forest. I will send people to erase all the traces you left behind. In the mountains and the jungle, if the Druids want to help a friend hide his whereabouts, then no one can find him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy cheered, skipped and hugged Rogge's arm and stayed there? You can live with me and my brother! Brother, he woke up. I will definitely want to see you later. He always wants to see a real knight! Also, you will like my baked pine nuts cake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Ai Mimi and Rogge's intimacy, Grub's face was blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Jason hosted Rogge in his own home. There have been no outsiders in the village for many years, so almost all the people in the village gathered in Jason’s yard. Even Kubo, who was not hurt, insisted on attending the party after he woke up. Only Grub is resting at home because of physical discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid's food is light and natural, and there are very few foods, which makes Rogge less refreshing. Fortunately, the Druids are good at making wine, and the fruit wine is refreshing and refreshing, so that Rogge can drink a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome’s profiteers were born, eloquent, and there was wine and wine, and it didn’t take long for them to compete with the people in the village. The people in the mountains are simple and hospitable, and they admire men who have the ability and strength. Rogge's high-powered knight is naturally the target of many girls. He even said that the most ruthless Druid Grubar in the village was easily knocked down by him! The girls gathered around and took Rogge and asked Dong to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy and Rogge are inseparable and staring at other girls with hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he was besieged by the girls, Rogge still did not forget to take the old Jason's ass, always making him comfortable and old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet was finally dispersed in the middle of the night. Amy struggled to get rid of some ruthless Rogge from the hands of the girls, and helped him back to his own small courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Jason returned to the house to rest, half asleep, and suddenly sighed. His wife sat up and asked with concern: "Old man, what's wrong with you? Isn't it very happy tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old woman, I always There is an instinct, maybe this Rogge will break the calm of our village."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old man, in my opinion, he is a good boy! Have the ability, Integrity, cleverness! If he is willing to join our village, it would be better. For decades, these faces are facing you, you are not bothered, I am still annoying! I see Amy’s child seems to be very interesting to Rogge. If Amy can keep him, I think it is a good thing! The young man is very bad, don't say that when you were young, you are not as good as him. Now, I don't think you are necessarily his opponent!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the old woman, this young man’s history is definitely not simple. I went to observe the people who chased him, there are more than one hundred people! And there are still a few calendars in it. The harmed guy exists and almost came to me. I see, only the North's 'Rage of the Sky' big Druyi Court To overpower the two leading knights and ah, the old woman, I always felt that Jacques Rogge, who has dark atmosphere "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;.. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
