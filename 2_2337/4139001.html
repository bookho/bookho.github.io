			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book is destroyed on the fifth day (3)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the slow step from the church In the middle of Rogge, the piano snorted and greeted him. "You are awake?" said Ronald Pope, who has told me that you will wake up and have time to go to the Great Hall of Light. You look Very weak, isn't it still recovering, do you want to eat something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is pale and scary at the moment, his feet are also vain, looking a pair The appearance of a serious illness. He waved his hand and said faintly: "You are going to reply to the Pope. I will go to see him later. Don't worry about me, everything is in my hands... Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated for a moment before finishing the sentence. His eyebrows were twisted together, his face was gloomy, and he was shocked to take a step back. Rog didn't pay any attention to her. She walked outside the sanctuary. The piano was full of courage and cried behind him: "Where is Roger, where are you going? Now that you are in poor health, let me go with you." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Rogge accelerated at the foot, and his figure flashed slightly, and it has disappeared from the church. Where does the piano track his movements? After staying in the same place for a while, she could only smile a bit and leave alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge locked his eyebrows and couldn’t help thinking about it. His thoughts are like a rushing river. The waters are choppy, and the underwater is a mysterious reef. Every moment, there will be countless knowledge rushing into his thoughts and pooling into the river. That is, he saw an ordinary tree, and he will watch the past future of the tree in an instant, its composition, and how life flows. Next, there will be countless whimsy based on the knowledge of these seeing in his mind. Some are familiar to him, and many are similar to known natural magic. But more is the strange idea he had previously unknown. Even if a leaf falls, Rogge will calculate the surrounding wind in an instant, and even everything within 100 meters may affect the movement of anything falling from this leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Rogge was able to control himself and not receive too much knowledge, but after waking up, these messes, but both The knowledge of infinite mystery floods into his consciousness like a raging wave! Rogge at the moment. Like a carriage that has long been overwhelmed, the car is still piled up on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although both eyes can see through the plane. But Rogge is now completely afraid to let his gaze pass through this plane. He is a little scared. When he is afraid that his eyes will extend too far, he will bring a storm of unsustainable knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked, not knowing where he was. He instinctively avoided the place where the amount of information was too large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not without direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While still asleep, Rogge suddenly sensed the birth of a strong breath, that kind of sight. It is like a bright moon in the sea rising in the night. For Rogge, this breath is very strange, he can be sure that he has never touched the master of the breath. On the other hand, this breath is familiar again, and there is a clear relationship between Rogge and Uncle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is calling Rogge to wake Rogge from his sleep. But when Rogge woke up, the breath completely disappeared. However, Rogge’s understanding of power and the world at this time is no small matter. Although it is just a few calls in the dream, Rogge has firmly captured its position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge is moving in the direction of this call. All the scenes in his eyes are nothing but extremely complicated information, energy and historical future. A combination of changes. Rogge suddenly had some self-deprecation, and now he sees the essence of everything. But I can no longer see the confusing appearance of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it didn't take long for Rogge to adapt to the new changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set his footsteps and looked up, seeing the majestic and magnificent Bavarian Grand Duchy. He took a glimpse of it and walked toward the Grand Duke. The guards of the goalkeeper just wanted to ask, and suddenly recognized Rogge, and instantly replaced his face with pride and majesty with the most enthusiastic smile. The speed was so fast that Rogge was not surprised. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the guards don’t understand why they are alone in the Grand Duchy, how can they block them? At this moment, Bavaria’s great justice expedition to the North. So several guards led Rogge on the side. A quick trip to inform Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only Rogge’s eyes that had swept the entire Grand Duchy, and still did not find where the call came from. From the moment he stepped into the Grand Palace, Rogge’s weak sense of the call had completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Palace is as good as ever, plain and watery, with no outstanding powers and no hidden power. The only thing that can be said is Catherine. In the eyes of Rogge, she is covered with a hidden glory. Sheng Hui is noble and not blazing, apparently not the power of Catherine itself. In fact, at this moment, Catherine is still a beautiful woman with no power in the eyes of Rogge. Rogge’s slight thoughts, the source of Shenghui, have already appeared in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is from Shenghui of MGM. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the two great apostles sent by the great Fryemir to this plane have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, Rogge immediately smiled coldly, and his mind floated an idea: "I am afraid this thing will become a great Frye Mill that is endless." A dark spot on the radiance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the thoughts, Rogge is already standing in Catherine’s study, looking up and down her. Catherine, who has the title of the first beauty of the king, seems to have just taken a bath, and the rushed hair is still wet. The dress on her dress is elegant and conservative, in full compliance with her identity. But Rogge knows how crazy her soul is under her noble and reserved appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned. Strode to Catherine, reached out and grabbed her neckline, tearing hard. With a bang, the first half of Catherine's dress was torn off by Rogge, and her right chest was completely presented in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seems that Catherine is never surprised, no matter what Rogge does. She just looked at Rogge and smiled. "How. Are you interested in me? Yes, what do you like about me? To be meek, or to resist?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke’s boss has witnessed this scene, and it’s just like earth. One party is not to be so rude to the Grand Duke, and the other is the Lord of the Church of the Light, which the Grand Duke may not be able to offend. No matter which side, it is possible to crush him into gray. Big man. And Rogge’s move like a rogue is completely inconsistent with his status. But Catherine's words are even more amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss has lowered his head at the fastest speed, knowing that even if he looks at it more and listens more, he may lead to a catastrophe, so he will roll With the climb out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was just closed, and there was a sound of heavy objects falling outside the study, and then the pain of the boss’s voice rang. Obviously this one is absolutely not light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ignored Katherine, but gently stroked her chest and abdomen skin. The color in my eyes is changing, staring at her body and watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is quite a good chest. But what Rogge saw at the moment was not the perfect body, but just the numerous overlapping images and light and shadow. Finally, Rogge took back his hand and said faintly: "Dear the endless ocean, can you answer a few questions? First, where did my child go and hand him over to me. Second, the natural goddess happened. What. Third, what means did you swallow the MGM of Heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine heard a word and asked with ignorance: "Endless Ocean? What is that? I can't understand what you are saying. Ah, the goddess of nature, I know the land, but I only know that she is a god with powerful power. Most of the believers are Druids. As for her. What, these gods. How can I know? You should be clearer than me. As for MGM Grand. He just said that he would use blessing to bless me, so that I will not be external. Infringement. How can I have the ability to swallow him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stares at Catherine's eyes to make sure she is telling lies. As always, when he is thinking, the answer naturally emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why, Rogge feels that there are some problems with this answer. As for the problem, he can’t say it. In order to deal with the huge knowledge that comes from all the time, he is exhausted, and how can he spare no more time to think carefully? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger frowned and said: "You have a baby in these few days? But it doesn't matter. Why can't I completely feel his breath? Are you hiding him or sealing it? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine calmed down a little and said: "I know you will come to grab my child, so I have completely sealed him and pushed it in." Going to the turbulent flow of different space. As for where he will drift, when will he wake up, and what kind of fate will wake up after he wakes up, he will see the flow of the river of destiny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly stroked Catherine’s neck and said coldly: “The river of destiny has countless tributaries, and the storm of space is boundless. Now, how can I find him? Maybe I should kill you now, and the Pope’s restrictions can’t restrain me now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine Cold Cold smiled and said: "Do you care if you have children? In fact, you never hoped. I will give birth to your child. If you want to kill and kill, I will not resist or escape. As for the child, you will want to touch him in this life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking at Catherine, who is close to death, Rogge finally hesitated. On the one hand, she is the mother of her own child, after a while. He is somewhat unable to go. On the other hand, Rogge faintly felt that there were still many secrets hidden in her body. These secrets have yet to be discovered. And Rogge couldn't understand why he still couldn't understand Catherine's secrets now, just as he didn't know that she had her own child in the belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, Rogge once again felt that everything was not in his grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His face suddenly turned pale and his body swayed. Almost fell to the ground. Catherine was taken aback and came over to help the fat man. But the body of the fat man is too heavy, and she almost drove her to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath, stabilized his body and reached out to push Catherine away. But at this time he was in contact with Catherine's red luo and creamy skin, and the bottom of his heart suddenly penetrated into a line of consciousness, and another group of flames ignited. He suddenly pushed back and pushed Catherine to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was taken aback. Road: "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled coldly, his hand waved, and a gentle wind passed over her body. Although the wind is soft, but sharp as a knife, she immediately cut her dress, but did not hurt her half skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine relaxed and put on a charming and wild expression, said: "You want to go to me. Come on! I waited. It’s been a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her face changed and Rogge actually rushed up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately resisted Rogge’s body with her arms and shouted: “You guys don’t think I don’t know, you don’t just want to kill me, Just let you see the child, you will kill him immediately! You don't want to see him in your life! Get away from me. Don't touch me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp But how can her weak arms support Rogge's body? Only for a moment, her arms were soft, and the whole person was firmly pressed by Rogge, and then snorted involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the devil has become a real world of blood and fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast plains are like a large palette of colors, all of which are dried up in various colors. On this huge palette of unprecedented history, the pigments are the bodies and blood of the various ethnic groups of the Mozu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dangerous peak on the plain. This mountain with a height of several kilometers is extremely abrupt, like a stone pillar, and it is flat in the vicinity. There is no higher hill. Below the mountain peaks. Gathered in a variety of styles, all kinds of colors. Millions of demons. All the powerful races of the Devil can be found here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the black crushed demons, there is a large open space, and more than a dozen huge dragons are perched on this open space. The Devil World is a world of extreme strength. There are no places for the weak devils around these powerful dragons. In another open space, the giant who followed Loka was lying on the ground, his voice screaming. Within a hundred meters of his land, there is no other demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
