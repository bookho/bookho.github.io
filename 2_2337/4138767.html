			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Charlie roared against his newcomers, in the far south, in the city of Lille, in the center of the whirlpool of war and struggle, Catherine was softly whispering with the Bavarian Grand Duke to discuss the battle with the Rhine League. However, the harshness of her discourse is completely no less than the roaring Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear, I really don't understand what is going on! I don't understand the military, but our 100,000 army is stationed in only 10,000 people. Rothchel had nothing to do before, and it was already half a month. Why? Take down Rochelle, the front is Rhine. Now the entire Rhine Union can mobilize the army, but there are more than 30,000 people? How can the combat power of the aristocratic private soldiers compare with our elite knights? I don't understand, why should a battle that should end in a week be dragged to the present?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Bavarian Grand Duke is younger than half a year ago. It looks like it is only about thirty. His face is completely golden, just like a mask, handsome and mature. With a little cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine, this can't blame Roscherio. The last time the fortress attacked and defended, we lost more than 8,000 people. Now face two more Rochelle, who was assisted by the Great Magister, he should be cautious. What's more, this time Yero has already released his words and is ready to use the kingdom of artifacts. So this time we are still preparing to kill Rochelle and split the Rhine. , pushing Yero and Lhasa back to Rhineland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine took the hand of Dagong and said softly: "Dear, don't lie to me." The war is very difficult, but the real reason for the long delay is that you and Roscherio are not willing to start with old friends like Jero, Lhasa and Russell. I know that you want them to retreat, so Xu Xuan did not move. But now the results are very clear, they have to loyal to the Rhine League. Dear, you have given them the opportunity, but they let it go. Now, they can no longer blame us for being ruthless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catherine’s voice slowly became cold: “Dear, the great magister can’t decide everything. I’ve seen everything about the two great mages, and their top magic can only be released. Second, and then consider the role of other magic and the kingdom of artifacts, these two legendary magisters can kill up to 3,000 of our soldiers. In the presence of Mr. Prossis, I don’t think they Dare to consume all the magic. Dear, I also read all the siege battles that have been available for information in the past 20 years. When the offensive and defensive strength is more than five to one, all the cities have been broken, and 80% of the battles The offensive side lost about half of the defending party. I don't understand the military, I don't understand why the attacker's losses are often smaller."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;大公 nodded: "No Wrong, the vast majority of the defenders’ losses were born after the city was broken. At that time, they were basically slaughtered by the siege.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a philosopher who has never said it, only to success or failure Xiong? So I don't care about the process, as long as the result! As long as we are fully attacking the city, then we have at least 80% of the grasp of the casualties but the cost of 8,000 people to defend the army 10,000 people, is this the case?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big public is somewhat helpless: "Yes, dear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you attack immediately?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Grand Duke looked at the noble and beautiful Catherine, sighed Gao Shen to take my son, but sent you to my side. If you help me, it will be a lot easier. Catherine, your body and children are tight, don't be too hard. I will go back to the front line tomorrow! I promise you, within a week, I can stand in front of the Rhine City! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiles is the hero in my heart! You are always so decisive and determined, I know, no one can stop your steps. Dear, I almost forgot. The Pope did not promise to help us, but now there is no such thing. I think you should go see him before you go, and ask for it to be clear and specific. How to dodge! If he still refuses to send the Holy Knights led by Master Augustus, then you want him to be a Templar, at least five! These people will be of great use whether they are siege or field. If he still refuses, then you should not ask any more. Going straight is the one he promised us, and his face is not so thick! If you leave, these two demands that he must agree to one. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Grand Duke’s face was awkward and hesitated: "This.......somewhat is not appropriate?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong’s smile was even more embarrassing. He barely smiled: “I want the Pope to be unbelievable. I will go to St. Peter’s Cathedral.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Catherine smiled and looked at Dagong as a golden cloud figure out of the Grand Duchy, galloping in the direction of St. Peter's Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she turned back, the smile on her face had already disappeared. She hurriedly called in a maid and asked, "Is the Franco adult already here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs, he just arrived. But the time you met him. Isn't it half an hour later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time I waited for half an hour in advance to summon him to control the time, it’s a personal talent." Catherine thought for herself. She told the maid: "Notify him to come see me now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco looks a lot more mature than a few years ago. The blue-black dress is simple and generous. He gave a gift to Catherine and sat opposite her. But when he saw Catherine's ivory skin and perfect noble temperament, there was still a faint flame in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Viscount Franco, we are seeing this for the second time." Catherine's elegance made Franco unable to find any embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very happy to have this honor. You are calling me this time, are you dissatisfied with the ordnance armor produced in Sellers?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the contrary, I think I can't find better armor except for the production in Sellesborg. So I am going to transfer the orders of other arms dealers to you. Starting next month, I hope that the supply in Saleres will be doubled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco took a look at Mrs. Catherine, I am very happy to get With so many orders, I have to say that the production capacity of Sellers is probably not up to your requirements! In the unlikely event of your mistake, I am afraid...""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Franco, this is the final decision. You don't have to worry about the lack of production capacity. Soon there will be two arms dealers' industries that will be placed under your name, and you will be able to cope with these orders. I appreciate your ability to manage your territory and appreciate your leadership skills. The scenes of hundreds of dwarven slaves working hard are completely unseen in other places. You know, the Principality needs talent very much. As long as you contribute to the great cause of the Principality, you will certainly gain something. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco indulged and decisively said: "Mrs. Catherine, thank you very much for your trust." I know that the Principality is currently very financially constrained. This is good. In the future, all the ordnance supplied to the Brigade in Sellersburg will be priced only at the cost. I will not earn a copper coin from the treasury of the Principality. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled and thanked you. I am vacant for the treasury of the Principality! But you don't have to worry, you will be compensated for what you pay for the Principality." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chatted a few words at random, and Franco got up and went to the receiving industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine meditated for a moment, suddenly smiled: "Franco is really a smart person, the news seems to be very well-informed, actually knowing that I am The reason for just killing two arms dealers is that they like smart people...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels a little tired, stands up, and lazily stretches out. At this moment, her raised belly can no longer be covered by clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine came to the window of the floor and looked at the sky in the north, wondering what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The celebration of the Kingdom of Layton has been held for a month, but the King of Romon is still unfinished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliant luxury of the Layton Palace is in line with the status of the Leighton Kingdom in the Holy Alliance. At the end of the night, the square in front of the palace gate will be filled with large and beautiful carriages. Almost all the kingdoms of the kingdom are gathered in the palace, attending a variety of celebration receptions, banquets or dance parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only a rare opportunity to make friends and climb the privilege, they also want to take a look at the pure, blue, soft, like elf, Iclay Seoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the Astrophy empire, the Holy Alliance has not had a civil war for more than 20 years. The last time the Kingdom of Layton opened the territory was traced back to thirty years ago. Now the sacred alliance has been invaded by the high powers of the Three Kingdoms, and the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands have been swept down by the Layton Kingdom. This has really forced the old King, who has always been arrogant, to be complacent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, the old king rushed into the room of Ikerel in a whirlwind, telling her that she had defeated the Three Kingdoms in the Highlands and rescued all the elves. He finally got his wish to see the elf show his smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell walked to the old king and gently stroked his beard, but softly, proudly said: "I know Your Majesty will definitely bring the news of victory. Your Majesty, you are the hero of my dreams! I can only express my heart by giving all my love to you. The great magician Rogge once divined me. Destiny, he said, the person who has the elf Ikerel love, Wu Yun and Xun Gong will accompany his life. Your Majesty, let me give this lucky one to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At such a close distance, Ikerel’s small face perfectly expresses the exquisiteness and subtlety of the elf, and the beauty is almost suffocating. But what makes him even more ecstatic is that the countless old kings who read the people in the eyes of the elves see the clear love fire! He has supreme power, endless wealth, and countless women, but he knows how hard it is to have a sincere love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Romon announced that the entire Layton Kingdom carnival for a month! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dance tonight is no different from the previous dances. In the fireworks of the sky, the palace orchestra played a 'spring' Waltz, the whole dance has gradually entered. After a few more songs, it is close to the midnight, and it is almost time for the end of the song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of Romon has a high age, although the interest is extremely high, but the continuous night of carnival makes him gradually feel tired. Now that he is sitting on the throne, he has been sleepy, and the gold cup in his hand is also skewed, and the wine in the cup is spilling out. The maid behind the old king was so quick that he immediately took the gold cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sultry ballroom, Ikerel beside King Romon was a bit sullen, and she stood up. A maid came to help her, but the elf said, "It doesn't matter, it's so stuffy, I go out and breathe." Her elegant and delicate back disappeared into the back hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the luxurious ballroom, there are a few hot eyes that always pay attention to the elves. Shortly after she left, several figures also quietly left the ballroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This terrace of the Layton Palace is purely in terms of its size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell came alone on the terrace and looked at the southeast night sky. There is a city of gods, there are countless brothers and sisters, there are towering elves, and there is a green goose that she is used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passionate dance music fainted from the room. These dances are heard in Ikerel's ears, so straightforward, hot and vulgar. She deeply misses the famous songs of the elves, that is the real art, that is what she really likes. She is a born Sarah and has a near-fanatic love for elegance and art. Here, what is in this magnificent palace? All the people here will only stare at her with naked eyes, while desperately showing off her power, wealth, status or force. They don't know that these are not what she needs at all. She even feels bored when she hears this, and she feels sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the men Ikley has seen, it seems that only on the day that changed her destiny, God made Rogge look at her gaze completely. Some are just a strange and stern look. This gaze seems to penetrate her soul and scan all her memories and thoughts. At that moment, before the strange eyes of this cold, she seemed to be completely the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge watched her for half an hour, then nodded and told her that she could leave, and he would discuss something with the elders of Hughes. Ikerel was very scared. She found Ajani quietly that night, but Ajani didn't know Rogge's plan. She could only comfort Ikel. God made everything for adults. The future of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Elder Chess called Ikerel and personally told her that she had changed her life plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ikerel?" This eager voice belongs to the great prince Kerry of the Kingdom of Layton. "My goddess, are you waiting for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was so excited that he hugged the elf, but the elf struggled out of his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Kerry, you are always like this, you are not afraid that Romon will know you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not afraid! Ikerel, believe me! For you, I can give everything, tell me, what can I do to win your love? As long as you tell me the direction, I can do anything for you. "Things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikler is cold and fluent: "Is this the same for men? Always swear that you can give everything before you get it. Once you get it, In your eyes, it becomes totally worthless. Isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is in a hurry, he kneels in front of Ikerel and eagerly "I can prove! It's more than just talking about it for you! Ikerel, I heard that you are most brave, tell me! Is this the case?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell looked coldly at Kerry, who hated you aristocrats. They were all guys who would only talk about bravery. Only the warriors who triumphantly on the battlefield are qualified to talk about courage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is angry and rises low: "Ikrell! I will let you see if I am a person who can only talk empty talk! My father only settled the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands. I will let you see that in the hands of my Kerry, the entire Holy Alliance will become the hunting ground of the Kingdom of Leighton! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikleel said undecidedly: "Okay, I will wait, the day when you become a true warrior and king." Being able to spend a lifetime with a real king is my dream. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dance is coming to an end, and Kerry will also host the last few dances, going back to the dance hall. Ikerel has not gone, the elves A keen sense of hearing made her know that there was another person hiding behind the thick curtains.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sobbed low.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ikelel! What happened to you, isn’t Kerry bullying you? "The man hiding behind the curtains rushed over. He was very young and handsome, and his face was slightly a little childish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell was shocked. She looked at the man with a panic. Under her gaze, the young man looked cramped and his face was red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf sighed faintly The tone is the five halls, you can't help me. I am just an ordinary elf, no power to choose fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can help you! At the age of eighteen, I have already participated in the battle of the Three Kingdoms in the Pingding Highlands. I also killed four enemies with my own hands. My swordsman and military teachers praised me as the most talented of all the princes! Ikerel I know that I am still young and even childish, but I already know how to love! Yes, I fell in love with you from the first sight I saw you! Maybe I can't do anything for you now. But as long as I can do it, I will never hesitate. My embarrassment is the kingdom’s state affairs book, he will definitely help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell looked at his eyes and suddenly sighed to make sure that everything I said and you was only in my heart. Never show it in front of anyone? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pledge! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry said that when he died, he was the king of the Kingdom of Leighton. At that time, he would receive me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This bastard! "The young prince is extremely angry," I am looking for him to fight! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impulse of the young man quickly cooled down in the icy eyes of the elf.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ikrell, do you want to tell your father about this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't believe it, he likes Kerry very much." What's more, our elf has a long life, and her age is already great. After he died, if Kerry became a king, it is normal for him to receive me, isn't it? I am just an ordinary elf, I can't control my own destiny, and I don't dare to expect happiness. Therefore, my Highness, I cannot accept your love. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
