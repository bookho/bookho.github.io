			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A roundabout, gather the wings, and lightly fall on the rocky hills. Behind the hill is where she placed the giant scorpion of Gregory. The giant clam was piled up with a pile of boulder in the middle. She didn't want to take the pet that she had painstakingly received, and she was accidentally eaten by any undead creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the boulder pile in two or three times, but fortunately, the huge cockroach still lay there quietly. The gray-white, almost one-high python is now covered with fine red blood, still rhythmically beating. She gently stroked the giant python and felt the pulsation inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the giant python has already stopped pulsing. Suddenly, the giant slammed a bit, and it was a bit, then swayed violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clamshell fell and a huge claw stretched out. The paw was shrunk back again. After a short time, the whole giant cockroach suddenly burst open, and the whole body was dark green, and there was a faint blood red in the skull. The fierce bone dragon in the flow jumped out. It has three large, conical sharp corners on its head, and more than ten smaller cone angles in the middle of the three giant angles. It burns a blood red flame in its eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory's entire body is more than half longer than before, and five or six large, short, thick bones are born on the thick tail. Just leaping out of the shackles, it was extremely irritating with his claws scratching the ground, his head lowered, his burning eyes staring at the cock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to challenge me?" *** was surprised, although the Soul Contract provided enough means to clean up this disobedient pet. But now it seems that Gregory is clearly controlled by the temperament of the Hellfire War Horse, although its predecessor, the Demon Dragon, is much more advanced than the Hellfire War Horse, but this meal is a vulgar bone of weakness. For the dragon, it is still too rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** is self-defeating, the bone dragon roars and has already rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I win, I will release the contract!" Gregory sent such a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Amazed, the flames of the whole body fluctuated a bit. It seems that after the tonic, this stupid dragon has improved a lot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the big and deep mouth, *** stood still, the wings slammed open, and the left hand caught the lightning Ligaoli's nose. The bone dragon bowed his head and used the new giant angle to the left hand of the ***. The *** grabbed the giant horn and used the force twice, but it continued! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory raised his head and squatted into the sky, and then spit out a hot, hot wind, just hit her! It has another wing, flying in the air, lightning-like ***! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dragon's interest, the edge of the *** armor has melted a bit, and *** is a little surprised, this wind poisonous dragon's breath has actually increased very much The arrogance of the history seems to be the credit of the Hellfire War Horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the giant claws hit by the bone dragon, *** bends the left arm to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s claw hit her away! Her left arm was covered with cracked fine lines, and her left hand was caught hard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the strength of this body is not enough. My ability has not yet reached the point where I can take care of such a huge body." *** Imagine, she decided Re-select a new balance between physical strength, combat skills and appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Gregory, who was chasing the claws, and finally got angry! From the numerous battles of life and death in the outer world, how can you put this ignorant bone dragon in the sky! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The right hand quickly shrinks and turns into a hand bone, but the metallic luster is bright. She swayed and let the bone dragon rushed, grabbed the tail of Gregory! An irresistible force drove the bone dragon up, and after turning two ***, it slammed it into a cliff! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the bone dragon is embedded in the stone wall! It is hard to struggle to climb out, *** suddenly falling from the sky! Step on its spine and kick it into the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Pull out the bone spear on the back, do not aim, and lightningly throw the seven bone spear into the smoke on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke finally dissipated slowly. *** Quietly floating in the air, only the remaining right hand holding a bone spear, looking at Gregory coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the rebirth, Gregory has not had such a fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It spreads out on all fours and pulls the head and tail into a line. The four bone spears nailed their limbs to the ground, and the other three bone spears passed through the neck, lumbar vertebrae and tail, respectively, and nailed it there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The gaze looked coldly at Gregory’s skull, scared the bones of the bones that had just passed away, from Hellfire The violent temper has already run away without a trace. It desperately wants to plead with the information of the fortune, hate and hate that it is now nailed to the ground, and the versatile flattering can't make it out. The result of the pleasing is inevitably greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Gregory swallowed the tonic, the brain was a lot of light, knowing that this time *** moved the real anger, a bad, the one in her hand The bone spear will be inserted into your skull. It put the head tightly on the ground, and the flame in the eyes was dimmed a lot, trying to make a pitiful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** 勉 Strongly suppressed his anger, turned and flew away. The powerful bone dragon in the outer world is not uncommon, but in the first life, the predecessor is a good thing of the dragon, maybe it is only such a head. Pursuing power is her supreme instinct. Such a good combat assistant is really reluctant to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See *** turn around and go, Gregory is in a hurry, struggling to get out, even a few bones will not hesitate. It pulled the bone spears one by one, gathered them into a bundle, and hurriedly chased the ***. If you don't feel a little, this master may not necessarily pack yourself in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge bypassed a big tree in front of him, and he was open in front of him, and he had already walked out of the forest without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses pointed forward, "The atmosphere of Artest’s adult is not far ahead, maybe, on the other side of the hill. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s spirit is very good, he is very interested in this mysterious demon general Artest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elysses, this time we fled to the devil world, you said that Orpheco adults will know? If Orpheq is not in this It’s good to go out, and those who understand these courts don’t dare to come. Even if adults know that they can’t be so far apart!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lysis didn't answer, but gently stroked an unremarkable obsidian ring on her finger and sighed. After a moment, she slowly took off the ring and let it slip from the fingertips and fall into the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally here!" Rogge cheered and climbed to the top of the hill, but immediately opened his mouth and no longer heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses smiled a bit, and kissed Rogge gently, and said, "I still lost. Little Rogge, sorry, dragged. You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small magical array on the top of the hill, a scale of scales floating quietly above the magic array, a while The darkness of the atmosphere continually dissipated from the scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic array is actually hundreds of neatly arranged holy knights! Dess and Karajan are on the list! In the center of the sacred knights is a small group of bright robes of the red robe, surrounded by a faint white fluctuation, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is a seeming attraction to Rogge’s eyes. The middle-aged knight who stood in front of the queue at random, he only wore a full-length steel body, and a common knight sword was hanging in his waist. Other than that, the only eye-catching one is a red cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark red, even a purple-black cloak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has no reason to feel that the boundless killing power is hidden in the seemingly ordinary body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice began to smash: "Elysses, you are not saying...Will you meet the Devil General Artest? He...they will not be these holy knights..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karajan stepped forward and unexpectedly put away the sound of screaming. Lang said: "My dear Princess, escaped here. You should have died. In the face of the great Augustus, all the tricks are No matter what!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses stared at the middle-aged knight for a while, faintly said: "Sure enough, blood angel Augustus is an adult. If I am ready Bind, don't know if the adult can let go of Rogge? He is just an insignificant little person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yanghaha, a princess of the Princess, you are now Half of the body has been burnt, and the slightest magic is not left! If you don't bind, what can you do? Symbolic resistance? We are welcome! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses ignores Karajan’s cynicism, but only looks at Augustus.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Augustus angered and said: "Cara Yang! To shut up! Are you not enough people lost? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and gracefully stared at Elysses, and please understand the rudeness of my ignorance. Your I am afraid that the requirements are somewhat embarrassing. After all, Rogge has been established as a heresy by the church. When he arrested his other party members, there was a small storm. If he did not deal with him at all, I am afraid that this decision was made by me. If you don't obey the public, you will be detrimental to the reputation of the church. In this case, Rogge will be sentenced to life without any hard work, and I will be personally honoured and will be free for up to five years."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and glanced at Rogge, and the color of surprise flashed away, adding: "Otherwise, he can swear to the Church of Light, and by the Pope." After personally performing the christening ceremony, I have been practicing in the Great Hall of Light for more than ten years. When I expire, I will personally recommend him as the alternate Templar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysian Stoudemire nodded. "It's so good, then I am relieved. Augustus is an adult, let's go." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; At this time, the mutation suddenly students! A scimitar flickered in the air, screaming and screaming at Augustus! Dess shouted, and the Holy Cross slammed and picked the scimitar. The scimitar is like a ghost. It is unpredictable in the air. After colliding with the trenches for more than a dozen times, it finally exhausted. After colliding with the trenches, it fell unwillingly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dess was a little white and couldn’t help but step back. He snorted: "Who dares to come to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen figures jumped into the field, one of them rushed to Elysses, Luo The greet greeted him, and the figure was flexibly turned into a turn, and it flashed through Rogge and came to Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kakarafeos! How did you hurt this?" Elysses whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bloody body, a huge wound on the right side of the face, still bleeding, which made the smile on his face seem a little distorted. Rogge looked back and turned out to be Jingo! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo slammed a dark black, magical scroll decorated with three dark dragons to Elysses, hoarse and screaming: "Princess flies." Artest he betrayed us! The old minister just packed up his ambush, you are going, there are old ministers here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes for life, all sides The holy knights have already rushed up, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo’s more than ten men shouted at the same time, their muscles swollen and their body surface covered with a layer of Large needles like steel needles, two huge fangs protruding from the mouth, and huge bone spurs also extending from the back and joints. They landed on all fours, and the ends have turned into cold iron hooves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original is a useless Devil War pig family... Elysses wants to run!" Kara Yang exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Des and Kara Yang saw the situation is not good, immediately copied from the left and right, and then first arrived, instantly crossed the many holy knights, and entered these magic Among the families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dess's huge trench with a strange whistling sound, a bit of a warrior warrior stabbed a pair, the warrior still does not give up, see It was really impossible for Dess to bite on his trench! The huge fangs and the trenches rubbed, and the sound of the teeth was soothing. The green blood continued to flow from the warrior's mouth, but he still bite, and the two-inch thick trench was bitten by it. Slowly bent! Dess was anxious and angry, and he couldn’t get back to the trenches. Kara Yang met, flew over, and the sword shadow flashed, and the soldiers' limbs were cut down. Then he stabbed the sword's body with a sword and another sword. The soldier still died and died! Kara Yang shouted and smashed the warrior's head in half with a sword, and then stripped him off the war of Dess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Magic Pig Warrior resisted the fight, but the disparity between the crowds, half of the people fell in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo hurriedly said: "Princess is going! There are old ministers here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jing Ge roared and began to show the prototype of the Devil War Pig, but the body shape was more than doubled than other soldiers. The whole body was covered with a layer of lavender giant nails, and numerous bone spurs stretched out from the armor. More than ten fangs were stretched out of his mouth, and a long horn was placed on the long nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo screamed in the roar of the clouds, the giant hoof slammed down the ground and the heart of some people seemed to stop beating in an instant! A ripple on the ground swayed forward. More than a dozen sacred knights who are charging are suddenly standing up, and then the earthquake is everywhere. The holy knights are thrown into the sky for more than ten meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo then rushed into the sacred knights, and the teeth stalked, and sent a few holy knights to the west. The sacred knight's gun was stabbed on it, but most of it was bounced off with a hard piece of nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black shadow flashed toward Jing Ge, and Jianguang flashed, and broke the thick armor on Jinge’s back, leaving a deep wound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo snorted and turned around. The black shadow stopped and showed his figure. It turned out to be a tall, full-body black warrior. It had a huge dark red two-handed sword in his hand. The sword had a reddish flame and swallowed. The blood of Jingo purple is still dripping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carus! It turned out to be you! Is the traitor of Artest coming too!" Jing Ge’s angry voice was ringing like a thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior smiled slyly and paid you still need to use Artest’s personal shot? If you have me, you will be enough! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carus! What do I say is also the king of the war pig family, just because you want to fight with me? Today I want you to pay for your arrogance! Jingo Yang Tian screamed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carus sneered, "hanging a war pig! Although your fame is big, it is just a pig! If it is not too many of you, too sinister, do you want to have a place in the top five races with your fighting power? I cut you today, just to let you know that our dark magic warrior is far stronger than you guys who only know how to breed! "Well, he once again incarnates into a black fog, swings his sword and fights with Jing Ge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the battle, Elysses looked Do not look at the battlefield, pull up Luo Gedao: "Little Rogge, go with me to the devil world! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Jingo adults? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dedicated to saving me, and I will be kind to the war pigs in the future." The demon family is the lifeblood of the whole devil world. You will understand when you go to the devil world. Ready? let's go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a few fogs scattered from the scrolls of Elysses, and they quickly became three dark dragons. The dark dragons bit their mouths in the void." It seems to have bitten something, but pulls it hard in three directions. The space is like a curtain in a play, and it is opened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Look through the gap in the space, there is the devil of blood, fire and smoke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and Elysses jumped in The gap in the space, the crack disappeared behind the two.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless colors, light beating around the two, and the suction from all directions is tearing Two people's.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suffers from the space storm to tear him apart. He knows that if it is not enough, it will be transmitted to the devil. A pile of meat residue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what kind of place is the devil? Rogge is somewhat full of expectations.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy ribbon in the space suddenly concentrated in front of the two, the seven-color ribbon gradually merged into one, and gradually became a dazzling white light. Rogge heart straight jump Recently, he is very sensitive to anything milky white.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space storm in the different space seems to have settled down. Elysses looked at Augustus and his face was a little weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You actually used ‘the time and space of the orderer’? Am I so worth it?” Elysses smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand it underneath. But this is the Pope's will, and only obey it." Augustus said politely, "Now, Go back to the two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge force that tore apart the space behind the two, followed by a whirlwind of Rogge and Elysian I rolled it in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Elysses fell to the center of the battlefield. Both sides who are fighting are shocked. Jing Ge’s men were already dead and wounded. He had several long guns in his body. The nails were also peeled off by large blocks. They were being besieged by Dess, Kara Yang and the Dark Warrior Carus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge and Elysses returning here, Jinge was anxious and angry, and was negligent, and was taken by Carus. Deep into the neck! Jing Ge screamed in amazement: "Princess! Old minister... Incompetent!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glared at the proud Carus. Suddenly an almost completely transparent, looming Jinge rushed out of its body and passed through Carus's body without any hindrance. Just after passing through, the transparent giant pig mouth also smashed a similarly transparent figure, the giant pig head smashed, tearing the figure into two pieces. Then the shadow of this giant pig became lighter and thinner, and finally disappeared...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carus’ eyes were sluggish and completely lost his luster, he slowly fell Going on, I can't get up again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang laughed a few times and said to Rogge: "There are adults of Augustus who want to Play space to send this little trick? You dead fat, the last account has not been counted with you, actually dare to escape? Now you are running away?" In the long laugh, he jumped, the sword shook , stabbed to Rogge's knee. He made up his mind to ruin Rogge's limbs, lest Augustus think again to send this fat man to the Guangming Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life-saving, Rogge’s responsiveness instantly increased by one level. He reached into his underwear as if he had no time to pull out the magic wand, and he directly moved the magic in the staff against Kara Yang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s underpants were blown up and smashed, and three green balls of light were connected back and forth to meet Kara Yang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang is only scared to death, three decompositions! Still so close! He only came to pray: "Lord, bless me..." was hit by a green ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously his luck was not so good. When he reached the second ball of light, the whole person began to become transparent. The third ball of light passed through his body and flew away, almost hitting Dess who came to the rescue. Dess finally showed all his strength in this moment. He screamed, and the space around him was twisted. The ball of decomposition broke around an arc and swept his body to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he has just escaped one, and the other ball of light of the decomposition has locked him, and he is approaching. Des Yuguang glanced, watching Rogge, who was only wearing a shirt, meditating on the spell and knowing that he was preparing to perform the next decomposition. Dess once again applied space distortion and barely escaped this decomposition. However, Roger's caster is unusually fast, Dess has just slowed down, and the third green ball is already in front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel of the death of the palm of the hand is finally dead, and he has to test his luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge can’t dare to gamble with him. He stepped up the curse and prepared to make up for him if he could survive this decomposition. The last decomposition. His magic is only barely enough to cast a decomposition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still thanks to Kara Yang, if not scared by him, Rogge, who is afraid of death, will not be stimulated when he is in the war, rushing on Tenth level mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s spell was half-finished, and he felt a pain in his back, and then he was black, and he was not awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space in front of Dess fluctuated, and a long sword lingering around the hot flame suddenly extended and picked up the green ball of light in front of his eyes. Almost at the same time, a hand was extended in the space, and Karajan, who was almost completely transparent, was captured. Then the Holy Spirit poured into Kara Yang's body like a raging wave, and even the sacred hymn was heard in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kara Yang recovered and almost sat on the ground. He suddenly jumped up again and shouted: "You are a despicable pig!! I first yelled at you!" Then he took a long sword and rushed to Rogge, who was comatose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses said nothing, opened his arms and stopped in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cara Yang is almost going crazy, he screams and slaps his hand to Elysses! Light is based on his hand strength. If it is not the strength of Elysses, this is likely to interrupt her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses looked at him with certainty, Kara Yang’s hand had not arrived, and the wind had already blown her long! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a smashing lightning strikes, and Kara Yang picks up! Dess was full of anger and jumped up, catching up with Kara Yang in the air, trembled and slammed him down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Dess, you are doing very well! I was just thinking about whether to recycle this waste. Since you maintain him like this, this time Write it down for a while." Augustus is calm and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang just got up and heard the word 'recycling', scared to climb on the ground again, long look down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus turned to the elegant Princess of Elise, a courtesy of the Princess, just now, please don't mind. Let me go back with me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses pointed to Rogge and asked, "What about him?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus slightly hesitated to ask him, as we said at the beginning. His Royal Highness, the magical array is there." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses nodded and walked to the magic circle first. A breeze blew through, slightly picking up her robes, revealing a pair of bare feet like frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant sun leaps out of the clouds, plating a bloody glow on the body of Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the magical side, she paused a bit, looking into the distance for a moment, sighing, stepping into the magical array, never looking back...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus commanded the two knights to carry the stunned Rogge, and went to the magical line. When Karamay squatting on the ground, he whispered: " You have to clean up the battlefield, and you must not miss every inch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang is repeatedly called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Augustus’s disappearance in the magic circle for a long time, he dared to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycling me? You wait, this hatred me remember! "Cara Yang's face is full of grievances, but his voice is extremely low pressure, for fear of being heard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;骂归骂, Augustus He told him not to make a discount. Kara’s lonely figure walked around the hills and carefully examined every place. God knows if the blood angels deliberately threw something, so good. Did he obey his instructions?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun slowly passed over his head and began to sink to the mountains of the horizon.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang suddenly snorted and picked up an ordinary obsidian ring. He carefully observed the ring and finally recognized the scent of Elysses. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt very incomprehensible. Although he was only a nine-order angel, but after all, it was the first to come to this world in the way of coming! But I did not expect this There are so many strong space players, especially this Elysses, if not because of her, how are they? Like a squatter, the scavengers are cleaning the battlefield here? If it wasn’t for Dess’s secret help, he would almost be recycled by the Augustus adults!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking The person who likes the beautiful Elysian is Orphey Roque, and his heart is a bonfire. Since he came to the world, he has been deeply infatuated with this and fully understands the man. 'All the happiness. But this Elysses, obviously the strength of the station is not enough, but there are so many people who have been harassed, and have broken their own good things!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
