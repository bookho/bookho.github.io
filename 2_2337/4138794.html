			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duchy of Dresden is no longer the original defeat. After receiving large war reparations from Latvia and Levi, Alei temporarily solved the military problem. Now the overall situation of the Holy Alliance is initially fixed. In the future, this Grand Duchy will be used to receive the high officials of the Empire. Naturally, it should not be too shabby. Under the guidance of the elf artist, the refurbished Grand Duchy is elegant without losing the elegance of the North, and the softness of the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the afternoon sun already contains a distinct warmth, the little green will also embellish the city of the North, but Rogge’s luxurious study is completely There is no spring. On the contrary, there was a burst of chill out, which caused a layer of frost on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned and looked at the girl who was sitting in front of her eyes. There were countless girls in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl sits there like a stone without life, and only the chill that continually evaporates from her will remind others of her existence. She seems to be looking at Rogge, but her eyes are completely out of focus. If you look into it carefully, the eyes are like two windows leading to another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl wore a long white dress, and the neckline stretched out like two wings of the butterfly, revealing her round and thin shoulders and a large crystal clear chest. . It was only the strange soft luster on her skin that made her look more like a jade carving. On her bare skin, she could see more than ten criss-crossed scars and a faint cross-scratch on her cheeks. It is hard to imagine that such a beautiful and mysterious girl has suffered so many injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amy... Ai Luoluoge opened his mouth and didn't know what to say. He tried to find a topic, but no matter what he said, There is always no way for girls to react.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls are like a lifeless ice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge couldn't help but have a headache. He turned to look at an inconspicuous little man sitting in the corner of the study, the death class.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class was full of love and pity The young girl turned a blind eye to Rogge’s helpless eyes, and the slight upwards of the mouth fainted a taste of gloating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence in the room lasted another hour. Rogge couldn’t stand the endless confrontation with the girl, and finally gave a look to the death class, and escaped out of the study.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class also followed the Rogge and went out of the study.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge lowered his voice, anger Road: "You don't. In embarrass me? She is like an iceberg, what do you want me to do? What's more, you know the relationship between me and... that matter? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class sneered a sneak peek, but it is not a problem that I should worry about. If you do it, you will pull it down. As long as you ruin the contract first, I just happen to This damn task is freed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge angered: "Even without you, I will not let Nicholas kill!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class sneered: "If you don't have me, you have already died more than once. Now that you are so sure, very good, very good! Then I This is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly laughed and said gently: "Death class, you want to anger me, so I can escape from this contract." Go out? Haha, that’s a nap! Since Xiusi has promised you this condition, then I will try my best. As for you, if you want to be relaxed, let Nicholas die and say it!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrugged and said: "Who knows when Nicholas will appear? Maybe tomorrow, maybe one year, maybe ten years, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of the death class suddenly swept over Rogge’s throat, and Rogge’s face was white, and the memory of the death of the class was broken. He flashed in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger Adult!" The cold voice of the Death Class is like blowing from hell. "You know how much money I paid for the sky wrath, please kill me." ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A gold coin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughs in your eyes, I am quite valuable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The death class ignores Rogge’s ridicule to collect this gold coin in order not to set a precedent for unpaid killing, otherwise, depending on what you have done, it will not be excessive for me to kill you a few times. If not for Ai Lott, this child, and the elf who was watching the sword for you on the same day, when I will take this task, take the dragon gun... Do you really think this thing is worth my life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death of the class, if you break the contract, I am freed from this mission, maybe I will kill you again for another gold coin! Now... You are smart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was silent for a moment before he smiled and said: "Death class, as a life reaper, you are no better than me, so Don't talk to me with this arrogant attitude. As for the wrath of the sky, he was the first person to set a squad for me if he had never met. If there was no *** that night, I and Ajani would have died under your sword. But I don't blame you, you just act according to the contract, I will count these accounts on the sky wrath. I have no other advantage, this is to avenge! I am not the unnamed pawn who can be bullied in the past. No matter who bites me, I will never give up until I have the same bite. How to say it, for the time being, it is called the principle of reciprocity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class snorted and you want to scare me? If it wasn't for you to slaughter the Druid Village, how could the sky wrath adults kill you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles at the god class, do you really think that people in the city of Yunxiao are good things? The elves who thought they could be firmly controlled were forced to leave more than 10,000. I am afraid this is the real reason why they want to kill me. Moreover, the village of Druid is obviously killed by the people of the Guangming Church. Is it true that some of the crimes must be placed on my head? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class suddenly sighed old and was not interested in your struggle for power. As long as you have done what I asked, this task I I will continue to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted Rogge’s shoulder with a strange sadness: “I should also look for this task after I finish it. Retirement and retirement, oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of the dead class, Rogge couldn’t help but feel a little strange, this old and perfect killer I am at the peak of my skills and career. How do I suddenly want to retire? But no matter what, Rogge has determined that no matter how difficult it is, he must pay the rewards required by the Death Class. Even if the prevention of the elf Nicholas has not used the death class, then he can not let him resume his freedom and then go to the sky wrath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that it’s easy to meet the requirements of the Death Class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger sighed and glanced at the beautiful girl in the room who was still motionless like an ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Treating Ai Luo Luot wholeheartedly for 30 days, let her smile every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another reward for the death class except for the dragon gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement does not seem difficult, but just now Rogge tried his best and Ai Luolu did not say a word. Suddenly, Rogge would rather face Nicholas than to face the idea of ​​this ice-like girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reunion, Rogge almost could not recognize her. If the last assassination of Rogge and Rogge took possession of her body, the girl still had a trace of human body temperature, and now she seems to have completely turned into a piece of ice. In fact, Rogge couldn't connect this cold, thin, pretty girl with a little ethereal beauty to the plump, healthy, energetic Amy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a baby’s cry came faintly in the distance, and Rogge gently covered the door and walked to the cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie is lying in bed lazily and enjoying the afternoon sun. At the bedside, there was a little baby shaking the blue, and the loud crying was coming from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid took the child out and gave it to the aunt to breastfeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie looked at the child in her arms with a happy face, and did not raise her head. "All of them have been born for ten days. I have been okay for a long time. I will come back to see you in the morning. I can stay for a few days this time. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s gone at night. I’m going to finish it, you have to rest for a few more days, don’t get tired. Kids show me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie hesitated for a moment before handing the baby to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child’s big eyes turned agilely, looking very pretty and clever, with a few Clark’s handsomeness in his eyebrows. Looking at Rogge and teasing the baby, Auntie suddenly felt a little inexplicable fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, it took me a lot of hard work to have this child... Can you... stay here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;&nbsp; Rogge stunned, smiled: "Where do you want to go, this child is so cute, of course, you have to stay. Can't see it, you will be born!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently stroked the aunt’s bare, full-bodied chest and added: “The body is getting better and better!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie proudly raised his chest and smiled and said: "Since you like it so much, my body should be restored when you come back. Can we have a good one?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a little, just said: "Let's talk about it. I should go, take a rest, wait until the body is fully restored and then handle the business!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss has covered the door of the aunt’s bedroom, and he followed the roger and said: "Roger, the team has been waiting in the house. The child....you see What should I do? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked silently in front of him. After a while, he asked coldly: "Who else knows this?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss always replied cautiously: "Of course, people who know this matter have been killed by myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge nodded, faintly said: "You are doing very well. After treating this child well, it will be my own good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss is a bit strange, but still should. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has come to the study room, he opened the door that is still frosted, and a cold chill came inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is still sitting there motionless, even the posture has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed softly and said: "Ai Luo Luo, time is up, let me go!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is standing up, like sliding on the ice, going out behind Rogge...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the spring of the North At the time of the season, the city of the gods began to greet its most beautiful time. With the full energy support of the silver dragon egg, and without spending a lot of magic to keep the city warm, the beautiful elves began to think of ways to decorate the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole city of the gods is full of green, the flowers of various colors are dotted in the green, under the ancient trees of the elves, countless strange small The beast and the birds enjoy the spring sunshine leisurely. They occasionally jumped into the hands of the elves and enjoyed the gentle touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time Roger enters the city of the gods, Rogge’s mood is very relaxed and enjoyable. In this fairyland-like city, he can always put aside the idea of ​​fighting for power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time he was very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty unparalleled figure ran from a distance, and it was in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya has a long skirt, nothing to decorate, but the wizard's cut perfectly outlines her curve, whether it's her chest or flowing eye waves Every time I look at it, I will let Rogge heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin is arbitrarily placed on the head, and the bright and unparalleled face seems to be shining with a faint glow. It seems that she has been a good time during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin suddenly screamed and slammed into Rogge's arms and threw him directly to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Froya’s close-knit face, I feel the soft body in my arms, and the fat man can’t help but be confused. I almost don’t know what it’s all in front of me. It’s a fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and coughed. Ai Luolu, who has been behind Rogge, turns a blind eye to everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya climbed up as if he had, and struggled to get Rogera up, and couldn’t help but complain: "Dead fat, you are heavy again." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted twice and didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya took the lead and held his waist in one hand, staring at Hughes: "Elder Sister, have you been unwell recently? How is it so good?" The weather is still coughing up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: "His Royal Highness is more and more energetic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Froya smiled and smiled that there was only new tea and sunshine every day, and naturally happy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the word 'new tea', Hughes immediately changed his face and asked: "His Royal Highness, my tea garden..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin has nothing to say: "Your tea garden is all right, but the tea trees in the center are too slow, I may have picked it up, you better hurry. Take care of it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Xiusi changed a lot, he had no choice but to disappear between the green and the violent flash. The figure disappeared instantly.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria pulled up Rogge’s hand and said to Ai Luoluo: “Ice sister, borrow your fat man for a while, and return you for a while!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Luo Luo finally reacted, the ice wind in her eyes disappeared, replaced by a blue. Her voice has a strange hurricane Whistling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please feel free to use. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblins quietly spit out their tongues and pulled up some confused Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After a moment, Rogge and Froya have sat side by side in the canopy of an old tree of elves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no magical accomplishments at the moment Shallow, the magic of the elves and old trees brought the invisible magical wind to gently touch the body, making them feel very comfortable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Rogge opened Eyes, smiled and said: "I really didn't think there was such a good place in the city of God. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria still enjoys closing his eyes, only saying: Every day, just thinking about harming people, how can you appreciate this?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her beautiful, uncast side, Rogge is heart-warming. He tempted his hand to take a look at Froya's waist, and Froya followed the trend and leaned softly into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger looked at her pretty little nose, long eyelashes, and lips with flashing mysterious lavender sheli, screaming: Froya..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon moves the body and makes himself lie more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not hate me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fairy opened his eyes and a pair of clear It turned out to be a smile: "All the souls of your soul are fascinating, how can I hate it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was shocked, never I thought that the trick was actually dismantled on the spot by the little goblin. His face was red, and he laughed a few times. He finally said: "Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya smiled and took a shot of Rogge When I woke up, I felt something was wrong. People are lost with the paradise of the artifact. A little check will tell you what your hands and feet are. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's face is redder...you solved my soul charm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
