			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has not dreamed for a long time, with his strong mental strength, from the tenacity of the Necromancer, it is impossible to have dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment, Rogge was stunned, not knowing where he was, surrounded by gray mist, he tried to reach out and wave, mist As it is, there is a layer of slippery, wet, stucco on his hand. The surrounding light is oppressive and dim, and you can only see things within ten meters. Not far away, a dead tree stood alone, and all the branches were twisted in a strange way, very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no breath of life here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not reject the breath of death, so pure and strong death makes him feel very uncomfortable. This is where? Rogge shouted, but could not hear a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the world of death, the paradise of the undead, the ultimate purgatory of all living beings!" A cold, evil, sacred voice broke through Rogge's Mental barriers ring in the brain. "Who are you?!" Rogge yelled, and the voice never heard again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge wants to call, but there is no sound. I want to run, but I can’t move. Only fear, despair and collapse are left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A powerful suction in the distance took Roger to fly and quickly broke through the mist and went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at the weird forest, the gray-black river, the bare hills swiftly passing under the feet, and he almost jumped from the scorpion Come out. However, he still can't move, all he can do is to protect the whole body with mental strength and prevent the leakage of anger. This strange world will continue to absorb the spirit of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is also gray. The cloud is like lead, and the wind is like a knife. Repressed people want to be crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking through the cloud is an endless ash. There was a little bit of light in the gray, but I didn't know where it came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge bone bird flies in the air, really coming to Rogge. Rogge's heartstrings are getting more and more gradual, but they can't do anything. His face is distorted and his eyes are protruding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the bone bird passed through Rogge’s body, as if the fat man was a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man draws an arc, falling from the sky, going straight to a hill and going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless skeletons scattered around the hills, but one of them is standing proudly, and the dark black sickle has a cold flash, it is *** . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge fell straight, *** turned his head, as if watching Rogge. The fat man’s brain banged, and he only felt whirlwind, but he felt that he had been awake with the ***, but he still couldn’t move. Only the heroic spirit was sucked away like a tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind swayed from the *** stand up, the sacrums within a few tens of meters were swept up and fluttered around. *** The flame in the eye socket turned from pale to dark red, and a black from the top to the top, quickly dyed down. A white cockroach has been dyed dark black, and the original scar on the skeleton disappeared after the black dyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Speaking silently and screaming, the bones that have been unable to hang down behind are like spring flowers, gradually opening and raising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black smudged hand smudged the sickle, and the dyed knives began to squirm like a living creature, such as an old vine The handle is growing wildly. The large sickle knives stretched out a few sharp metal thorns. After the squirm itself squirmed, there were a few more turns, and tiny lightnings continued to smash over the knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An invisible enchantment force field stretches out from the body, extending to about ten meters. Creatures in this enchantment will continue to be affected by various negative emotions. Of course, this enchantment is useless in this paradise of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, *** looked up and looked over the side of the mountain. Rogge, whose mental power was almost absorbed, also clearly felt an ancient, evil, cold and arrogant existence there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly leaping high from the top of the hill, such as riding the wind and waves like a gliding in the air for more than ten meters before falling, not into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, Rogge is exhausted and can only see five meters. *** Mobile is extremely fast, going to the mountains and rushing away. Along the way, the *** was low and low, and occasionally a side of the body flashed a sudden dead tree, only to scare Rogge cold and sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally settled down, since the eyes can't see clearly, simply use the mental power to start searching around. The fat man's consciousness gradually sank, just fell into a quiet lake. The eyes are still five meters away, but beyond the horizon, the outlines of some objects gradually emerge from blurry to clear. Rogge was delighted in his heart, and his spirit was scattered. He could only see the range of five meters at once. The fat man rushed to collect the mind, and the objects outside the horizon emerged again. Slowly, Rogge is becoming more and more familiar with this kind of unhappiness and sadness. A spiritual force spreads like a life, and the sensed objects are also from big to small, from near to far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly Rogge’s spirit touched the energy of an evil icy cold, and the sudden savage, fierce, and desperate desire for flesh and blood almost suffocated Rogge. At the same time, *** immediately turned to look in that direction, stand, turn, and rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A zombie emerges from the fog. The zombie's body is black, but it is unusually strong, with a simple leather armor and a short sickle in each hand. Through this period of research on various undead creatures, Rogge immediately recognized that this is a zombie warrior. Zombie warriors are often formed by martial artists with high martial arts and determined will, retaining some of the fighting consciousness and skills of the pre-lifetime. Compared with the average zombies, they are not ten times as many as eight times, and five times as many as six times. A small number of zombie warriors evolved from ordinary zombies, but not as good as the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** rushed to the front of the zombie warrior, the long-handled file was lifted high and slashed. The zombie warriors doubled their shorts and tried to seal them. ***The sickle in midair suddenly added, flashed over the seal, and slashed. The zombie warrior was very agile, and although unexpected, the body was still instinctive and flashed. Although the knives of the *** smashed it, it was a bit difficult to make it tough. Only a foot that was more than a foot long and half-deep in the front chest was opened. The skin at the wound opened and only a dead gray was seen. The dry meat is very different from the wound of the ordinary zombie rot and pus. The zombie warrior's movements did not seem to have any effect on the wound, and it was still very quick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** But the veteran of the zombies, immediately applied the tactics of trial and error, began to wrap around the zombie warrior and smashed the sword, and broke through from time to time. The zombie warrior's line of defense left a wound that was only deep and not deep. The so-called ants are more than dead, and the wounds are more, and the zombie warriors can't help but slow down. It is only limited by the insufficiency of strength, and *** can only fight a long battle with zombie warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge tries again to explore this zombie warrior with spiritual power, sensing a thin layer of magical energy that fills his body. Rogge, who is familiar with low-level magic, knows that this is the effect of magical armor. I didn't expect this zombie warrior to have this kind of protective magic. This is completely inconsistent with what is contained in the collection. Rogge condensed his mind, once again increased the frequency of mental power, and sensed the energy of the previous group of ice cold in the zombie warrior. At this moment, the energy is as striking as the lighthouse in the night. In the heart of Rogge's heart, he carefully tried to wrap the energy of the group with his mental strength, and then screamed, his mental power burst, and he ordered a bunch of energy. The zombie warrior immediately stunned, and the protective armor of the magic armor faded like a tide. Then it trembled and struggled, pain, fear and even grief and impact on Rogge. At this time, the fat man's will has been firm as steel, and he is unmoved, but he is desperately crushing the energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***How ​​awkward, how can you let go of such a chance, under the screaming of death, more than a dozen black lines criss-crossed into a network. Silently drifting past the body of the zombie warrior. The zombie warrior suddenly stood still, and after a moment, he only heard a bang, broken into dozens of small pieces, scattered all over the place. The energy of the group also exploded, turning into countless bright shining eyes, and drifting around. *** 欢 雀 , , , , , , 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 欢 *** The kind of desert traveller who is satisfied and happy, just like a long drought, has enjoyed the spring and has run through the whole body. Rogge also followed up with a small tonic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a brake in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Stops enjoying with Rogge, waiting quietly. How many times of life and death have already cultivated a person with a keen instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding environment is projected one by one in Rogge’s spiritual world. The small group of dazzling golden light is the god hidden in the skull of the *** The source of energy, a circle of purple and black around the golden light, fluttering a little golden light fog makes Rogge very familiar, it seems that he is now in this group of spiritual energy fog. Since this time, the energy of *** has grown a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Same as Rogge’s mind at the moment, and the evil existence on the mountain side can only be temporarily suspended. Only a group of zombies outside here seem to be unable to cope, it seems to be slippery. Of course, the idea of ​​*** is never so complicated, but it seems that he understands Rogge’s thoughts and rushes out in the opposite direction of the group’s largest energy group. A few knives on the road solved a few low-level zombies that were crawling out of the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out of the encirclement, a zombie soldier stopped the way. *** With Rogge's technique, Rogge attacked the energy core of the zombie warrior and made it stand still. The *** is a knife, but the knife is swaying, and the zombie warrior is easily broken. The magic armor, although still unable to lick its waist, but at least cut a foot deeper. The energy group of the zombie warrior began to drift again, but the *** had no intention to absorb it, and once again cut down the two lower zombies who stopped the road and went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge clearly felt that the light blue energy group that was chased by the group was full of anger and unwillingness. But zombies are hard to compare with 骷髅, *** is not as fast as a cockroach, the most powerful zombie, (Rogge still does not know whether it is a zombie lord or a thousand-year zombie king) want to catch up with the door No. Since he escaped from trouble, Rogge concentrated all his mental power on the light blue energy of the group, and suddenly hit it, and it was like a candle in the wind and rain. Rogge himself was also uncomfortable, and he was dizzy for a while before he recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed proudly, but before he finished laughing, he saw *** rushing straight to a cliff and leaping down. The rapid fall makes fear like a anger, drowning Rogge...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!!!!!!!!!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream, Rogge turned over and sat down, sweating through the pillow. He gasped in a big mouth, and for a moment he didn't know whether the dream was true at the moment, or it was true and illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Rogge, what's wrong with you?" A pretty maid pushed the door and came in, sleepy, and half-solved. "You have a nightmare? Do you want me to accompany you?" The maid's eyebrows are all in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat quietly, thinking back to the situation in his dreams. He looked at the maid, and the purple-black mist in his eyes flashed past. The maid immediately snorted, and the two bloods in his nose ran down, softly fell to the ground, and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, hahahaha!!!" Rogge laughed wildly, and the electric light flashed through the window, reflecting his face, just like the reincarnation of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a rush, the storm poured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the canonization, Lille City issued a call for the order, and Rogge and others set off to go to the king. Anyway, at this time, there has been some initial arrangement in the territory. Everything is counted as an orbit. The iron ore of the iron ore that is shipped out may be used by half, and the rest cannot sell too much money, except for maintaining the castle. Maintenance costs, the rest are used to build roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter in the mountains is still very cold. A heavy snow a few days ago made the entire mountain look a silver. The afternoon sun shines on the slab of trees, refracting into a colorful halo, like a crystal palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a hundred dragons and beautiful mercenaries are leisurely marching on the way out of the mountains. Seven months ago, they were not defeated by the army. However, after several years of tempering between life and death, it is considered to be a veteran who has experienced many battles and killed people without blinking. Although it is difficult to change the habits, it seems that there is still some arrogance, but everyone is faintly revealing the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha relies on gold, and people rely on clothing. The mercenaries were well equipped, repaired in Sallesburg for a month, and the equipment was refurbished. Everyone added a blushing velvet cloak, and half of the bronze vest was hung on the chest. This team of mercenaries pulled out, how to see how it is like the ace of the Knights, where would you like to be a three-way miscellaneous force? The last 50 people in the queue wore simple leather armor, bowed and bowed, and followed the mercenary on foot. These people are the mountain people recalled by Rogge, and the fat man is ready to train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden death of Rogge (in fact, due to the exhaustion of mental energy) is always unable to figure out that the night is the dream is true, three days have passed, The mental strength has only recovered a little while, but the fat man has mastered the secret of spiritual shock. At this moment, the fat man is sitting in a warm carriage and enjoying the treatment of the sick number. It’s just that the rugged road always wakes up the fat man from sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day finally arrived in Lille City, the mercenaries and Kate split up and went to the military to report. As an independent cavalry brigade, Rogge and others have a small piece of their own camp in the third Knights station. Going to the military to register, receive letters, lead the army, take equipment, make team flags, and so on, a bunch of trivial things, only busy a few nobles called bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Rogge went into battle, and after another four days, an elegant fairy dragon on the flag side was leaning against a stunning bard. It was really a national fragrance, and the quality was unparalleled. It was just that Franco became more and more familiar, and finally recognized that this was the reddest girl in the city of Lille, the "bigest in the night". This team flag is a dozen, I am afraid that I will be immediately impeached by the Aristocratic Supervisory Academy. Even Orpheq does not want to protect everyone. Under the sigh of sighing, Franco, who had already been overwhelmed, had to take over the flag. Everyone laughed and laughed, a look that should have been so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is ill-conscious because of illness, not as a captain’s consciousness, hiding in the room to practice spiritual strength and magic, studying about the undead Various books of magic borrow. Most spells in Undead Magic are spells of various curses and creature summons. The Necromancer can use a magical power to simulate a soul-like energy core. The undead creatures thus formed have good combat power, but they are not expensive and can accept simple combat instructions. Another way is to collect the soul of the living and attach it to the undead. The resulting undead creatures are closely related to the soul of the living, and have certain wisdom. If it is the soul of the strong, it will be very powerful. Undead. At this point, Rogge finally understood that the energy of the mass that was felt in the dream was the soul of the undead. It is only the magic that is not derived from the soul or the soul of the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of the god that constitutes *** is the purest and powerful soul energy. ***, this is a foreign object that should not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence is reasonable. Which ancient philosopher once said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationality of existence is that only reasonable talent exists. Some people argue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even unreasonable, as long as it exists, is that reasonable? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is reasonable? What is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it is unreasonable, Laozi and *** are here too! Whoever comes nonsense, give him a knife and two paragraphs. I will let you not first. Exist, see how you are reasonable?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fat man is fighting against abstract thinking in the room, a casual soldier rushes directly into his room . Rogge recognized that this was a bodyguard knight around Kate, watching his nose and nose swollen, and I was so scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Rogge, the big thing is not good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slow down!" Rogge I sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello Kate sneaked into the 'Devil's Abyss' casino with our dozens of lion-hearted knights," said the young knight, blushing. Just under the face, the red color is not obvious. "I don't know how, the dozens of the Second Knights are also gambling there, recognizing that we are the Knights of the Lions, they came to provoke and were repaired by us. I didn't think that the grandson called more than one hundred. The number came, now Kate boss is blocked inside, he ordered me to break out to ask for help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately puts the world view of the Necromancer "Throw it aside, jumped up and shouted: "Come on! Call the brothers to copy the guys! Take the stick! Don't bring a sword! Right, don't wear a military uniform!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon and the beautiful mercenaries have been tamed and squirmed out this month, and they have heard of the fight. Rogge had just counted fifteen on the small school field, and his men and women had already finished all the collections. So the party rushed to the casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries came to the door of the casino as the knights, and saw two face-to-face sturdy men standing at the gate of the casino, only the people No one is allowed to enter. The aristocratic scums have been fighting for a long time, and they still can’t see the difference. Rogge ordered, twenty dragons and beautiful knights rushed up, ten dozens, immediately solved the guard at the door and rushed into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is very spacious, but it is a mess at the moment. Inside, black pressures a big man, afraid that there are not one hundred and sixty or seventy people. The big Han clothes are all brown blouses. At first glance, they are the undercoats of the knights. At this time, everyone was screaming around a small door on the side of the hall. There was no movement inside. Only Kate held a wooden gun and kept it at the door. At this time, a few big men rushed up, Kate sideways, let the front five rushed into the house, and stopped the door, the guns and guns point, a few times knocked down the remaining three big men. The house was also lively and quiet after a while. "Plop" a few times, the five big men were thrown out, the roots of life are a bit purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
