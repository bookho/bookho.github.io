She couldn't help it, as long as she thought of Fu Luoya, she couldn't help but tears. When was the last time I cried? She can't remember it completely. Was it still very small at that time? She didn't dare to think that when she saw Fu Luoya again, she could not be as desperate as ever. She and Froya are very clean people, if she knows about herself and Rogge.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni doesn’t dare to think again Going on. What made her heart more faint is that she finally couldn't get rid of Rogge! What happened to yourself? Don't say that Rogge did that kind of thing to himself, that is, someone who has always offended himself, nor has he ever lost his life under his sword. Is it true that Rogge can’t get it? This answer, she subconsciously avoided. Her world seems to be overturned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her world was once so perfect, so clean. She has a world-famous family, a teacher who is a sword saint, and a lover who has no one in Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, it was all perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But slowly, the changes in the world have constantly disrupted her dreams. Finally, her dreams are finally ruined by this unremarkable fat man. Inside. Because she had such a little affection for the fat man...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" Androni screamed and stunned a bird. She looked around stunnedly, so that no one in the wild, no one would see such a shameful scene, she would kill the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t realize that the smell in the forest was getting more and more strange, not only did she never see a bird or beast, but even the insects were not, quiet. It’s terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni jumped over a tree that was lying on the ground and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month, a figure stands there and is looking at her from top to bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you!" In this uninhabited forest, the sudden appearance of such a single woman is absolutely not normal. Androni felt instinctively dangerous and the heartbeat suddenly accelerated. This feeling was only seen when she faced a few people like Master Procis and Orphee Roque. She has always played the role of a hunter. This time, it feels like a weak animal staring at a hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in addition to danger, there are other things that are stimulating her nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beautiful face that can only appear in a dream, such as a mirror black, a smoke-like eyebrow, and a pair of mysterious silver eyes . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her skin is soft and imaginative, it seems that the wind is a little bigger and will be blown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked down again and saw her hands clasped in her chest sleeves. This chest does not seem to be particularly big. Somehow, Androni was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, it looks like it should be like me..." Androni was missing. She suddenly woke up and couldn't help but flush her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androgny's line of sight is once again down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a pair of white and bare barefoot under her gray robe. However, her toes are about a foot away from the ground...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s heart sinks immediately. Being able to float in the air without any support, except for a few magicians, as a warrior, only those who have stepped into the sanctuary can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you say that this beautiful and heart-wrenching girl is already in the forest of the world? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is watching ***, *** is also carefully watching Androni. Her silvery eyes are as penetrating. When she sees it, Androni feels uncomfortable, as if there is no clothes at all. Androni didn’t understand why she was a little cringe in front of this delicate and indescribable girl! Isn’t it true that you are not afraid of it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two beautiful women have watched each other for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The little mouth is slightly: "You are....Ander....Ronnie?" Her voice came like nine days, but the tone was Very oyster, just as I just learned to speak. In fact, this is the first time that *** has spoken in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni asked coldly: "Who am I? You can't control it. You are here to stop me, what do you want to do?" She subconsciously took out the stars. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s giant suddenly came out from behind the *** and looked at Androni with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge bone dragon that suddenly appeared shocked Androni. In fact, Gregory has been standing behind the ***, *** that petite body can never stop the huge bone dragon more than three meters high. Just as soon as I met, Androni’s attention was completely attracted to ***, so that she turned a blind eye to Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly felt that the skull dragon was familiar, but could never remember where he had seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not allowed her to think carefully, the words of *** made Androni furious: "Let your sword down, in front of me, resistance is Useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni almost fainted, from childhood to age, no one dared to talk to her like this! Even if it is far better than her Orphee, she has at least maintained some superficial politeness and corresponding respect for her strength. She thought that *** was also a person who stepped into the sanctuary, but after reading the bone dragon, he let go of his heart. The strong 6 and the undead are the strongest but not the three or five, and all are old magicians, not a woman. In this way, this *** may have used magical props, even artifacts to achieve the effect of floating, in order to scare yourself. And since *** is mixed with the bone dragon, although it does not look like an undead, but at least it is also a dark attribute, just by the sacred attributes of Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, Androni smiled confidently and let me put down the sword is a very easy thing to see your skills. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly mentioned the blue sky, one white and one blue and two flames slowly ignited on the sword. In the little stardust, there was a strong sacred The breath dissipated. Although she was angry and arrogant, her heart couldn’t help her, and she was still afraid of hurting her. The sacred breath that was deliberately released was to let *** know that her dual attributes were vindictive. Let her know how difficult it is to retreat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni faintly and smacked the idea of ​​***. She must first defeat this little woman, and then live and catch A little bit of convincing her, and finally let her completely become her own captive. In that year, Froya fell into the hands of Androni...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *** A faint smile, the small hand was caught in the air, and there was a ripple in the void. A huge slashing knife appeared in the little white hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Androni was shocked, widened his eyes, and looked at the huge sickle in his hands in surprise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is A knife that is taller than ***! She can't believe it. This girl like a dream is so powerful weapon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ***Five fingers like Lan Lan, the huge death sickle is like a life, hovering in her hand!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She holds again, death The sickle stopped, as if it had never been moved since ancient times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition between this movement and quiet makes Androni’s head slightly Halo.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she distracted, *** has disappeared!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Androni only felt that there was a burst of coolness behind her neck. She hurried forward, and the starry sky appeared incredibly behind her neck, blocking the sickle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;***The left hand holds the squat, the figure is flying, the huge death sickle can't live in the air with a sharp whistling, and Androni is embarrassed. Androni has a hard time, she wants to change Body shape, always have a little bit , or at least to change the vindictiveness, but all the actions of *** are completely unrestricted, and they must be moved immediately, and they want to stop and stop. The sorcerer’s knives are even more sinister, and when they are hidden, they are always in Andro. Ni’s unexpected angle appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni has no way to wait for him to die. She bit her lower lip and look for a chance to change her sword with ***. She managed to seize an opportunity, regardless of the death of the sickle, a sword reversed. But now it is actually using the right hand of Bai Shengsheng to block! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni bit his teeth, pressed down the heart and couldn’t bear it, and the stars fell under the stars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***After grasping the blue sky...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She actually grabbed the artifact with bare hands Starry sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of blue, white, and silver flames blew up on the blue sky, and the huge energy shock finally separated Androni from the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Look at your right hand, it’s already black. She finally looked up and looked at Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a good sword." *** is more and more fluent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of milky white flames ignited in her palm, burning the black burnt, and the right hand of *** was restored to white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s pupils are shrinking, this is the holy flame! Why can a girl who is with the bone dragon and use the slashing knife to use the holy flame! ? What's more, holding the artifact in the bare-handed starry sky, it was just a blackened piece, and it was restored immediately? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni can't believe his eyes! What is the use of her hand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very strong, I want to use '妖莲淡说.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countless black A leaf appeared in the body around the body, and formed a very delicate and extremely complex body black on her body. It was hidden in the helmet. A dozen pieces of the piece like a lotus petal were from the 'demon lotus'. Extending out, dozens of almost transparent ribbons danced, and the ink-colored wings slowly unfolded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endless pressure from self-dressing This pressure is as real as it is, and there is a small electric light that can't stop flashing in the space around the ***. This kind of oppression, only in the face of Prossis or Orphey, Androni feels She wants to escape. In the face of the people who stepped into the sanctuary, escape is the only wise choice. Although she is only half a step away from the sanctuary However, the strength of *** is far beyond the realm of those who have just stepped into the sanctuary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory! ***Cry and scream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fierce hurricane from the back to Androni, is the bone dragon! Androni Once again, I am confident that I will not use my back to bear the dragon's dragon's breath! She suddenly turned and resisted the dragon's breath from Gregory!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How do I forget the bone dragon? "Not yet waiting for her to repent, the back of the neck is slightly numb, and then the powerless paralysis suddenly spread to her body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the Sanctuary Less is already awkward, but actually sneak attack?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is unable to fall down. She is unwilling, even if she must lose, but It shouldn't be this kind of loss! Why is *** not willing to beat her upright? It doesn't take much time!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden, she has A grievance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not satisfied? ***Retracted his right hand and a drop of Androni's blood on his fingertips.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blush, on her white fingers It’s so fascinating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I have the 'Demon Lotus', you are not my opponent. However, if you don't let Gregory give you something, I have to work hard to catch you. How good now! Easy and easy. "*** put Androni in his arms, for the first time showed a faint smile. Her angelic smile is so evil and fear in Androni's eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since I lost, you want to kill and kill, but don't insult me!" "Androni is looking at the frost.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** stroking Androni's face in detail, her brow nose, red lips, have not let go, the atmosphere in the forest suddenly became very strange and...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;旖旎.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s beautiful big eyes are full of panic, she is so shocked that she can’t tell Words come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The cold little hand stroked her neck, and even went into her neckline! The hand did not hesitate, holding her chest standing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you doing? Her questioning sounded like begging for mercy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Still smiling like an angel, but began to solve Androni’s clothes. Droni’s upper body was already complete. *** With both hands over, Androni only felt sour and numb, unable to tell the uncomfortable feeling, and there was a flame in the chest that slowly ignited.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Unlocked Androni’s blouse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s brain is in chaos, already Completely shocked by this change of Mo Ming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please... Don't do this... your hand! Don't..." She pleaded as a nightmare.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the blue pants were released, Androni finally lay completely In the forest, she closed her eyes and pleaded helplessly, interspersed with cockroaches.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***No hesitation at all, a pair of cold little hands Go in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears finally flowed out of Androni’s eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know How long...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, *** raised Androni. Two pieces of her face were faint and fascinating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Unplugged a small piece of nails that was inserted behind her neck. Androni barely stood up, one shook, and almost fell. Lived in Androni.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was ashamed and angry, pushed away the ***, picked up his clothes and blocked his body. She is thinking about it, but she is weak, how to do it? In this case, how can she do it and ask her? Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** turned and floated, and fell on the back of the bone dragon, and wanted to leave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Androni bit his lower lip and cried, "What the hell are you!" Telling you will never forget it! Wait! Don't you dare to leave a name? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Looking back and smiling, the whole forest seems to be a lot brighter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"* **. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gaze of Androni, *** and Gregorian entered the void.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Androni was awakened a little. She always felt that she had just made a strange dream, just scattered clothes and all-powerless body told her that all this is true. It’s really born.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! You are so deep! Too mysterious! Can you tell me what you have done? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's all for your stupid dragon! I took off the ready-made keel altar and made you the new body. Now your body is strong enough, but the breath is still poisonous. You said, what do I want from you? On the beat, the flame bones are much better than you. The starry air of Androni is very cloudy and very suitable for you. I have checked her whole body carefully and have some understanding of how much the stars are fighting. When we go back, we will transform your body. In the future, your breath will bring some starry and vindictive attributes. Although it is much worse than Androni, it is always better than your wind. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! You are so kind! Too great! But the master, things obviously are more than just what you said! You must have a lot of things to tell me! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is another reason, that is, in that world, Androni may be one of the most beautiful women. Of course, I have to take a closer look at her body proportion and temperament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! You didn't say anything! There is definitely nothing to tell me! Although the woman is very beautiful, but the owner is no worse than her! There must be a reason! You What are you doing so beautifully? How much power have you lost for your present body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, our steps will not be limited to this In the world. Sooner or early, we are going to the world. There, beauty, sometimes it will be the most powerful weapon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! You are too great, too far-sighted! However, you still have something to look at me! I have already guessed it!" The bone dragon screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory! You shut me up! Believe it or not, I broke you into a bone!" The voice of *** suddenly rose eight degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ‘green sea’ is a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the two factions in the elders’ home, it’s a quarrel. Even the 13th rituals of the Great Elves are no longer consistent. Slowly, more and more elves are in favor of staying behind. After all, living on this land for thousands of years, suddenly giving up everything to face a completely unknown future, it requires great courage. The elves love faith, but they are not honored by the gods, especially the gods and scriptures passed down by the prophets and gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the road to return, I don’t know how many elves’ blood will be sprinkled. In the Wanli migration, I do not know that there will be several elves in the first place to reach the last holy place. Only by the gods of the millennium ago, it is necessary for the elves to take such a big risk, that is, to believe in the most pious elves, and to hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rogge’s explanation of the mystery is vague, which gives the elves who advocate staying behind a lot of room. Who said that glory can't be achieved in the Green Sea? Who can say that the Green Sea will not become a holy place? Of course, Rogge did not know where the Holy Land was, and this interpretation of the elves could not be refuted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also does not want to explain. With hundreds of thousands of different spirits on the road, he really showed his ability. It is best to lie to a few thousand and ten thousand. And the less the number of elves who are willing to go on their own, the more they worship the gods blindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not need wise followers, he only needs blind believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freid is right, water can carry a boat, and it can overturn the boat. Not to mention the 100,000 elves, even if the anger of 10,000, a thousand, or even a hundred elves, Rogge did not afford it. When things got so big, Rogge was already a little scared. He is like stepping on a wire, and if he doesn't know which step is careless, he will fall into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, the unprecedented debate in the Elves turned to a reinterpretation of the gods. There are three sacrifices in the Great God Temple standing firmly on the side of Rogge, but the other ten sacrifices are advocated to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing is that after Androni left, the people on the Frey side also hurriedly left the Green Sea. Although Rogge is almost certain, Androni's sudden change is the ghost of Druids, but when he is not revenge, he does not have that strength. But in his heart, he has already given a heavy note to the North Druid League. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the heart of the fat man, after being bitten by a bite, you must bite back a bit, even if this bite is bitten after ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Rogge was surrounded by several elder elders, looking at the majestic Elf Temple and the Presbyterian Church in the afterglow of the setting sun. He has announced that, regardless of the outcome of the debate, he will lead the followers who are willing to follow the true gods and set foot on the journey to find the Holy Land. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the Sala and the seven-color deer tribes, there is also the ‘Changshengshu’ tribe that is good at architecture and the ‘Dark Moon’ tribe that is rich in guardian warriors is determined to follow Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last three days were to wait for the 12 Dark Elf Warriors scattered around the ‘ Dark Moon’ tribe to return to the Green Sea. The entire elf family, who received the title of the guardian warrior, has more than one hundred. The ‘dark moon’ with only 5,000 people has 12 guardian warriors. It can be said that it is powerful. Among the twelve guardian warriors, two are the Guardians of the Elves, and the Elfs in the Central Mountains have only a total of eleven Guardians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of the Green Sea City is crowded with elves, and the elders of all the elders and the sacrifices of the Great Temple of the Elves are sent out of the city. Although they have split in each other's beliefs, the elves have been rich in water for thousands of years, and their mutual feelings are still profound. The expedition means that the life of the elves of the Central Mountain in the millennium has come to an end. Whether it is going out or staying behind, the future fate is full of unknowns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, in the elders and temples, I couldn’t wait to argue for the enemy of your life and death. At this moment, I kept talking about each other’s blessings. This has some of the scope of Rogge's understanding. According to the idea of ​​the fat habit, since you have dismantled my desk so much, I am not worthy of the two knives behind you. After Androni left, many of Rogge's plots could not be displayed, and it was so long that it had been kept for so long, or else there might be several elder elders returning to Hilo's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not you choose to follow, Rogge’s natural and sacred status is that all elves must respect. The elders and the priests came to Rogge one by one, which made him tired and half dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a riot in the forest, more than a dozen elf knights rushed out of the woods and rushed to the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the guardian warriors! They are coming back!" said the Elders of the Dark Moon tribe, told Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the dozen or so knights who are far away, there is a white flash. In the heart of Rogge, he looked at it, it was a huge white tiger! The knight on the white tiger wore a gorgeous green body armor, carrying a huge dark green wheel saw, and a beautiful full-faced helmet blocked the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it be so clever? Rogge jumped up in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves guard the warriors rushed to the hills, their mounts were different, and the weapon armor was unique. They jumped into the mount and came to the elders of Juss and Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall elf knight took off his helmet and said: "The Elf Sanctuary, the Darkmooner, Rumsfeld, specializes in following God. Adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Tiger Knight was hesitant after seeing Rogge, but she took off her helmet and looked down at Rogge with her head down. With a hint of excitement: "The Elf Sanctuary Guardian Darkmoons, the wind butterfly, especially to follow God to make adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is a big difference, wind The butterfly's stunning posture is enough to make him suffocate. This pair of shameful looks, the lethality is full! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...this..." Rogge didn't win, and Androni's gloom left, and it was diluted a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is still so beautiful, it is the beauty of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the fat man has experienced a lot in the past six months, and his strength is good. At the moment, all the skills were spelled out, and the heart of his erotic color was forcibly suppressed. A sacred look was made, and the two elite warriors of the elves were helped. There are naturally different kinds of treatments, all of which are armrests. The power of Furamsfield is strong and the wind is strong and considerate. Rogge holds her delicate wrists, a finger gently, if any Nothing swiped on her skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s so fascinating teasing is obviously out of the wind, and she’s tight, but she doesn’t make a sound, and Roger lifts her up. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Xiusi looked at them and thought about what they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve guardian warriors have seen the gods and then returned to the Darkmoon tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the fat man left and right, Xiusi coughs to make an adult, your safety is related to the fate of all the elves following you! According to the classification of the Terran, your magic is only tenth in the eleventh level? Congratulations to God for making adults, so short work, you have a breakthrough! Of course, according to the old man, your strength is far more than an eleventh-level magician. Perhaps, your strength should have the level of a 14th-level magician, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s heart, this Hughes’ eyes are so hot! I’ve almost seen myself!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is only 11 levels of magic, but the high magic control allows him to release nearly twice as much magic as the same level of magician. Recently, the magic of Elysses The power of inflammation is far from the general magic. Although he is too far away from the changes of Elysses, he can drive the magic with a huge spiritual power, without having to recite the spell or use the stroke. This is enough. Grab most of the 13th-level magicians through a decisive battle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge thought proudly, if it is *** obedient, it is the little goblin of Froya, isn't that the hand coming? Of course, after the arrival, the fat man naturally has a lot of programs waiting for the little goblin...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man will be relieved, want to let *** obey, This difficulty is not much lower than the one who singled out the top ten mages and won the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this Hughes seen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Hughes are full of wisdom. He seems to have guessed Rogge’s mind and smiled and said: “God made the adults, and before they became elders, they used to It is a 16-level undercurrent killer. This is a must-have for watching people. Adults, for your safety, you want to use these twelve elf guardian warriors as your special guard. Among the two sacred guardians Rumsfeld is loyal and suitable for your guard collar. Wind butterfly, this child is my grown up, very careful, martial arts is outstanding, just do your personal guard, what do you mean?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suggestion is so close to the extreme, how can Rogge not agree? It’s not easy to resist it without laughing. But a fat face has already blossomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this elder Sister has nothing to do with himself. Suddenly he has sent such a big man, and he must have a picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s face was slightly moved, and the elders of Xiusi guessed his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes adults, you don't have to doubt the old age. You really have a relationship with the rise and fall of the elves. The old life is almost five hundred years old, and it has not lived for a few years. In the past five hundred years, the elves have not been strong, but they have continued to decline. Over the years, the old elders have seen that there has been no change in our elves. The tradition has been believed to be supreme. In fact, our hearts are burning! We believe in it. Tradition, but the tradition has not brought prosperity to the elves. But if we want to change, we will not know how to change in the forest for thousands of years. The old man finally understands that by our elves themselves, we are unable to get rid of the fate of decline. Hilo should also be aware of this and will lower the gods and call on all the elves to return to the Holy Land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what is the power that hinders the transformation of the elves? Where do you come from? As an elder, you should at least dominate the fate of the Darkmoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most devout place of faith, the most traditional Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean the Great Temple of the Elves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes the adults really smart ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Xius, can you at least make some changes in the Darkmoon tribe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes the adult, I am five hundred years old, the eldest person in the Darkmoon tribe. But in my life, I have never stepped out of the Central Mountain. I can only inherit the foundation of the art. Some improvements have been made. However, what the elves need now is not a drastic improvement, but a reflection on the meaning and manner of the existence of the entire elf. Thoughts have always been firmly in the hands of the sacrificial people. Even if I am The reforms carried out in the Darkmoons, the Great Gods Temple can also be judged in the name of faith and prevented. In fact, the sacrifices of the temple have prevented several changes in the Darkmoon tribe. If they are not afraid of darkness The power of the moon esoteric martial arts, I am afraid that the dark moon family has been removed from the five elders in the elders."<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Shusi, although I am a god, but you have seen it, I have not ordered the authority of the elves to sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults, in the age of settlement, the sacrifices of the sacrifices, although not much benefit to the elves, can at least be harmless. But in the process of migration, these proud sacrifices are limited. The knowledge clearly cannot cope with the endless challenges and changes. The good play between you and the sacrifice is just beginning. Slowly, you will establish authority. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Shusi, your thoughts are awkward to the temple!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the name of God, bringing God's people into the abyss of destruction, this is the real embarrassment." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened quietly. This wise elder elder gave him too much shock. But what shocked him was still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
