			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than 400 years of history, the capital of Richelieu has always been the largest city and the most beautiful city in the Asrofic Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide Analess River passes through the city. This river, which is likened to the 'emperor's blue pearl necklace', and her dozens of rivers will make Lissé's makeup unique. Richelieu is a city on the water. The city is divided into hundreds of small islands, magnificent palaces, thousands of sculptures, countless bridges and unique bridges. Stay unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bard who said, "Reading the poems of Richelieu seven times is not as good as seeing the city with your own eyes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has spent a full seven days visiting Richelieu and can only rush into the most famous scenery. The remote alleys that record the true historical customs of Richelieu have not yet had time to delve into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eighth day, Feuerbach’s emperor triumphantly returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the ceremony of the Great Emperor returned to the capital was unusually grand. However, those who know the inside story understand that the record of the Emperor’s expedition to the dark forest can be described as horrible. At the beginning of the 200,000-strong army, only 110,000 returned to the Imperial Capital. At such a painful price, the empire failed to establish a permanent stronghold in the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the defeat of Feuerbach, and it is the fiasco of the city of clouds. In stark contrast, the sacred sect of silver and the fascinating and deteriorating ‘Poseidon’ corps have been screaming for years, and almost succumbed to the Holy Alliance. The brilliant record of Pompey and Alexander and Frederick and the Emperor was once again remembered and relished. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Rogge and Layton’s Kerry’s sale of the Holy Alliance is to the Astrafik who admires the martial arts. No one Interested in asking more about the two empire upstarts. Those who truly know the insider do not mention the truth of the war. Except for a very small number of people in the entire empire, no one knows the key role Rogge played in the empire's acceptance of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat word of the fat man is not very good. There are even many rumors about Rogge inside the silver saints. Most of them are about the fat man, the magical one, the beautiful and imaginative two female guards. When talking about these rumors, most of the men are jealous and jealous, while women are hateful and jealous. The rest of the rumors are about the general performance of Roger in the Battle of Montreal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For seven days, Rogge also heard some rumors, he naturally knows the source of these rumors, must come from the mouth of the four ice magicians. But the fat man doesn't care. This is exactly what he wants. Anyway, this is a crisis, the unfamiliar emperor of Richelieu. It is better to be despised than to be valued. As for Fu Luoya and Feng Die, now they will cover their face in any occasion. No matter which dynasty, sitting on the best of the best is often the way to trouble. Although Rogge has already had the right to sway, but the foundation is too shallow, it is better to be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ninth night, Feuerbach’s Emperor secretly summoned Rogge. This made Rogge somewhat surprised, and the Emperor’s unusual concern for him was not a blessing or a curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the call is in the small restaurant of the Great. In the Imperial Palace, this can indeed be said to be the hall, but the area of ​​500 square meters is still larger than the banquet halls of many wealthy people. The vault of up to six meters is fascinating and far-reaching under the shadow of a huge magic lamp. The 10-meter-long dining table is in this hall, like an island in a huge lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest hobby of Feuerbach is conquest, so the decorations used to decorate the restaurant are some armor swords or powerful Warcraft specimens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great tastes the grilled taste, and the main dish tonight is a calf that has been roasted all day. In addition to hiding nearly a hundred years of spirits and precious caviar, there is no special dish. This contrasts with the luxurious life of the Southern royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great is tall and taller than Rogge. His head has been slightly grayed out and his body has begun to bless. Although the thick beard is majestic, it always makes people feel that it is far from the iron-clad emperor who has fought for 30 years and has a far-reaching reputation. The gift that was given to Feuerbach the Great for many years was a half-legged right leg. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great greeted Rogge and retired the waiter, leaving only the weak, one-step-three boss to serve behind. He slashed a large piece of roast beef, swallowed a few mouthfuls, and then drank the spirits in the cup, and took a sigh of relief for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Emperor Feuerbach came up, he spoke harshly and immediately scared Rogge, and a piece of beef was stuck in his throat. When the fat man was in a hurry, he also drank the spirits in the cup and finally rushed the beef down. It’s just that the spirits of the centuries-old spirits are too strong, and the fat face is red and purple. Rogge squeaked in his head, only to secretly gather spiritual strength, which slowly restored the Qingming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when he promotes his mental strength, it seems to be a faint resounding resonance from the old manager. The fat man’s heart glimpsed, but it was just when the dizziness rose, the line felt too weak, and he was not sure if he was too suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge’s embarrassment, Feuerbach’s emperor laughed and said, “We’re a North Korean warrior who can’t drink, can’t dare to drink It’s important! Good, you are a good boy!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man doesn’t know how to answer it, he just has to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kid, you have done a beautiful job in Montreal this time, a live-mouth is not left, even the administrator has been killed by you, sullen, crisp and neat Wrong! Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man doesn't know how to answer, it is still unassuming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and I were very similar when I was young. They are daring and dare to do it. If you look at it, you will do it! I heard that you are very early." I used to live with the city of Yunxiao. I killed a lot of them in Montreal this time. It seems that you are completely on my eldest son?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly came out with a cold sweat. It is not a big deal in the eyes of the emperor to pull up and gang up in the court, but it is always the first taboo in any dynasty if it involves the emperor's family affairs and tries to influence the inheritance of the emperor. Pompey has a lot of military strength and a deep foundation. Rockefeller is a great magician and has a good position. Feuerbach may have scruples about them, but he will never be afraid of the fat-minded person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge’s cold sweat, the emperor haha ​​smiled for years. The church, Pompey, and the city of Yunxiao are more and more powerful. If you want to be in the empire Mix well, if you don't stand on the side of the Faith, you have to stand on the side of Druid. You can have a lot of people and strength in your hand. If you don't stand on both sides, they will get you down first. Kid, you don't need to be afraid, we are not as shameless as the Southerners! Among the empire, the first is loyalty, and the second is true. You are good at it, it is not easy for others to pull you down. As long as you are always loyal to the empire, you will have the same! But if you have any other thoughts..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Feuerbach have a glimpse of the eye, and the cold and cold eyes almost freeze Rogge in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great stuffed a large piece of meat into his mouth, slightly ambiguous: "The kid, the Holy and the Druids are fighting more and more." Great, do you know why I let go? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog immediately asked along the meaning of the Emperor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Empire Prairie The most powerful creature is the Fenrill Devil. The female wolf will give birth to a dozen wolves every time. After a few days, the wolves can start fighting each other when they open their eyes. Only two or three of the most powerful wolves can survive. Each of the growing wolves is the most powerful of the brothers and sisters, and because of this, the Finlay Devil is always the most powerful Warcraft on the prairie. In fact, since the day of the founding of the Empire, the infighting has never stopped, but the empire is stronger every day, and the territory is becoming more and more vast! The cowards of the South will only kill the heroes and kill the heroes. How can we be the North Warriors who have the entire prairie in our chest? One day the Empire opened the passage to the South, or won the sea to the sea. We will definitely Let those southerners who only know how to enjoy themselves know the power of the North Warriors! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge felt the light of the rough man for the first time. If there is no confidence to control everything, how dare to let the people fight Regardless of the inside, the Asrofic Empire has never stopped fighting for centuries. In the brutal competition that has a bearing on life and death, there is absolutely no room for the mediocrity to survive. In fact, any empire in the empire Almost the characters may become targets of hostile factions. For example, hundreds of Druids who died in Montreal are victims of such internal struggles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It can be seen that there are no incompetent people among the dozens of emperors of the empire for hundreds of years. This is almost unimaginable in the southern dynasty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the boss whispered something in the ear of the Great, and the Emperor suddenly said: I almost forgot the business tonight. You kid is very good, I like it very much. The title of this prince is right to be your reward. Come, let me see how your luck with this kid can get my daughter. By the way, Barr, how many daughters do I have? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss thought for a moment and said slowly: "Your brave man, you have a total of forty-six princesses, twenty-two who have not married." There are eleven of them over the age of fourteen. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach waved his hand impatiently, but you are ten years older than me. How have you become more and more sensational in the past few years? Take things up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CEO has slowly withdrawn from the small restaurant. Rogge couldn't help but wonder, and I don't know what this ‘thing’ has to do with the emperor's daughter. Since the Great opened his mouth, the Prince has not been able to run. This is a lot easier than I thought. It’s just that the fat man knows that the city of Yunxiao will never let go of his own. The smoother it is now, the more successful Druid will be in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, the boss took a gold medal and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach took the golden plaque and shook a few shakes, pulling a crisp sound inside. This sound sounds similar to the dominoes commonly used in Rogge's gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stunned Rogge, Feuerbach discovered a jade card from the golden plaque, took a look and asked the boss: " Marika Barr, how about this child, I can't think of it anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss is slow to say: "Let’s wait, the veteran Go and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great turned and smiled at Rogge: "Kid, my daughter can only bring you a prince’s title, except Besides, you don't expect to get any benefit from her. On the contrary, you will have a lot of trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach has a big shot On the shoulder of Rogge, he said: "If you marry a princess, you may not be a prince. Otherwise, the empire has been passed down for centuries, and now the prince has already been a thousand. But the prince’s title is following the blood of the imperial family. Before coming to Richelieu, Pompey must have told you about the importance of the Prince. You can be cautious about this kid, don't let people kill and kill your prince's position. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Rogge was confused, just nodded his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the boss has returned, he took a large portrait in his hand and handed it to Princess Feuer Hallika, who was born to Princess Fasley. The matriarch is from the Boguna family and is a small tribe in the northeastern part of the empire. The princess is seventeen years old and currently lives in Maple Leaf Palace. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felbach looked at the portrait and laughed happily: "You are not bad luck!" But this child looks like a temper, you can do it yourself! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog took over the portrait thrown by the Emperor, just looked at it casually. Anyway, this princess is only a prince’s title, she even Beauty is better than the ones around him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portrait is a tall, beautiful woman with a thick black long shawl on her shoulders. The smile is wild and pungent. The long skirt on her body is very tempting, revealing a large piece of skin on the chest, waist and thigh. Rogge rough estimates that she may be almost as high as Androni, that is, better than him. Going high in the first half. The princess's body-building is really good, but it looks like a bad tame character.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is secretly alert, he decided to go back Immediately afterwards, all the laws and customs of the empire were clarified. From the portrait point of view, Marika is a beautiful and beautiful woman. But Rogge is convinced that he will not have good luck in Richelieu. Say, there will be no gods to care for him. The supreme god does not throw a trial The light is given to him, the only possible reason is that the fat man is not a climate, and he can't enter the eyes of the gods in the sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When coming out of the Imperial Palace, the boss Let Rogge go to the Maple Leaf Palace tomorrow, he will arrange for Marika and Rogge to see one side. Finally, the farewell, the boss always said with a deep meaning: "Your Majesty appreciates you, you have to be self-sufficient. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back, Rogge repeatedly thought about the meaning of the last sentence of the boss, but he was puzzled. In fact, throughout the night, Rogge said But the words are only fifty words, and the Emperor is alone. It is the first time in Rogge because of the silence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way to the Maple Leaf Palace, whether it is guarding or living here, the nephews and princesses, the attitude of Rogge and his party are very respectful. Of course, this respect is not directed at the fat man, but to the boss. The emperor has been fighting all the year round. The nephew who lives in this remote and deep palace wants to serve the emperor one night before the old age, and it must be arranged by the boss. If they are lucky enough to have a son, they will immediately step forward. If you have a princess, you can count on your daughter to marry a high-powered person in the future. Although the emperor has nearly a hundred children, there are hundreds of nephews in the deep palace. Most of them are still without children. It is the meaning of the boss for them. It is like the supreme god in its son. Like the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that his reputation in the capital is not good. What surprised him is that there are still a few young girls who often indicate to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very clever waiter in the Imperial Palace followed Rogge and whispered to introduce the characters of the road. These girls are all princesses who have not yet married. According to the law of the Empire, only the Marquis is eligible to marry the Imperial Princess. However, in the Astrophy empire, which is patriarchal and arrogant, in addition to the family of the family, only those who have established sufficient military skills can qualify as the Marquis. For these people, it is not good to go back to a princess. The trouble is quite a lot. It is not as good as the political marriage between several big families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the aristocrats of the same title, the difference in power and wealth is often a far cry. Like Rogge, who has a country and a heavy hand, there are not many people in the entire empire. Although the northern national customs are simple, in the eyes of most people, the actual interests of the body must also overwhelm things like word of mouth, likes and dislikes. For those princesses who do not care, the mother family has no power, being able to marry Rogge is undoubtedly a step into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between moments, Rogge and his party came to a quiet courtyard. The courtyard is small, but elegantly furnished, but not luxurious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter whispered: "Maryika is very beautiful. She likes poetry, art and freedom very much. As you can see, her mother's family is not very prominent. It is only a small tribe of the empire of the Far East. The princess has frequent exchanges with the artists of Richelieu and is a frequent visitor to the art salon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tall, handsome, elegant man walked out, and a woman full of wild beauty sent him out. The man smiled back and said, "I have had a nice afternoon with the beautiful Princess Maryka. At the salon next week, I have a new poem. I hope that you will be there at that time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika smiled and said, "I will definitely go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter of the sensation whispered: "This is Baron Relo. In the past year, he has been the most famous poet and composer of the emperor. The one next to him is Princess Marika."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Relo also saw Rogge and his party. His eyes swept over the crowd, and he snorted and went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at Relo’s back with his hand on his back and his brow was slightly wrinkled. The waiter observed the words and sighed in the air: "These people who have been art-savvy have always been so arrogant! In the family of Relo, there is not even one count..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Malika saw the boss, greet the big one, how come you are here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss has a constant slow-talking voice: "According to the command of the next, today is the day when Rogge and His Royal Highness meet." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika's thick eyebrows wrinkled up and I didn't get notice! Why do you want to see what Rogge adults?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a sudden exclamation in the hospital. "Is this not Bar Daren? God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One The middle-aged lady ran all the way. She is as eye-catching as Vilka, but it is much more gentle and feminine. Although she is old, her charm is still beautiful, and she must be more charming when she is young. She took Mary Carla behind her and smiled at the boss: "Bal Daren, Malika is not polite, you should never remember it! How come you suddenly come, do you want to summon me?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Princess Fesley, His Majesty has appointed a marriage for Princess Marika."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..." Marika couldn't help but scream. "Do you have to ask me what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fesley immediately turned back and said: "Malika, you shut me up! Do you even dare to violate the will of the emperor?" She then lowered her voice and asked nervously: "Bal Daren, can you reveal a little, the emperor?" Who is the name assigned to Malika?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss used the withered hand to refer to Rogge as the Grand Duke of Rogge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fessley's eyes brighten the Duke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a temporary title, After marrying Princess Marika, Lord Rogge will be officially banned from the prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fissley swayed, breathing almost paused, she Looking at Rogge's gaze, it is as gentle as seeing an unforgettable lover. "Prince! God, praise the Great! So, he must have a vast territory and his own army, which province is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are Principality "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fisley fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge and Malika are sitting opposite each other. Although the atmosphere in the room was very embarrassing, the smile on Rogge's face remained unchanged. Marika's dark blue eyes stared at Rogge, and finally couldn't help but speak first: "Do you really want to be my husband?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is the meaning of the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is no love between us, no love can be produced or even high!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "The value of human beings lies in wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are a noble person, you should reject the Great! But I know that you men will not do this. Prince! This is what you want to do for me!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you put your hand on the jade card I am engraved with another name, and I am still a prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what you want to marry is the name of the princess, you can go to other princesses. Ah! They will be happy to marry a prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "Who will bear the consequences of the violation of the will of the Great, who? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika. She stared at Rogge for a while, and said: "My mother will be fascinated by your wealth, territory and power, but I won't! If it is not betrayal, will you get everything today? Now sitting proudly at me In front of me, it is actually a traitor, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is unmoved and faintly said: “Politics is a game, but its Complexity is more than a history book, nor can it be recorded in poetry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika slammed a thick black, his eyes blazed and gnawed his teeth: "I said You. But I can tell you that I already have a loved one, and I will always love him, always thinking about him. If you really marry me, then every time you press me, I will Think of you as his!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger sneer at the lover, is the poet Relo? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid who has been standing behind Marika suddenly said: "You have to be shameless, our princess has already said so clearly!" You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful, don't say it! "Malika immediately stopped the maid. She knew that Rogge couldn't do anything about himself, but if Julie offended him, it wouldn't be a fat man who killed Julie on the spot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and ignored the beautiful. He changed his comfortable posture and did not mean any anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marika frowned, and she finally felt that this fat man was a little difficult to deal with.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Rogge, let's talk calmly." I am not interested in the source of your superiority: power and status. You have just made great contributions to the empire. If you ask for the great emperor, he will choose another princess for you. But if you have to marry me, then I will definitely let you regret it. According to the tradition of the empire, you only have one chance to marry the princess. I will openly communicate with Relo, if you kill me, it is rebellion. If you can't stand it and drive me out of the house, then your prince will be gone. Of course, you can choose to endure, and I will talk to everyone about the wonderful feelings with Relo. At that time, your prestige in the territory will be even worse? At the end of the day, for your reputation, you will still drive me out of the house. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
