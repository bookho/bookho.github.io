			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth day of the book is destroyed on the fifth day (eight)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sword falls rapidly in the air, The wind was cut through the air, and the body of a strong Mozu warrior on the ground was easily pierced and deeply inserted into the earth. Immediately, a faint flame spreads out and instantly burns all the things that can be ignited along the way into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chaotic and bleak battlefield immediately appeared a circular open space, the center of the open space was inserted with the flame sword, the hilt was still slightly It trembled and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stretched his right hand forward, and the five fingers slowly opened, and in his palm, a mysterious and beautiful bracelet emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone let me return this to you." Rogge said. His hand is pointing to Locar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment he took out the bracelet, Rogge knew that its owner was Locar. As for why this is known, Rogge is not clear. This idea is completely self-existing in Rogge’s consciousness. I don’t know if it’s the singular ability attached to this bracelet, or the idea that the pope is pre-placed in his consciousness, or the power that Rogge controls everything brings him. one's gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the answer, such an unknown is clearly not in the control of Rogge. However, the fat man has been hit so many times, so this time it only hurts in the heart, there is no abnormality on the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia’s little hand, the bracelet left Rogge’s palm on his own, crossed the sky and fell into the hands of Loja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lifted the bracelet in front of her, and her eyes turned into a faint black, carefully observing the numerous statues of the Mozu hidden in the bracelet. After a while, suddenly sighed and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia looked up at Rogge and slowly said: "Does he have anything to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rogge said: "He just let me return this thing to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lojas slightly reveals a bitter smile, at this moment, from a young girl On the child's appearance in Loja, Rogge suddenly saw the traces of the passage of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet smile on Luo Jia’s face has disappeared, frowning. It seems that he is doing a very difficult decision. The devil is standing on top of the holy peak. For example, Shen Yuan stopped the Yue, but he did not recover from the power, that is, no war, no escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, Rogge was able to seriously observe the Emperor. The Devil is tall and tall, and is as tall as Rogge. His gray-purple long hair straight down, it seems that every hair is extremely heavy. However, two long eyebrows, half a meter long, floated slowly in the air. There is some gentleness in the face of the devil, but from the outline, it seems that there is no blood relationship with Elysses and Adrienne, and there is no relationship between Elysses and Adrienne. Similarities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor’s long eyes are drooping, revealing the lavender light. His body is covered with heavy black translucent armor, and occasionally a smart light flashes through the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge once knew that the Emperor was not wearing real armor, but the natural armor formed on the body. The sporadic messages from the armor tell Rogge. The Devil's body is extremely powerful. Among the artifacts known to Rogge, there are very few that can break these armor. From the point of view of the strength of the body, the demon is a very powerful force, but the war has just shown that the devil's skill should be said to be a controller. However, his most important significance for the Mozu is that his field can resist the invasion of the heavens. It can also greatly enhance the combat power of the Mozu Warrior. At this point, Rogge finally understood why Elysses would say that the devil was the hope of the entire devil world. However, if this is the case, it seems to be somewhat far-fetched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now Rogge is not willing to think about what it means in Elysian’s words, he just took a deep breath and his eyes gradually pan From the blue light of the stars, I stared at the Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people waiting for him, waiting for him to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the devil world stopped flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, the atmosphere is getting more and more dignified. Luo Jia suddenly sighed heavily. The little hand turned over and took the mysterious bracelet into the palm of his hand. Then he said to Rogge with a wry smile: "He always does this. He thinks he is standing at the peak of the mundane can't set foot. His heart is filled with countless planes, and he likes to think about things from a God's perspective. Why? In his heart, the planes and the humble existences are always stronger than their own existence. He chose to return this floating bracelet to me at this time, and it will really pick the time! For decades, decades. Time is just a short moment for our Mozu, but for me to live forever, it is just a moment in the blink of an eye. But in your Terran, this is the time of life. He... Hey, he chose The big prophecy, is now dying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glimpsed, and the heart naturally emerged from the Pope’s demeanour. But in the eyes of Rogge, the Pope is always a dark, unclear, unreasonable darkness. Every time he launches a large prophecy, his power is so earth-shattering, so Rogge always believes that the Pope is a terrible existence. Naturally, the old state of the pope will be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but listening to Luojia saying this, isn’t the pope’s old man not disguised, but really like a candle in the wind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before reaching the Lord God of Heaven, the Pope was the biggest enemy of Rogge’s life. At this moment, I know that the Pope has not come to Japan. Rogge should have been happy, but I don’t know why. At this moment, the bottom of his heart is a bleakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loja suddenly screamed almost hysterically, and the clear, screaming shouts ran through the heavens and the earth of the devil, spreading the sorrow that could not be vented. In every corner of the devil world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the sky is like a fire, the earth is corpses, and the blood sorrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lojas grows long, and the little body rises slowly. In this way, I flew to the horizon in the distance. Her body could not pass through the brilliance, and the brilliance became brighter and brighter. Later, she seemed to have turned into a splendid meteor, crossed the long sky, and then suddenly appeared in the sky, and then . It disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog is a bit embarrassed, he looks around. Suddenly awakened, the vast demon world with multiple planes, who is still alive at the moment, is only him, the emperor and the dying Miro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hasn’t had time to ask Mirovlya, but even if he asks, it’s mostly unhelpful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s blue wings slowly rose to the maximum, his hands clasped in front of him. Among the hands, a little blue starlight gradually extended, eventually turning into a translucent pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor suddenly asked: "Do you want my god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's take it!" The emperor smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stared at the Emperor, raised his gun, and the blue wings were one by one, and the body began to move slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue screamed, the speed was getting faster and faster, and it was like a lightning in the blink of an eye. Rushing into the distance of the Devil is less than a kilometer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an invisible dividing line between Rogge and the Emperor. When Rogge stepped on this dividing line, a thousand pains came at the same time, and he couldn't help but scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is a bird that rushes forward in the storm, he must bear the rain and wind every moment! All sorts of strange injuries hit him like a sky. Almost every inch of the advance, Rogge will add countless scars inside and outside the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the realm of the Emperor!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the storm, a piece of blue feather from Luo The two wings fell off, marking a clear trajectory behind his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the last phoenix blue feather exploded in the air, Rogge finally rushed to the front of the demon. He screamed, the invisible force field instantly expanded in the field of the emperor, covering the body of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is holding a gun right. If the wind is like electricity. Sting to the Emperor's chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of the collapse of the field, the long hair roots of the Emperor's fall are broken. He seems to have never thought that it would be such a result. He was shocked at a time, and the huge impact of the field collapse was unbearable even for the Emperor. His armor was immediately covered with fine cracks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue guns go like electricity, in the twinkling of an eye, they have been on the chest of the emperor, but the devil has not moved, but his right hand suddenly stretches, even Going a bit faster than Rogge, inserting directly into Rogge's chest and holding his heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, Rogge suddenly tightened on the back of his waist, was hugged by people, the momentum could not help but slightly slow down. It was this moment of pause, and suddenly there was a sly figure between the devil and Rogge! Rogge couldn't stop the gun, he didn't want to accept it, and the momentary fallacy, the devil could recover his ability to escape his attack, so he added the final strength to the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a future to find out who the person is, Rogge's gun has broken into her chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low, hoarse cockroach is so familiar...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war gun passed her The chest was broken, the armor of the demon was broken, and the body of the demon was deeply penetrated. However, when the heart of the demon was touched, the gun finally exhausted its power and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adrienne! You...what can you be here!" Looking at the plain, gentle, atmospheric face, Rogge’s voice began. Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne smiled softly and said: "What I say is also a genius in the Mozu, there is always something that you don't know. The father is the only one in the devil world." Hope, I can't let you kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is as gentle as ever, and she can’t see that she has been broken by a gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, time seems to have solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed his eyes, and the impact of too much shock made his mind blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many things, how many things he has to do!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why? But why can't their perfect endings coexist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that Adelaide’s life is rapidly dying. In fact, she has already died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of the impact of the impact is too large, Rogge's soul suddenly emerged countless extremely strange and strange ideas. He suddenly asked Adrienne: "Your face, has it always been like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne is a glimpse first, then smiles Softly: "This is just not telling you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice slowly descends, and it is getting more and more ethereal. In the end, only a few glimpses of the lingering sounds follow the wind of the devil world,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at Ade Renee, who was like a deep sleep, and looked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Miro who hugs him from behind Rogge. At this moment, Miro has never moved again, but the arms are still buckled like iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked up and looked at the Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor’s long eyes are also looking at him, and the purple eyes are calm, just as everything has never happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you calling them back?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, they don't know what they want to do." The emperor replied, he sighed slightly and said: "It is the gods of heaven." How can I do omnipotence and omnipotence? Just now I don't know why Adrienie can be here, when I didn't think that Elysian would do that."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
