			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Mountain Range has started to snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peaks are covered with silver snow coats, covering the rocky mountains and steep cliffs, the slopes of the slopes become soft and beautiful, and the spiny bushes And the low shrubs turn from the new green of summer and autumn to dark green, like the emeralds that are dotted on the snow coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of the gods in the mountains is unaffected, and most of the elves have not noticed the snow. The pale crown of the elves is still green and dripping, and the magical mist is constantly being sprayed. The magic of the silk through the elves of the elves has become a warmth of the bursts, slowly rising from the ground, melting a hundred miles. The chill. Snowflakes didn't even have the chance to get close to the bottom of the valley, and they turned into a mist at high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you step out of the sanctuary of the city of God, you will immediately feel the power of winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thorns in the wind chilled and reminded Effie, it is winter now, and it is winter in the north. At this time, she should stay in the warm city of the gods. Under the protection of the ancient trees of the elves, the city of the gods is as warm as spring, and even the small lake will not be frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie tightened the mezzanine cloak, the cold made her cute neck narrow, hiding her head in the hood, only revealing half of the face and a small Mouth, exhaling a group of white air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's agility is on her body. Although the tightly wrapped cloak greatly limits her freedom of movement, she is still lightly leaping from another rock to another rock, or through the forest at a very fine pace, with a keen sense of her You can avoid the stone seams and tree holes under the snow one step at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she can run faster, but I can see that Effie Ning can choose this extremely tired running method, and never want to cloak Open a slit to let the cold air come into direct contact with her skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of water suddenly attracted her attention. Effie quickly changed direction and soon stood in front of a stream. This is one of the few unsealed water sources in the winter mountains. Geothermal heat passes through the depths of the soil. Although it cannot be a hot spring, it is enough to ensure the smooth flow of clear streams in this cold season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stream without any traces of impurities blooms like a flower, and the unknown small animals come ashore because of the breath of the outsiders. The shrubs of the snow, even the elf's eyesight did not see its appearance. Breathing the moist air by the water, Effie stopped in a happy mood. She has the heart to wash herself. She has been alone in the forest for a day and night, even if she only wash her face. But the biting cold wind made her not even want to stick out her cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie finally hesitated. I tried to probe a finger into the stream. Her body has solidified in an instant, and her face is completely bloodless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumped out of lightning. Then tightly wrapped himself in a cloak and trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden warmth in the wind, and the warmth was warm and gentle. In the blink of an eye, it penetrated into the skin of Effie, blending into In the blood, she expelled her chill from her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pure elves, why are you going out in this weather? The cold north is not suitable for elf life."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie turned his head and saw a tall middle-aged man standing not far away, smiling at himself. In this cold weather, he only wore a thin white robes, but there was no sharkness. The most striking thing was that he wore a pair of shackles on his hands. Now there is a faint magical light shining between his palms. The warm wind just came from his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie stretched his body and felt much better. The warm wind kept circling around her, blocking the coldness of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered that she had not answered the other’s question, and immediately said: “This is part of my work! Otherwise I would not leave the city of the gods. Thank you, my name is Ai Feier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Constantin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effie got a lot of Constantine up and down and asked, "Why are you wearing shackles? Although it looks like a good thing, it definitely binds the action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Effie frowned: "This bow is so troublesome to use. I would rather use an ordinary magic longbow. Right, Mr. Constantine, why are you alone in the barren hills?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This winter in the north is particularly cold, I smell the breath of the beasts. I heard that this is a new elf city nearby. I am afraid that the beasts in the Central Mountains will have a large scale. The commotion, so come over and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairchild looked at Constantine’s eyes, the clear eyes were as penetrating: "Mr. Constantine How do I feel that this is not the only reason you are here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of Constantine was originally a belief in spreading to the high gods in the north, but There was a very powerful person over there, I couldn't beat her. So... I decided to investigate the orc activities in the Central Mountains. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, have you run away?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin's face is not red, the heart does not jump: "meaningless life is not what the wise man does, only to stay in the body, can continue to spread to the high gods Glory. Miss Effie, what is your job? Why do you run around in such a cold winter? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for three thieves, and every few days I will find them around the city of the gods." When I don't catch the thief, I have to clean the temple. If God returns, I will accompany him to bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Effie, Constantine was slightly surprised, his eyes lit up with colorful haze, and he glanced up and down Ai<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy once again, suddenly his eyes lit up and shouted: "Miss Effie, you are so holy! If you are such a person, you should return to the belief of the High God. It’s a rare purity! Just set it, Miss Effie, I will pass on the glory of the Most High God.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe in Hilo. And according to your human standards, I should think that I am very bad." Effie did not appreciate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin’s righteousness: “Holy or not, only see if the soul is noble. The radiance of Miss Effie’s soul is the softest of the people I have ever seen. Holy. I don't care what people in the world think. I only believe in my own eyes. Miss Effie, Hilo's faith can't be compared with the supreme god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How do you know that Hilo is not as high as God? Since you only believe in your own eyes, have you seen Hilo, have you seen the Most High God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kang Standin was silent for a moment. He suddenly said solemnly: "I haven't seen Hilo, but the Supreme God... How to describe it? In a meditation, I have seen the Supreme God with my own eyes... You can't imagine what I saw or understand. My sorrow and joy. At that time... I saw light, the purest light! The vastest light! I saw only light!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sounds better than Hilo, but I am not interested." Effie did not doubt the feasibility of his words. Just jumped up and rushed to the direction of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Constantine tried to stop her, but her efforts were just in vain. In desperation, he could only follow Effie in a step-by-step manner, and instilled in her heart to the teachings of the High God, trying to seduce this pure elf who was tricked by Hilo. From the new into the Holy Light of the High God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie finally couldn’t stand the endless preaching voice in his ear, and said: "When are you going to follow me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Until you are converted to the High God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is impossible!" Effie answered with conviction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin’s frowning, there is no way to take this elf. He suddenly showed up and smiled. You can see the glory of the Supreme God with your own eyes. What do you say? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only believe in what I saw!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case! I will teach you meditation, and all the sacred spells I know! With the purity of your soul, when you practice a certain realm You will definitely see the Supreme God! At that time you can not repent." Constantine's eyes are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't lie to me?" The turn came suddenly, and Constantine even had some confidence that his luck would suddenly get better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never lie." Effie faintly said, but what she thought was: "I am just misleading..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Constantine, I will find you a place to live in the city of the gods. When I finish my daily work, I will come to learn meditation and divine practice with you. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From today, you have to think of it from the early days! I will work for you for your work! Constantine replied firmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie’s eyebrows raised, snorted, did not say anything. Waiting for Constantine to see the magnificent god When he was in the temple, he regretted it, and it was too late.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure elf woman and the devout ascetic walked through the forest and quickly flew to the city of the gods. Going away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Constantin, it seems that the Church of Light has never spent so much time recruiting a believer like you. In this way, I doubt that you will be able to recruit several believers in your life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A credible person has been worth thousands of believers who are not determined! The set of the Church of Light has indeed enrolled many believers, but it has caused the believers to deviate from the glory of the Most High God. They can recruit a large number of blind believers, but true honests may not have one in a year! "The words of Constantine reveal a deep loss.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like you have something to do with the Church of Light! spy? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not a spy! But I do have a relationship with the Church of Light, a deep relationship..." Constantine smiled bitterly... the new Cardinal of the Church of Light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s very important! But don’t remember your noble status when cleaning the room.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Delaware Empire’s Tiffany is important, she A few hundred kilometers southeast is the famous port city of Ludan. The south is an alluvial plain rich in grain and rich in grain. A boulevard leads to the Principality of the North. This avenue will continue to cross the territory of the Principality. North, the Babylonian Empire is also connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Delawares are brave and versatile, and they have a profound knowledge of architecture, art, and magic. However, because of the limited population, there are not many troops in the empire, and there are only 50,000 troops in the country. Originally these forces to fight the Chaoshan Legion can be said to be enough, but the Empire has never thought that Rogge will double the number of soldiers, and it is unreservedly poured out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the Imperial Army, there are also many powerful people who lead the unprecedented situation. Under the combined efforts of the powerful, the city defenses of the Delaware cities were destroyed before the war. In the following wars, the Delaware Army on the side of the defending city lost its advantage in geography. The personal qualities of the soldiers were inferior to those of the elite tidal warriors. The rest, naturally only the part of the massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the Delaware Empire, it was completely unexpected that Rogge’s march would be such a god. Therefore, every attempt to massacre the city has caused the traditional occupation, prevention, and appeasement of the Imperial Army to be saved. After the massacre, the army will also receive supplies on the spot, and will not maintain a long supply line. Therefore, after each battle, Rogge’s army only needs to rest for one night, and the next day can be <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the next goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody double-flag movement on the earth has already surpassed the military common sense of many generals in the Delaware Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy all the Delaware’s detectives, which is a difficult task for the strong. So in the early days of the war, the battles on the front line were like a Delaware in a fog. The generals sent a large number of reconnaissance cavalry in accordance with the most prudent approach. Of course, the result can only be the loss of these best cavalry. Later, the war situation became increasingly clear, and the Delawares also knew that the in-depth Rogge replenishment was very fragile. As a result, the generals made another mistake. They sent thousands of people to try to bypass the imperial army and cut off the supply line of the emperor. What the generals didn't know was that there were two dragons flying in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, waiting for the 3,000 sneak attack on the supply line, it is the 30,000 Aley warrior led by the Bauhinia butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this dusk, standing under the city of Tiffany in the capital of Delaware, Rogge was temporarily freed from killing and bloody, and he was able to enjoy the city of the same name as Richelieu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a population of 300,000 in the city of Tiffany. Because of the drive of Roger’s bloody double flag, thousands of civilians have entered the empire. According to Wallace's estimate, there are now 800,000 people in Tiffany City, but the regular defenders are less than 30,000. This is the result of Delaware giving up several small town defenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there are a lot of strong people, this is not good. Wallace frowned and reached a conclusion in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Rogge stand under the city of Tiffany, but Wallace studies the city defense of Tiffany, and Rogge is only admiring Tiffany Ni's beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany in the sunset is not just a bustling emperor, she looks more like a fine and magnificent art. Richelieu is famous for its water and island city, and Tiffany is famous for its unique temperament. Her façade is not like the common square of other city defenses. Instead, it is built into a section of curved wall. The wall is nearly 30 meters high. Except for the arc at the bottom, the top three layers will be like Swift. Stretching the tip of the wing, you can find a platform that is light and smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corners of Tiffany, each stands a curved spire that slant outwards, and the spires of nearly one meter on the spire seem to be made entirely of crystal The crystal is bright and dark, flashing the light of indigo, dark red and bright yellow. The last spire tower was built purely in black crystal, as if to devour all the light. The pedestal's pedestal is engraved with three giants bent over and backed by their powerful, graceful backs with huge curved spires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the setting sun, Tiffany is like a gorgeous piece of jewelry, each of which reflects different brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have heard all the rumors of Tiffany, but with the rhetoric of the rhetoric, it is impossible to fully reveal the charm of Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Rogge, we need to take two days off to build the siege device. Also, the Delaware Chamber has refused to surrender, we want to raise the blood Double flag?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How many people have been killed?” asked Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace silently calculated that it was between 850,000 and 900,000. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger slammed a Delawareer and killed one, not too much. The bloody double flag... this war does not have to rise. In order to avoid the heart of the people in the city, 800,000 people who have nowhere to go, are not so good to deal with. Wallace, what if we can't attack Tiffany?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace slammed and replied: "With the supply of our army, if you can't attack Tiffany, there may be only a few thousand people who can return to the empire. Originally Tiffany. The population suddenly increased several times. As long as we control the water source into the city, it will take less than a month, and the city will be broken. But now, our army's supply is only enough to support seven days. It is not good for us to delay."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a beautiful city, I can’t bear to let her get too much blood!” Rogge smiled and said: “800,000 people! It takes a lot of time to kill it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace asks: "But, Isn't the war not to raise the double flag?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge replied faintly: "The flag raising is inevitable, but not raising the flag does not mean not killing the city. Going to the siege preparation, this war may cost us a lot, but the ultimate winner will only be us. Because the goddess is with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The night is deep, the military battalion of the Imperial Army is silent, only the silent and heavy footsteps of the silent soldiers reverberate in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a separate camp, Mei is wiping the weapon under the ***. In front of her, more than twenty different sharp edges were lined up. They were only six centimeters in length and twenty centimeters in length. And the blade whip is also open, lying flat on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A piece of green crystal on the handle of the blade suddenly lit up. Rose took the blade whip, covered the whip handle with his hand, whispered a spell and then pulled it with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
