Large groups of large birds are flying back into the nest, and the sounds are coming and going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden hooves broke the details of the mountains, and dozens of riders thundered from the distant mountains and rushed into the jungle without any loss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These riders are very clever, and the horses have been integrated into one, and they are very flexible in the lush virgin forest. It’s too slow to get on the Mercedes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds were frightened and flew. The beast also instinctively felt the threat and had already disappeared without a trace. It is the occasional fierce World of Warcraft, which also smells the unusual taste in the air, and let the knights go out early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights of the rushing are wearing a linen robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is usually a reloading of the knight's undercoat, but the strange thing is that these knights are not wearing any heavy armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all flashed their vindictive light, and they followed the front of the knight who was riding in the pure black battle immediately, and kept going deep into the forest. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, there was a knight on the distant hills, his armor reflecting the light of the setting sun, dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoof rumbling, one knight after another rides up the hill, lined up in a neat queue behind the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several knights who came to the back of the man and watched the position of the surprised bird in the virgin forest. One of them said: "The old man of Sarreus, I really didn't expect it! Just for a while, they can actually run so far! The generals of Sarreus, the whole army assault can't catch up with them. I take the vanguard Two hundred people go and try it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salrius has a neatly trimmed beard that looks close to forty years old . He snorted. Receive the team! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers are somewhat unconvinced! I have at least 50% confidence to catch up with them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What are you going to catch up? Are you dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young knight’s face is a little red, raising the voice: "We just packed up the round table knight and more than 30 A golden lion knight can not lose more than fifty rides without spending much time! I think they are just like this. It is enough for me to have two hundred people! Their long-distance endurance is much stronger than ours, and they can’t catch up with them. How do we go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salrius snorted and asked: "All responsibility is naturally carried by me! Do you look down on the Golden Lion Knight? I ask you, how many people can you give you a thousand knights for 10 minutes? Think about it! Take the team!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the moon rises and falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumbling hooves keep going all the way in the day and night. There is no stopping except for a short break every two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the knights finally stepped out of the mountains and embarked on an endless plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long snoring, the horses fell to the ground and none of them survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All knights are ragged, and the vindictive light has long since disappeared. In addition to the round table knight Charlie is still tall and straight, the rest of the knights are unable to sit down to the ground, can no longer stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie silently swings the sword, will accompany his many years of war horses to dismember, then gave birth to a pile of fire, barbecue and horse meat. All the golden lion knights were silent and began to dismember their own horses. These companions who have faithfully accompanied them through countless wars will continue to connect with their owners in another way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie is well versed in the 6 geography, knowing that it is already a strong domain of the Delaware Empire, and there is considerable distance from the battlefield in the South. The Imperial Chamber of the Delaware Empire is not martial, and it has not yet been involved in the war in the South. They are relatively safe here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the vast plains for two days, after crossing many small villages, Charlie finally saw a broad main road. They turned from here to the north, and less than a day, a small town is already far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you get here, you don’t have to worry about going to the chase. Charlie decided to make a minor repair here, add some horse supplies, and then continue north, bypassing the Central Mountains and heading to the Asrofic Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking behind him and silently following his 30 golden lion knights, Charlie couldn’t help but feel sad. Who can think of the Golden Lion Knights of Megatron in the past more than a year? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Lion Knights now have only one long sword in their hands, except for one suit. Armor and sundries were thrown away before they fled. In the three days and three nights of sprinting, more than a dozen powerful knights fell forever in the forest. The remaining 30 knights, no matter from any aspect, are the best knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the sudden interception was always a huge shadow in Charlie’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no idea where the thousand light knights come from. But they are well-trained and rigorous, and the knight has an excellent commanding art. The two round table knights were all in a battle, and they were all capable of breaking. When the situation was not right, a round table knight led a half-golden lion knight to head to death. Charlie took the remaining half to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to escape half is better than the whole army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie knows that the ambassador of this murder will never be the pope. He left the city of Lille and he specifically sought the consent of the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleepy pope only gave him a sentence: "All you ask for is to find the answer from the north."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Pope wants them to stay, and has the ability to completely erase them from the world without any trace, why bother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding the church, then the Bavarian Principality has the ability to move so many mysterious knights to kill their own people, there is only one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that Dagong would dare to set the Pope’s will to ignore it, Charlie couldn’t help but feel chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie is thinking, a knight whispers in his ear: "Charlie, do we find a place to settle down? Now too People pay attention to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie left and right, and surely the residents of the town are watching them secretly. Seeing Charlie’s gaze, everyone was afraid, and even hawkers began to collect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie looked back and followed his 30 gold lion knights, all of them were ragged, expressionless and murderous. How can a half-degree Knights look like? It is clearly a group of dead lives! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid of causing turmoil. Seeing a small hotel on the side of the road, it looks elegant and clean, and the beautiful female shop owner is busy. The most difficult thing is that she occasionally looks at the eyes here without any fear. Charlie waved, and the 30 knights rushed into the small hotel, crowding the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a lot of guests in the store. At this moment, they threw their meals on the table and fled. Several maids couldn’t stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female shop owner and Charlie did not expect this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female shop owner has a pair of beautiful big eyes, watching the escaped guests, and even greet, but it has no effect. She was so anxious that she stumbled and turned her head to stare at Charlie with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie also felt a little embarrassed, but he was not good at words, first waved, the golden lion knights each found a place to sit down. They naturally block all access to the traffic, leaving only a winding path for people outside the store. Charlie licked his body and touched it. Where can I find half a gold coin? He pulled off the necklace in his neck and handed it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick male voice in the hotel asked: "How is it so noisy outside? Wake up the children!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall man came out and he saw Suddenly there were so many fierce big men in the lobby, and they were scared on the spot. Despite his pale face, he still pulled Lilith to his back and said, "Who are you! What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie glanced up and down this the man. As a Knight of the Round Table, his eyes were so powerful that he immediately saw that he was a veteran knight, and he was okay, and his temperament was estimated to be around six or seven. Any of the gold lion knights present at least were ten-level knights, and he actually dared to stand up. It seems that the love of this female shop owner is indeed not shallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie suddenly had a heart and soul. In the man's horrified gaze, he stood still, the violent white flame ignited, and reached out to the man's throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Charlie’s vindictive flame, the man’s eyes were desperate, but taking care of the female shopkeeper behind him, he did not retreat, snoring, backhand to Charlie’s Throat buckle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his big hands touched the vindictive flame of Charlie's body, and he couldn't move forward anymore! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!" exclaimed the small mouth of the female shopkeeper, she suddenly flashed from behind the man, a pair of small hands drew a clever arc, Shoot under Charlie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie’s vindictiveness suddenly flashed, and the female shop owner and the man both bounced back. But he couldn't help but take a step back and his chest was disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie was shocked, the female shopkeeper was obviously not strong, but let himself eat a small loss. He is very familiar with such a sullen grudge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is starry! You are the one of Andre and Procis!" Charlie shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre and Procis have been faintly Ophir's opponents, all the golden lion knights have stood up, and the temperament shines one after another. The atmosphere in the store suddenly became tense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie always feels that the female shop owner is very familiar. He takes a closer look and suddenly excitedly said: "I remember, you are Lilith! I have seen you before. I am the person of the Golden Lion Knights, huh, huh! How are you here? Rogge! Is he here too??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear The name of Rogge, Lilith suddenly stunned, and the tears could not stop flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was taken aback and asked urgently: "What happened to you? Don't be afraid, big deal, I will fight with them!"<br /><br />&nbsp Liss wiped her tears and smiled reluctantly: "Kahn! I am fine. These people are my former friends. I didn't recognize them at all. The children cried again, dear, you go first." Let him sleep!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also told the maid to prepare the food room, then sat down next to Charlie and whispered: "I haven’t been there for a long time. His message. Can you tell me what happened to him? Since I was chased by the Principality, I have no news of him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie smiled a bit and said the recent events of the Principality. Finally, "This is the case. The Golden Lion Knights have completely disappeared. We are now, like you, the targets of the Principality. Right, why is Rogge?" Not with you? This Kahn is a bit of a bone, who is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" En is now my husband. He is a very good person. If it weren't for him, maybe I was already sick and dead here. At that time, I already... In the tears of Roger Lilith, once again, I couldn’t stop falling and finally fell. Cried on the table: "He has had me in his heart!" I just waited for it to be abandoned again and again... but it doesn't matter, I still love him... but after I got here, I really can't help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Charlie was a little helpless, and he had no idea how to comfort the poor girl. He knew completely that for the nobility, civilian girls like Lilith were often just objects of play.<br />< Brilliance suddenly sat up straight, wiped away tears, and smiled reluctantly: "Sorry, I was the first time I saw someone from the Principality, and I was in a state of disappointment." You are all tired, and the meal should be fine. How long do you plan to stay here? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith pushed the necklace back and shook her head. "Too much, you can buy more than a dozen stores like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War together, No money, no. Even for children, take it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liliths heard 'for the child', his eyes were red again, silently I have a necklace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lion knights have finished eating their meals and put on new clothes, ready to go out. The town is not big, they can't buy a horse, and only plan to go to the big town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute!" Lilith hurriedly chased it out of the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Charlie, tried to stop, hesitated for a long time, finally made up her mind: "Charlie, if you can see Rogge later, tell him, Let him be free when... When he is free.... Come back and take a look at his son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is still a thousand miles away I have already been a father. At the moment, he and Clarke, the Marshal of Alams, and the generals of the Layton Kingdom finalized the final marching route to attack the Three Principalities of the Highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a brand new map in the center of the luxury march. This map is the brainchild of the Elf Scout. It records all the mountains, rivers, roads and towns of the Three Kingdoms in the highlands, and the details of these leaders who have been leading for many years are shocked. They could not help but re-estimate the strength of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the high country of the Three Kingdoms, the Kingdom of Layton is determined to win, is to send a full 25,000 army. Rogge also made up the four thousand troops of the Principality of Ale, plus 2,500 elf warriors, and formed a coalition with the army of the Kingdom of Leighton. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the diplomats of the Three Principalities in the Highlands also clashed with the diplomats of the Kingdom of Layton and the Principality of Ale in the Holy Alliance, the coalition forces of the two countries have I started to gather secretly on the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Layton really did not bear the prestige of the first power of the Holy Alliance, and it took only two days to complete the 25,000 army. It was Clark’s uncle, the Marshal of the Kingdom, Arams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant King of Romon never took the council of the Holy Alliance too seriously. In his view, it is just a place to find a just excuse for the action to be taken. The deal was done long under the table, and it was discussed in the parliament, but it was a walk through the scene. In the life of King Roman of Lomon, he had several wars with the Asrofic Empire, and they all had their own wins and losses. Therefore, these second-rate small countries in the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands have not yet been put in his eyes. What is a war? In the view of King Romon, the joy of being able to win the newly acquired elf little beauty is far more important than the life and death of thousands of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the first sight of this little fairy, the sixty-year-old King Ramon seems to have regained the bloody youth of the age of twenty! He now began to like the court magician of the Ayre Principality from the bottom of his heart, and even figured out whether to remove the current court division of the Layton Kingdom, so as to replace the incomparable Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful appearance, the impeccable temperament, the weak body, let the heart of King Romon take it for him. No matter which aspect of the evaluation, this little fairy is the elf's top choice, far from the elf woman that Romon has seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this elf beauty has never laughed, which makes the heart of King Romon too dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under repeated questioning, the elf beauty finally spoke up. She said that the elves followed the great magician Rogge to seal the demon in the North, but Rogge was concealed by the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands. Then they sent troops to attack the Elf Base Camp and arrested her numerous brothers and sisters. As long as she thinks about the suffering of these brothers and sisters on a daily basis, she will be very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day of coming to the Kingdom of Layton, the melancholy elf beauty fell ill, and the disease was getting worse, and the disease became more and more heavy. They almost stopped. King Romon was as old as ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high country of the Three Kingdoms sneaked into the looting of the elf he had known, but did not take it seriously. But now this matter involves the life and death of his heart, this feeling is completely different! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raging old king immediately summoned the Minister of the Kingdom, announced that Marshal Elafas would lead the troops, no longer awaiting the resolution of the Holy Alliance, and immediately declared war on the Three Principalities of the Highlands. ! The ministers looked at each other, but no one was willing to violate the king in anger. The commander Marshal Alams, who is in charge of power, is also very supportive of this decision. The Three Kingdoms of the Highlands did not respect the decree of the pre-Secretary, and the ministers tacitly decided this decision. What's more, after the annexation of the two largest countries in the Three Principalities, the strength of the Kingdom of Leighton will be far above the other countries of the Holy Alliance. A unified sacred alliance may no longer be just a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is as Rogge expected. The king of the Kingdom of Leighton has supreme authority. To manipulate the behavior of such a big country, it is only necessary to balance the number of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf beauty with great drama and artistic talent is the most powerful trump card in Rogge's hands. As she matures, the power of this card will gradually emerge. Rogge never doubts this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how much the price is paid, Rogge is determined to completely eliminate the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands. He must let all the members of the Holy Alliance see the end of the looting elves; he must completely sever the greed of these people. Rogge wants everyone to know what it would be like to dare to put his claws into his pocket. It would be very painful, very painful, and unbearable! He does not have this strength now, but the Leiden Kingdom has this strength, and it is very worthwhile to pay the elf beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two-day military discussion on the border, Rogge always brought the butterfly and Ajani to the side, but did not let them speak, only to see and listen . If there is a problem, he will explain it in detail at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Elafas is quite skilled in military strategy. He knows that although the country of the snowy country is the least powerful in the three countries of the Highlands, there is a presence of the Duke of Annas. The power is definitely not much lower than the other two countries. He deliberately tried the combat power of the Rogge Guard, so he immediately agreed to the request of Rogge against the country of the ferrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big strategy was quickly determined, and the next day, the generals were discussing the details of the battle. After two days of hard work, the entire operational plan was formed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the total power of the Three Principalities in the Highlands is only 40,000, it is necessary to disarm and defend the three houses and more than ten large and small cities, and the total strength of the coalition forces is reached. Three thousand and two thousand people, so all the generals agreed to seek a decisive battle with the three kingdoms of the Highlands as soon as possible, so as not to have a long night dream, attracting the rebound of other countries of the Holy Alliance, and even incuring another invasion of the Asrofik Empire. Fortunately, it is the harsh winter. The Asrofik emperor is inconvenient to move and the supply is difficult. If you want to go out and rob, you have to wait a month or so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end of the military talks, in the long horn of the horn, tens of thousands of coalition forces packed up the camp and slowly opened up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the military is the capital of the Goshawk country. The Northland warriors are proud and proud. If there are no special circumstances, they will not break the city. The country of the Goshawk is the most powerful of the three highlands of the Highlands. It is difficult to tolerate the government falling into the hands of the enemy. Luoyun City Monday, Pingchuan, is suitable for the final battle of the army. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition forces are marching in this way, and it is hoped that they will be able to launch a decisive battle with the three countries in the lower reaches of the city, and defeat the main power of the three countries in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the south of the rich, heavy cavalry is a very expensive unit, especially in the north. Of the 25,000 people sent by the Principality of Layton, only one thousand heavy cavalry and another four thousand light riders. The rest is 8,000 heavy infantry, 10,000 light infantry, and 2,000 long archers. But the soldiers of the Leiden Kingdom mostly came from these reloaded knights. The small Principality with weaker national strength can't afford to regain the top of the reloading knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams has been over 50 years old, very thin, and his eyes are extremely sharp. He marched tightly and rigorously, and dripping water did not leak, so Rogge was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams is not a military genius like Orphey Roque, but he is a heavy-duty man with few flaws, and he wants to defeat him. Easy thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal personally led the 20,000-strong army to march in the middle, and the remaining 5,000 troops marched in parallel on the right side of the right, guarding the right wing of the army. Rogge led the army and elves of the Principality of Aray to march on the left side of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the largest collaborative effort between the elves and the Terran after the Millennium War. Walking in the middle of the rough North team, the elves look elegant, refined and delicate. In the eyes of the North Warriors, the elves did not have a little bit of warriors, and they passed their heads gracefully and tenderly. But the beautiful long bow on the elf reminds the North Warriors that this is more than just a good-looking toy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are eight knights in the Elves who are dressed in plain dark green cloaks. They are the eight elf magicians that Rogge has urgently transferred. Although the elves were not good at large-scale army battles and battles on the plains, Rogge still had the confidence to teach the Duke of Annas. After all, he has not only elves, but also a thousand knights and three thousand infantry in the Principality of Alei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day when the gods smashed the city, the strength of the Annas ace reloaded infantry left a deep impression on Rogge, so this time the fat man is ready Come and seek to smash all his elite heavy infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gorgeous black mage robe, his posture is even more bloated, and the dragon horse under the seat is quite a bit difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he has grown a lot of fat, but he wore a special intensive armor under the mage’s robe. In front of the generals of the Principal of Layton, Rogge is a great magician. How can a magician wear a full body? The fat man knows the aristocrats' ability to take people's unchanging nature, so the black magician robe is extremely gorgeous. Fortunately, the elves have never lacked masters of art, and they can make this golden, decorated with countless jewels only a luxury, no vulgarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s action in the immediate direction is awkward, sometimes catching something, and occasionally making mistakes. The fat man's movements are mostly inflexible, and the magician's physique is famously poor, so the generals of the Principality of Layton did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ajani and Wind Butterfly, who are behind Rogge, know that it’s not the case at all. Rogge is deliberately training himself to slow down and stay the same as ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a permanent cure for Rogge, and the agility is no longer the elf. But the price is also surprisingly huge: the elf elders who cast this magic, all the magic has disappeared cleanly, instead of the original predicted permanent reduction of two levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Hughes who were there at the time just sighed and their faces were gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aga Ni and the wind butterfly all use a full-faced helmet to cover up the stunning appearance, but those who are still conscious can still see that they are all unsettled, obviously Not on the upcoming war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the wind butterfly is riding stiffly on the horse, and it seems to be a little helpless. In addition to the huge wheel saw on the back, the side of the horse hangs a giant bow with green flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow of the giant bow is composed of countless elf statues with different postures. These exquisite statues tell the most famous legends of the elves. At the back of the bow, two elf girls are stretched out. These are the two most beautiful girls of the legendary Elf. They dedicated themselves to Hilo, and the string of the springs extended from their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Elf King's Bow can not only shoot endless magic arrows, but also enhance the power of the magical longbows of the elves in a considerable range. It is a horrible arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge senses the undulating magical fluctuations on the bow of the Elf King, and the heart is really happy, but with inexplicable worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of the morning, Shadow Knight Rafael ended his training and came to join Rogge. This Elf King's Bow is the elder of Hughes who brought him. What worries in Rogge's mind is that the old fox of Xius is as if he knows what he is thinking, and at this time he has sent such a weapon of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a coincidence. Originally, he only had a 70% grasp of the plan. With the bow of the Elf King, the grasp immediately increased to 10%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, Fengdie’s heart is full of turmoil, and she has done her best to suppress the trembling of the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow behind her, Shadow Knight Rafael, the former Guardian of Rumsfeld, is hiding there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly really can't tell what it feels like in the heart, the most loved one rides with himself...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the person he loves is just a body, and the soul mark of Rumsfeld has been completely erased. In his body, now is a brand new soul, a cold-blooded animal without feelings, a rogue shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her favorite person has completely turned into a rogue sword for killing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly has just made up his mind to turn a bite of hatred into a love for Rogge, and then dragged him to hell. However, Rogge arranged for Rafael to ride with himself in a blink of an eye. She knows that Rogge is intentional, but the wind butterfly is never willing to admit defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse leaps forward lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raphael, like no weight, flutters with the ups and downs of the war horse, the distance from the butterfly is always one inch, no more than one point, no One point less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't be crazy! I have to forget everything in the past! I will love Rogge!..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hysterical cry is repeated in the wind butterfly The heart reverberates...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Highlands of the Highlands have given up their last efforts in the Holy Alliance. It is a long-lasting thing to want to reach a resolution in a place like the parliament. What's more, they have some disadvantages after all. The news that the elves' sneak attack almost released the demon has spread throughout the Holy Alliance. At that time, thousands of people witnessed the horror of the devil's resurrection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the reaction of the Kingdom of Layton and the Principality of Aray was unexpectedly fierce and left no room. Before the sacred alliance countries reacted, the coalition forces of the two countries completed the assembly and officially declared war on the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the scouting information, Rogge knows that the army of the Three Principalities in the highlands is now beginning to assemble quickly and enter the city of Luoyun. The small-capacity Rangers also began to appear around the Rogge team. But these unlucky cavalry have only one dead end when they meet the dark side of the moon. The superb archery of the elves swayed in the hands of the dark-faced knights of the moon. They shot the horse first, then murdered, and a rider did not escape to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road leading to the city of Luoyun, there is only one small town stationed by more than 1,000 people. Under the attack of Marshal Alams, it only fell for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, between the city of Luoyun and the coalition forces, there is only one hundred miles of Pingchuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ordered the entire army to turn and slowly moved closer to Marshal Elamas. The three-way army maintained a distance of three miles and began to approach Luoyun City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a night of rest, the coalition was assembled and organized into neat teams and began to march. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon, the flag fluttering in the city of Yuncheng slowly became clear in the distance. Subsequently, the pieces of the flag and the dense pikes became clear from the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands has been in the forefront of the Falling City, although the military is not dominant, but relying on the defense of the sturdy Luoyun City and the brave warriors They still decided to fight with the coalition forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal Arams’s long sword pointed to the sky, and the horn’s long screams, the army slowly moved and began to array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hurricane, Rogge’s movements were still awkward, but his eyes were clear. He observed the formation of the enemy's right wing and could not hold the order underground. The troops of the Ayre Principality moved, the array of three thousand infantry was in front, one thousand snow bear knights were placed on the left, and the infantry team was followed by two thousand elf warriors. At this moment, they were replaced with the elf longbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark side of the moon, Roger sits on top of the dragon and waits for the command of Marshal Alams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main force of the three high-country countries is 20,000, and another 3,000 are guarded in the city of Luoyun. Perhaps it is the narrow road of the family. The right wing of the Principality is led by the Duke of Annas. The forefront is the heavy infantry of the country. Two thousand heavy infantry, the hand of the giant shield, a pole four meters long gun pointing high to the sky, just like a chilled steel forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Kingdoms of the Highlands placed the heavy infantry at the forefront, apparently posing a defensive formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the strength of the coalition, it is a wise strategy to follow the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams’s sword swayed forward, and the commander immediately blew the horn, and the coalition started at the same time, slowly moving forward. Every ten steps, I scream. More than 30,000 troops shouted in unison, and the momentum immediately rose to the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition forces have been forced to stop outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long horn of the horn, the reloading knight of the sacred alliance of the Principality of Layton was instigated by a horse, and was listed as an impact cavalry line ten meters before the lineup. Then the heavy infantry armed with the giant shield rushed out like a tidal wave, and listed it in several rows before reloading the knight. The longbowmen slowly moved forward with the heavy-duty infantry, and they were approaching a single arrow before they stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reloading the knights once again marched forward and set the impact formation behind the archers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the head of the city of Luoyun, the grandfathers of the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands are staring at the battlefield in the distance. One of them turned to an old magician around him and said: "Master Lapas! Now the enemy is superior, and it will take a master's thunder and lightning to give these arrogants a good lesson!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapas’s heart beats, but his face is proud, and he promises to come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas was defeated in the city of the gods, but it was because the power of the devil was not able to compete. The horror power of the Lapasley magic is shared by all, so once returned to the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands, the old magician was immediately recognized as a god. The reason why the Three Principalities of the Highlands dare to fight, but also because of the existence of Lapas. The old magician's wide range of lightning magic is one of the most suitable magic for the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lappas has a hard time. He is a 12th-level magician, and it is reasonable to say that it is already very powerful. However, it is said that Roger, the great magician led by Ale Principal, easily killed the 11th-level original court magician Gnawala, but he was really uncertain that he could win Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long horn sound suddenly rang through the clouds, and the pensive Lapas was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archers of the two armies got orders, bowed to the sky, the arrows rained across the sky, and fell to the other side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war finally began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infantry shouted, and the giant shields lifted up to cover the arrow rain in the sky. But there are still many long arrows that cross the gap between the shields and are deeply inserted into the soldiers' bodies! For a time, screams came one after another. More powerful, the long arrow directly penetrates the hand shield of the light infantry, and is inserted on their heads! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two armies fired each other, the left wing of the coalition was surprisingly calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infantry of the Ayre Principality not only stopped moving forward, but began to contract, and stayed out of range. At this time, a temporary four-meter platform was set up in Rogge. Eight elf wizards stood up. With a cry, a hundred strong soldiers raised the platform and slowly moved forward. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the far-reaching bows and arrows, under the protection of heavy military, these elf wizards are very safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas’ archers were at a loss. The enemies on the opposite side are outside the range, and it is useless at this moment. To turn the enemy in the center, you have to advance a few tens of meters. If the other cavalry rushes, these archers will be confessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas was sullen and still hesitating, and then a horrified array of arrows rained from the opposite side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warrior holding the elf longbow has a much longer range than the human archer. Moreover, influenced by the bow of the Elf King, nearly half of the elf longbows are slightly magical, and their range and power are added! Archery is the speciality of the elves. The two thousand elf warriors are comparable to the excellent archers of human beings. They do not say the arrow skills, but the number is only five hundred archers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrified Duke of Annas immediately showed the extraordinary lethality of this arrow rain! After the three waves of arrows, the archers who had no power to fight back before the battle suffered heavy casualties. He rushed to the ground and pulled back the few remaining archers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf arrow rain that had caused the army of the people in the millennium war to finally reappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog’s hand waved, the whole formation slowly approached, and the arrow rain gradually extended forward, falling on the head of the heavy infantry of Annas. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas has paid enough for the two thousand heavy infantry. At this distance, the Elven Arrow Rain is not enough to penetrate their heavy armor, though Still sporadic casualties, but completely affordable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that there is no need to reload the infantry, Rogge ordered, and the Elf arrow turned to the central enemy. Under the double strike, the archers in the central part of the enemy could no longer afford heavy casualties and returned to the battle. The arrow rain of the coalition forces began to cover the infantry of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled coldly and observed the slightly confusing Anthony Forces. Then he passed through a thousand horses and fell into a silver armor. The Duke of the Duke...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singular chords sounded on the battlefield, and more than ten giant pythons crossed the kilometer and flew to the coalition! The three-meter-long giant python is invincible, and even after wearing a few people, it is hard to reach the ground. There are often several unbroken soldiers struggling on the mast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a giant scorpion like a thunder, shooting at the high platform standing on the wizard wizard! Rogge sat still, Ajani has skyrocketed, and the long sword and the cloud with a white flame tail, sideways on the giant python! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the two armies, the unstoppable giant scorpion turned a corner and slanted upwards, far behind. Ajani fell to the ground and some stood unsteadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this kind of giant cockroach is generally out of place, and it takes a lot of time to load. The threat is not too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge on the squadron: "Give the Masters a command! Goal, reload the infantry in front, cast fear twice!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Annas camp has long entered the wizard's magic range. In the screams of the enemy's horror, the magical lights of the eight elf magicians flashed, and sixteen pale yellow magical light balls crossed the hundreds of meters of space, split into two waves and fell into the heavy infantry camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rigorous heavy infantry formation suddenly screamed and screamed, dozens of infantrymen were affected by fear, pushed away their comrades, and began to flee in desperation ! Annas’s battle like a copper wall has suddenly got some flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goal! Heavy infantry, chaos twice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Rogge II The command of the road, sixteen magical light spots with red light fell on the Annas array! More than 30 heavy infantry eyes became blood red, and they suddenly pulled out the short axe behind them and chopped down to the comrades around them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goal! Heavy infantry, fear twice!" Another dozen heavy infantrymen began to take the road and escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas’s battle is finally in chaos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goal! Snow Bear Knight! Bloodthirsty, Unlimited Use!" The snow bear knight who pioneered began to reddish one after another, the last dozen The Snow Bear Knight was blessed with bloodthirsty. They almost resisted the murder in their hearts, only the last line of clearing made them wait for Rogge's orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas is also a person who shines in magical light, it is Lapas. The three big men on Luoyun City saw the battle of Annas in chaos and quickly sent Lapas to dispel magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician carefully hid outside the range of the other magician and began to prepare for the group magic to disperse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sneered, he is waiting for this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly woke up from the stunned, she immediately took off The bow of the Elf King, full of vindictiveness, the whole person is wrapped in a green flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden brightening on the battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lappas looked incredulously at the big hole that suddenly appeared on his chest, and was no longer able to continue with only a few syllable spells, his eyes gradually lost their looks, Yang Tian fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Archer can't shoot him, the Elf Master can't hit him, but the Elf King's Bow's range is simply beyond his imagination...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green flame on the wind butterfly is gone, the whole person is sluggish and almost unable to stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the killing of the number one magician, Rogge’s eyes lit up, and he stared at Annas, his lips moving a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas’s face suddenly changed, and Rogge’s soft voice rang directly in his mind: “Dear Duke of Annas, now, when you get two hundred It’s time for the elves to spit out one by one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Layton, the repression of the archers of both sides has ended, and the army of the Layton Kingdom has occupied The upper hand. However, the continuous shooting of more than a dozen giant scorpions in the city of Luoyun also brought some casualties to the Kingdom of Layton. The casualty figures, Marshal Elamas, can still accept, but the horror of the horror of the tyrannical tyranny is not acceptable to the marshals.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infantry began to follow, and the archer's shot extended to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the signal of the general attack by Marshal Arams, Rogge also continued to order: "Snow Bear Knight Charge! Master retreat, send 200 people to protect Master. Elf archers change armor arrows! Infantry strikes, the whole army follows up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steel torrent hits a solid long embankment and picks up The huge waves of the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield entered the most cruel phase of stalemate. The infantry in the front row pushed each other with shields, trying to insert the sword into the enemy's body, and the infantry behind it. Push the front infantry hard and try to squeeze into the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reloading the Cavaliers has been removed from the front line, they only lost more than 300 rides in a single charge, but they successfully rushed the opponent's solid array shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams’s face was gloomy and terrible. He observed the entire battle and kept counting the number of damage. In the general phase of the meat grinder, the lives of the soldiers of both sides are in their hearts. As long as there are no more casualties than the other side, after the death and injury of thousands of people on both sides, the strength of the coalition forces will be reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now seven hundred heavy-loaded knights who have regrouped after the battle, waiting for orders. Marshal Alams carefully looks for weaknesses in the formation of the opponent, ready to give the opponent a fatal blow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle on Rogge’s side is much more beneficial. The tight-fitting infantry formation of Annas was already in turmoil, and the Snow Bear Knight rushed in. The heavy infantry turned inconvenient, but the defensive power was very strong, and the Snow Bear Knights immediately went into a hard battle, one by one and immediately smashed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, the reloaded infantry of Annas met the nemesis, the armor-piercing arrow shot by the elf full-time archer at close range! These armor-piercing arrows are half heavier than the ordinary bows and arrows. The arrows are sharp and hard, and only a few tens of meters apart. The elf archer can easily hit the weak parts of the armor. The armored arrows are highly toxic, even if the meat is not deep, as long as the blood is seen, the soldiers of the middle arrow will soon be poisoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf archer has three thousand infantry guards in front of him, and the arrow-fired enclave of the scorpion increases the casualties of the soldiers of Annas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Snow Bear Knight also fell into the enemy line and could not withdraw, and the casualties were expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ordered again that the 100-year-old dark-faced knight led by Ajani was dispatched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still firmly established in the Chinese army. Now Marshal Alams has begun to gain the upper hand. If the enemy retreats into the city, it is not too difficult for Rogge, who still maintains a lot of magic, to break the gate. This is also an important reason why the Three Principality of the Highlands chose to fight in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani took out the clouds, and under her vindictiveness, the clouds began to shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her vindictiveness is getting higher and higher, and finally the golden raging flames rise to the sky! Rogge sensed Ajani's grudge, and his mind counted: "Eleven, twelve, thirteen... four!... No, it is fifteen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge was shocked, when did Ajani actually break through to fifteen? Moreover, the vindictive form also changed the most common green and natural temperament of the elf and became an unknown vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at Ajani somewhat strangely, but at the same time his heart was settled a lot. The strength of Ajani has become more and more powerful, and it is not life-threatening to deal with the ordinary soldiers under Annas. As for why her strength has improved so fast, it is not too late to ask after the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, Rogge always felt that Ajani’s vindictive flame burned too much, and it’s like a desperately showing the moment. Flowers...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ajani turned her head and just caught up with Rogge’s gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face is hidden in the helmet, Rogge can't see her expression, but sees a faint mist in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani looked at Rogge deeply, and his eyes contained endless love, reluctance, jealousy, and...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
