			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of adventurers wandering in the Central Mountains like locusts, they are crazy searching for the wealth of the dragon, the city of the elves and the tomb of the undead . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of God has not been seen by adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley facing the city of Sarah is extremely steep, and the exit has grown into a dense virgin forest under the massive natural magic of the Elf. The illusion of the ancient tree of the gods of the gods makes this forest look like a billion-year-old adventurer has not penetrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still an imminent crisis behind the prosperity of the surface of the city of the gods, the three elves old trees have long been unbearable magical demand, began to appear There are signs of exhaustion. Rogge has informed the Presbyterian Church to let them lower the temperature of the city of the gods, not to maintain the survival of any green space and old trees, so that the elves can wear more clothes. But Rogge knows how much the resentment of the good elves will be against this directive. Perhaps this will provide an excuse for the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last hooliganism to deal with Zhao Wei was unexpected, but not more. In case of urgency, what they will do is not necessarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge repeatedly considered, always can not find a way to save the magic of the ancient tree. There is no solution to the magic recorded in the Devil's Black Crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally decided to put this matter aside for the time being. Rogge licked the sun and stood up. It is now in the middle of the moon. Rogge walked out of the room, and Ajani was at his door and was already asleep. When she heard the door ringing, she immediately woke up and was still sleepy, standing on the side of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart groaned, hugged Ajani and asked her to go to sleep. Ajani said nothing, and must accompany Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and gave her tight clothes and walked into the courtyard. The two did not speak, but walked silently under the quiet moonlight. At this time, the night was already deep, and only the sound of the screaming on the snow was echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden hoof of the horseshoes suddenly outside the hospital. Then, the wind butterfly and the five elf guardian warriors entered the yard. Rogge saw that the blockade line was gradually calming down. Instead, Dresden began to swell, so the wind butterfly and other people came back. When they were in town, Rogge was able to cope with the risky adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge and Ajani, the wind butterfly stunned, she did not expect it to be so late, Rogge still has not slept. Seeing that Ajani’s bird was following Roger’s side, she had a shadow on her face, which seemed to be unbearable and sad. Rogge was very worried and nodded, even if he had said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind butterfly and guardian warriors went back to the room to rest. They have been running for a day and it is already very tired. Rogge is thinking about his thoughts, and Ajani still has some dreams and half awakening. No one is present. In the shadow of an old tree in the courtyard, a black panther is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds in the sky are getting thicker and thicker, and there are sporadic snowflakes falling. In the twinkling of an eye, the snow becomes a big snow. The wind is gradually rushing, and there are small electric fires that are undetectable in the clouds, but there is no thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the large courtyard, Rogge still took Ajani in a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes this quiet, silent night, which calms his busy, almost innocent head. Ajani tried to wrap her clothes, and the thin elves were afraid of cold. The winter snow in the Northland was too cold for Ajani. What's more, the snow in the night doesn't know what's going on, it's getting bigger and bigger, and there is a feeling of incomprehensibility in the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani suddenly felt that there was a slight flower in front of her eyes, and it seemed that there was a black shadow that could not be seen. She blinked and thought she hadn't woken up yet, but saw Rogge suddenly rushing, like a slamming of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind and snow anger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was still thinking, but his heart suddenly burst into a cold, and the instincts of life and death forced him to fight forward! Then he felt that his heart was cold, and he had already drawn a long hole by a sharp thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ajani's view, the snow seems to suddenly have spirituality, and the omnidirectional Rogge gathers, and a white snow group surrounds him! She didn't have a long sword, but she still chased the snowballs around. She knew that there was a terrible enemy in the snowball waiting for Rogge's life! It’s just that Rogge’s dodge is too horrible. The invisible enemy can’t help him for a moment, and Ajani can’t catch up with the snowball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly shouted: "Ajia Ni! Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia When she couldn't think about it, she fell to the ground immediately. She just knelt down and felt that a heat wave had passed over her head! She looked up and saw Rogge standing in the same place. If the big courtyard was in a mess, the ground was black and the snow was gone. The snow in the sky didn't know when it disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-sided silver light shield is slowly rotating around Rogge, he can't stop breathing, his face is tired, there is a horrible left face In the wound, you can see the bones of Sensen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hospital, the wind butterfly and the guardian warriors have already started to stun, and they ran out of clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge made a gesture to stop the wind butterfly and Ajani who wanted to run, then closed his eyes and stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood oozes from the wound on his face and body, and falls on the ground again and again. The elves in the courtyard have no one to pay attention to. . They knew that the invisible enemy was still in the courtyard, waiting for the opportunity to wait for the opportunity to assassinate Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large yard, but there are many elves with natural night eyes, but they still can't find the mysterious enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is thick and the clouds are rolling, and the little snowflakes are gradually falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly flutters in a pale gold, and she holds a small and exquisite jasper, and the beautiful eyes begin to shine. Her slender ears suddenly moved, and the whole person suddenly turned to the corner and made a fuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Rogge also opened his eyes, the silvery light in his eyes flashed like lightning! The elf in the courtyard suddenly felt that the entire courtyard suddenly swayed, and there was a stun in the head. Only the martial arts fan of the highest martial arts knows that this is only her illusion, and the courtyard has not moved at all. This is the first time she has experienced the spiritual impact of Rogge. Although she is only marginal, she is still surprised to open her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black shadow that suddenly disappeared from the corner of the wall. The black shadow struggled and slowly turned into a solid, which turned out to be a beautiful black panther. It was supposed to be a very strong black panther, but now it was languid, unable to lie on the ground, but a pair of beautiful eyes looked at Rogge without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves looked at each other and couldn’t hide the surprise in their hearts. They have all seen that this black panther is made up of Druid's unique deformation skills. However, Druid has always been in good relations with the Elves. The only son of the Northern Druid, the wrath of the Sky, is here to help Rogge. Why did this Druid come to assassinate the Elves of the Elves? Judging from the assassination of the ghosts, the level of Druid cultivation is already very high. Such a high-level Druid will not know the existence of the four Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internals of the difficult morality have been split? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts in the wind butterfly have not been finished, Rogge is angry: "I still don't give me a prototype! Damn Druid! "He hasn't been so close to death for some time, and he is now in a state of anger." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves’ heads were slamming again, and there was a guardian warrior’s leg that was soft and almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black panther screams, can no longer afford Rogge’s spiritual shock, and slowly begins to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young girl appears in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is slender and body-building, her body is painted black, and only a calm, expressionless face is a jade-like white. She had a conspicuous scar on her face, and a pale blue blood was flowing down her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was attracted to her eyes for the first time. From her eyes, he saw the fascination of the electric cloud, the gale, the heavy snow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Rogge, the silver light once again illuminates, and relying on the enormous spiritual power, he is able to pull out of her eyes. The fat man couldn't help but scared a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to drink, suddenly saw her face, exclaimed: "You are Amy! Are you still alive?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the battle of Green Dragon Trillen Hugh, Rogby thought that everyone in Druid Village had died under the hands of the Last Judiciary. I didn’t expect Amy to be alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy staggered and stood up, her quiet voice with a strange wind whistling:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I am not dead, although I was in a country of death, but I was saved back by the great god of nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge noticed that there was a scary big scar on her top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And fortunately, the god of nature sent you to the North, so I came to revenge and revenge for the entire Druid village." Amy calmly said. It is like telling something that has nothing to do with yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart jumped, and he suddenly felt that Amy made him feel very uncomfortable, and he didn’t know what was wrong. Suddenly, a fierce murderous murder came out from the depths of his soul, and his eyes suddenly became blood red, and then he was crushed by silver. Although Rogge can't control himself, he doesn't want the elves to know what they have done. He waved his hand and told the wind butterfly, Ajani and the elves to go back to the room. He asked someone to interrogate Amy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves returned to the room, but the wind butterfly hesitated. Her martial arts are far better than others, and she feels much more acute. She instinctively felt that something was wrong, and there seems to be a huge danger lurking in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, Rumsfeld’s melancholy face flashed through her mind, followed by Roger’s horrible, stormy Magic makes the adventurer a bloody scene of the sieve, and his inscrutable, unpredictable mental impact...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly chills, intuition tells her She and Rumsfeld will not be Rogge's opponents. The final outcome can only be to let the fat man who is endless, extremely sinister and poisonous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly paled, secretly biting his teeth and went back to the room silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajini returned to the room, suddenly there was an inexplicable worry, and came to the window again, looking at the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pinched Amy’s neck and pressed her on a tree, cold and cold: Who taught you this skill? Is it the North Druid League? Who is instructing you to kill me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need someone to instruct you?" If there is anyone who instructs me, then the commander is the natural goddess of Druid. Don't you die? "Amy's voice doesn't have a little emotion, just like a person is talking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge can hardly suppress the anger and murder in his heart!< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to kill me? There are so many people who want to kill me, I am still not living well! Although I don't know why you suddenly become so powerful, but you can kill me, it is still far away! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneered and looked up at Amy, and suddenly jumped a few times in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai The whole body was painted black, but apart from that, she turned out to be complete! Two small ones stood up in the cold wind, and a cluster of black clouds in the lower abdomen was clearly visible.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day in the small village of Druid, his scene with Amy’s lingering suddenly flashed in front of him. Rogge felt dry in his mouth, and there seemed to be a burning flame in his heart! The lower body could not help but Standing up, it is on Amy's body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty is a bit strange, Amy is beautiful, but it is still inferior to the wind butterfly, even Ajani It’s better than her, but how can it be so difficult to control tonight?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Amy” Rogge’s voice is low, "At the time, did you love me, love to die? How can I kill me now? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't regret it, we didn't do anything at the time. But now I have to make everything back." Rogge smiled, he suddenly lifted Amy's leg, put it up, and the lower body directly reached her most The secret place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really want to do this? You will pay for your actions..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Amy's strange and calm voice once again aroused Rogge's desire and anger, and he snorted and forced forward, piercing Amy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of great pleasure swept Rogge like a tide, he didn't expect it to be so fascinating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Rogge was horrified to see Amy’s throat suddenly cracking, and a little cold star slowly drifted over! This is the tip of a fine sword! Luo Ge understands that the degree of this sword is almost unimaginable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold ice covered the whole body of Rogge, he tried his best to lift his mental strength, only barely moved himself back, still looking at the sword Gently and just right to break his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is slowly darkening...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to die? There are so many things that I can't do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last moment, before his eyes, there is a black flame on the left and a pair of silver on the right. Eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani knows that Amy is Rogge’s old knowledge. She stood at the window and saw everything the fat man had done to Amy. She couldn't help but snicker. But because of the eminent feeling of the elf, she always had some uneasiness in her heart, so she kept looking at everything in the courtyard, watching Rogge forcefully insert Amy's body, violently moving, and then reflected into her eyes... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s that electric light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani immediately stopped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge fell to the sky and Amy slowly fell to the ground. At the same time, the two men's throats marked a blood arrow, one red and one blue, such as two flamboyant flowers, blooming in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ageni reacted until Rogge’s body fell heavily on the ground. She screamed and refused to put on a long sword and immediately went out through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is like a serpent's snake letter, quietly shrinking back from Amy's throat. Then a faint shadow flashed out of the tree of the old tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a figure of a black swordsman. If there is nothing, it seems to be constantly moving in the wind, always making people elusive. Only the slender sword in his left hand gave a real feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow saw Ajani rushing over, it seemed to sneer a little, the right hand waved slightly, and Ajani immediately felt the temperature around her dropped sharply, an invisible force. The field firmly bound her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was so set in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni is in the dark. She can already be regarded as the strongest in the elves, and she has already been restrained in front of this person. What kind of person is this? This kind of strength, this kind of pressure, she has never seen in the elders of the Sisters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked at Rogge on the ground, and it was an electric light, and the sword was like a snake, with a shadow, to Rogge The heart is stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani’s breathing paused! Her heart was completely settled at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her panicked pupil, the sword's tip is close to Rogge's heart in an inch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hysterical scream smashed the silence of the night sky, and a few tiny electric fires suddenly appeared around Ajani, clearly defining a circular force field. Outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed again, and she broke free from the bondage of the force field, and then her tiptoe was slightly smaller, just like this, with a fire To Rogge...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of approaching the light, will she feel warmth and light, or is it painful? No one knows except the moth himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the flame is fierce and hot again, Ajani is willing to make such a moth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her slim body has already taken a pale green afterimage and cast it on the body that Rogge fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, her figure is so beautiful and desolate, even the mysterious killer is also moving, the sword in his hands is involuntarily slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani finally grabbed a short moment, and before the sword fell, she rushed to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword penetrated her back without any hindrance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unremarkable sword is an unimaginable sharpness, and Ajani feels that the cold blade is moving smoothly in her body, but She does not feel any pain. She knows that between life and death, her feelings become thousands of times sharp, not painless, but she has not had time to feel the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin sword has been worn out from her right chest, and the sword tip is right, still the heart of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani screamed again, the whole person desperately twisted to the right, her bones and the fine sword rubbed, and it was so squeaky. sound! The sword cut two ribs in her body, but the tip of the sword was finally taken a little, and the heart pierced Rogge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is soft, but under the invincible murder of the mysterious killer, it is no weaker than any one. But he did not expect that Ajani would be so staunch. His usual habit is not to waste any effort, so the vindictiveness of the operation is just enough to penetrate both people. But he is confident that the sword that had just broken Rogge's throat is enough to cut off all his vitality. Now the sword is only supplemented by the special requirements of the Presbyterian Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a glimpse of the glimpse, Ajani’s beautiful figure has been deeply shocked by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her blood as a spring, even flowing up the sword, he couldn’t bear it, nor dare to imagine that she was completely Under the clothes soaked with blood, there is a terrible huge wound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would not even imagine that if such a sword was inserted into his body, would he have the courage to use his flesh and bones to deflect the sword in a flash? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this incomparably elf girl, his heart suddenly became extremely bleak. But out of the professional qualities of the killer, he is still prepared to completely destroy Rogge's heart. But he did not want or want to hurt this beautiful and respectable elf woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His time of distraction is actually very short, this time his sword tip has just emerged from Rogge's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly flashed a purple power, this tiny electric light power is unimaginable big, big enough to tear the space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking through the cracks in the space, there is a gray, lifeless world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several transparent, pale black ribbons that come out of the gap in the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These streamers are as fast as the time and space constraints. Just appearing in the air, they are already hitting the back of the killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed angrily: "Mom! Wasted so much, it still alarmed it! The old men in the elders are really confused." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and Ajani’s body flew up and fell heavily in the corner of the courtyard, and the dying Ajani was still clutching him. The body, the two have never been separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow-like killer has disappeared, and the strange and sharp whistling sounds in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shocked everyone, and Frey and his guards rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frey's face was pale, and he was able to barely see two extremely dark shadows chasing and fighting. The face of the wind butterfly is white like a dead person. During the occasional pause between the two people in the battle, she saw a beautiful figure wearing a black armor. A dozen pieces of a leaf like a lotus leaf stick out behind her, protecting the wings behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pair of white wings, that white, I do not know why, even stinging the eyes of the butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly suddenly felt a familiar feeling from this person's figure, what a desperate, horrible memory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Druid warrior suddenly saw Rogge and Ajani falling in the corner, and he screamed and ran over, just stepping into the 罡The scope of the wind suddenly screamed, and a dozen blood mists spewed out from him at the same time. In the twinkling of an eye, he was so torn into a bloody fog by the hurricane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back! This is the battle between the Sanctuaries! Don't be affected!" Frey screamed! His face is whiter, not just scary, but for other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow-like killer suddenly appeared, his hands flashed in the light, stabbing in front of the empty one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Just appeared in front of his sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask on her mask was originally a cold demon face suddenly moved! She doesn't flash, she doesn't hide, she has a small mouth and a silent scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint shadows of the sky flashed, and a huge sickle slashed down to the killer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer was shocked and stunned: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shadow once again became faint and disappeared. The slashing knife fell into the air, but the deadly sword was followed. It disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Two wings, her figure disappeared again. There was a strange howling in the courtyard!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen stunned explosions in the air! The servants of the government are waking up from their dreams, and then screaming and falling down, as if they were arrows The five senses are sprayed out! Their bodies are too weak to withstand the devastating fluctuations of the people in the Sanctuary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air suddenly shines, A huge bunch of snowflakes suddenly exploded, and then fell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snow fluttered in front of the wind butterfly, she only saw that it was not snow at all. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a feather, a white, feather-stained feather!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind butterfly is in a tight heart.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fry suddenly screamed: It’s a death class! Is it your father who sent you?! Give me a hand!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He roared, and completely ignored himself, suddenly jumped into the yard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sigh of helplessness in the air, a soft and melodious male voice rang: "Lord! You are so confused, can't you see this?" The dark nature of men? The creature that fought with me is obviously a demon from the world of death! However, anyway, my task has been completed, and I can go back. The Lord, in fact, you are dead or alive. It doesn't matter to me, as long as it's not because of me, it's okay! Oh, this demon has been hurt, but there is still something to kill you. Look at your luck!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strong wind in the courtyard, and Amy, who had fallen under the tree, disappeared. The voice of the class came from afar: "What happened tonight? All the people are crazy! I don't want to go with the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtyard Quiet in the middle, the figure of *** is gradually clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she can’t stand, she can only support her body with a huge death sickle, the back wings are stained with blood, and more than ten ribbons have been All of them are only a short period of time, and they are slowly dancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** It was difficult to move to Rogge and Ajani in the pool of blood. After listening to the heavy footsteps behind him, Frey strode over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, *** can’t hold the sword of death anymore, let it fall to the ground. *** No reason, she tried to pull Ajani from Rogge. But Ajani’s fingers clung to Rogge and were deeply immersed in the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak also ran over and raised Rogge and Ajani together. He also wants to separate the two people first, but it is also in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Sinking and whispering to Fred, "Do not move them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She ripped open the clothes of Ajani's back, revealing a horrible wound that could see through her body. ***The wings behind the show, stretched out to the front. The pale blond blood did not drop from the tip of the wing and fell into Ajani's wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni’s flesh and blood grew wildly, and the whole wound was filled in a blink of an eye. She also had a faint breath. After doing all this, the luster of the "Demon Lotus" armor was dimmed a lot, and the black streamers were also taken back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Take a gentle shot of Ajani’s back, Ajani moved a little, her hands loosened, and she fell asleep peacefully. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Gently put her aside, then quietly look at the unmoving Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark black ‘Demon Lotus’ glove sneaked away, revealing a pair of crystal-clear, almost transparent hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak suddenly stayed! I saw these hands, and at the same time I still have the wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The hand is a little trembling, gently stroking the face of Rogge...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How? Is he still saved?" Frei asked anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***He looked up and looked at Frey. The devil's face on the mask smiled and I was not afraid that I was a devil. Will you kill all of you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak stayed, said: "If it weren't for you, my brother would have been killed by the class!" I don't care which world you come from, angels, devils, I only know that without you, the brothers have already died! Is he still saved? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Sigh gently, I am...the same. He is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" Frey screamed! He only looked down at Rogge carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s face is very quiet, just like falling asleep. However, there is no anger at all, just like the same statue. There was a red line on his throat, and Frey knew that it was an extremely smooth and neat cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak’s voice trembled, and he suddenly yelled at him: “Death class! I will definitely want your dog! You wait for me!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A courage is big enough, the warrior who barely came to him whispered: "The Lord! The class is a long-time friend of the Sky Fury! The villain bluntly said that this time the task of the class is probably the meaning of the elders' home. The masters of the class, the strength of the class is unfathomable and you will do so, the anger of the sky will be very unhappy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fry calmed down, he was silent for a while, and said: "Thank you for your reminder. I understand, the task assigned to the class is my father, the North Druid's wrath of the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior is a little afraid of the thunder, you should never be impulsive..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak coldly said: "I didn't have the urge, I was fed up, I was fed up with the elders, I was fed up with the city of Yunxiao, and I was fed up with the sky. Wrath adults. Go back, go and say to the angry man of the sky, just when he has never had such a wayward and perverted son! In fact, he gave the class such a task, and he didn’t care if he had such a son. And tell the class, I will no longer be the son of Sky Fury, let him kill me! If he does not come, I will go to him a few years later. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
