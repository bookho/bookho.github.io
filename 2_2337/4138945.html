			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;盛世年华卷章十二相忘下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanli Icefield has ushered in a new day . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment of the night and the hustle and bustle, Rogge is striding. In front of him, it is still the night of the blue moon and the cold star, and behind him, is the Wandao gold snake dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His speed has reached its limit, and the fat figure flickers and flies, and if it is a meteor, it flashes on the endless ice sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This race with the morning light finally ended with Rogge’s defeat, and a little red morning light in the golden color filled his whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and suddenly set his footsteps. On the sky in front of him, he was slowly descending from a figure of pale golden light, and Rogge immediately recognized Macbeth, which was not seen for a long time. Only this time, Roger always felt that Macbeth was a little different from before. From time to time, his pale gold body will fly out more than ten golden stars, and every starburst contains a lot of sacred atmosphere. After the stars dance in the air for a while, they will gradually dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth doesn't care about these stars, but Rogge feels more acute at the moment. And the dragon eye of the left eye is not just a symbol of strength, it itself contains a very strong insight, you can see many things that ordinary people can't see. Combined with the scanning of mental power, Rogge immediately discovered that every point of Macbeth's body was flying, and his body composed of golden light became weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen O'Reilly?" Macbeth smiled and asked. This smile makes his handsome and majestic face more attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! After seeing her, I have a new direction since then. I just regret why I didn't listen to you at the beginning. Going to the sky earlier." Look at the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not too late, but it is not too early. Unfortunately, I still know too little about the domain of the gods. Otherwise, you should be able to remind you earlier. Come over, let me see your strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth raises his hand and points to Rogge, a piece The light golden light falls like a waterfall. Sprinkled to Rogge. Rogge stood in the same place and did not move. Let those golden rays pass through. Only the fat man had another idea. His mental strength was one, and Jin Mang quietly cut off a piece and left it in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth smiled slightly and said: "The power that does not belong to you will eventually dissipate. Even I can't keep them, how can you occupy it?" You should have learned. I have already taught you, so it is not necessary to secretly analyze the attributes of my strength. If you need more powerful power, you should go to Auger Reich."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rug's skin is thick, and it is not red at this time. But although he would be embarrassed, but the thing to the mouth is that nothing will be spit out, so he still left that small group of gold awns in the body, just said: "The more I practice, the more I find myself before. The way to go is wrong, and the overall transformation of the attributes has happened. So Macbeth, you should teach me all the knowledge you understand, so that I can cope with different situations. As for O'Reilly , 哼..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth laughed and said: "O'Reilly is indeed very special. Of course, I am referring to the one now called Fengyue. She understands The way of strength is very unique. You must not imitate it. And with her character, it will not be a good teacher. If you really need to improve your strength, I think her first thought should be to directly transform you. So I am not talking about her, but another O'Reilly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asked: "Another O'Reilly? I want to I have seen it, she called...called..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "You ask her name yourself." Macbeth smiled and said: "You should learn more about how to use strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The endless winds around the city suddenly solidified, and a faint murderous silence shrouded the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the frosty Wella stepped out of the void, staring coldly at Macbeth. This time she did not wear the demon lotus, but in the hands of the dragon soul guns on the gunpoint constantly burst out of a group of electric fire body. Apparently she was full of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Wella's murderous, Macbeth has no fear. Smiling and replied: "I did say a lot more. But there is no chance to say it later. Although I am not as powerful as you, the only work I have done is to praise God. But you are too focused on strength. Although I am still short in this plane, I do understand more in some respects than you. Why do you want to stare at him? What is the significance of this? Think about it carefully!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner’s eyes were more angry, she stared at Macbeth, and the murderous murder came out. Only slowly, her killings gradually disappeared. In the end, she just sighed a little and said: "You...just say what you want to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Before she left, she glanced at Rogge, just as the fat man looked at her like a smile. It’s just that the fat man’s eyes are on her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s anger just revived immediately, and the thunderstorm that had been brewing for a long time on the Dragon Soul’s gun suddenly flew out and knocked the fat man down to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fat man struggled to climb with an electric fire, Wella had already left, only Macbeth still smiled at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, I should tell you how to use all kinds of power, and choose by yourself. This is all my memory of power and Know, you comprehend yourself." Macbeth raised his hand, a group of holy crosses condensed by countless tiny golden characters flew out from the fingertips and slowly flew to Rogge. Only with the Holy Cross at the same time, there are dozens of golden stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge let the Holy Cross sneak into his chest, he just stared at the stars that flew around, suddenly said: "Macbee, you The current situation seems to be a little bit normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe's smile is unchanged, calmly said: "You also see it? Yes, my body is working A little bit of demise, and this process can't be reversed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this? In this plane, who can have this ability to destroy your ontology? Is it a natural goddess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s Achilles. The great light angel created by the great Tiratemis is really powerful. This time, Achilles apparently prepared enough means to deal with the lower gods..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Macbeth can't help but smile, and continues: "I didn't even see him, I was dismissed from the primary godhead that I just got the power of faith. Since the godhead has been disintegrated, then Everything traces will die out. Hey, Achilles... If he didn't suddenly choose self-destruction at the last moment, I think we will all fall in front of him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned: "As far as I know, after the angel is destroyed, the soul will return to heaven and be born again. Unless... is in some very special circumstances. I miss you. At the beginning, you should be able to choose to destroy, and then return to heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth nodded, proudly said: "The earth is true. If I chose to destroy, then黛Rieh could not trap my spiritual body. After returning to heaven, the great Frian Mill would recreate my existence. But she put the power of faith in front of me! From the power of faith From a moment on, I foresaw the end of today's destruction. I don't know why I came to this conclusion. But I know that I will not be a god for a long time with my help. Now, I am, after all, I already have a godhead, so I don't regret it. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Rogge silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for the eternal existence in exchange for the moment of the gods, in exchange for a splendid moment in the ordinary life, is it worth it? Rogge always thought he knew the answer to this question. But now he suddenly feels another choice. It can't be said that it is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth’s ambitions made him and destroyed him. But he finally has the right to choose, so he has no regrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more Jin Mang on the white body, he indulged, and said to Rogge: "Some things you want to do are going to do, many times Once the opportunity is missed, it will not come again. In this respect, you don’t want to be as muddy as O'Reilly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe finally took a shot of Rogge The shoulders suddenly rose to the sky and flew to the endless sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly had a bit of sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and swept everything out of his mind. He took a big step and rushed to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is vulnerable. On the first page of the book of Hilo. If you say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because God is fragile, except for the lowest gods. You will choose to open up your own domain in the niche plane, and not let your body stay in a plane with many powerful existences. In the field that God has opened up, he will have great convenience, because many rules in the field will be formulated by God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the middle of the first page of the book of Hilo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book of Hilo, the lowest gods, such as Macbeth, are not recognized as gods, but can only be classified as There is no such thing as a kind of thing between God and secular existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the wind and witnessing the splendid destruction of Macbeth, Rogge finally understood what was said on the first page of the book of Hilo. . But there is a saying that he can't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods are not omnipotent, and Hilo is omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty knows that Fengyue has already opened up its own field of God. Only in this process, she will gradually lose herself and lose all emotional memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he wants to pull her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw her time, not too late, but it was never too early, just just had time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For possession, the fat person chooses to forget. He will run all the way along the path of strength until he can pull back her from the domain of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes took a satisfied smile and talked to Rogge all the way to go outside his room. He reached out and pushed the heavy traps on the door and he was pushed away. Just the moment the door opened, the smile on the face of Xiusi immediately solidified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge probe, also saw the horror in the house of Xiusi, his face immediately became very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes slowly walked into the room. Although he walked step by step, his footsteps were so light that he was light. He didn't look at the ground at all, just squatting back and forth in the room. Only when his footsteps passed, all things remained the same, and even the tea scattered on the ground did not break or turn over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked around the room, his face had become iron blue, looked up to the south, and there was a murderous flash in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge couldn’t see the expression of Hughes, he stood at the door. The expression was weird and asked: "Elder Chess, what's wrong with this? Your old nest is actually made for people to copy? Hehe. This is not like a four-hundred-year killer!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hughes turned around, his face was restored to his usual elegance and calmness, smiling: "Rogge, not a thief who visited my room." It’s just that someone has sent a message. But this is not a good news.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately asked: “What news?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for why a message will completely renovate the room of Xius, and who has this ability, can deliver messages in such a hegemonic way, the fat is not a sentence ask. He knew that asking was also a question. What Hughes wants to say is always going to figure out a way to tell the fat man. If he doesn't want to say it, he can never ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good news, two bad news." Hughes was not in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether you say which one is better." The fat man leaned back on the door and did not hurry back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the city of the gods has been ruined, this is bad news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Xiusi smiled slightly. Just saying: "The good news is that you will have more than 50,000 elves from now on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man stunned, and was temporarily made up by this huge gap. Overwhelmed, he has been worried about the lack of elves and low fertility. I didn’t expect that there would be 50,000 more elves now, but this is a good news! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the other bad news is that if you are not moving fast enough, all your elves, whether new or old, will probably fall on the orc army. Under the knife axe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge calmed down, he thought a little, frowning and asked: "Don't the Green Sea let the orcs give it? This is not too Maybe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes sighed and said: "I thought it was impossible. But the impossible thing happened. It is said that it happened. More than a hundred thousand orc army swept the entire green sea, and now more than 50,000 surviving elves have arrived in the city of the gods. But the city of the gods must not stop the orcs that followed, so they chose to retreat to the underground fortress. Now, it is estimated from time that the orcs have just arrived at the abandoned city of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at Hughes and asked: "Repair Elders. You have the books of Hilo in your hands. How can you not know about such a big thing in the Green Sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on the face of Hughes slowly disappeared. Shen said: "I really don't know. I think there must be a guy behind the orc. The orc suddenly becomes so powerful. It should be his masterpiece."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge wants to continue to ask why the 200,000 elves in the Green Sea will not be able to withstand more than 100,000 orcs, but when he counts time, his face is changed again, frowning: "No, one day orcs The striker will arrive at the underground fortress! He is, these elves are mine, and nothing can be hurt in the hands of the orcs! Elder Chess, I am going to look at the underground fortress now, what can you do? No?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes immediately said: “I just built a directional portal there, Rogge, if you want to go, we can go Take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, there was a magical glow in the middle of the underground fortress that the three kings spent in a long time. When the light dissipated, Rogge and Hughes had already stepped out of the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was psychologically prepared, Rogge was shocked by the sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer the magic array to a very wide hall center. Every other distance on the walls of the hall, there is a magic light. Dozens of magic lights light up the entire hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the air in the hall is filled with the pungent smell of bloody suffocation and drugs. The rows are lying neatly in rows of severely wounded elves, low The low embarrassment echoed in the whole space, and at first glance, the wounded could not seem to end! Dozens of elves shuttled back and forth, caring for the injured elves, and they were too busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground fortress was originally designed for the elves of the city of the gods, and can accommodate more than 10,000 elves. But at the same time, there were 50,000 more elves, and they immediately became extremely crowded. Even these injured elves can only be lined up one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of seriously injured elves, it sounds like this casualty is not big, but when they appear at the same time, that kind of shock, not a Simple numbers can accommodate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at it all without a word, his eyes slightly picked up. His hands seem to be casually behind him, but occasionally a small flame of magic is blown up on the clenched fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden whisper in the hall, and a light figure came to Roger and Hughes like a gust of wind, it was Effie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are finally here!" Effie said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do these are the orcs doing?" Rogge asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. I heard that this time the beasts are very powerful and the number is very large. They also have many war behemoths that they have never seen before." Effie replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded and looked gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
