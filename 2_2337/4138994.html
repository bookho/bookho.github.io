			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book of the seventh day of the last day (1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth day of the afterlife<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twins in the hall are as quiet as ever, but the alternating ice and fire of the past has been replaced by soft warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue is still standing in the air, just like it has never been seen for thousands of years. However, the flame in the hall is only a small flame at the moment, which is erratic and seems to be extinguished at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s arms holding the sorrow of the wind and the moon, quietly standing in front of the statue, seems to have turned into a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sun of the mystery jumped out of the horizon, Rogge’s eyes finally opened. He glanced at the statue deeply and slowly landed on the ground and walked outward. As he left, an invisible force field gradually disappeared, and the Holy Flame in the temple began to heat up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of coming out of the twin halls, Rogge suddenly became soft under his feet, almost fell to the ground, squatting with a slashing knife to support the body, this did not fall Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue suddenly had a line of anger, and always looked at the front of the gaze slightly, looking at the direction of the main entrance of the Twin Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dizziness caused by the force of force, the fat man struggled again and stood up straight, step by step slowly to the purgatory angel temple. The heavenly flame is powerless, and even if Rogge has turned all his power into a sacred attribute, he can't completely suppress the damage caused by the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is full of indescribable strength, and Rogge’s body is empty, and the power of everything is in great desperation. He began to slowly absorb the forces that were free from the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After capturing a victoria in the day, Roger was as usual. Secretly intercepted a piece of her own strength, day and night to explore the secrets of Victoria in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thirteenth angel, that is the transcendental existence of many angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the teachings, the power of the wise angel is enough to tear the evil god of the ectopic face. Today's fat man has reached a new stage in his cognitive power. He knows that Andreioli, who is unclear, is the power of Victoria that he saw on the day, and is enough to defeat and destroy the goddess of ice and snow. Fortunately, the power of Victoria was completely suppressed when the war began. Many battle angels also die, otherwise. Rogge is destined to destroy only one way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few days of quietly exploring the breath of Victoria, the fat man finally realized. For this reason, he discovered the extremely hidden power of the Purgatory Angel Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breath has a slight resemblance to the atmosphere that Victoria carries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is no longer the power of you and me, as long as he can absorb it, he will be eclectic. Rogge went to the main hall step by step, and every step he took, his pace would be solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while. The most powerful people in more than a dozen churches gathered at the top of the Great Temple of Light to prepare for the discussion of heresy and the development of the church. As the owner of the sanctuary, the fat man is only under the Pope and Augustus in real power, and of course he is also present. It is only Rogge's interest in cruelty, and it is even less likely to have any interest in the development of the Church of Light. Therefore, such meetings have always been able to hide. But as long as it involves the issue of dividing money, the fat man will definitely attend, and he will be fierce and embarrassed when he fights for something. The reason is also high-sounding, quite a bit of the profiteers of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after the church was returned to the fat master, although several people died in the first few days, the later people, rights, things, money, all The more abundant it is, the more it benefits than the past. This can also be said that the fat man brought a little surprise to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a big round table. Rogge sat sullenly, listening to a cardinal in turn, and yawning impatiently. The cardinal, who was in the midst of a long story, was in his early forties. He looked at him and looked at Rogge. But the fat man only did not see, but also a yawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in addition to Rogge at the round table. The pope also leaned back on the back of the chair, and it seemed that he was completely awake, and Augustus had his eyes lowered, as if he had completely turned a deaf ear to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aged cardinal finally stated the affairs of the parish, stood up and began to recite the spell. The round table slowly rises with a faint mist, and in the mist, the outline of the entire parish gradually emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal pointed out to a precipitous mountainous area, saying: "Those heresy are gathered in this place..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal has not finished, suddenly see the Pope open his dim eyes, looking at the topographic map of the magic, the flash of light is weak, but somehow, The cardinal was so scared that he almost stunned and almost sat back in the chair! When he fixed his mind and looked at the Pope again, he discovered that he did not know when the Pope had restored the look of lifelessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus suddenly said: "These heresy will be handled by me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The cardinal was shocked and happy, and did not understand why the blood angel Augustus would become so enthusiastic. Before he could suppress his excitement, he expressed his gratitude to Augustus for his elegant and courteous manner. He heard that Rogge yawned very loudly and sat up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s gaze, sweeping away the boring appearance, and laughing at Augustus: “Sweeping heresy is always the responsibility of the church. If you don't dare to disturb your holy knights, let alone the mountains, is it not convenient for the knights to walk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus are all expressionless , faintly said: "It doesn't matter, I will personally lead the Holy Cross Knight to go to chaos, efficiency should be faster than your sacred church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog The face changes slightly. There are about a hundred of the Knights of the Holy Cross. It is a secret corps newly established by the Holy Knights in recent years. It is directly under the command of Augustus. The members are angels who come, and the individual strength does not have to be said. Under the pro-independence of Augustus, the strength of this legion really has to pass through the church of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the fat man has another experience. He smiled coldly and suddenly said to Augustus: "You didn't show up at the crucial moment, and now you are eager to show piety. Is it too late?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Augustus has a brow and pauses for a moment. Only slowly and honestly: "The piety is in no particular order, let alone the glory of the Lord God is the glory of the Most High God, how can they be divided into each other? In addition, Rogge, you are so nervous, I am afraid that the land is not for the Lord of Destruction. Service? I seem to feel some other breath from this map."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat looks unchanged, said: "Another breath? You must be too sensitive Augustus is an adult. You must compete for the task that originally belonged to the church, what is it for? Of course, you will not do the job of stealing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for Augustus to rebel, the Pope opened his eyes again and slowly said: "You don't want to fight. Since this kind of thing was originally managed by the church, then Let's go to Rogge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus's eyebrows immediately wrinkled, saying: "This thing is done by Rogge, it seems not very suitable. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is inappropriate. We must believe in the piety of the Lord's believers." The Emperor slowly swallowed: "Rog, go and get ready!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Rogge left, the cardinal did not want to understand why Those heretics in their own parish will become so popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rush of scenes in the church, and a new batch of magic equipment has just arrived, which is being distributed according to the individual strength and attributes of each church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge strode into the main hall of the sanctuary. Briefly briefed Qin on the plan for the next action, and ordered a few names to let her prepare quickly, and then went to her temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the fat man pushes open his door, there is an instant loss of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon are standing in front of the window, staring at the picturesque scenery. And Nafi is lying on the chair, staring at a pot of green plants in front of him, is in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that they are childish at the moment. The color is full, and when the two are standing together, the fat man will always be a little dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge come in, they greet them at the same time. The windy moon slowly drifted away, and it was set up before Rogge, and Nafi screamed and jumped directly to Rogge's shoulder. Her movements were so fast that Fengyue reached out and grabbed it. She wanted to catch Naifei in midair, and she even caught it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Fengyue was immediately covered with a layer of frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled, reached out and took the emptiness, took the death knife and handed it to the wind. She draped her head slightly, took the sickle and threw it into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and reached out to the wind. The wind and moon glimpsed a little, habitually leaning against Rogge, but immediately reacted, and wanted to go backwards. But when she saw Naifa sitting on the shoulders of Rogge and looking at her triumphantly, the wind and moon frowned slightly, as if biting her teeth, so she stood still and then was taken by Rogge. Into the arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie stared at the windy month, smiled more and more proudly, and Fengyue’s double eyebrows became wrinkled and tighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly has a feeling, a feeling of being fooled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, this situation, the fat man only smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the beautiful scenery is always short, in a blink of an eye, the window has been hanging for half a day like blood clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked out the window, smiled and smiled and said: "The time is up. Let's go, we should kill again."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge took the piano and more than a dozen churches from the transmission circle, it was dusk. Half of the sunset is like blood, and the mountains that stretch below are painted with a thick red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and slowly spit out, distinguishing the breath of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, he raised his hand and pointed to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a valley surrounded by mountains, beautiful and quiet. In the shade of the trees, there are several villages scattered. There are several stone walls in the mouth of the valley, which cleverly use the surrounding terrain to protect the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Killing the light." Rogge gave the order to the piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano is complacent, and greets the temples behind him, and flies to the valley. At this moment, Nephi suddenly reached out and pointed to the piano, and the piano immediately flashed a light bluish brilliance, which was set in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stunned and turned to look at Nafi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let her stay here!" Nai Fei suddenly said. This is the first time the fat man heard her speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glanced at the piano that had recovered his ability to move, and looked at Nafi, and said to the piano: "You stay here to meet, others Continue to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nearly a thousand inhabitants in the valley, and there are a lot of strong atmosphere in it, just like a wolf and a good match. Compared to the sanctuary, they are just strong sheep. Even if the piano is a powerful mage, it is only a matter of time before the ten priests kill the mountain people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred screams rushed into the valley, and Rogge flew to the pinnacle near the valley with Fengyue and Nephi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air, only one piano is standing in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first scream began to reverberate in the valley, Rogge had already set foot on the peak of the pinnacle, and Nafi and Fengyue also fell with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pinnacle is extremely dangerous, with a smooth platform on the top of the peak, which seems to be artificially cut into general. There are several old trees in the corner of the platform, and there is a small stone house under the shade of the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the setting sun, this stone house is elegant and reveals a deep drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
