			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream volume chapter eleven gods under the anger <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chapter eleven gods anger<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sacred scatters, the pair of white and white wings flying in the sky no longer exist, the red and black colors are restored to the dominant Status, only the far-reaching peak of the sacred radiance of the whole body still stands, and the light column that penetrates the heavens and the earth is not dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, only the broken body that was filled with the earth, the blood that was slowly flowing, and the corpse standing in the middle of the battlefield, witnessed just The big battle that happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle that buried three million Mozu warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red clouds in the sky are slowly flowing, and the wind between the heavens and the earth is no longer completely bloody and stench. Occasionally, The wind will bring some acidity unique to the devil. There will always be a faint scent in the wind, which is the last trace left by the smashed angels in the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the corpse, the little figure has been set, and the giant blade, which is out of proportion to its body, is deeply inserted in the corpse in front of him. For the earth-shattering cheers of the Mozu warriors on the battlefield, it is completely indifferent, just looking at the distant peaks that are extremely incongruous with the demon environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy, screaming, a footstep like a fruit-like footstep came from behind the little figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a giant with a height of five meters. The dark black armor is full of sharp spikes of up to one meter, and the long corners of countless twists are from Extend the hole in the armor that is purposely left. He climbed up hard on the corpse, because his body was too heavy. Every time he takes a step, the steel boots will fall deeply into the flesh and blood pile under his feet. Different from other Devil warriors, the giant three-headed chain in his hand will always have a strong fragrance. Obviously, this fierce weapon has already drank a lot of angel blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The omnipotent Lord Luojia, you just..." The giant said in the language of the magical family. When he had not finished speaking, Locarat waved his hand. Signaling him to be quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, countless demons are watching Luojia. They found anomalies in the Locarat on the top of the mountain. The cheers gradually sank. After a while, the entire battlefield relapsed into a dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel it?" Luo Jia suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...what do you feel?" The giant behind Lorca looked confused. He looked around and listened carefully, but he still had nothing to gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia seems to sigh and said: "Just a moment, a god is angry. Her anger even spread to the devil. If you still like Now, just knowing the power and killing, then after another thousand years, you can't reach the position of the demon general."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant rumbling A few times, his laughter also contained tyrannical power, which provoked a slightly larger body block within a hundred meters. "I just want to be with you. The position of the general is simply not suitable for me. You see, how correct my choice is now. In the war of the six devils, only you have won a brilliant victory!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia sighed softly and said: "There were only 516 combat angels killed. This is for the Heavenly Army. It’s nothing at all. Not to mention that the Holy Mountain is still in the hands of heaven, and we are still very far from victory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But those arrogant big lords. When the emperor's sixth demon king, Amelia, and the demon-loving dragon king, they have not won any battle so far! And you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant said half of it, and saw that Luo Jia suddenly jumped up and the long blade swept through the void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately snorted, slightly squatting, three spurs, each thorny hammerhead ignited a thick purple-black flame. At the same time, the millions of Mozu warriors at the same time clenched the weapons in their hands. In their densely packed teams, a group of various hues of light could not break out. That is a sign that tyrannical strength is rapidly increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Luo Jia’s blow, there was no abnormality between heaven and earth. It's a hit. It seems to be completely empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lojas. Are there any fighting angels coming?" asked the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locara looked up at the sky and stood still for a moment. I slowly said: "It's not a fighting angel. It's weird. I just felt that a guy has been watching us all the time. Is it that I am wrong? However, just that guy feels very much, it is very, very annoying! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a group of giant behemoths, like the size of a hill, slowly emerged from the horizon on the far side, slowly coming to the battlefield. These behemoths are the corpse of the demon world. They don't have much combat power. They rely on a huge body, strong defense, and a large area of ​​acid to make a living. They are the scavengers of the devil world, usually raised, and can also be used to clean the battlefield. The corpse can grow up to a hundred meters long and tens of meters high. When they no longer grow, they will be slaughtered and used as food for the Mozu warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia told the giant: "After cleaning the battlefield, you will go back to the fortress. I have one more thing to do, to leave for a while. Before I came back, you have to do the battle to keep the fortress, and never fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant promised to come down and asked: "How long will you go to the Lord Luojia? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple question seems to be a hard time to give Loka. It was silent for a long time before replied: "It should have come back soon. But now...may be going to be very long. So you have to be patient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Under the deep night, a round of high-hanging blue moon is shining indifferently to the sleeping central mountain. Only occasionally, there will be several long wolves that break the silence of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the Central Mountains, the majestic and ancient temple is as old as it is, with a faint glow under the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is dark and there is no light at all. Only with the faint light from the statues of the giant beasts on the walls, can you barely see the hall scene. At the high platform at the end of the main hall, there was only a stone-backed high-back chair with a tall middle-aged man sitting on the chair. He closed his eyes. It seems to be resting, and it is like thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two giant doors of the hall were silently opened, and a black robe mage rushed in. He went straight to the long stage of the high platform in the temple and thumped. Cried: "The greatest Artest adult! There are enemies attacking us, in the previous inspection. I found that most of the sentinels were killed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The middle-aged man slowly opened his eyes, so the two bright lights lit up in the hall. He said with a strange and rich metal texture: "Not most. But all. Not just the sentinel. In fact, now I am in the middle of the land, and only one of you is alive. And your life, too The line will end..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe mage was shocked and looked up in horror, looking at the middle-aged man on the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief breeze swept through his body. This gust has a strange power. Wherever it passes, whether it is flesh and blood or clothing, it will be instantly disintegrated into a group of invisible fog by the extremely hot and pure magical energy, and it will become nothingness in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respected Artest, I didn't expect to see you for so long, your predictions are still so accurate."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the cold moonlight, Adelaide slowly stepped into the main hall. Behind her, Miro, who was carrying a giant hammer, followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man on the high platform holds the jaw in his hand. Slowly said: "I still remember you, are you called Adrienne? Time flies so fast, I have been here for more than 100 years in a blink of an eye, and the little guys of that year are now grown up. But the devil only sent you two? He also missed the companions who fought side by side in the same year. Or, the two little guys offended the emperor, so they will be stupid and ignorant. Did the East and West send to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne smiled and said: "The father is indeed stupid. Otherwise, you will not be sent to this plane. , to open up a refuge for my family. But now it is too late to correct the mistakes, maybe the two little guys of that year are enough to correct the mistakes! But I really don't understand, the demon dragon has always been the most noble race in the devil world, but you Why are you betrayed? Isn't the promise of heaven so worthy of your belief? What do you want, strength, eternal life or glory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne looked pale and she was looking at the ground in front of the high platform. There was a thin sole on the ground, which was left by the black robe mage. The source of the magical source that she sent out should have been able to evaporate all traces of the black robe mage, and it did not hurt the ground of the hall. However, as Artest said, her prospects were biased. Of course she knows why. As early as a few hundred years ago, Artron Artest was a powerful entity with enough strength to compete with the Emperor. Today, in terms of the age of the dragon, Artest is the peak of the body, and the power will only be higher than that of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is Miro or Adrienne, the power of the devil is clear. Although the Devils all believe that Artest's strength is stronger than the Dragon King, but still not the magic king. However, all the existence of the Devils' knowledge of Artest still only stayed a few hundred years ago. In the past few hundred years, no one knows to what extent the power of the generals has reached, and no one knows whether he has gained more powerful power from the heavens after betraying the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this legendary figure in the devil world, she can't be nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne smiled softly, and my heart became like water, and then the golden blue eyes lit up. She said gently: "The legendary Artest, let me use the magic that I have experienced in the foggy field for a hundred years of loneliness to show me my respect!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;??;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro on the side of a torn open his robe, then the purple ice flame frantically emerged from his body, instantly condensed into a dark purple armor around her body, and another pair The fire wing formed by the purple flame stretched out behind his back. The power of Miro climbed wildly, and the invisible power radiated from him. The boulder on the ground and walls of the main hall could not be smashed, and the crushed stone that was shot from the ground did not fall to the ground. It floats in the air under the traction of invisible forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the great momentum of Miro's powerlifting, Adrianne held her hands up and woven a complex and complicated gesture on her head. Instead of emitting a little power on her body, she is constantly absorbing the power of her surroundings into her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne's blue light flashed, and the figure disappeared into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-altitude Artest finally stood up, he untied the cloak, and suddenly he uttered a loud dragon. Then a deep purple giant dragon with a length of 50 meters appeared in front of Miro! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a demon dragon in the sky, and the eyes of Cang Bi are staring at Miro tightly, and the waves are like a wave. The Miro armor couldn’t help but burst into a large group of ice flames. It was only Ron Artest’s Longwei that forced Miro to stand in the air and only slowly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artest stares at Miro, opens a huge mouth, Miro can even see in the throat of the dragon, a little green light is rapidly Light up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is quietly lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sacred light sprinkled from the top of the temple, shining on the huge dragon body of the demon general Artest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Artest is in the middle of the hall without lights and fire. Where did this holy glory come from? Miro suddenly looked up, only to find out when the entire hall of the main hall had been taken away. This holy glow fell from the night sky. Among the sacred huis, the Weina blond of a demon lotus flutters, and her hands hold the dragon soul gun, silently stabbing Artest’s back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic dragon suddenly slammed his head and slammed into the glory of Shenghui! The dozens of long horns on his head are like dozens of guns. Its hard and sharp, almost no less than the dragon soul gun in the hands of Weina!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is still for a moment, lit up between the Wella and the Dragon A little bit of precision, the violent energy storm suddenly broke out, and suddenly swept across the area of ​​the square! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majestic hall disappeared and disappeared into the sudden energy storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a frenzied energy storm. Miro went up against the wind, and the giant hammer was like a flying sky, squatting on the dragon's body of Artest! The giant hammer fell, and several large dragon scales were instantly broken. The dragon's wings flickered, and a swipe, the unstoppable force of the Miro hit the tens of meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hitting the Miro, Artest was like a small bug, and he didn’t even look at him. The magic dragon's green eyes stared at the ground just the Wella standing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon smiled lowly and said: "The fallen angel. Even if you only have yourself. In fact, it is enough to fight with my bright and stalwart! But why do you still have a sneak attack like this, and your power is So powerful, how can I not sense your existence? How about it. Just now, you are not good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina face is like frost The corner of the mouth oozes a trace of blood. She held the gun on her right and pointed to the general of the Devil. The left hand, which was originally behind her back, slowly extended and opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two long and sharp horns of more than one meter fell from the hand of the fibrin, and fell into the dust after one after the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said coldly: "Artest, I have no other reason to do this, just afraid that you will not escape."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Escape? Why should I escape?" The general's low laughter suddenly turned into a straight dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I escape!" Artest snarled and rushed to Wella, his voice screaming still echoing in the air: "The Fallen Angel Ah! You are the plaything created by the great gods. Now you are trying to fight against the gods who created you? All your efforts are in vain! I am the war dead here, the fate that has been decided will not be divided. Change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne's figure suddenly appeared in the air, her golden scorpion shot a thin golden light across the body of Artest before. Her figure is still hidden, but the golden light is still in the air for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil generals completely turned a blind eye to this gold line, and he did not change. The moment when the huge dragon body touched the gold wire, the surface of the hard dragon scale suddenly rose up a steam. That golden line actually cut into the dragon's extremely hard dragon scale, until it cut into the dragon's body tens of centimeters, which dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne's figure flickering, in the blink of an eye, dozens of criss-crossing gold lines will seal the space around Artest. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Artest’s body is too large, and the magic resistance is far beyond Adelini’s original expectations. This little injury is nothing to him. He completely ignored the magic thread under Adrienne. After a long sigh, the Devil General spurted a beam of green light into the void in front of him. The green light suddenly exploded, and the space around it swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and slammed out of the void, and several pieces of demon shards fell from her. She bite her lower lip, her body is like electricity, and she flies from Artest's back. Then he grabbed the backhand and threw off a large piece of flesh from the dragon's wing. Also hidden in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artest is sore, he bites into the void, and actually bites Wella from the void! The generals glared at Wella, hovering in the air, and then slamming into a distant rocky mountain at an unspeakable speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro smashed from the side, hammering a number of hammers on the demon general, but Artest’s tail hit. Miro was shot down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock trembled a bit, seemingly unable to endure the pain of the body being hit hard. In the roar, the rock mountain slowly collapsed, and countless boulder buried Artest below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, if the volcano erupts, the collapsed rock mountain suddenly explodes, and countless rocks fly through the air, passing thousands of kilometers in the air. This fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the slabs of the stone, the two wings of the Vena, if a light smoke rushed into the sky! On the trajectory she left, there were dozens of feathers falling slowly, and more than ten broken dragon teeth flying in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge shadow has passed over the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artest broke through the light net that was suddenly woven from the roots of the golden magic thread at a speed that was not commensurate with his huge body. Going to Wina, who has already rushed to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical light net is broken. Artest has long gone. In the air, only the pieces of broken dragon scales, as well as the turbulent flow of magic. Adrianne suddenly emerged from the air, her face pale, could not help but spurt a blood like water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with serious injuries, her smile is still mild. Adrianne wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and looked at the beautiful energy fireworks that were constantly blasting in the sky. The blue scorpion re-lighted and emptied into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at the very moment. He had seen tears in Adelene’s eyes. But Miro knew that her blood was colorless and transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is not a tear at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most splendid fireworks in the night sky quietly lit up in the night sky.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the fireworks Under the picture. One big three small four shadows fall in different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in the air, the dragon is rolling. In this regard, it was stopped in the air, and the huge dragon body was now a terrible wound. Only the bright dragon's eyes are still shining with calm and calm light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne finally succeeded in hiding into the void when Kankan fell to the ground. Miro was planted heavily on the ground and was already unconscious. Since such a high altitude, how strong is Miro's momentum? The rock that he was in was cracked, but his body still looked undistorted. The strength of the Mozu body is indeed far beyond the races of this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the demon generals have just stabilized their bodies, and the dragon's eyes reflect the figure of the light angel flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden radiance of the golden cross is still as bright as ever! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina screamed and took the power, and shot a shot between Artest’s eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the guns are suddenly empty, and the Devil’s General has disappeared without a trace. Weina was shocked. After a series of vicious battles, she was already very familiar with the use of Artest. The power of being seriously injured by the dragon is that it is impossible to dodge her shot in a teleportation manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s heart suddenly moved slightly and looked at the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, I don’t know when there’s a little figure, she dragged a huge blade and was struggling to jump and then grow The blade waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her long edge is empty, but I don’t know why, the huge body of the Devil General has appeared there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long blade silently passes over Artest’s body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Suddenly a painful dragon screamed, and the huge dragon body rolled in the air. The dragon's blood was sprinkled with his movements. In the bloody rain, a dragon claw also fell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stood in the air, quietly watching the little figure leaping and falling, falling and leaping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Artest’s painful roar has gradually declined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough!" Wella's eyebrows wrinkled and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little figure stopped and held a huge long blade. Looking up at Weina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cold moonlight, this little figure finally became clear. It turned out to be a little girl! She looks like she is about ten years old, her long hair is straight down to the knees, and she looks beautiful and unparalleled, and the pair of hands holding the giant blade of the white hand is soft and tender, seems to be able to be folded by the weight of the giant blade at any time. She is full of magic dragon blood at this moment, so she can't see the color of the short skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The once-famous Devil General, has been cut into dozens of pieces by this weak girl. The corpses are scattered all over the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Loja!" Adrianne exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl ignored Adelene, just smiled at Weina and said, "It’s still far from enough! Wait for me!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was said, Lojay jumped and jumped, and the giant blade could not wave, until the body of each dragon was cut a few more times. Going back to the original place, spit out with satisfaction. She stretched out the scarlet tongue. Putting a small piece of the dragon's minced meat on the lips into the mouth, it seems to taste the taste, and then smiled at Wei Na: "I can't wait for you for a long time, I don't want you to wait too long!" It's just that it's just an empty body, it doesn't feel like cutting it. I don't believe that this body betrayed the Mozu, I don't think you will believe this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the two of them touched each other, the earth suddenly trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and stretched her left hand to the soft face of Locara, which was almost blown by the wind, and the fingers were open and cold. : "Get it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Locara looked innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The heart of this body is missing, you won't find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locara looked very rare and she looked up at Wella. Word by word: "In the name of the Dark Devil. I did not hide any part of this body! I just like to cut things, but I don't like to collect these dirty bodies. That is some metamorphosis of this plane. What the guys will do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena's gaze swept across the battlefield. The brow wrinkled slightly. She has used the insight, but still can't find out where the missing piece of the heart went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia brows and wrinkles, also trying hard to think, the thin little fingers can not help but knock the handle of the giant blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing is not the heart of a dragon. What matters is why this heart will disappear in front of their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Wella knew that she couldn’t think of it again. She turned to Luojia and smiled and said: "Are you called Loka? I hate you, and you have intervened in my battle. Since we have met, do you want to play once?"洛 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia smiled sweetly and replied: "The light angel is a famous fight, even if it is fallen, maybe it will be even more powerful." O'Reilly, in fact, I also want to cut you slowly. You are such a beautiful, that is, for a year, I will not tire of it. But now it is not when we fight. I miss you I also feel that in many planes, time and space are beginning to be disordered. Although I am not here for a long time, I am afraid that when I go back, the time in the Devil has been going too long. So I want Go back to the devil world immediately! When the war is over, we are all lucky to survive, once again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locar looked at Adelaide again Ni, smiled: "You are so powerful, you can actually fool such a powerful light angel to help you. You just ask ? I worked with you "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ed Renee softly smiled, nodded his head toward Logar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lojas licked his mouth, dragging his giant blade, struggling to jump, and jumped into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina once again scanned the battlefield and still couldn't find the heart. Her brows are getting tighter and tighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is always a turbid gray, like the darkest dusk. The earth is full of dead old trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no day and night, no time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the old tree, a strange creature is walking aimlessly. Half of his body is flesh and blood, and only half of his face looks very handsome. And the other half of his body is a half deputy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange whistling in the sky, a piece of things falling into the air and falling in front of him. He groaned and finally recognized that it was a piece of meat that was still warm. The only instinct to tell him that the taste of this piece of meat must be extremely delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he swooped forward and hugged the meat and chewed it. When the last piece of flesh and blood was swallowed, he still tried to lick his right hand with his half tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a magical radiance suddenly entangled his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, he did not know how many planes he crossed, appearing in the center of a magical array. He was very scared and wanted to run away. However, he found himself completely unable to move, and could only stand in the magic circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the magical array, stood an old man and a dreamlike little girl.
