			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;盛世年华章章一新年下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central mountain range of the sky, a large thick snow cloud tight Pressed on a set of long, staggered mountain peaks. The peaks of the wind whistling, wrapped in goose-like snow flakes, whizzing back and forth between the mountains and forests. There is no deep waist in the valley, except that the mountain wind occasionally shakes the leftover snow from the canopy, and there is no other movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak of the snow suddenly collapsed into the corner of the fist, revealing the black stone below. A vigorous and powerful hand reached up to buckle the rock. This hand was exposed to the wind for a long time. The gray skin had a little dark purple spots on it, and the cracks were no longer bleeding. It looked like a white mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hand is slightly more powerful, and a strong figure will turn to the top. The man's face is cold and his eyes are as sharp as an eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and the peak seemed to be facing the mountain wind. Only a thin layer of snow, it can be seen that the landscape is quite flat. After the peak is a gentle slope leading to a narrow valley with curved bends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man is actually wearing the military uniform of the Ayre Principality. He observed the situation and waved again. The soldiers of the Principality of Ayre turned up the peak one by one. These soldiers are old and young, almost everyone is wounded, and their military uniforms are all ragged, just as they have been in the rocky mountains for dozens of days without trimming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have indeed been in the mountains for decades, and it is said that they have fled for dozens of days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the man is Du Lin, who was led by Rogge and led 20,000 Alai recruits into the Central Mountain Range to encircle the orcs. After a month of shackles, the army finally arrived at the edge of the orc activity area. How to deal with orcs. Du Lin has long been rich in experience. He swept the several orc tribes in a relaxed manner, and then carefully approached the last time he met the well-equipped orc warrior. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he marched straight and met the orc army in a large basin, he looked at the orc warrior with a clear, well-armed, densely-armed orb, Du Lin Suddenly found that he was facing, not a powerful orc tribe in anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a powerful orc empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next. It is endless and fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tragic encounters, fierce battles. After the fierce break, the fierce escape, the fierce counterattack, and the seemingly endless escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc's physical strength and endurance are in the mountains. In the past few days, Doolin's ear has been echoing the roar of the beasts all the time. He didn't know how many orcs had fallen under his sword, and he didn't remember how many robes were torn by fangs and claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has no time to calculate how long he has escaped. The sun and the moon are just signs that guide the direction. Even the night when the stars are not there, they can only rely on the belief in God to distinguish the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long runaway and the short restless rest constitute the whole of life in these days, and the night and night are meaningless. Du Lin launched all his wisdom, led the soldiers to maintain maximum physical fitness with the most limited food, and identified the direction in the bad weather and complex terrain. When encountering the appropriate terrain, he would leave some people to serve as the post-disaster task. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These warriors have never returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after spending dozens of days on the edge of life and death. The surviving warriors are all determined and determined. Every time Du Lin appoints the troops, the designated soldiers will obey and go to the scheduled attack location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin only feels that every syllable spit out when the order is issued has a strong bloody taste! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where should Du Lin, who should we follow?" asked his adjutant. All the soldiers’ eyes also fell on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked ahead. The Lord God bless, although they also walked the detours these days, but in the end did not deviate from the road to return home. Going straight along the ridge will wrap around the territory of the Ayre Principality, and along the valley, it will lead to the depths of the Central Mountains. In this snow-covered season, everyone knows what it means to test the strength of the beasts in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifty thousand? Still 100,000? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looks at his men. Today, there are still fewer than 2,000 warriors who are still following them. He is suddenly proud of these soldiers! Almost every fallen soldier. They have dragged an orc who is much stronger than himself. You know, these are just recruits who have been trained for a long time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can he do? Can you bring these thousands of orcs back to the Principality of Alai? The main force of the Principality has already been transferred to the southeastern front of the empire. At this moment, there are no more than 30,000 troops left in the country. They can't stop this group of bloodthirsty orcs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a deep breath and pointed his finger at the adjutant. Shen Sheng said: "You, take fifty people, and follow this road to withdraw Aleigong." When the country goes, be sure to report the situation of the orcs to the adult of Rogge. The rest of the people... walk with me in the valley!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant, just say What has been drunk by Du Lin: "What the mother-in-law! Live! Go back! Do this, you are worthy of me, worthy of the brothers who died in battle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The adjutant bite his teeth and suddenly took down Du Lin's sabre, carefully tied it behind his back, and then led the soldiers to sneak away in the direction of the Principality along the ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin met the cold wind and finally looked at the direction of the Principality of Alei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are his life and death enemies, his only sister, and the family of his soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly turned around and led the soldiers to rush down the hillside and rush to the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never looked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly, who is leaning over the big desk and studying the military map, suddenly shakes and sweeps a heavy scroll from the edge of the desk. When I fell down, I took a bunch of documents and smashed all kinds of paper and scattered them all over the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Ette, who sat on the side and wiped the sword, jumped up and rushed over to try to hold her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia Butterfly pushed the hand of Et. Hands hold the table to support myself, a little weak and authentic: "I... nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she is pale and has a cold sweat on her forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has been waking up for three days. During the three days, he did not say no, he did not eat or drink. He sat alone in front of the window, just watching the sunset. Liter, the wind is snowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of the powerful martial arts magic, the practice of all kinds of curses. One by one through his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some magical notes borrowed by him, and there are also some strong points from the presence of such as Orfeoque. The dark magic of the mysterious and powerful magical royal family in the black crystal of Elysian. From the huge death magic knowledge of Elgra's memory, the battle scenes of the wind and the moon, the mysterious Achilles's ability to show off the miraculous ability, even the holy scriptures of the bright churches that are widely known by the world. One by one from the heart of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt confused in his mind for a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts thought of the end, Rogge’s heart was over and over, and the rest was only the part of Rodriguez’s explanation of the most basic principles of magic. . And the mysterious servant Serrafi stepped on his belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Rodriguez’s memory, Rogge saw the most magical power behind all the magic. And the feet of Serafi show the skill of using the weakest force and using the peak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knowledge and sentiments have long existed in the memory of Rogge, but he has been busy with powers and struggles, and has no chance to think about it. Moreover, at that time, he was immersed in the magical enhancement brought by the purgatory of purgatory in the outer world. There were enough powerful magic in the formal magic system. He never thought that it would take time and effort to open a new magical path. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Rogge did was to strengthen his ability to instantly and silently. And to enhance the power of the existing magical ground. These are simple and easy ways to improve your strength, and with his powerful magical control, it is a perfect complement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge realized the magical power that was slowly produced in the body, and his heart flashed like a flash of light. He suddenly stood up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a breeze in the room. Wella has appeared in front of Rogge. She was wearing a demon lotus, holding a death sickle, staring at Rogge, and nodding her head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you finally realized something, okay? I will show you how to fight. Don't be afraid, I only move up to three poles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swayed the devil and will die again The sickle was thrown into the void and began to slowly make a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stared at Wella and asked, "Have you used a war gun last time? Why are you switching back to the sickle now?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina chuckled and said: "Then I watched O'Reilly without a suitable weapon. So temporarily lend it to her! Use less nonsense. Get started!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice has not fallen, and the boots have taken a picture. Appeared in front of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Rogge, the silver light flashed, and the mental strength caused her legs to be biased. It even let the Vena kick, then the flame flashed in his hand. Almost a hand held a fireball to the face of Wella! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men are driven by the spirit of the weak magic, and the second and the third, if there is no vindictiveness, began to roll over in a narrow space, A fierce battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, Rogge could not be supported for a few times and would be defeated by Weina stormy. At this moment, Wella will stop and let him breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Rogge recovers, he will immediately rush to fight again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Rogge has been able to survive several rounds of attack by Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After one day and one night, Rogge’s mentality began to recover, and he was able to support the time longer and longer. However, Rogge knows that he has used his enormous spiritual power to make magic power, which is really too much cheaper in terms of power. Moreover, with the absolute power of Wella at the moment, I don’t know how many times higher than the period of Rogge’s heyday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sunrise was first raised, Wella was hit with a plain, weak and weak punch on Rogge’s face. Rogge bowed his body, just staring at Wella's eyes, ready to decide where to evade when she punched her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is like a child with incredible skills at the moment, playing in the stormy waves of power. However, at this time, the operation of the power in the space suddenly changed slightly, but for the Wella who walked through the waves with very weak power at the moment. Any unknown change is enough to have a huge impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden giant* suddenly drowned her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena’s movements only stagnate the incomprehensible time, but at this moment in the eyes of Rogge, this flaw is enough to turn into a victory! He screamed, and the magic of the whole body was instantly evoked, turning into one paralysis and then attacking Wei Na. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner only felt a numb body, she was fixed again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the reddish morning light, Wella’s full of sculptural and light angelic seemingly radiant looks like a slight glow. That moment of glory is enough to shine for thousands of years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart moves. If the mind knows that the opportunity will no longer come, he will take care of Wella, and even kissed directly on the slight lip! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of the moment, the extreme of softness, seems to melt at the touch of a...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, time has been frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Wella, a pair of eye-catching golden cross stars, she shattered the heavy space shackles. The shoulders trembled slightly and slammed into Rogge's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes were black, and he slammed his face and slammed it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina did not return, and broke into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog squatted down and looked at the strange and rare gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown, the underground gnomes, although clearly aware of the weakness of Rogge's power. Under the gaze of his shining eyes, he was so afraid that he would not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly stood up and smiled: "I am in a good mood today, let me go! I will dare to sneak in later, but it is not so cheap. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the fat man flew up and kicked the underground gnome out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by without knowing it, and every day, Jimmy will age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are just a waste of effort." The little goblins leisurely repaired their nails. Still lifting the hand from time to time. Looking at the effect of coloring in the light, I squinted at the busy Ji Ma. Pour cold water without mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima is worthy of being the chief oracle of the silver sacred religion for many years, and the collection of precious magic scrolls is not rare. However, she has dozens of secret dens in the empire, but there are some reasons for Fu Luoya to doubt her true identity. At this moment she had just arranged the magical array of the next hiding place, and was carefully cleaning the traces in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Fu Luoya’s ridicule, Ji Ma just smiled, even though she laughed, it would only look even more embarrassing: "I am not in vain, I only know if I have tried it. Don’t you want to know what you really are in his mind?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria snorted, Road: "My status is tens of thousands of gold coins, hey, if he is loose, you should not be crazy about it. I have known him for so long, don't you know him?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can be said, maybe you don't know him!" The laughter of Jimmy looked very harsh. She wrote the request on the paper that had been processed with magic, and intended to make Fulu Ya looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ridiculous request of course attracted a ruthless sneer of the goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But two days later, when the starry sky really appeared in the hands of Jimmy, Froya stayed on the spot!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that there is no sign of weakness in front of the old witch, but the little goblin who has always been fangs has a blank in his mind, and he can’t hold the expression without any trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Jimmy’s old woman, it seems that she still has a little fragrant starryness with Androni. The little goblin tried his best and finally squeezed a little smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she laughs like she is crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You see, your value in his heart is at least an artifact." Jimmy smiled more and more harshly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days, Xiusi’s fine sword also reached the hands of Jimma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes has never used this sword. At first glance, this sword is only very sharp, but no matter how much Kima waves it, it does not emit a little bit of magical fluctuations or something else that can be alert. Even if the ordinary fine sword is so slanted, the sword will tremble a little. From this point of view, this sword is indeed a weapon of assassination in the dark night. Although it has no other additional properties. But if you wave in the hands of a sanctuary, you can not emit any power fluctuations, but you can indeed touch the side of the artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You see, you are worth at least two artifacts!" I don't know why, Jimmy's smile this time has a little mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Froya just looked at the fine sword on the table, and he was unheard of everything, and no longer bothered to hide his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ji Ma let her be in a daze, busy from work. Eliminated all the traces in the room, and then pulled out a transfer reel. After the magic glory. The room is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sixth day, the death sword of the class was quietly placed on the table in front of Jimma. This time, the turbid eyes of Jima also lit up. She murmured: "I can't... this! Is this the twelfth movement of the twilight? Impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya looked at it all silently. Her hand suddenly turned over, and she had already had a very thin dagger in her hand, and her backhand wiped her throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima was shocked. With a sigh of relief, Froya’s body was immediately stiff, and the dagger was only a few minutes away from her throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima Shi Shiran over, reached out and took a little effort to open Fu Luoya clenched his fingers and took off the dagger in her hand, saying: Your position in Rogge's mind is really not low. He is willing to exchange you with three artifacts, you should be happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria Light Lightly said: "No one of these artifacts is his. None of the people who have these artifacts are his subordinates. He wants to let these people take a shot, and they have to pay a considerable price. Think about it, if you have a kind of Artifact, you said, what conditions should be exchanged by others, will you be willing to hand this artifact to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima smiled. Gentle and authentic: "No matter how big the value of the artifact, no matter how much he pays, obviously in his heart, your value is far more than these things. This is the most important thing for women. So you should be happy "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya smiled sweetly and said: "I am of course happy, very happy, in fact I never thought he would do this to me! But I also know your plan. You know very well that the fate of the goddess of ice is irreversible, at least you can't do it. So you only want to retaliate. Just thinking about killing Rogge. Even if you can't kill it. He must also bring him enough trouble. The only card you can rely on is me. As long as I am dead, you are finished. Even if Rogge comes to see you alone, as long as he does not see that I am still alive, you Can you kill him? He doesn't even have to do anything. Just wait ten days and you will fall down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima's face turns into Gloomy, slowly and honestly: "Yes, I can do it now, just Let the gods pay a little price. But you don't want to die so easily. I can seal all your movements with one idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Fairy With a chuckle, said: "Well, we will consume it. You can't distract yourself in the future, you can't sleep, you have to stare at my movements all the time. If you don't sleep, do you have to live at least five days?" With five days of life missing, no matter what you want to do, time will not be enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima snorted, stepped forward and reached for Fu Luo Ya's collar, the hands of the old age spots and the little goblins such as snow ice muscles formed a strong contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s bloody eyes glared at Froya, word by word: “If you dare to mess with me, I will now strip you out to nomads. Go inside the tribe! Even if you die, those men will not let go of your body! Then I will take your body to Richelieu and let everyone see your underground!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria's face instantly became pale, but she turned back to Jimmy without hesitation, coldly: "You are free."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of applause from outside the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, good! Beautiful style, fierce and pungent! It's really a rare beauty in the world! How can your value only end in three artifacts? "With the clear laughter, Miro strode in. His eyes were clear and bright, and the dark eyes in the darkness looked up and down and looked at Froya. It was all without disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima was shocked. She placed at least three warning systems outside the room. The escaped career also allowed her to keep an eye on the surrounding movements, but she was still unaware of the approaching people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you!" Kima shouted and clasped Froya's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro did not pay attention to Ji Ma, just looking at Fu Luoya, smiling: "I secretly followed you for three days, and observed you for three days. Every day you make me appreciate you more! Don't worry about the hand of the old thing, before she can hurt you. Rocknord will cut her into pieces. The only trouble is the death she has on you. Curse, but I will protect your soul. Master Zakzamu will stop the subsequent curse. You may hurt, but she basically has no chance to curse you. Of course, bravely beautiful, you may also Dead, but I think this risk is still willing to take it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro appears calm and elegant, it seems he has put Fu Luoya and three artifacts Think of it in your own bag. However, the warrior behind him was out of place: "Miro! The enemy has not fallen, and there are so many powerful people behind the little woman. It is not the time for you to declare the victory! You have too many words!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted to say something. The wall on the other side of the room suddenly collapsed. Rogge came in and smiled and said: "Mr. Miro, she may be willing to take risks, but I don't like her to take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Androgoni and Hughes behind Rogge, Miro’s face is slightly dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger looks to Ji Ma, said: "Master Jima. The person you want to kill is me. Since I am here, let her go. Let me replace her to bear your death curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Froya screamed, but the voice immediately stopped. Ji Ma has already spurred the curse, which makes the paralysis reach above the head and neck and stops her more words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Jimmy. I am seriously injured and weak. What are you afraid of?" Rogge walked alone to Jima and Froya. The face is full of sincere and harmless smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ji Ma sees that Rogge is really weak at this moment, and it may be difficult to send one or two third-order magic. Surrounded by powerful enemies, there is no hesitation in the slightest. Anyway, the little fairy is in the hands, and I am not afraid of what the fat man is playing. Ji Ma has always been a fierce person who dares to do it, and immediately recites a curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogner looked at Jimmy’s curse until she finished the spell. His face was gray and he couldn't help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Soul is a curse known to high-level wizards. It connects the caster with the soul of the subject. The caster's mind can destroy the soul of the subject, faster than instant magic. Almost impossible to understand, quite similar to the soul contract. However, the Death Soul can only be targeted at one victim at a time. Since Jimmy succeeded in cursing Rogge, the curse on Froya will naturally be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima suddenly smiled and screamed and walked to Rogge, but his hand was loose, as if he let go of Fu Luoya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro’s eyes are bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria just regained his ability to move and wanted to rush to Rogge. However, behind her there was a gentle but irresistible force that drove her back. Androni then took her hand and stopped her further movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro suddenly stepped forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes coughed and took a step forward, between Froya and Miro. Miro's eyes flashed, hesitating whether he needed to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior behind Miro sighed and said: "Miro, you...think big things first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima's sharp laughter gradually went down, and she found Rogge looking at her calmly, without any panic or fear. The calm, watery eyes made her very uncomfortable and extremely uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! Repent of what you did! Please beg me! Maybe I will not kill you for the time being!" Gima screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill me? You may wish to try." Rogge smiled, his eyes gradually lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima is anxious, new hatred and old hate come to the heart, immediately urging magic without mercy, decided to give this blasphemy a mark A profound lesson into the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She roared at Rogge and suddenly found out that his eyes were full of odious and smirking eyes and did not know when it had turned into silver! Jimmy just felt faintly dangerous, and the silver light was already bright enough to be indescribable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Jimmy, there was a sharp pain like acupuncture, and then the whole world fell into complete darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima was in a state of extreme panic for a time, she could not describe the feeling of the moment, she did not even think that magic can actually be used this way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything is still there, and the curse of death! Jimmy is caught in the hysterical excitement, yes, she still has a death curse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ji Ma urged a curse. Perhaps it is just because of the feeling of being blind, but perhaps because of the additional power brought by the curse on the dagger. In her consciousness, she can almost see a dark gray noose in the soul of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
