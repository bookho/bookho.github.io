			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candlelight of the jump will confuse Rogge’s face, and it will make the beautiful and beautiful handwriting on the letter like life. The swashes of a tangled flower branch completely turned the letter into a work of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please forgive me for calling you, because this is what I am giving you The last letter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the palace of Luoyuncheng, Rogge is reading the letter that Ajani left for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no expression, but his hands can’t control the trembling. He has to put the stationery on the table to continue reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me for leaving when you need me most. These days with you are the happiest time of my life and the most painful An experience. I am just an ordinary elf, my heart is not as strong as you see it. Dear, these happiness and pain have already exceeded the limits of my fragile heart."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath, barely calmed down and continued to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't bear this world, I can't bear you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, dear, I have to leave Rumsfeld and Wind Butterfly grew up with me, their position in my heart is more important than myself. I know, you will say that I am stupid, but I am such a simple elf. Although they are young The genius in the elves, but in front of you, they are like a child. I saw you step by step to lead them to the cliff, and let them jump on their own, but I can do nothing. My shallow wisdom can not be tempered. Your thoughts, and fear that my ignorance will destroy your plan, so I can only wait and see.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld is dead, Raphael is not him But Wind Butterfly doesn't know, she always refuses to admit that Rumsfeld is no longer there, just as she doesn't know that jumping off the cliff is not the end, but just the beginning.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly is too proud, I know, she will never I have to admit my advice. Because she hates you, she hates me too. But she doesn't know, every time she respects me as Miss Ajani, how far the distance will make my heart hurt! That pain, It’s not under the grief of Rumsfeld’s death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is very proud and hates you, but she is a good girl. Hatred is blindfolded. Her eyes made her only want to retaliate against you, so she chose the second road. But she didn't understand that Rumsfeld is more important than her life and even her pride. How can she really fall in love? What about you? Even if she turns hatred into love, how can she more love her with Rumsfeld? She will be empty in the end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; If she succeeds, you become the love of her heart, the tragedy has just begun. Betrayed the one who loves him, the pain will be far more than losing life, this is the pain that my limited wisdom can think of. Limit!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never told me Your past. You are like a god hidden in the cloud, let me worship in the distance, but I can only guess your world by guessing. But I can feel that you have carried too many things, although I don’t know that. What is it. However, I still ask you if the butterfly really falls in love with you, please give her a little happiness! Don't let her indulge in the painful abyss forever.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please be kind to those who truly love you, because their only source of happiness is your concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only time I have asked you, let me be willful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are my favorite person, and the butterfly is more than my life. Dear, your poor elf is really a dilemma. No matter what kind of pain is not what my fragile heart can bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, please forgive me, I only have to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow, your elf will show you the most beautiful moment of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear, don't forget me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly has already removed the heavy armor and stood behind Rogge. Her beautiful face also has a cover that can't be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally opened his eyes and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the wind butterfly for a long time, then put the letter paper gently in her hand, faintly said: "Let's have a look!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked out of the room, his back looked incomparably bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a plop in the room, followed by the tears that the wind butterfly could not suppress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, there is still a fire that is not extinguished everywhere in the city of Luoyun. There are occasional screams and screams in the distance, some of the country of the goshawk that does not want to yield. The nationals are still using all possible opportunities to fight the invasion, but these sporadic rebellions are not enough to change the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge went out of the palace without aim, and the coalition soldiers who drove along the way saw him and could not conceal the fear and respect in his heart, and the most standard army Salute. But Rogge was expressionless and turned a blind eye to all of this. In his pupil, there was only a burning fire in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart, all the flames he saw were golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gold, as it has been turned into a burning meteor Ajani...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At that time, on the battlefield, the dark side of the moon led by Ajani was like a sharp knife. In the twinkling of an eye, the enemy's camp was cut. The sword pointed by the cloud, it was the throat of Annas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas’s face has changed dramatically. Ajani's golden vindictive flame has already risen more than four meters high. In front of her, the densely packed army has encountered Chunyang as ice and snow, and is quietly melting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas took the initiative and turned around and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of guards with a four-meter stab gun, the front of the thorn gun, neatly unified, instantly formed a piece of steel Jinglin, stopped before Ajiani. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni, as if she had never seen this piece of steel, was flying from the ground and went straight ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ajani!!" Rogge screamed like a thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless magics in his body that can’t be flashed, and the whole person takes a piece of afterimage and chases it to Ajani! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longma sighed, it couldn’t stand the strength of Rogge’s leaping out, the bones of the body were shattered and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty thorn guns pierced from Ajani's chest and pierced from the back...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Ajani's vindictive flame suddenly retracted, has been transformed from a blazing flame into a real flame, at this moment, Ajani has entered the ranks of the 16th-level powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the vindictive flame instantly melted all the lance guns, and Ajia Nidu did not slow down. In the blink of an eye, he passed the hundred of Annas. The guards left behind dozens of bodies like coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only felt that the flames in the body were getting hotter and hotter, and everything in front of her eyes began to blur, and she could still discern the figure of the Duke of Annas. She slammed her hands and slammed the thunder and thunder, and swept away the body of the Duke of Annas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Annas is still rushing, after running for dozens of meters, suddenly a blood arrow spurts out, even the man has been neatly The center line is divided into two pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless power has sprouted out of Ajiani's body, and the light of the flame even reflected the heavy armor on her body! Her helmet suddenly burst, and a golden fly, the body is like a light feather, rising up...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hot! This is... this is the holy The power of the domain?” Ajani’s consciousness has begun to become blurred. She tried to open her eyes and faintly saw the outline of Luoyuncheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ajia Ni!! Stop me!" Rogge's screaming shock! Unfortunately, Ajani has already disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last moment, Ajani only saw a golden ocean in front, and a soft voice quietly sounded in her mind: "Good boy, you are too tired, come on, come and take a break..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle on the entire battlefield is still a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of officers and men quietly watched the huge golden flames that rushed into the sky, listening to the shocking bang that followed. , silently watching the 10 meters high wall of Luoyun City slowly collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ajani, are you gone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger stood and watched The final, thrilling beauty of Ajani. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coalition soldier suddenly appeared opposite the enemy is turning back and looking at it, so he took an axe and slashed him. The screams ignited the war again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aga Ni, why..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singular smiles appear on Rogge's face He grabbed the helmet of a heavy infantryman around him and lifted him over. It was as easy as a chicken, and then his hands smashed his heavy iron helmet into a scrap. The thick plasma mixed with white brain sprayed from the inside, splashing Rogge's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ajia Ni, you have something to worry about, why don't you tell me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood The brains and minced meat could not fall from Rogge's mage robes. His eyes flashed silvery, and some of them walked stunnedly toward the huge gap of the wall of the city. Behind him, scattered pieces of corpses and internal organs were scattered. In front of him, the soldiers of the country of the snowy country retreated to both sides like a tide, and actually gave him a passage to the city of Luoyun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the soldiers of the country of the Snowy, even the Elf and the Snow Bear Knights subconsciously avoided Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ajia Ni, what have I done, you must choose this path..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Li Xiaosheng, a giant python shot from the city head to Rogge! In the eyes of Rogge, the silver awning was so strong that he grasped the tip of the cockroach. He covered a layer of deep purple scales on his hand, and his claws were sticking out with the claws of the cold light. The impact of the giant python brought Rogge out of more than ten meters and fell heavily on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the horror of the soldiers around, Rogge jumped up and carried the giant python, no harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aga Ni!!!!" Rogge screamed in the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black circle of fire suddenly spread from Rogge, regardless of the enemy and me, the people who were affected were screaming! The black flames on them can't be extinguished anyway, they can only watch the flames burning their own flesh! The flame was so fierce that it melted the armor in a blink of an eye, scorching the flesh and eroding the bones and internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach in the hands of Rogge also burned a black flame, and a black pillar of fire rose from his body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning giant, and quietly flew back to the city of Luoyun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! The brakes that shot this giant python have been blown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a black flame, Rogge looked awake, and he walked step by step to Luoyun City, one after another magic circle lit up in the body. Each time there are five magical missiles whistling out, and the daring enemy who dared to approach him was sieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly bites the silver teeth, regardless of the lack of strength, and instigated the horse to chase down to Rogge. The bow of the Elf King in her hand flashed, and an invisible magic arrow shot like a raindrop, shooting enemy soldiers around Rogge. The elf warrior of the brigade then followed, and the arrow rain that shot at a close distance caused the enemy to fall down in pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, the stunned Marshal Alams also came back. He saw the time had come and immediately issued the command of the general attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is finally over...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge doesn’t know when the battle stopped, I don't know how I was sitting in the palace of Luoyuncheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge wanders aimlessly in the city of Luoyun... The heart echoes Ajiani’s voice repeatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please be kind to those who truly love you, because their only source of happiness is your concern."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In my life, women who had left traces in his life flashed one by one. Lilith, Ajani, Elysses, Androni...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighs, all along, his whole mind is just placed On the vengeance of the Church of Light and the Principality of Bavaria, Elysses did not pay much attention to the people around him and the things around him. What I think all day long, in addition to fighting for power and strengthening the existing forces in the hands, is how to fight against the opponent, throwing the stumbling blocks in front of them. Time is incredibly fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many things have you missed these days? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ajani was around, Rogge often ignored her existence and did not pay attention to what she thought. In his heart, Ajani is a very beautiful and elf, nothing more. In addition to the time of thinking, Rogge will bury his head in meditation and accumulate magic power bit by bit. He calculates his own property as a sinister miser, calculating his time every minute. In Rogge's memory, as soon as he calls, Ajani will appear beside him. The things that are handed over to Ajani are always properly posted. And while she was busy, she seemed to disappear from the air again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani, seems to have occupied a position in the heart of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she fell like a meteor, Rogge was only present, and the gap between the hearts was so huge! It’s so huge that it can’t be filled at all, so great that it makes his world slanted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a little more thought on her, a little more care about her feelings, why did she go to the road? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart was a bit boring, and suddenly a blood spurted out, his face immediately whitened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian’s old voice sounded in his heart again: “You need to leave room for people!” When he heard this, Rogge thought it was just The pedantic of the old man. It has always been necessary to be neat and tidy, and murder has always been to squander the roots, leaving room for it. Now Rogge finally understands that the meaning of this sentence is far more than just as understood by himself. He suddenly remembered that Elder Chess also said: "I am afraid that these costs will not be affordable in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he has already paid the price. The price was completely unanticipated by Rogge, and he could not afford it. Rogge once thought that everything was under his control, and he was only wary of these old people, and his advice to them was not in his heart. Now, he finally paid the price for his arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, who has long been unafraid of the heat, feels that the night in Northland is so cold for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tightened his clothes and looked happily behind him, and the delicate figure that had been silently behind him was quietly gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked so thoroughly and so badly that she completely burned her life in the golden flame, leaving no trace in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog can't find her, and she can't find the mark of her soul. This is completely beyond his expectation. With his keen sense of singularity, the soul of any new dead person can't escape his tracking. Why can't I completely feel the traces of Ajini's soul? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the only explanation is that the power of her vindictive flame is too strong and powerful enough to burn the soul. In the last moment, Ajani has stepped into the sanctuary. The power of the sanctuary is still far from what Rogge can grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You demon! Go to hell!" A sudden, tender and crisp drink came suddenly! A black shadow then rushed to Rogge, and the short sword in his hand stabbed Rogge's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still immersed in his own thoughts. The assassin saw that Rogge did not evade, and the short sword stabbed harder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge raised his hand at random and had pinched the panicked assassin's throat. With a slight effort on his fingers, he was ready to break the assassin's neck. Although Rogge did not exercise his mental strength, the scales and claws on his hands have also disappeared, but the crushing of a person's neck bone is still a trivial matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Rogge, he suddenly made a slight move and brought the assassin to his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is obviously a half-child, a pair of big eyes filled with fear, panic and anger, because the gas is coming, his face has begun to purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge can feel the assassin's skin surprisingly slippery, the fingers are slightly loose, and the assassin immediately breathes fresh air with greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You a little girl is not good enough to save my life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because You are a demon! Everyone in the Goshawk country is a warrior, although I am a woman, but you can't look down on me! Let's do it, demon! You killed so many people, but as long as you can't kill the country of the goshawk All people, someone will come to you for revenge!" The girl's extremely angry voice sounds very clear and sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown why, Rogge suddenly saw the shadow of Lilith from the girl’s stubborn eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilys, like Ajani, is a strong temperament of the outer soft. It was only then that I was only a short-sighted person. I only knew that I was ridiculous and ruthless. I didn’t realize the gentleness of Lilys, who had always been silent. Since fleeing the Bavarian Principality, he has never heard of Lilith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if she is doing well!" Rogge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed, his hands loose, and the girl fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go!" Then Rogge turned and walked toward the alleyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl quickly climbed up and shouted: "You demon, you killed so many people, why not kill me? But I will not be grateful Yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her courage is commendable, but after she escaped once, she did not dare to die again, so she dared to yell far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I attacked the country of the Goshawk because you killed my elf first. If there is no greed, where is the war? This is what you said." You don't understand. Let's go, don't let me change my mind." Rogge faintly, his lonely figure is already walking to the end of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not your opponent! But the people of the Goshawk country will come to you for revenge!" The girl rushed to the back of Rogge Screamed and ran into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revenge?" Rogge snorted and said: "The object of your revenge will be the kingdom of Layton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge returned to the Falling City Palace, now the wind butterfly does not know how long it has been crying, and now fell asleep on the desk. In addition to Aga Ni's death has been too big for her, forcing the use of the Elf King's bow also makes the wind butterfly's vindictive full overdraft. Even if she is strong, she can't support it at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quietly picked up Ajani’s letter from the head of the wind butterfly, and wanted to open it again and watch it again, but his hand kept shaking. He hesitated and repeatedly sighed quietly, and a black flame turned the letter paper into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sleeping butterfly, Ajani’s words are ringing in his heart: “If the butterfly really falls in love with you, please give her a little happiness. Let's not let her indulge in the abyss of pain forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room of Rogge does not know which one belongs to the Goshawk Grand Duke. . He picked up a fox fur cloak and covered it on the wind butterfly, then quietly walked outside the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly woke up. She saw that Rogge was about to leave the room and screamed: "Adult, where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to kill."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
