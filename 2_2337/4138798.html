Before the last moment, every scene deserves to be placed by all the kings. The deepest part of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth knight’s tall and strong body stood up again and again, and a trace of smoke spilled out of his numerous wounds, his face Distorted, can't stop the smoke from the nose and mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The eyes of the *** are once again opened, and the silver light is still soft and clear. She slowly opened the wings behind her, and the golden blood could not escape from the feathers and drip. Her body trembled slightly, and it seemed that the simple wing movement also brought her endless pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But *** still snorted, with dripping golden blood, ascended into the sky, ready to once again into the dense fog of the Ninth Cavaliers . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragic war of attrition is about to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This duel, I don’t know when it’s the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the duel will only be a result, that is, the *** will die and the ninth knight’s existence will not be longer than the *** how long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light of the sky is suddenly dark, and then it is too bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ninth Cavaliers and the ***, all stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't support it anymore." The black martial arts emperor's spiritual fluctuations suddenly passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The duel must be completed immediately, or it will alarm the heavenly patrol." The fire of wisdom. He also has a feeling of exhaustion, but still can support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich nodded. All the smog returned to him, temporarily covering countless wounds. His right hand was a virtual grip, and the left-handed two-finger fingertips ignited the green flame, and the natural flames were held in the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich is cold and cold: "***, if you admit defeat now, there is a chance to go to the world again, see him last. This In the decisive battle, you have lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The silver glimmers, the black flies, she stares at Heinrich, literally: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would rather die unbeaten!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the kings are shaking, even though they I know that *** has burned the last bit of life energy, even if a miracle appears, *** won, she can not escape the destruction of fate. But all the kings of the heart have faintly created a trace of fear and uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only the black warrior emperors who are still struggling to support the sky, silently staring at the complex eyes that seem to be mixed with hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a gray robe, slightly petite and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unyielding ***......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that fantastic ***...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Slowly lift your right hand and make a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little milky white light appears on the right fist, getting brighter and brighter, and in a blink of an eye it becomes a dazzling glare!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the purest sacred energy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the long years, all kings have their own means of resisting divine energy, but see the emergence of divine energy The kings still feel instinctively uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the decisive battle, the reason why *** does not use divine energy is precisely because Heinrich’s smoke can ignore the attribute of energy in defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in this final blow, can the Ninth Knight resist the attack of divine energy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two kings are approaching swiftly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich shouted, flame The long sword went to the chest and went to the chest. *** Do not evade, let the flame sword penetrate through the chest, revealing from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her right hand punched the same punch to Heinrich, and Heinrich left his left hand. *** Li Xiao, the right fist hit heavily on Heinrich's left arm. With a bang, Heinrich’s left arm was completely crushed! The right fist of *** was immediately hit on the chest of the Ninth Cavalier...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures of the two kings crossed each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The crumbling, the wings are softly hanging around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the skylight returns to the most intense blue light, and then the sky above the arena has returned to the constant lead color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich stood firm and turned to ***. His pace is still calm, but the body that was originally black and blue is now gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You win," Heinrich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face has now been replaced by a tumbling smog, only to barely see the outline of the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The body trembled a little, a small mouth, a golden blood poured out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of the huge body of Heinrich nearly three meters, *** seems so weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ninth Cavaliers looked at the sturdy support that did not fall, and smiled lowly, it was not the sky can not support it... Oh, of course, the king’s There is no such thing as vocabulary. Since you are winning, let's do it. Get it for yourself and get it right. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last blow of the moment, although Heinrich hit the ***, but its soul mark is almost completely wiped by the punch of the *** Got.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Sigh with a sigh, the right hand lifted, ** the ninth knight’s chest, when retracted, there was already a small group in the palm of your hand. The flame of blue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the eyes of the Ninth Cavalier dimmed, and the gray body gradually became hard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the ninth knight Heinrich, who used to be in the air and in any of the numerous spaces, has permanently become a stone statue in the middle of the big arena.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of blue slowly plunged into the palm of the hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind started to roar again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Looking at the majestic stone statue, struggling to walk outside the arena.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a pair of white Step barefoot and step into the thick gravel and gravel. A step forward, there will be a few drops of golden blood falling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large arena with a radius of tens of kilometers is originally a small courtyard for a king. But now the *** can only move step by step, the big arena suddenly becomes extremely huge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time does not know how long it has been, that petite beautiful gray The figure is still moving step by step in the big arena.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings have already left, and in addition to the *** in the big arena, only the statue A stone statue that has completely lost its signs of life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countless spaces flew in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is well aware of the risks behind these splendid brilliance. His mental power is broken down into countless thin tentacles, one by one to test the space around. It’s just that no matter how much his mental power is divided, it’s as insignificant as the infinite space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also knows that in the absence of coordinates, it is impossible to find a position in the outer space in a stormy space storm. Just, if you don't try it, Rogge won't give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a trace of his soul in the depths of his heart, and his connection with his hometown jumped a few times. Rogge had to sigh and slammed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the large room on the top floor of the temple, Roger was wearing a loose robe and comfortably resting in the lounge chair, seemingly asleep under the sun bathing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly opened his eyes, and after a while, he gradually adapted to the bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sat beside him, a pair of hands in the subconscious, clutching his arm, pointed nails deeply stuck in his flesh inside. Her face was exhausted and pale, and her forehead was full of fine sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath and smiled weakly: "Dead fat, if you don't come back, people can't hold on!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the green and sultry eyes of Fu Luoya, Luo Ge’s heart was suddenly moved and relaxed. Rogge gently stroked the sweat on her forehead. He had to admit that the little goblin after the rebirth was like a person, just the unpredictable, beautiful face, the lethality is as terrible as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin is on Rogge’s arm, smiles like a flower and wants to take advantage of it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a fascinating little goblin around me, and the stagnation of Rogge’s heart has been diluted a lot. Since yesterday, there has been no cause of uneasiness until now. Ge was really awake. He tore the bandage of his right hand and looked at the dense wound in his palm. His right hand flicked a few times, and the skin grew like new, and there was no scar at all.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s eyes suddenly lit up, and she walked up to Rogge in front of her, with a dangerous blue fire in her eyes, gnashing her teeth: "Dead fat, just now What is magic? Hurry up and teach me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge. His body has been completely transformed, with the increasing magic, his ability to regenerate and various Resistance is constantly improving. The ability to recover wounds is just one of them. This kind of ability is not unique to Rogge. In terms of restoring regenerative ability, the troll is much stronger than the fat one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is somewhat embarrassed: "This is not magic, it is not a big deal." What do you have to learn to do? "The fat man can not have the ability to transform Fu Luoya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead fat, good things you do yourself, how can you forget so soon?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria looked up and raised her head. On her slender neck, there was a very thin pink scar.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog was immediately speechless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All in all, dead fat, if you don't take this scar Give me a way to get rid of it, I am not ending with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya grabbed Rogge’s arm, five pointed nails wickedly Piercing his skin, of course, even the oily skin can not be stabbed. But her fingertips immediately lit up five small electric fires, and Roger was shaken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The little goblin snorted and turned to go out, and the body shook a little as he approached the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at her back without a word. He knew, Fu Luo Ya was just too tired, and she was very angry. In fact, she was forced to show it to him. No matter what her purpose is, at least now Rogge’s heart is no longer suppressed.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge did not have the ability to leave his own coordinates in other spaces like ***, and lost the connection of the soul contract, he lost the possibility of entering the world of death. The last time he was uncomfortably uneasy, arrived. The outside world, the result can save the devastating ***. Now he once again felt the indescribable panic and heartache, when he was eager to know that *** is in the outside world, but now he stayed in the original The spiritual brand on *** has completely disappeared!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya is well-versed in the use of ‘out-of-town prison, and her mental strength is not weak. With her help, Rogge can stay in space storms for much longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Froya didn’t expect Rogge to stay that long. In order to maintain this line of contact, she asked Rogge to come back until she couldn’t hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the picturesque scenery in the valley outside the window, and the uneasiness in the bottom of his heart rose again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in that world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exhausted Froya did not recover for a few days. Without her help, Rogge could not support it for a long time in the space storm. Now Rogge already knows how dangerous it is to travel through space. The fat man of the day was ignorant and fearless. When he first crossed the space barrier alone, if there was no *** as a coordinate in the outer world, and the world here had Elises forcibly recalling him with powerful and unparalleled magic. The spiritual ontology, maybe he will permanently flow to the unknown world at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow of the sunset slowly passed over the beautiful valley. Rogge always stood still in front of the window and did not move. He repeatedly thought about the source of his uneasiness. In the past, I summoned *** and Bone Dragon, but I didn’t get any response. Why is this time so uneasy? Do you think too much? Still another reason? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge temporarily gave up the idea of ​​entering the space storm search for the outside world. He set his mind and began to take all possible clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the elders' home not far away, Xiusi was fascinated by the sun, with a smile on his lips, just thinking: "Be free to use the soul of the soul." Crossing the space, this is something that many great mentors can't do! Is this the ability of 'space'? God makes adults, you are really supernatural..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death has little concept of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***I don’t know how long it took, she only knew that the edge of the big arena, which seemed to be out of reach, is now in front of her eyes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, her black fluttering in the wind is getting smaller and smaller, even though the wind is still so fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big arena is now left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hangs down again in black, no matter how the gale blows, still does not move. In the darkness of the mirror, a pair of white wings are reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The wings of the *** are opening little by little, one by one black feathers fall, and the wind is swept away by the wind, or Deeply buried under the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of dazzling white fluff appears quietly on the wings of the ***, these fluffs can not stretch and grow up until finally stand proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when the big arena has been left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings behind her are as white as new, the bare white barefoot is no longer on the rough sand, and in a foot high, like Walking on an invisible road, slowly moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The ground in front of me suddenly surged, and a huge skeleton suddenly flew out from the ground. In an instant, it was twisted by an invisible force. Smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The brow is slightly wrinkled, it seems to be enduring hard. Her knife-like lips are almost transparent, and there are countless colors in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, *** lips slightly, squirting a light blue flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green inflammation condenses in the air and does not scatter. It always flies around the ***, suddenly and faintly, not changing the shape, and finally finally condenses into A sturdy nail. The whole body of the nails flows with black and black luster, but there is a dazzling cyan in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, *** squirted a blue flame, and another piece of nails slowly formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it has been, and there are nearly a hundred pieces of A-leaf in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the demon lotus is more elegant. More than ten stretched nails behind it are like the same bimetallic wings, which protect the pair of white wings. The whole demon lotus is covered with a complex and elegant cyan pattern, which is full of mysterious atmosphere against the slow flowing black luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes on the demon mask slammed open, and the strong silver awns illuminated a range of ten meters. *** A whistling sound, a force that is unstoppable and defensive from the demon lotus, surrounded by smoke and dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment the smoke is scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***In the air, there is already a huge pit with a length of more than ten meters on the ground. Her wings shook and turned into a meteor, going through the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory squats on the mountain, covered with dust and gravel, if not the spar in the center of the forehead occasionally flashes a blue Light, it is simply a weathered giant sacrum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bit strange around the mountain, and all the winds stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon suddenly looked up, *** is standing quietly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master..." Gregory’s voice trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! You are so great! Too wise! You defeated the king! Which guy is you being beaten?" The next moment, Gregory It was resurrected, and it screamed and rushed to the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Looking at the bone dragon quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon suddenly lost all power and fell heavily on the ground. It immediately hit a roll and climbed up, but no matter how the four thin wings were flapped, the weak body could not fly away from the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! You are so great, your strength has reached this point? It can be compared with the Dragon King!!" Excited Lego is desperately slaps, no matter whether it is exaggerated or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon suddenly appeared, the body of the *** has been shaking slightly, it immediately closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With each tremor of the body, the surrounding space will shrink, and the unstoppable force of the scorpion will flow out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you are slow, like Gregory, you feel that something is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead cloud in the sky doesn't know when it starts to fade out of dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red color is getting brighter and brighter, and it seems that the entire outer world is stained with a burning blood color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gregory looked up at the sky, the thick clouds were tumbling, like an endless burning magma hanging over the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire burning sky is like a huge vortex that begins to spin slowly. The center of the vortex is the mountain where the *** is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly sighed and sighed... Can’t suppress the power. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and caught the cyan knife with a cyan pattern in her hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* **Looking at the vortex center in the sky, slowly rising.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the endless vast alien world, the five kings are concentrated in Elgar In the hall, silently watching the clouds of fire in the sky. The kings know that the catastrophe of the world of death is coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the lower undead creatures Standing in the same place. They seem to have completely forgotten to hide in the depths of the ground, just standing stupidly, bathing in the bloody red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remembering thunder!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, countless bombs began to shake the entire world of death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Fearlessly greeted the heavenly parade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the four-meter heavenly parade, the body of the *** looks so light and weak. However, the size of the body does not mean that the strength is strong. In fact, *** knows that the heavenly patrol can completely become hundreds of meters tall, although this change is meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***I don’t know why I know this, but she just knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavenly patroler looked at the sorrow with a little hesitation, especially looking at the white wings slowly behind her. But when his eyes fell on the death slasher in the hands of the ***, the anger finally burst unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavenly patroller brushed the giant wings of three meters, snarled and roared: "Dirty creatures, your strength is very much out of me." Unexpectedly, but this is your misfortune. The power of too strong makes you unable to escape my eyes! Before you destroy you, look at the wings behind you, I will give you a choice with kindness. Opportunity. Are you bound, let my flame spear pierce your soul, end your dirty existence in an instant? Or are you ready to resist the end, and suffer a long torment in the sacred flame of heaven?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***It’s so cold and cold: “It’s inexplicable! Put away your ridiculous kindness! Your simple wisdom cannot understand what is noble, dignity and pride.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer pays attention to the Heavenly Rangers, only slowly mentions the Death Scythe and begins to gather strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavenly patrolman screamed in anger, his roar shook the flame chariot and could not stop shaking, hundreds of lightning balls fought The car flew out and then turned into an endless mad forest, covering dozens of kilometers of ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was not good, and the four wings fluttered, and the blue and black shields immediately protected the whole body. A large electric post then hits its shield and hits it from the top of the peak. In the roar of the bone dragon, the thick electric fire hit it one after another until it was deeply plunged into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The death of the slashing knife in the hand, the huge blade immediately turned into a dark shadow, a virtual shadow composed of collapsed space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are strange changes in the space around her dozens of meters. Any lightning that passes through this area has a strange twist, and every lightning The direction of the distortion varies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the battle with the Ninth Knight, the *** still needs to slowly gather strength, in order to reach the peak of power, throwing a death sickle made up of space debris But at this moment, almost in the blink of an eye, the power of *** reached its peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the powerful and powerful heavenly parade, *** decided to give up all the skills, only to get the most powerful one in exchange for a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the heavenly patroller has been unstoppable! His eyes are angered, his eyes are twitching slightly, and the flames in his hand are high. From now on, facing the ***. But the huge tower shield of his left hand was subconsciously guarded in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heavenly Patrol is almost furious. Not only because of the arrogance of ***, but also because there is a hint of uneasiness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he afraid of? As long as he stood on the flame chariot, he was invincible. The existence of this world, no matter how powerful, can never survive under the flames of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Suddenly shivering, the surrounding space could not vibrate. She took a trajectory if she could, and slowly pressed it to the heavenly patrolman!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heavenly Patrol hunter can no longer control himself, he does not Roaring in the ground, the huge tower shield hit the flame chariot heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ***, this dirty humble creature, dare to attack him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you not seen such rude existence? a thousand years? Still 20,000 years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death always has a strong presence, and even more powerful than the immediate *** is not just one. They are always humble and cowering in front of the noble heavenly patrols. They will only escape in vain and try to survive for a while. Celestial Rangers enjoy this game of hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple of Elgar, the five kings were waiting silently, waiting for the moment of destruction. Every king’s mood is very heavy. *** Although it is an alternative to the king, she is also a king after all, and her destruction will still make all the kings feel a little sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ***, the kings felt something different, something that was already forgotten by all the kings in the long years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fire of respectful wisdom, if the eight kings are there, we will fight with the heavenly parade, how much can we win?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of wisdom is amazed, there are some trepidation in the spirit of fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been thinking for a long time, and said: "There is only less than 10% of the grasp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In other words, do we still have hopes of victory?” the Black Warrior Emperor asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." I don't know why, the fire of wisdom suddenly felt that this answer was extremely heavy, and it was so heavy that it was almost impossible to afford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior emperor was silent, and the entire hall was once again dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the clouds in the sky are burning, and large swaths of flames are falling. On the ground, there are countless undead creatures standing still. As long as they are exposed to a little flame, they will burn up in their entirety, and they will turn into ashes in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha!" The laughter of the heavenly patrols spread throughout the world of death!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *** I looked down hard at the huge flame spear that penetrated my chest and felt the blazing flame that burned her soul mercilessly. And the Death Scythe in her hand now only has a small half of the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Scythe has disappeared completely when it passes over the wall of the Flames around the Flame Chariot!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The full blow is not carried into the flame chariot...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burning the soul of the soul The flames are getting more and more prosperous, and an inexplicable pain has hit the body of the ***. She trembled, and the silver awns in her eyes gradually dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her last line of consciousness bursts crisply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on?"
