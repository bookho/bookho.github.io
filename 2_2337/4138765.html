			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a month of hell-like treatment, the fire of the demon lotus in Rogge was finally wiped out, and now he only has some flesh wounds. These small injuries can be used in a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a surprise to Rogge that the wind butterfly has begun to recover, and the recovery is so scary that it seems that it will take another month to get out of bed. It is. According to the current situation, her martial arts recovery is very likely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, Androni and Froya took turns to take care of him, but let the fat man enjoy a lot of gentle treatment. In addition to the recovery of the wound, Rogge's mental strength finally has some permission to feel the progress. But Rogge's will is stronger, and he is never willing to increase his spiritual power through the burning of divine power. Moreover, after losing the erosion, such a huge mental power has become inexhaustible, and it is useless to increase it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, Rogge, who was nearing full recovery, was brought to the elves of the City of Gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes took out a dull, light gray chain and threw it at Rogge. This chain is not big, no collar and sleeveless, shaped like a vest, the sale is really terrible, not like the hand of the elf, but it is very light. Rogge turned over and looked at it for a long time, and couldn't see where the nail was, but from the material point of view, it was made of scales of what creatures. However, the silver dragon's fine scales are not only beautiful, but also through the practice of Longwei, how could this look like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was very confused, but he was still wearing it at the request of Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes suddenly picked up a long gun after himself, and the temper was lifted to the top, and a small group of bright sparks sparked on the tip of the gun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was shocked, there was no action, and there was a strong force on his chest, and he was shot out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s, it’s hard to get up, and the chest ribs are still broken. He couldn't help but anger: "Old things, how are you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the rifle in the hands of Hughes, and the tip of the gun was completely distorted because of the excessive force! Rogge looked down at his breastplate again, and there was no scratch on it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this really made of silver dragon scales?" Rogge still refused to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled smugly: "That is of course! This breastplate is topped with the most advanced craftsmanship of the elves tradition, 'historical dust' It became this look! Haha, my old man has always been thoughtful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Historical dust'? What is this, it sounds It’s not like it’s useful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a smile that has been lost in this process, just like the millennium, it will completely lose its originality. The breath and luster, but all the features that can withstand the test of time can be preserved. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger snorted and said how this breastplate looks like a layer of gray. But it sounds like you are the so-called elf traditional craft, afraid of Can only weaken the ability of the equipment, will not enhance it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiusi's old face is red, screaming: "It seems like this. But, young people. You must know that time is the most impartial and unselfish. Only things that have remained unchanged after thousands of years of time are truly immortal! Anything that still exists through the dust of history must be a good thing!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elders of Xiusi, without the test of time, I also know that the scales of silver dragons are good things. You are taken by the dust of history, look at them, even with dragons Weiquan is gone! Isn't natural Longwei not a good thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, Longwei Longwei, as the name suggests, it is exclusive to the dragon The majesty. What is not yours, nature is not a good thing, the dust that can not withstand history is also normal. This breastplate is ugly, but it also has its own advantages. The killer generally has a deputy, thieves, my old man is no exception. But even with my four hundred years of vision, I will see this breastplate at first sight. Think of it as a cheap bargain. A thing that is not afraid of thieves, do you say it is a good baby?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said coldly: "The dust of history, this name is not bad. After thousands of years, the truth of everything has been concealed in history, this is the real origin of this name? This historical dust, presumably On the 'Elves of Ancient Elders', only the things that the elderly can understand and use!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes reveals the color of surprise, praises: "It's true that God is an adult, even you know it. Don't be busy, there is still a good thing here." Said, Hughes proposed a strange long weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weapon is three meters long and has a one-meter-long thick handle. The front two meters are like a giant beast with a few corners. The same, more than ten three-inch long sharp angles stretched out from all sides, can not tell the rough. The front end is staggered with three sharp spikes. It looks like a gun, and it looks like a mace. The handle also seemed to be twisted with two long corners, and a fork was placed at the tail handle. The corners are ground into three edges and are sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inexplicable thing seems to have passed through the 'Dust of History', like the weapons used by the Arctic savage orcs. Rogge seems to look at it, think it should be a giant tooth, or a long-horned hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that is in harmony with Rogge is that this thing is heavy enough, and there is a hundred pounds in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes proudly said: "This war gun is also the proud work of my old man. Just call it, it is called the Dragon Slayer!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is speechless, after a long time: "Do you say this thing is a gun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put a heavy armor under the stone wall and it is a gun. You are not ready to try it. The power of the Dragon Slayer is guaranteed to surprise you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger took the dragon-snake gun, snorted, and made a big stride toward the armor. In the blink of an eye, he was in armor. Before the establishment, and then a shot!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon-shooting gun suddenly flashed, the three guns pierced the heavy armor silently, and did not enter the stone wall Mi Duo deep, until Rogge hit the heavy armor, he stopped!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked, the power of the dragon-shooting gun was too It’s horrible! Especially the irregular tip of the gun and the incomparably thick gun body left a big hole that was over a foot and a half on the heavy armor! It seems that this dragon slaughter is impossible to leave a live mouth. He thought for a moment, took out the dragon-gun, and slammed it, and when the loud noise, the heavy armor was completely flattened. The grid is somewhat puzzled. Although the power is not small, it is not bigger than a wheel of more than one hundred kilograms. It is much worse than a straight thorn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;修斯解Said: "You can not underestimate the Dragon gun, the other end of the Dragon Silver Dragon all angles can be used both in it too! This gun is naturally not just an ordinary long gun, its special power is different. Only when it is straight, its true power will be thrown out. If you use mental power to drive, the power will increase, it is simply invincible! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said in a deeper way: "But the gun is too fierce, and it seems that the gun can't stay alive, and it's not very convenient." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiusi said: "The dragon-gun slaughtering dragon gun, originally not for fighting people, this is the treasure used to kill the dragon, you used Deaf, that is naturally a death! If the monks can leave alive, what is it called a dragon gun! "[< /> /> </ br> </ br> Hard, Xiusi, this old thing is used to screw so many dragons together? Rogge is really skeptical, that is, let the silver dragon screw itself, can also be screwed into this effect. But he knows to ask It must be asked in vain. It is useless to use this old fox. If you are a communication, he is not saying that the killer has his own killer. He is looking for a magical way from the elf.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elders of Xiusi, this is so fierce, is it really let me go to the dragon? Rogge asked half-heartedly and half-jokingly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not for you to kill the dragon, but if you encounter a dragon in the future, you can still have this gun. Fighting on a fight. Just the hand of your martial arts is really not a martial art. It depends on what kind of artifacts can't be strong. But with this gun, forgive the dragon if the ability is almost, you have to take some care, it is very thick and thick, and it is very painful to tie it. And the dragon is so big, you have permanently solidified the add-on, a random shot, how can you get a piece of meat, which is enough for it. What's more, this gun is a thorn on all sides. As long as you carry out your strength and stab, it is a big hole! In the style of God's adulthood, this gun must be poisoned. Since the gun name is a dragon, this poison does not matter to other people, as long as there is special effect on the dragon. I heard that God made the adult's new wife a master of pharmacy, especially for poison. This little thing must not be able to beat her. If it is really difficult, then my old man will be thoughtful, and then go over the ancient books of the elves to see if there are any special poisons listed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and said: "My old man's meaning is not to let God let the adults go to the dragon, but to say that if you encounter a dragon in the future, it is somewhat useful to have this gun in your hand."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge squats, Elder Chess, what did you say? Is there a dragon that will not come to the door in the future? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes adults, there must be dragons coming to the door." You think that the silver dragon that was killed this time just gave birth to a dragon egg. Since there is a dragon egg, then it must have a father. You killed its wife, isn't it going to come to the door? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you know the elders of Hughes? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The roar of the silver dragon before the death, is to ask her husband to revenge in the dragon language. God makes adults, you don't have to look at me like this. Dragon language is not difficult to understand. At least it is much easier than the ancient Elvish. I am a 400-year-old killer. It is not unusual to understand the dragon language..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face is surprisingly ugly. He knows that the silver dragon that just gave birth to the dragon egg is extremely weak. That is the case, the Dragon Slayer team is almost completely annihilated! Now even if there is a more dragon-shooting gun, how can he deal with a silver dragon that is coming to revenge? Xiusi is unfathomable and cannot be more powerful than a silver dragon. He really has this ability and will not sit still. So many elite elves are dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When will the silver dragon come to revenge? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...I don't know the old man." Maybe it will arrive in a few days, maybe it won't appear at all. But no matter what, it is always necessary to start preparing now. "Shuss smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you have used historical dust on this gun and armor, right?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, if you don't have time to wash away the silver dragon's breath, the revenge of the silver dragon will definitely come to the door." Now, it is a bit difficult to find a real enemy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog has put aside some thoughts. This is useless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the dragon gun in his hand and said: "God makes the adults, your martial arts is bad. This is too fierce to deal with the human enemy." I think about my life skills and think of a gun technique. Named '弑神'. This type of gun technique can only be used in combination with the second special effect of the Dragon Slayer and the unique spiritual impact of the adult, so I can only explain it and cannot give you a demonstration. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, this is another trick, in addition to straight stabs, but sweeping! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Xiusi’s call to the dragon’s gun was a week round! The dragon’s gun was slightly light, and suddenly there was a huge half-moon with a diameter of three meters. Light cyan light blade!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the light blade is as great as a prison!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This light blade flies out, not too fast, but the place where the grass is completely innocent!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that this is light Sharp edge to the extreme performance!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the light blade silently immersed in the stone wall, Rogge has a chill from the bottom of his heart, This dragon-gun is also too powerful. The two stunts on the light have steadily overwhelmed the stars!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes coughed to make adults, Just the light blade, all the power is in the pressure, so the energy is not much, you can spend seven or eighty times..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge was shocked and looked at it again, sure enough, the grass was safe. Oh, I didn’t even break the skin...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t waited for him to ask, Xiusi rushed: the second stunt of the Dragon Slayer’s Dragon Slayer The gun blade', we can learn this trick. The first step is to slap a "slaughter gun blade". No matter who you see it, you will never dare to block it. The only reaction is to jump up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge slightly moved and nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If the other party is a magician, then one is enough. If it is a powerful warrior, then in the air to him again to a dragon slapping, he must have the ability to change direction in the air, and then hide. At this time, God enables the adults to come up with the stunt spirit of the day to deal with my old man. They are in the air, hiding from hiding, your mental impact is also difficult to prevent, and at least you have to be dizzy for a while. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's last step is the magic of your master's mastery. The dark inflammatory column makes the adult a magical genius. This magic must be able to move instantly. The other party is completely unprepared, and this moment, the magical black flame that runs through the heavens and the earth is burned, it is unfamiliar, and it has to be baked half dead! If the other party is a magician, most of them can be taken. If it is a warrior, then God makes the adults go up to the two with a dragon sniper, and it must be easy to take. Of course, God's wisdom for adults is not something I can understand. It is natural for you to improve your God. For example, after a mental shock, when the other party is unable to move, the hand is shot, or jumped up with a dragon gun to make up a shot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thinks about this trick repeatedly '弑神', couldn’t help but shudder. He suddenly stepped forward and grabbed the dragon-gun in his own hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember why adults should be afraid? This dragon-gun is built for you. '弑神' can only be used with your special power. From the experience of my elderly people, it is best to be serious before making a move. The name of the gun and the name of the recruiter are good. The more the opponent is on the alert, the easier it is to get hooked... Yes! Our elves have always been bright and bright, even if they plan to use this sinister trick, how can we tell the other party's name in advance! But beg for peace of mind, but beg for peace of mind, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you look at the rookie gun Rogge, the only bad thing is that it is inconvenient to carry. As for the silver dragon vest, he was not ready to take off when he put it on. In terms of defensive power alone, this vest is much stronger than the tactical reincarnation of the year, but the vest is a little smaller. No way, the silver dragon scales are so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the threat of revenge in the upcoming Silver Dragon, Rogge has begun to figure out how to deal with it, but it is useless at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, after harvesting two new pieces of equipment, Rogge is in a good mood. As for the sacred sorrow of the sacred god, the sinister has reached the extreme, except for the strong ones close to the sanctuary. With his own ingenuity, it is not difficult to improve this trick, and then smash or kill, when you can rely on your own mind. As for those who are close to the sanctuary, how can they fight with it? Either buy it or run it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of the city of the gods at this time is blue, the climate is warm and pleasant, and there is a lush green everywhere. The squid wrapped around the outer wall of the truss house began to squirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger, accompanied by the elders of Hughes, walked all the way in the city of the gods. Compared with the time of the initial construction, the city of the gods has changed a lot from the delicate and splendid typical elf city, becoming rough, practical and dangerous. Of course, compared to the human city such as Dresden, the city of the gods is still an incredibly beautiful city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the three elves, a mysterious dome temple has been built. There is only one inconspicuous small door in the temple, and there is no window at all. This mysterious temple does not have any elf guards. But all the elves that have passed through are self-study and keep a distance of more than ten meters from the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Hughes went to the only small door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that there is a deadly trap around this temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small door opened automatically in front of Rogge, and when the two entered, they quietly covered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is a magical world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground in the temple has been completely occupied by the magical array, criss-crossing the nicks like a river crossing the earth, shimmering magical light. The magic silver poured into these nicks transmits the center of the magic magic array to each magic symbol, and then collects the pure, magnified magic energy back into the center of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cluster of low groves in the center of the magical array. The huge silver dragon egg is placed right above the end of the grove. At this moment, the silver dragon egg radiates a soft light, and beats rhythmically. Every time it beats, it is like a wave of waves in the sea, a circle of pale white magic waves from the inside out, passing the entire magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic symbols are lit at the same time, a trace of white light hits a white crystal above the dragon egg, and it is a rog from the silver Dragon crystal in the dragon brain! Dragon crystal follows the dragon egg's beating, and also fluctuates rhythmically. After bringing together the magical array, it will shoot a bright white light toward the sky and shine on a green egg shape hanging from the top of the temple. Above the object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
