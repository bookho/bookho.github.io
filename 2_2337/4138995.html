			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book, the fourth day of the last day (2)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of the final battle, Adelaide Nie blocked the eyes of Andreoli with her body and tried to exchange for the scene of Rogge’s escape. At that moment, Rogge was not very clear about the power of the star Andreioli, but he now knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline as a mage, supported for so long before breaking the law, not on the spot and only lost the magic, can be said to be a very Good results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog didn’t think she would do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne has always given Rogge the impression that it is mild and will seduce him intentionally or unintentionally. However, in the impression of the fat man, the Mozu has always been a race that only cares about itself and does not cooperate with each other, let alone saves people to save people. What's more, what is the fat man worthy of her place to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how unreasonable this matter, Adrianne is, after all, she has been ruining Rogge and seeing her weak under the calm appearance. Already the body, how can Rogge be indifferent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strode forward, holding Adrienne’s hand, just wanted to say something, suddenly snorted and stared at her eyes. Look carefully and keep on watching. But the more he looks, the more his hands become cold. In Ade Renee's eyes, there is a faint silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said hard: "How is your body like this? You... don't you want to live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Adelaide smiled and said: "For our Mozu, losing power is equivalent to losing all the meaning of life. So I really didn't want to live when I started. But, since I look at it I still have a good time. Then I might as well try to live without power. Rest assured, I am not so easy to die. Don't think too much, don't you look back?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge heard the words and looked back, only to find out that Wella did not know when it had appeared behind him. It’s just that Wei Na is not looking at the fat man, but looking at the wind and moon that is floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind was seen by Weiner as unnatural, and instinctively sensed her power, so even though she frowned. The light in the silver enamel is becoming more and more dangerous, and there is still no attack. Instead, slowly retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger met, and he took the wind and pulled him behind him, blocking Wenna’s gaze with his body and saying, “Don’t scare her.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner looked at Nephi again and snorted. Nephi was not good at seeing it, and immediately flew to the back of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is she? She has not only the breath of the natural goddess. It seems to have your blood." Wella is cold and cold, there is a kind of voice Strange meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "She is Nephi, very beautiful! Of course I know she is related to the goddess of nature, but she is my daughter first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stared at Nafi for a long time, and looked at the windy moon, sighing: "She... How did she become like this? And she I can't recognize me at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man turned his head and looked at the wind and sighed. Road: "This...is very complicated. It is like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina inserted: "Since it is complicated, you don't have to say it, you stay there. Don't move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to it, Wella's eyes brighten the golden brilliance and stare at Rogge. Under her insightful field, things that happened to Rogge were re-presented in her consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena's face is changing. First, I was amazed, then I was amazed. Finally, my face suddenly turned red and I yelled at Rogge: "You actually... actually to her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty body week Suddenly an invisible force field was raised, which cut off Verna's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina was immediately shocked and said: "You obviously have no godhead, how can you block my insight? What is this, is it the power of the field? It feels weird... as if... there are no features."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and said that she didn't care at all, but when Rogge removed his strength from the body, she immediately looked at it with great concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne walked behind Rogge and reached out and raised a small piece of flesh in his ear, whispering in his ear: "Little Rogge, you quietly Tell me, what did she see? Is it related to your two little beautiful people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and turned his head and wanted to say What, but seeing Adrienne's gentle smile, the look is bleak. Adrienne smiled and said: "Well, I said that I will not have anything. What else can you worry about? I did it at the time, for the future of the Mozu, but it has nothing to do with you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Wella finally regained her gaze and her face was somewhat white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "You have seen my experience of this time. I found that when the Pope used the Great Prophecy, the power of the power seemed to come from one. The main god, called Isaac, sounds like he is the Lord God of Redemption. It is a bit strange, why is the Redeemer of the Redeemer able to give the Pope's great prophecy with such terrible destruction? Or, salvation is only Is one of Isaac's abilities?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man paused, his face became more and more ugly, hesitated, finally asked: "The heavens How many Lord Gods are there? Is there really twelve main gods as recorded in the Holy Scriptures? And, like the fellows like Andreoli, how many heavens are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed and said: "How do you forget that angels will leave their memories when they leave heaven. Unless...beever like Andreoli, relying on the powerful power of the body This space forms a projection, and it is possible to retain the original memory."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought for a moment, said: "I understand that this projection can only exist in space for a short time, I said how to always see his way of existence!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at Rogge and looked at the windy moon behind Rogge. Gently said: "Maybe you choose to follow Destroy Lord Desmasen is right. Only in this way, you can survive for a while. As long as you can survive, you may be able to find other ways. Only this The hope of the plane is really not much..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned: "Why do you say that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waina was silent for a moment, and slowly said: "You must have discovered that this plane has a very unique characteristic, that is, any force beyond a certain degree of existence. Can not be in the plane Maintain a long-lasting stable form. That is to say, this plane sets an upper limit for the existence of all living in it. For the angels who come from heaven, this ceiling is too low, which makes habit The adventurous angels who use powerful power are very uncomfortable, and they have given the world's inhabitants the possibility to challenge them. It is reasonable to say that, as Andre Olympus is also a high presence in the heavens, it is impossible to be in this plane. The body, even if it is just a projection, can't do it. But since you have already seen his projection, then the high-level angels of heaven can appear directly in this plane. At that time..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chill of cold whispered in the heart of Rogge. The stone house fell into a dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly laughed and broke this almost suffocating silence, saying: "Take him so much! Even if the gods of heaven are strong, we will not see There is no way to do it. You see, my Lord Dissmason obviously has to go through the main god of the war. Isn't that an opportunity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Your faith..." Weina looked at the fat man, and stopped talking, just sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "My beliefs are no problem. If you want to get something, you have to pay the price. I think it is worth it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner’s gaze is on the sidelines, no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said again: "It’s good to be able to see you. But don’t tell me your position this way again, this time except Beyond me, both Augustus and the Pope have sensed the breath you cast. If it wasn’t for the Pope’s appointment, I’m afraid that it’s now Augustus and his Holy Cross Knights. The Pope has been helping me in the dark. But I can't see him completely. Who knows what his real thoughts are? So don't take risks, you have brought your guns, you bring Adelei. Nie changed places to hide, and we slowly think of ways."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wella took the gun and snorted, saying: "Just give me enough time, maybe I can kill both Augustus and his Holy Cross knights. These low-level angels are fighting. The wisdom of the above is really not worthy of compliments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighed. Gently patted Weina's hand. Dao: "What is the use of killing them? Kill these useless guys so that they can be more powerful? It is better to let them occupy the position in this plane. We can still have a little more time." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words are not finished, Rogge’s eyebrows suddenly screamed and sneered: "That thirteen wise angels have come! Oh, her power is strong. However, the time to come to this plane is too short. In the small places where the atmosphere is concealed, she knows that it is still too little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue voice Just falling, Victoria’s cold, arrogant voice rang in the stone house: “It doesn’t matter how much you know. You have exhausted the power of the eye of destruction. How can you stop me from returning to heaven? As long as I return to heaven The great Setanistoria will know the conspiracy of Desmasen, and will also punish the actions of you. When I come to this plane again, it is the end of all heresy. And you, It will be the end now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly silenced for a moment, the screams from time to time in the valley and the roar of the magical explosion disappeared without a trace, and a soft light curtain of pale gold quietly enveloped the entire valley, almost a moment of effort, The atmosphere of more than ten churches in the valley disappeared. Not only the sanctuary, in fact, the breath of all life in the valley has disappeared at this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, silence was broken, and Victoria’s breath clearly appeared in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the golden glory of the support, she flew blonde, the two pairs of white wings behind the slight fan, slowly rising from the valley to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of Victoria is too strong. Strong to almost arrogant to the whole plane! Her power seems to have fully recovered, and it is not at all comparable to the one that was destroyed by Rogge that day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by the breath of Victoria, Rogge also changed slightly. Victoria absorbed the power of all the angels in the valley, but this is not a decisive factor. In fact, she has reunited all the land into one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The heresy, ready to take care of your own destruction? After absorbing your strength, I can return to heaven to the great Setenistoli Asia states your conspiracy!" Victoria has flew up the mountain. The cold eyes looked at Rogge from the stone house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to go back? Is it so easy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue smiles and jumps From now on, directly rushed to the high-minded intellectual angel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria is furious, the way the fat man rushes is simply scorning her! Her hands are raised, and thousands of gold wires that are enough to pierce the stone in an instant are generated instantly. From all directions, it has been stabbed to Rogge, who has turned into a virtual shadow because of its speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These golden threads are different from what Rogge saw on the day. Without the suppression of the Eye of Destruction, they finally show the real horror. Each thread has a certain chance to penetrate all defenses, whether the defense comes from armor or from magical shields! Every wave of Victoria waved, thousands of silk sprinkles, regardless of how low the probability of defense, how to have hundreds of silk lines to break through the defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge screamed, and a layer of force that shined a little bit of the stars. All the gold wires quickly dim after entering the force field until they die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria sneered, lips slightly open, and a clear drink, in addition to the high majesty in the drink, there is an indescribable power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars of Roger’s body burst into a little bit of beautiful blue stars in Victoria’s drink. He shuddered and his mouth blew. It was like a slamming heavy blow, almost falling into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria Fiber pointed to Rogge, and hundreds of gold wires were instantly generated, and they were stabbed to Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she suddenly discovered that Rogge was not panicking, but was laughing, laughing and mad, and a pair of eyes looked up and down in a bad manner. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
