			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prosperous Years Chapter 14 prophecy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? Then you talk, altogether How many?" Froya poked at Rogge and asked me playfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rockefeller, Sky Fury, Mesley...She can barely count one, after all, it’s not what I did. Finally, Ji Ma, this old woman. The magic is still very powerful, and there are no other important people in the other." The name of one strong person spit out from Rogge's mouth, and a battle of the world on the edge of life and death also reappeared in his mind. Rogge looked a little embarrassed, as if he had returned to the scene of the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like a magician or a magician. Have you ever killed a warrior with the power of the Sanctuary?" Fu Luoya asked. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s question pulled back Rogge’s thoughts. He shook his head gently and said, “No. Those who have reached the sanctuary’s position, though There is no horror in the lethality of the big magician, but they feel keen and react very fast, so there is almost no weakness. The big magician is different, their bodies are weak, and if they are prepared for protection magic in advance, they are not prepared. In the case, it is very good to kill. Of course, if they are fully prepared, they will become more difficult to deal with than the Sanctuary. So the most feared by the great magister is the assassin hidden in the darkness. Mess who died in my hands. Li is like this. If she is prepared for it, then I basically have no chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria leans on the thick cushion , said: "It seems that the magician is a very dangerous profession. But I have this meditation in my hand, it is a pity to not practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗Ge Mo Ran. The higher the level of the magician. The more horrible their attack power is. However, in comparison, the magician's defense is very slow. The great magicians who can use the seventh-order magic almost all have the horror spells that can be used to kill the enemy. Magical battles above the Great Sorcerer often show life and death between several spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's meditation meditation has many horror magics that are not within the spell system, and has a full magical power in one hit. Unique power. Therefore, although she only recovered to more than thirteen magical powers, she can win the level 14 magician. However, the meditation of the plane is not completely harmless. Its biggest flaw lies in the lack of means of protection. And after the caster releases the magic, he often loses resistance or fights his hand because the magic consumes too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria has a lot of magic equipment. But unless it is an artifact, the protection provided by the equipment is still not enough to offset the power of high-order attack magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, Rogge immediately took the hand of Furya and said with concern: "This plane is meditation, you still don't want to practice it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin smiled softly and faintly said: "Of course I have to practice. You are now more and more enemies. I couldn’t help you any more. No more practice. I don’t think it’s completely useless? You see, I’m not even as good as Mora.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue smiled, one hand whispered The ground explored her long skirt, all the way up, and said: "You just won't be a little bit of magic, and still have great use..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulu With a bang, Aya kicked out Rogge with a kick. This is evil: "You don't want to open the subject. Anyway, no matter what you say, I will practice the meditation. Or you will take me to Adelini, you choose!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "When dealing with these demons, what kind of faith do you have to say? Just use Miro, and want to come and grab a woman with me? I am of course two Everything is not to make him bloody!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin snorted, but his face was a smile, very happy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the carriage is the ice cold world, the carriage is warm and spring. The two went all the way to Richelieu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage has just stopped in the middle of Rogge House, and Robsky, who has been rushed, is racing back. He didn't have time to meet Rogge, but he must do it with the following and carefully flatter these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge's magical manipulation is no different. But he was still careful and busy for a long time. Only the magic traps placed around the magic lab were lifted. Just pushing the door in the middle, he and Fu Luoya are stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen magical arrays on the floor of the large room. The fascinating light on the circle is still running slowly and orderly. Everything looks nothing different, but the goddess of nature who sleeps in the middle of the magic array is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the natural goddess can never be its own death. Rogge had carefully examined every magical array before leaving, and there was no problem. Even if nobody cares, they have no problem running for a year or two. So there must be someone who has the heart to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which person can sneak through so many magic traps and take away the power of the natural goddess without leaving any traces? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, regardless of the person's level of magic, stealth skills must be high. And it can be seen from the fact that nothing else in the laboratory has been passive. His purpose is very clear, that is, the power of the natural goddess. The timing of his choice is also very favorable. In the past, there were often two or three Sanctuary strongmen in the Rogge House. Which one is the average person who came in? However, in order to defend against the orcs, all the strong people on the fat side gathered in the Central Mountain Range, and the government was temporarily empty, and the result was swayed by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is puzzled. What is the purpose of this person to take away the goddess of nature? These natural goddess divine powers were completely isolated from the body of the natural goddess by his use of the elves, but they existed unconsciously. And they are actually very, very meager, and they can't be used at all. Divine power is hard to die, once they are out of the elf's position. In connection with the body of the natural goddess, it is either taken back by the natural goddess, or the same as the previous one, the natural goddess directly punishes the disrespectful by morphing or sending a servant by sensing the direction of this divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge already knows that divine power has an invisible connection with the body of God, but they have no power in themselves. And it is completely different from the power of God and God. Just as every magician has the magic of different attributes, but what magic can be cast with these magic. It also depends on many other factors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the power itself is actually of little use. Let Rogge worry that this hidden character is actually familiar with their activities. To know that this person wants to kill a few people in his house, it is much easier than stealing things from a well-prepared magic laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya looked at everything in the magic lab, unbelievably: "All the power is stolen! It’s incredible, we put so much defense The measures can make people sneak in. If my teacher, Jero, is not dead, he may not come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighed. Tao: "There is nothing to lose these powers. It is only that he specializes in stealing these divine powers. There must be a great purpose. It is a pity that we do not know his purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You didn't say it last time, except that you can use the two-way connection feature of divine power to stimulate the goddess of nature. In fact, these powers are useless? Why would someone steal it?" Froya asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Rogge, he suddenly moved a little, and he said: "This may be related to the two-way nature of divine power."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man squatted back and forth in the room for a few laps, suddenly set up and said to Froya: "When Androni is back. You will stay with her, you can't separate it anyway!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin smiled and said: "Why, you are worried about me! But Anne Baby is not as obedient as I am, in fact, those powerful guys on our side. In addition to Hughes, I see who you are not commanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is annoyed, the goblin does say his pain. He has known this problem for a long time, but there is no solution. For any Sanctuary or Big Magister, it is the king of a country who is very polite to them. There are no one who is the one who is standing on his own side. After he thought about it, only Androni had some hope. It is precisely because of my own way that I do not listen to the command and control, so in the real struggle between countries, the role that the strong can play is extremely limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I naturally will find a way to Anne, I am just worried that you will not stay honestly beside her." Rogge stared at Froya... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whereabouts of the strong are erratic. It is clear that Mora has already returned to the Imperial Capital for many days, but Androni and the Death Class are missing. Rogge couldn't do anything, and he had to deal with the chores that had accumulated over the days. Since the battle with the goddess of ice and snow, the fat man has re-recognized the importance of these customs. If the devotees of the goddess of the goddess of ice and snow were not massacred at the crucial moment of the war, and the power of her faith was greatly reduced, it would be more difficult for them to get the final victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the field of battle between the gods, in addition to the realm of the gods, it is also to compete for the worldly believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, by capturing the miracle of the goddess of ice and snow, Mora has already completed the bloody and cruel cleaning, and stabilized the silver Teach inside. The next step for her to do is to combine the eyes of wisdom with the teachings of silver and to unite a religion, a religion that dominates the source of the greatest empire in the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred religion of the empire has a long history in the empire, and many of the ancestors of the empire are in the church. This time, Mora’s cleaning scale is unprecedented, and the style is extremely hot. As long as it is a person who dares to question the goddess or her authority, and persuaded not to change, it will be bloody and suppressed. At the time of the religious war, there were countless believers in the silver saints who died in the eyes of wisdom and in the hands of Rogge. Where did this bloody hatred be easily solved? Therefore, although Mora is backed by the goddess and the means are tough, the combination of the two religions is still very difficult. Many believers are afraid to oppose her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mora completely adheres to the strong style of the wind and the moon, and hardly suppress all opposing voices. Fortunately, she has Rogge and Straw support in the imperial political arena, and those who oppose are more or less scrupulous. Only after Straw lost power. Rogge alone is hard to support, so the voice against Mora is getting louder and louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the days when Rogge left the Imperial City, Robsky fully demonstrated his political talent. He could not move around among the great aristocrats. He had reached several compromise deals with a few great aristocrats, which reduced the pressure on Mora's reorganization of the silver sacred religion. This result made Rogge very satisfied, so the fat man simply let go of the boss. He himself put his mind on how to let the Ale Principal winter and deal with the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fat man’s understanding of each race, the orcs can dispatch 200,000 troops at a time. That shows that the population of the orc empire is at least five million. This is a big worry. The fat man is completely unsatisfied with the fact that he has killed more than 100,000 elite orcs. His style has always been to eliminate the roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has also fantasized about the use of the orc. Just knowing that this idea is unrealistic at once. Obviously, there is a mysterious and powerful force behind the orcs. They can train a scattered orc to become a disciplined warrior, able to cultivate powerful war behemoths, and even have warlocks who can use natural disaster rituals. Leisure class. This power will never hand over the orcs to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the fat man has received an urgent report from the Bauhinia butterfly. He knew that the orcs were so military. The 20,000 warriors led by Doolin have probably turned into the belly of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes the fat man annoyed is that the current foreign enemy is waiting, he has to spend his mind to fight. The accumulation of grain in the Principality of Alei is near exhaustion, and the large migration of the Bauhinia butterfly to avoid the orcs has intensified the consumption of food. However, the requirements for the purchase of grain in the Principality, whether for the Principal of Layton or the Duke of Doliyak, were rejected by the excuses of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a situation, Rogge is hard to suppress the anger of his heart. He felt that it was time to look at the opponents in politics. The fat man can't move Pompey and Alexander, but with his power and strength. It’s still a good idea to clean up the role of the Principality of the Principality of Layton or the Governor of the Frontier Province. The most reliant thing about Rogge is that he has the support of many strong people, and he can do something that others can't do. He knows that as long as the Prince of Kerry and the Duke of Doriak, headed by Pompey and Alexander, are hurting, then others will definitely think about it when they choose to be against themselves...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doriak and Kerry are one and the youngest. They are mediocre and lascivious people. The fat man began to seriously consider if you put a magical fire on the shackles of the two men and grilled the thing half-cooked, so that they could no longer move women’s minds within a few months. I don’t know if the two guys have since then Still dare to be so blatantly against yourself? Of course, fat people won't really let them withstand it. It is necessary to teach them, but they can't push them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s spirit began to reflect on the details of the plan. In a blink of an eye, when he roughly thought about it. It was discovered that the day was already slanting. One afternoon passed without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more power of faith, the more it is to push her to the depths of the realm of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden burst of fatigue came, the fat man barely rubbed his eyes twice, and fell to the table, screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fascination, Rogge’s eyes suddenly lit up and there was a metallic wall shining with soft light. Rogge looked around, except for the wall in front of him, surrounded by white clouds, the only way out was on this wall. So he took a step forward and observed it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wall is made of a strange metal that Rogge does not know at all. It is faintly transparent, and there is a crystal, it radiates in the soft golden light. It contains a sacred atmosphere like a drizzle, and it feels very comfortable when you lie on the fat man. The interior of this metal seems to be liquid, and there are countless faint smog in the air. The fat man's eyesight is amazing. He adjusted it slightly, and he has already discerned that this burst of thin smoke has actually been formed by countless tiny charms containing powerful energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single is one of the functions of light smoke, it has already seen Rogge dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge set the god. Strong pressure is shocked. He only feels that everything he sees is far beyond what he can understand. Rogge had a right hand and turned into a sharp claw, trying to grab the wall. However, he was surprised to find that after a very unpleasant snoring, his claw tip was completely destroyed, but there was no trace left on the metal wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Rogge’s move awakened something. There was a loud roar around him, almost fainting him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall in front of Rogge slowly moved. Lopsided. Until the wall moved to dozens of meters, the fat man discovered that the face that had just appeared in front of him was not a whole wall, but a huge brick on the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is standing on the ground, stunned, full of awe in looking at this side can not describe its vast. The upper, lower, left and right margins are hidden in the walls of the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can present the whole picture, what kind of building is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a floating city hosted by Fengyue, how big and magnificent can it be worth one-tenth? What's more, the solidity of this wall, the enormous power, is what Rogge never dreamed of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall is gradually accelerating, going all the way. Rogge stared at it, the first fashion was shocked, and later turned into fear. That is the fear of a powerful existence that is unknown and indescribable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge always thought that he saw a wall. But when it gradually went away and gradually revealed more appearances from the clouds, the fat man discovered that what he faced was actually a golden castle that did not know how grand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this golden castle flying farther and farther, first with both hands and then with legs. At the end of the day, Rogge began to shudder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has moved to the other side of the day, and only at this distance, Rogge can see the whole picture. It is not a gold castle, but a strange armor! A huge to incredible armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower part of it is a loose skirt, which looks like the base of a castle. Just after Rogge’s careful study, this part is a small armor. Part of the leaf. The upper part of the base is gradually closed like a spire. The top of the minaret is surrounded by three giants. Each head is wearing a golden helmet of various shapes. The mask that is integrated with the helmet is solemn and majestic, and there are hidden clouds in the hollow eyes. It seems to be looking down on the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tower of the minaret is densely arranged without knowing how many faces! These faces are neatly arranged and different, and each face looks like a different race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these faces all have one thing in common, that is, no matter how many eyes they have, these eyes are tightly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
