			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five days have passed, and "hunting" has been carried out as planned. The hunters left some traces of ecstasy, and the prey were also very bright, and they were able to show the clues. Now, the prey must have known that a human expedition with more than 100 people has arrived here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves have increased their sentinels these days, and the activities of the spies have become more frequent. It can be seen that the dwarves have a good leader and are not as impulsive as the average dwarf. Inferred from the confession of the captured dwarf, the Dwarf King likes to brain, and the hunters are afraid that he will not move his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter laughs as soon as the dwarf thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth day of the night is still very calm, the hunters buried the bodies of two dwarfs who were tortured and died in the forest. In the afternoon, the two bodies were brought to the dwarves and brought back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, when Rogge was reading the magic book in his own camp, he suddenly felt a man dexterously got into his tent. Rogge was quiet and still reading hard, until a pair of delicate little hands covered his eyes like lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger pretended to be shocked, when a sweet voice sounded from his ear: "Guess who I am?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;;;nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly touched back, grabbed a hand on the chest behind him, sneered: "Ai Ni, every time you have to send the door to suffer, I am not afraid of eating "You?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Nie smirked and fell on Rogge’s back, not paying any attention to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Eat me? I’m afraid that you don’t have that big appetite and hold you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't you not leave your bones in the first few times?" Rogge's hand moved hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ainie snorted twice and stabbed the fat man behind Rogge's neck with his nails. Don't be so anxious. People come here to have a business, the princess lets you go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart jumped a few times, but his face made a happy look. Ai Nie twisted Rogge again and said: Dead fat man, is the idea of ​​playing the princess again? Don't think about it early! You are not afraid to be transformed into a Warcraft by the princess? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria's camp is not big, but like the mysterious carriage, the space inside is incredible. It is only what Rogge can see. There are three guest bedrooms, a hall, a kitchen and Froya's small magic laboratory. The dozens of different animals she has caught in these days have also been broken into here, not knowing where the collection is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that day, the two waiters of the fat man and Froya have had a lot of dew marriage. No one knows how to think about the fat man who has always been lascivious. However, after that night, Froya lost interest in Rogge and never touched his finger again. As for Rogge, he did not have the courage. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waited in the living room for a long time, and Flora came out of the room, and Rogge’s brain was immediately blank.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Floria apparently just finished bathing, and the drops are still dripping down on the tip. A little face looks more beautiful and clean. She wears it at will. The nightdress, wrapped in a shawl, barefooted, sat freely on the sand opposite Rogge. The water on her body had not been dried, and many graceful curves were revealed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge stared straight at Froya’s frosty snow, and remembered that the little feet were cold on his face that night. The feeling of slippery. At that time, the fat man only had anger, and today he was able to observe it carefully, and he also felt the beautiful and beautiful of Froya.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The beauty of Roya is perfect. In Rogge's memory, which part of her body is so perfect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge? Rogge? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria even called Rogge's soul several times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Froya gently touched the edge with her finger and asked faintly: "I heard that your mage pet is a very embarrassing cockroach. Can you summon it to show me?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you waiting for? I am afraid that I will not get your pet?" Fu Luoya began to urge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, summoning 骷髅 in your room seems to be something wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not right for you!" Froya picked up a mat and slammed it to Rogge. "Let you summon you to summon, but also push the three resistances. Do you think of staying in the jail for a while? Or, Do you want to try the smell of lightning?" As soon as she raised her hand, the shawl opened a corner and let Rogge stunned and almost sprayed some nosebleeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be forced, Rogge had to slowly pick up the summoned mantra. In fact, the fat man is now summoning ***, just a thought in the heart can be done, there is no need for a spell. He pretends to be a mantra, but he wants to drag the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short summoning spell, Rogge was sweating. In front of Fu Luo, the great magician, he did not dare to play tricks on the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the mantra, a magical array appeared in the center of the hall, and a faint cockroach began to take shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cockroach is tall and strong, wearing a simple armor, holding a shiny steel knife on the right, and a fine iron shield on the left hand, apparently a superb warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that it’s not ***, it’s just a ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were so many battles, *** had also gathered the wings, put away a conspicuous sickle, and used a rust knife to pretend to be a normal cockroach. But Rogge can assert that this time it is definitely a real soldier! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rogge, how is your pet not the same as what others have described me?" Froya also had some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, the villain's pets are somewhat different, and the villain does not know what is going on. Others looked surprised, passed around, It is inevitable that there are some untrue places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also true." Froya indulged for a moment, carefully observed the cockroach, but how to look is just an ordinary The squadron is gone. She was slightly disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria thought for a moment and took out a small box with eight bottles of crimson magic potions neatly placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are the magic potions of the 'Fire Shield', I just made some. The dwarf tribe is much stronger than expected, and your current magic level is still showing Without the magic of 'Fire Shield', these will give you a bodyguard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has finally passed the barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming out of Fu Luoya, the fat man has a new anecdote. In the unlikely event that his life is in jeopardy, *** will only send a hand to make up the number. How is it good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fat man was full of heart, the dwarf Wang Zheng was violently thundering at the bodies of the two tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send the best spies out! Be sure to find me those damn humans! The 'hunting' plan starts immediately!" The dwarf king's eyes have changed It became dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two days ago, the Dwarf King and his think tanks made a plan overnight to prepare to fish out the damn Terran. The name of the plan is called "hunting." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My wise king, you have to be cautious, don't take the Hakkas' tricks. Recently there are more and more signs that the devil is about to be born, his The claws have slowly extended to this place! You must be cautious!" The old wizard said with a heavy eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My best spies have already found out that there are no more than 200 people in the Terran, as if they were a mercenary called Nighthawks in the Terran Nationality opposite the forest. The group of people. Don't say two hundred people, that is, two thousand, my 'Rage of the Flames' can also turn them into ashes. Now, the body of my people is lying here, do you still have to Advise me to shrink here, even avoid them?! Avoid two hundred people in the district?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In any case, this hatred must be reported, come, send the big wizard back to rest!" Two dwarfs came close, and could not help but put the old wizard out of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard was exhausted in the eye, and he did not go back to rest, and went straight to the holy place of the dwarf dungeon: the blue fire altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar is up to ten meters high, and a blue fire of three meters high is spewing out from the center of the altar. The altar is covered with magical symbols of the size of the scale, each symbol is slightly blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My lord, Chris Drake, who is in charge of the war, your humble servant, look forward to your god! Save your most devout believers. ! Point the future of your believers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard prayed under the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished the prayer, and he sang the mantra again. The lengthy mantra was sung for half an hour. The old wizard walked to the blue fire and opened his chest with a handful of gold. This knife is so deep that a blood is far from being marked and splashed on top of the blue fire. The blue fire suddenly slammed high, and the large rooms were all blue. The magical symbols of the senses of one flame after another emerged from the blue fire and slowly dissipated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God! Point your servant!" The old wizard screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue fire was once again a little higher and slowly dimmed. In the desperate eyes of the old wizard, the flame slowly lowered, only one foot more than a point, and finally turned into black inflammation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! The gold in the hands of the old wizard fell to the ground, and the remaining blood splashed on it, which was shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God!" The old wizard’s hoarse voice already has a hint of whimper. "Why are you abandoning your people? Or, this is coming soon." The demon that was born makes you helpless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wizard cried in tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty fully armed dwarf warriors searched in the Silent Forest, this team of dwarf warriors is well equipped, consisting of twenty intermediate tomahawk warriors and ten The rest of the axe is composed of even a dwarf wizard. The dwarf warrior has been at a certain age, the armor work is obviously better than others, and the magic silver symbol is used to represent the magical symbol of the armor. However, humans generally do not see the age of the dwarf, because all adult dwarves have a big beard with a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves marched on the ground and found a few human adventurers. These people were talking around the campfire and talking loudly. How much money the dwarf can capture. The advent of the dwarves of the brigade surprised the adventurers. They didn't even have time to pick up the weapons on the ground and fled to the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf Warrior had to admire these humans and escaped so quickly in the virgin forest. Due to the problem of the dwarf's natural leg length, it is impossible to catch up with these people on short-distance sprints. However, the dwarf's endurance is far from being comparable to that of the human race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chase and escape, in the blink of an eye, chased out three or five kilometers. The dwarf trackers came to an open space in the forest. The adventurers are smiling at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you scream, Lin Zhong rushed out more than a hundred ambush adventurers, including a magician! The situation of the dwarf trackers is not good at all. Everyone knows that the dwarf's talent in magic is not so good. Dwarf wizards are difficult to compete with the same level of human magic. Therefore, most of the dwarf sorcerers are dedicated to assistive spells in order to fully exploit the innate combat power of the dwarf warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aha! The dwarf is a dwarf, the brain is as small as a body! More than thirty strong dwarves, it seems that our harvest this time is not small, If you catch you, I can accept the team. In the second half of the year, I won’t have to suffer from this damn ghost place again!” One of the adventurers’ sinister (in the eyes of the dwarves, all human beings are insidious) middle-aged swordsmen I laughed and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf took a command, the dwarf tracker became a ***, the warrior was outside, and the axe was in the middle. He yelled: "Despicable humans, insidious night-money mercenaries! The descendants of the great God of War are only war dead, not willing to be slaves. Even if you try, I will let you use double the body as your stupid decision. The price!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? The dwarf's stubbornness is directly proportional to stupidity. Recognizing our identity is your most stupid performance! I am reluctant to kill You guys - every dwarf is a fortune! But don't mind if my property suffers a small loss. For example, live roasting you feed WoW. Brothers, get ready!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human adventurers were all scared by this sudden loud noise. The middle-aged swordsman has not recovered, and the light flashes in front of him. More than a dozen axe whistling to fly to him. Life is critical, he screams, and the temper is instantly violent, forming a small whirlwind bodyguard, then the long sword lightning strikes, picking a throwing axe in front of him, the sword and axe meet, the sword in the long sword will sword The body was blown up and the shock wave immediately flew three other axes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the middle-aged swordsman’s martial arts were amazing, he was caught in the left shoulder and the right leg with two throwing axe, and the injury was not light. Before he returned, the second wave of axe flew over. At this time, he was already unarmed, and he couldn’t take care of it even under the urgency. He fell on the spot and rolled aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody has ever thought that the dwarf who always pays attention to the bright and the big will suddenly start. Two waves of axe not only hurt the middle-aged swordsman, but also cut down seven or eight adventurers behind him. At this point, the adventurers only woke up and went to the front to kill, Lin Zhong suddenly fell into a scuffle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alpine dwarves are brave and brave, and the outer warriors will not die even if they have more swords in their bodies. The inner ring of the axe moves in a uniform, each time a dozen When the throwing axe is thrown in the same direction, there will always be several adventurers being cut down. The dwarf sorcerer blessed the dwarves and blessed the dwarf ‘powerful’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is glued up, every dwarf falls, and there are always two adventurers to bury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hidden camp in the forest, Jinge, Rogge, and Benjamin are concentrating on the clear water on the ground. The battle was clearly displayed in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect Paulus to be so embarrassed!" Franco was somewhat gloating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned: "The alpine dwarf is even stronger than originally thought! Even the golden lion knight is killed. Our staff is a little lost!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin is not in a hurry: "It doesn't matter, as long as everything goes according to plan, these losses are still worthwhile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander on the battlefield, the middle-aged swordsman, that is, Paulus finally got his heart and drank: "All killing! Don't leave alive!***, I don't want money!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, a fireball fell in the middle of the dwarf battle circle, four or five throwing axe hands burst into flames, slowly falling down. After a short time, the second fireball flew over again, and the four dwarves fell forever. The rest of the dwarves were affected and some were injured. The dwarf was extremely angry and roared, and an axe cut down a human adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original battle, due to the advantages of the Terran magician began to become one-sided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a commotion in the periphery of the sudden adventurer, and someone shouted: "Not good! There are big dwarves killed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulus called out: "How many people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least two hundred!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulus took the initiative and shouted: "Remove immediately! My man is broken! Magician, set fire wall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A fire wall in the forest burned up, temporarily blocking the dwarves chasing soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King "Rage of the Flame" stands in front of the fire wall and smiles contemptuously. He had a dark golden body armor, and a dark red flame could not escape from the armor. The covered helmet only reveals two eyes. The helmet is equipped with a god of war with a flame chariot. The wings of the chariot extend far to the side. The helmet is exquisitely crafted, and the feathers on the wing of the battle are all made to be perfect. The dwarf king rode a huge lizard. The lizard is four meters long from head to tail, with a dark purple body and a red eyes. As the tongue stretches out, it faintly carries a smell of sulfur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King holds a huge, quaint warhammer with a faint red light. The warhammer is engraved with a dense magic symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still want to play with fire in front of me?" The dwarf king shouted, and the hammer in his hand slammed and hammered on the red light. The fire wall immediately dimmed and quickly went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King led his men to chase down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Twenty Dwarf Centennial Warriors around the Dwarf King can't ignore the fact that the King of Kings seems to have mastered the power of the flames. It should have been built into a Dark Warrior. That is a very high level of the Dwarf Warrior. This is not a good fight." Jing Ge frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s opinion is different: “The dwarf king’s armor and helmet say that he can sell 50,000 gold coins,” 'It seems to add a lot of fire damage, and some ability to manipulate the flames, and the artifact is not much worse. Well, I see the 100,000 gold coins is the lowest price. This sale is worth it!"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin also strongly agrees: "You see, the Dwarf Kings have a lot of magic armor in their hands. These equipment are estimated to be mostly built by the dwarves themselves. It seems that There must be magical silver veins below the land! In any case, you must take down the dwarf hills! How much is lost? Jinge, Rogge, one of your men died, the Clark Chamber of Commerce will pay an extra compensation Hundreds of gold coins are for you! As for the rights of the veins, the Chamber of Commerce will give up 20% to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria looked at these people with interest and asked : "Is it so important to make money? Is it worth the risk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; Rogge is concentrating on the equipment of the Dwarf King. He accidentally said something in his heart: "Where is this rich woman who knows the hard work of making money, it is really ***...ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria grew up as a princess, and then followed the great wizard, Jero, himself as a master of pharmacy. There is more than one artifact in her hand. Money has never meant anything to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of this little fairy shows the most pure and beautiful smile, smiles lightly: "Fu Po? This name I like! Fu Cheng Po is very old? Is it already a woman?" She said, she reached out to catch Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her filigree jade refers to the ugly claws in Rogge's eyes as much as the devil. But where can he hide? In addition to making a laugh, I still laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s fingers glided gently from Rogge’s face, dyed into a pale green nail with a nameless floral fragrance. Rogge suddenly felt weak and fell to the ground. The sense of powerlessness was fleeting, and Rogge jumped again, and it was only when he screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria looked at Rogge with a smile. Rogge sweated, lost smile, lost smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the camp is either looking up to the sky or talking about the weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King has been chasing these adventurers for nearly fifty kilometers and copying their nests in one fell swoop. After Paulus personally led 20 people, he fought with the Dwarf King. ‘Rage of the Flames’ has to admit that the human beings in front of us are really strong, and under the double blow of their own hammer and flame, they can support this many times with swordsmanship and vindictiveness. Until most of the adventurers managed to escape, Paulus slowly retreated into the depths of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will come back for revenge!" Paulus dropped a word in disgust before leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King did not agree. In his plan, the hunting was just beginning. He was afraid that Paulus would not come. This time he only brought a hundred and fifty dwarf warriors, that is, to let the other party think that he is just this strength. When these damn night motorcycle mercenaries come back, there will be ten times the dwarven warriors waiting for them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adventurer Camp has made the Dwarf King a big gain. In addition to saving more than a dozen captured dwarves, they also got a lot of food, equipment, supplies and spirits. There are two small barrels of wine, and the old-fashioned appearance, the long-lasting seal mark, and the careful placement in the central account, know that it is worth a lot. The rich scent of the wine was scattered through the centuries-old oak barrels. It’s just that this wine has already made the dwarves unable to suppress themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Rage of the Flames" screamed under the pressure of the slamming, and stopped the idea of ​​letting people drink the barrels. The Dwarf King personally held two small barrels of wine and ordered his men to take all the useful things from the adventurer's camp, and burned a clean fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, although the invaders of the Terran have not been fully invaded, the Dwarf King has to put a long line to catch big fish. Moreover, the dwarves ended up with only 20 deaths, but the Terrans paid more than forty lives. The dwarves can be said to have won a great victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
