			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not yet waiting for Rogge to recover from the shock, Hughes threw out another message that made Rogge extremely angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger," Hughes said. "I got the news of Ajani on the road. The temple has rejected your request. Ajia Nie will stay in the dungeon until the day when the priests will finally judge her. Now although the city of the gods has suffered heavy losses, the status of the temple is still the highest in the spirit of the elves, on the issue of determining heresy. The decision of the priests is the final decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the murderousness in Rogge’s calm, Hughes quickly said: "And, we better not Hard to go to the temple to grab people, this may lead to the transformation of the entire city of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge calmed down and stared at Hughes: "Elders, to your city, is there no way to save Ajani?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes’ face is calm, his answer is again Ghost stunned: "God makes adults, I am just a killer. Assassination is the real contest of wisdom and martial arts, the light in the dark, It does not contradict the pure and beautiful nature of the elves. Although I am a killer, I am a simple elf, and my wisdom is not enough to cope with the complicated situation in front of me. Only relying on your incompetent insidiousness and despicableness will be nowhere to go. And it’s not good!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stared at Hughes for a long time and resisted the urge to erode. Such an old fox actually said that he was just a simple elf? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the old Fox City is as deep as you think, don’t have anything else to look at yourself, for example, if he is a 17th-level killer. ? The difference between the first level is the difference between the inside and outside of the sanctuary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man remembers the fate of Ajani. He knows that the elves are incomparably stubborn, and this nature is more evident in the three sacrifices. The elves dealt with Ajani, who was resurrected with unclean blood, and estimated that the means should be incompatible with the light church against the infidels. The sudden resurrection of oneself has already disrupted the plan of the temple, but don’t force these rituals to add any means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Rogge make the Zhaoyi and the rituals happy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it, called in a guardian warrior and told him, "Go to Rumsfeld to see me!"<br /><br />&nbsp Then he stared at Hughes and slowly said: "Elders of Xius, I need you to help me for the future of the elves. Anyway, you are used to walking in the dark, don't care again. "He?" He made up his mind and must drag the old fox of Xiuss into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled a bit, it was God, your order, I will definitely obey. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded, and smiled sullenly: "That's good!" That's good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorstep sounded, and Rumsfeld’s slightly melancholy voice sounded: "God makes the adults, Rumsfeld waits for your orders." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is cold and cold: "Come in!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's most elite warrior, the Guardian of the Church, Rumsfeld, came in. He saw that Rog did not let him sit, and stood. In the middle of the room, I kept the respectfulness to Rogge. The two guardian warriors stood silently behind Rumsfeld.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge face sinking Coldly asked: "Rumsfeld spent a month, how did the Terran army go down the city? Why are there only 400 people left in the dark side of the moon? What are the strategies I set before my death, and how did I not implement them? Is it that I am dead, you will never pay attention to my orders again? Come and give me an explanation! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld is silent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know because of the relationship The mysterious and horrible God has made the adults always think of ways to put themselves to death. Originally Rogge died, the haze in his heart has disappeared. However, it was not long before he appeared, the situation quickly separated from the temple. And his control has become out of control. In the face of the facts of blood and fire, he finally realized that only Rogge's strategy can make the elves survive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But after the sudden resurrection of God, he is now involuntarily involved in the struggle between the temple and the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rumsfeld, Rogge’s anger couldn’t help but rise again. What he really feels is not the heart of the wind butterfly, but the death of more than four hundred ‘monthly dark faces’ fighters! Although Rogge was determined to bring this unit into the abyss of darkness from the beginning, turning them into the sharpest sword in their hands, but he also loved the life of every soldier. So miraculously, after a lot of wind and rain, the dark side of the moon has never killed a warrior. Now that Rogge is dead and resurrected, only a month's effort, the most delicate moon's dark face actually lost half, which makes him not angry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rumsfeld! Although you refuse to speak, but do not keep orders, the command is weak, these two crimes, you have nothing to say?" Rogge The sound is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld is still calm, thinking of a comrade-in-arms who are dying around him, and his heart has passed a burst of unspeakable sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally spoke up: "God makes the loss of the adult, the dark side of the moon, I am as sad as you. I am willing to bear all the mistakes, please only You let go of the wind butterfly, she is still a child, still very naive, I don't know what I am doing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aha! There are also butterflies, You don't mention that I almost forgot her!" Rogge suddenly smiled and smiled very harmoniously, but let everyone in the room secretly fight a cold war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can rest assured that what the wind butterfly has to do, you have to bear what kind of responsibility. I will naturally decide this, you don't have to worry about it! Bring Rumsfeld to me! Let's go to the dungeon of the elders' home! I will personally interrogate him for a while! Right, Elder Chess, there is a dungeon in the temple, and the elders should have it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and whispered: "This...sit seems to be there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge strangely asked: "There is there, there is no. Is it that you are a permanent home, do you still know if there is a dungeon under your room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes coughed a few times, but fortunately the guardian warrior had been taken out of Rumsfeld, and did not see the old face of the highly respected Xiusonghong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of their departure, Rogge said coldly: "Since the temple keeps Ajani in the dungeon, I will pull it. Msfield is also locked in the dungeon! See what the rituals will do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned to Hughes and said: "Elders of Shusi, Now that there is a strong enemy outside the city of the gods, the internal situation is not stable, we must fight! I came up with an idea, you can see that it is not suitable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Rogge’s whisper, Hughes couldn’t help but sweat, and he couldn’t help but say: “God makes adults...not suitable...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s face sinks, cold and cold: “The elders of Xiusi are not right. I want to fight off the enemy, even the Necromancer is used. For the survival of the elves, I You have nothing to do with it. Do you still want to keep your own holiness? If you don't agree, then I will leave the city of the gods. Anyway, the temple will never allow a necromancer to guide the elves. If I don't want to face the enemy with the moon created by me, I can only leave without leaving a road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses sighed and whispered Dao: I will do what you want. Hilo, you sent a demon to guide the elves! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See Hughes finally agreed, Rogge immediately smiled at the elders of Yan Kais, what good things do you want to open? I want to come by myself! Well, You are going to prepare, when the time comes, let's get started!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Hughes, Rogge carefully calculated the whole plan, feeling nothing When it was flawed, it was called a guardian warrior. He told me, "Go and bring me the wind butterfly. I have something to ask her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, The guardian warrior came back and reported that the wind butterfly is now in the temple, the sacrifices are having something to discuss with her, and there is no time to see the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man cloud smiled and said nothing, went straight to the dungeon to review Rumsfeld. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** burning smokeless grease shines on the entire water. The walls of the dungeon are made of neat bluestone and are spotlessly clean. There are no essential by-products of human dungeons such as moss and mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When seeing that most of Rumsfeld’s body locked on the stone pillar was soaked in clear spring water, Rogge finally collapsed. Since he became a god, he has been so busy that he has no time and opportunity to study the eunuch's torture culture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the elves are an elegant race in every respect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge made a circle in the entire dungeon. He used to use the torture tool as the lord. He only found a whip and fluttered. Not on the road. It seems that Hughes is right. The most serious punishment for the elf is shame. Being locked into a water prison is already a very unfaithful thing, and the torture is not in accordance with the custom of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the wizard's dungeon arrangement, Rogge puts his heart down. Although he couldn't clean up Rumsfeld to make him somewhat unpleasant, he felt much more comfortable when he thought that Ajani would not suffer too much in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld is also a personal talent, just standing on the side of the temple. Time is very important to Rogge. He displayed the undead magic in public, although it was to defeat the Terran coalition, but it has inevitably caused a crisis of trust. Since the ancient gods were only understood by the elders of Hughes, the right to interpret the gods, like this god, has always belonged to the temple. Now he must pull the elf's other source of faith, the temple, from the altar as soon as possible. Only in this way, the elves who have no choice will gather around Rogge because of their faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Rogge’s heart, faith and blindness are one thing, and they are all his favorite things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, the fat man is very worried about the greatness of Hilo. Hilo is not the main god, the next layer, all the way to lure himself to the elf to sell. Thinking of this, Rogge hated it, and since then has a new understanding of the fate and the power of the Lord God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment Rumsfeld has been lifted out of the dungeon and locked in the interrogation room. Rogge slowly slammed into the past, sitting leisurely across from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld’s handsome face is still full of melancholy. He silently looks at Rogge quietly. With a beautiful magical shackle on his hand, this shackle can block the wearer's vindictiveness and is the most suitable thing for martial arts masters such as Rumsfeld. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge clap his hands, an elf warrior put a refreshment on the two, and placed it on the table. Rumsfeld’s eyes flashed in surprise. With his understanding of Rogge, God made the adult absolutely a sultry person. He stood on the side of the temple after he died. Now that God has resurrected, he has even done a good job. Preparation for quiet execution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Rogge really wants to do this, he will not resist, as long as Rogge promises that he is no longer a fan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cup of tea! Don't be nervous, I am also angry for a while. After all, ‘the dark side of the moon’ has been with me for so long, and I have never died of a warrior. Now come back and see that half of the war is dead, my heart hurts! I believe in you, you will not intentionally let your comrades die, I even know that you are a heroic and noble elf who will stand in front of his comrades to block the sword! Because you are a noble sacred guardian! Rogge smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld was very surprised, Rogge even said such a thing, let his heart have some turbulence <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trial is surprisingly easy, maybe, more like a chat between friends. Rumsfeld also slowly opened the heart, and even will Rogge talked a few words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the surrounding elf guards, there is always some unspeakable taste in this scene.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't know why, they always feel that the gods and the guardians of the church are shaking, and the ears are faint and sometimes whispering. The face is getting more and more ugly, and there is already a roll that can't be pressed in the stomach. However, God makes the adults in the room to sue, they must not leave the post, the elf warrior's duty and honor makes them support hard. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Elf Guards are about to support, all the discomfort Suddenly disappeared. The whole world suddenly had sound and color, and it was full of vitality. They greedily breathed fresh and humid air, and they were weak, just like a serious illness.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and told the Elf guard: "I have understood that the casualty of the dark side of the moon is not the fault of Rumsfeld. To open his beggar, he is free."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rumsfeld walked out of the gates of the Presbyterian Church, the night was already deep. A dozen elves are arguing fiercely at the entrance to the courtyard of the Presbyterian Church, completely without the elegant grace of the elves. Rumsfeld looked over and saw the guards of several temples pushing the guardian warriors of the dark side of the moon, trying to rush into the elders. But where are the physically weak, who can push the martial arts guardian who is strong? However, they screamed and slammed into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sacred ritual of the sacred priest is the highest command of the city of oracle! She wants to see the ruthless ruthless singer! You follow the devil and die The Master of the Spiritual Master, the fallen 'Moon of the Moon' dare to stop me! Have you turned away from the belief in Hilo? Are you afraid of the punishment of the fallen elf in the temple?" Agitated, her high attitude also explains the situation of 'the dark side of the moon' in the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the guardian warriors are not allowed to move. They just held the hilt and looked at the temple's attendants coldly, completely ignoring the hands they pushed on themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under their gaze, the temple's attendants felt inexplicable fear! They dare not tough, they have to raise the voice of accusation. It has already begun to have elves gathered behind them, which gives them a lot of enthusiasm, and scolding is becoming more and more impassioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld stepped forward and said: "Well, don't quarrel! Lord Rogge has forgiven my sins with tolerance. And restored my freedom. Is it the Zhaoyi Grand Sacrifice to find me? Then don't delay the time, let's go to the temple first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared at the guardian warriors and threw a sentence: "The sacred ritual will make you pay for the rude!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the elders In a window with no ***, Rogge was quietly watching the quarrel below. After watching Rumsfeld’s departure from the temple, he smiled coldly: “Dare to dare to come to me here! Zhao Wei, I will let you see this, you will get back, it’s a competent man. , or a demon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly burst into his heart, he couldn’t help but yawn, muttering: "Mom, Erosion is really a metamorphosis! It doesn't make much use. It takes almost all of the energy of Laozi to use it. What old things have nothing to do with this thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rog looked at the position of the moon and knew that there were still two hours before he came out. He told a guardian warrior to look at the door and then went to the quiet room to meditate. He must regain his strength as soon as possible, and if the old guy of Sius is unsuccessful, he is ready to come hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rumsfeld stepped into the small prayer room on the side of the temple, Zhao Wei was waiting anxiously for him. Seeing his tall figure coming in, she immediately stood up and greeted her with a happy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rumsfeld! You are back! Does Rogge have a hard time for you? He is a necromancer! Come back, the city of the gods can't Without you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing eagerly, and hate the earth: "Rogge will use the most evil undead power, we are all given by him It’s a lie! It seems that the elf warriors of 'the dark side of the moon' are really fallen. Even when they know that he is so evil, they only listen to his orders and do not obey the orders of the temple! I will call tomorrow. The elf of the city stood up and stripped the aura of Rogge! This demon, he will bring the glory of the elves to hell! And those arrogant 'the dark side of the moon', I will let them know that they are abandoning the elves. The price of faith!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Sacrifice, the 'Dark Side of the Moon' faith is stronger than any elf. In order to allow other elves to live in the sun They would rather walk in the darkness themselves." Rumsfeld’s sad but firm voice interrupted Zhao. "In these days, in order to defend the city of the gods, I looked at too many 'dark side of the moon' soldiers falling down beside me, but no one elf would retreat. The big sacrifice, the god created by the adults' The dark side of the moon is the most devout elf in the city of the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhao Zhao looked at Rumsfeld with some surprise, but see later The eyes of the person reveal unparalleled firmness. The most lacking of the temple is the use of force. The guardians of the two churches must be wooed. This is why I am reluctant to say: "Well, I can forgive the disrespect of the dark side of the moon." But Rogge, this evil Necromancer, I can never make a concession on this matter. If it is not the evil power of the undead, how can it be resurrected after death? He must have signed a contract with the evil spirit. And the elf is the sacrifice promised on this contract!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tonight, his melancholy is different from the past, his breathing is gradually getting thicker, and the blue veins of the road are constantly rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Sacrifice...Not good....You flee!...Escape!" Rumsfeld suddenly held his head in his hands and cried! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhao Yu was shocked and hurried: "What happened to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld suddenly With a low snoring, the eyelids have turned into a turquoise. He suddenly dumped Zhao Zhao on the ground, stretched his hand and tore it, and he had already torn off the Zhaoyi half-faced robe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the whiteness of Zhao’s nakedness and a little blush on the abundance of hills, the fire in the eyes of Rumsfeld is getting stronger and stronger! He suddenly grasped the huge giant of Zhao's elf, grabbed, bite, and slammed hard. The low snoring came out of his throat like a beast that was going crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhao Yu looked at himself and couldn’t hold his own ruthless Rumsfeld, but it was very calm: "It turns out that your soul has been The power of evil is in control! It must be the good thing of Rogge, the devil's good work, in the temple of Hilo, in the face of the inexhaustible majesty of God, how can you make this small conspiracy succeed!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madness of Rumsfeld only cares about Zhao’s venting of the original, and does not bind Zhao’s hands, sacrificing the weak body, how can he get the mad sacred guardian ? Even if Zhao Qi is punching and kicking teeth, Rumsfeld is only when she is scratching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She completely ignored the sacred guardian who was burned by the fire, her arms raised, her hands intertwined with a graceful and graceful gesture, and a few clear-cuts spit out in her mouth. Note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple of Hilo, as a great sacrifice, Zhao Zhao can move large sacred magic with a few simple notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, there seems to be a sigh of faintness, and then a black shadow that flashes without a flash. Zhao Yan’s face was numb, and she suddenly appeared in horror, and there was no sound in her mouth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Rumsfeld’s heart is getting stronger and stronger! There was a struggle in his eyes, but the struggle was so weak, and it was suppressed by the fire in the blink of an eye. He suddenly became very powerful, and after a few tears, he tore off the last few thin pieces of fabric on Zhao Wei! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a beast that is covered in fire, and it’s the clearest lake in the snow...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast with a red afterimage, suddenly plunged into the lake...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful face of Zhao Wei was distorted by pain, she The small mouth was big, but there was still no sound; her arms pushed Rumsfeld in vain, and the fragile constitution made her completely unable to push his mountain-like body! With his violent movements, Zhao Yu painfully grasped his back, and the pointed nails on his fingers marked a blood mark on his back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for Rumsfeld to succumb to the rudeness of pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inaudible sigh rang again in the dark, screaming twice, and two white ones were thrown to Rumsfeld. It turned out to be another two sacrifices in the temple! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are completely, their eyes are full of despair and panic, but the whole body is soft and obviously has no strength. They are also like Zhao Zhao, with a small mouth screaming in horror, like screaming, but no sound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frantic Guardian of the Templar immediately showed a new prey! Lifeless Zhao Zhao can no longer provoke him more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast jumped out of the lake, and the burning flame of the whole body did not weaken! It ecstatically looked at the newly emerging two clear lakes, and screamed and jumped in...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most sacred place of the temple, four are positive Intertwined, playing frantic and savage music! They have completely forgotten the passage of time, do not know that the night has passed, the dawn has arrived...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said how the temple light disappeared! The priests who have always been high above are the elves who truly abandon the faith of God!" Rogge's cold voice is like the loudest morning bell, awakening the elf who is still immersed in darkness and sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams came from three sacrifices. They seemed to wake up and suddenly appeared. The traces of the body and the weakness of the powerlessness fully explained what a frantic night it was! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes them desperate is that at the door, Rogge stands up and looks at them coldly. Behind Rogge, there are countless elves, all the elders are in it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More screams are from the mouth of the elf behind Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld stood up, even though he was still indifferent, but his eyes had recovered from the clear, and his temperament was still calm. His eyes glanced in the elf behind Rogge, as if looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly found it, it was a stunning face with a face full of despair and sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld’s face is finally white. The fascination in his eyes quickly faded away and became lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One side is the noble Guardian of the Templar, and the other is a holy sacrifice. The truth of the prayer and remorse every night is such a scene!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger did not give Zhaoxi a chance to defend his voice, his voice has already trembled with anger, and the higher the higher, the faster he said: "If not Today, the light of the temple suddenly disappeared. We still don’t know that in Hilo’s most holy hall, there is even the most ugly play! It’s no wonder that Hilo will be so angry! No wonder the light will disappear! I thought it was the demon who defiled the holy place dedicated to Hilo. I didn’t expect it to be like this!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a meal, Rogge gave the sacrifices a final blow. : There is indeed a demon that has defiled the holy land of Hilo! This demon is in the soul of our respectable sacrifices! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing her face pale, she sat down on the ground, and her extreme humiliation made her bow her head deeply. Her hands covered her face and sobbed low." All of them are still exposed, and all the hidden parts are exposed. There is a blank in Zhao’s mind. She only hopes that this is a nightmare, so I can wake up quickly!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld’s heart flashed through Rogge’s words: “You are the guardian of the church, let other elves see your weak side, not later, or later in the evening. Go find the sacrifices! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart is completely cold, he understands that all this is now arranged by Rogge. With his understanding of Rogge, the whole The plan will not give him and the rituals any room to turn over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up, just in time to meet Rogge’s sharp eyes. The elf is the most elite. The soldier smiled bitterly, closed his eyes and waited for Rogge’s verdict.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“According to the most glorious tradition of the elf, the elf who served as the Hilo sacrifice must be Pure and innocent, from the soul to the top can not be a trace of unclean! Now, the elves present, including all the elders of honor, have already seen that the three sacrifices such as Zhao Yu are no longer pure! Therefore, I declare as God's ambassador that they are no longer qualified to continue to serve as Hilo's sacrifices, and are no longer eligible to continue to live in the temple of Hilo! Now, they will be put into a dungeon for the crime of blasphemy. After I receive the gods, I will agree on the punishment for them! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's gaze turned to Rumsfeld again and twice. The body of the Guardian is full of power and beauty, all the lines." They both resolutely and gracefully and gracefully blend together, and it is a perfect body!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked a bit embarrassed. As a Necromancer, his perfect and strong body has always been his favorite object. However, it is important not to give him any chance to turn over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Have a distinguished elder to witness! Rumsfeld and Gui were convicted! Therefore, he will be permanently removed from the title of the Guardian of the Church, shut into the prison, waiting for the most severe punishment of the Elves! "There was extreme anger and contempt in Rogge's voice. The elves behind him recovered from the initial surprise and screamed at the four elves in the middle of the room.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accusation of anger continued for nearly half an hour, and there was a growing trend. Rogge had to raise his hands, and after a while, the room slowly calmed down.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three priests are dull, and the sudden blows have made the pampered women completely lose their ability to act and think. Zhao Yi’s will is the most determined. She wants to say out loud that this is a conspiracy! It must be a plot planned by Rogge behind him! However, when she saw the eyes of the elves in the field, her heart was cold, and she knew that even if she would argue, no one would believe her at the moment. Most importantly, she is no longer a pure body. Even if all the elves know that the whole thing is planned by Rogge, she can no longer serve as a priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She figured it out in an instant, this is the most important part of Rogge's plan. The tradition of the elf she has consistently adhered to has become her most deadly weakness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showa silently wrapped his body with a cloak. She only feels that she is completely numb, and it doesn't matter how Roger will retaliate. The biggest revenge has passed, what is she afraid of? The only thing that Zhaohao regrets is that she can't remind the new sacrifice to be careful of the devil. She knew that Rogge would never give her this chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching Zhao Wei and others were taken down, Rogge looked at Xiusi with a sneak peek, when he received the Xiusi rushing in, even He did not think that the scene would be so hot and irritating. But in any case, the temple was overturned, and he finally gave him a bad breath. As soon as he thought of the loss of the fascinating ‘the dark side of the moon’, Rogge couldn’t help but anger. This is a very sharp knife, and Rogge would have liked to rely on ‘the dark side of the moon’ to have a great deal in the north! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Rumsfeld, it’s already Roger’s palm. There are many magical magics in the memory of the Lich Elgara. The process of making the dragon horse also greatly opened Rogge. The Guardian of the Elves is an excellent test material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the city of the gods finally ushered in a long-lost peace. The elves were pleasantly surprised to see that the golden dome of the temple gave off a faint light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the day of its completion, the ‘God City’ has never been too peaceful. After a month of war, there are so many strange things in the elves, even after the sum of the past millennium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resurrection of the gods has made the elves very surprised, and the resurrected gods have used the evil, strange and powerful magic to repel the human allied forces. Greatly shocked the nerves of the elves. Now there are events of rituals and guardians of the sanctuary, and all the sacrifices are rare! Some elves have already felt faintly that even if Hilo will take the carriage of the god of death to the world tomorrow, they will not be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the attendants and sacrifices of the temple were put to prison, God made Rogge move into the temple logically. As for the light of the temple, how can it be difficult to master the magic of Rogge? There are no magic items in the collection of the elves that contain divine power. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge still has to clean up in the future, there is too much to wait for him to be a good one in the city of the gods. So after the temple was re-released, Rogge quietly came to the bedroom of Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the room of Hughes, Rogge hesitated and finally decided to knock in the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised the fat man was that the old fox was sitting quietly in the room, next to a pot of fragrant tea, apparently waiting for Luo grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, how does Hughes know that Rogge will come to him at this time? It is not far from dawn now! This old thing does not sleep, is waiting for him? Rog looked at the teapot, clearly the newly brewed tea, this old guy has not waited for how long! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is more and more wary of this old thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Xius!" Rogge piled up his most sincere smile and sat down. He pretended to inadvertently move the chair so that he could freely choose between breaking the window and breaking the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and gave Rogge a cup of tea. Rogge picked up a bite and he was a Necromancer. He was not afraid of poison. Moreover, he also drank the blood of the Green Dragon, and the anti-virulence was further improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Xiusi, I am here to find you, I want to discuss the situation with you. I have a lot of places to help the Presbyterians! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
