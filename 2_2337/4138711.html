			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has not yet risen from the top of the mountain, and the morning dew still hangs on the tip of the tip of the leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog easily lay on the roof and chewed a straw in his mouth. Amy was at his side, a pair of big eyes bright, staring at him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village sounded a burst of screams, seven or eight people carrying baskets and cans, under the leadership of the old village chief, the fish went up the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Amy." Rogge screamed lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The village head, what do they do in the morning, hunting?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy smiled and gently tapped Roy on the head of Rogge to hunt? Really you want to come out! If they let Gruba hear it, they will be angry. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grumbar? As for his ability, I will not look at it again and again. But he seems to like you very much. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy's face is red, whispered: "I have nothing to do with him!" Don't think about it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "He is the youngest man in the young Druid, you are the most beautiful girl in the village, he likes it." You are normal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy's face is redder and the voice is lower: "He is the most powerful man, but people... where is the most beautiful person." ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rughaha, isn’t there anyone else? You haven’t answered my question yet.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy, only after returning to God, Grandpa, they are going to give food to Trillen Hutt. Every ten days, I will send it to Trillen Hutt. Adults especially like the fruit wine we prepared! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was originally the story of Trillen Hutt. This is your secret, you should not tell me. Rog smiled. He suddenly took Amy over and kissed him heavily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy snorted, his body completely stiffened. After a while, it slowly softened. She hooked Rogge's neck back and responded enthusiastically.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were rolling on the roof, It took a long time to stop. Amy was as silky and flushed. She whispered, pulling Rogge's arm and trying to pull it out of her clothes. But that one The hand was so flexible that she couldn't help but tease the two pieces of soft meat on her chest, and she was so soft.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To..." Amy sighed The words were not finished yet, and the small mouth was sealed by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stroking her smooth, very elastic skin, one hand can't stop looking down. Amy squinted and twisted her body against the restless hand of Rogge. But Rogge is as big as a cow, how can she resist it? Amy’s voice has already been broken by Rogge’s last line of defense, touching her weakest place and making her heart beat like a drum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge picked up Amy, jumped off the roof, went back to the room, threw her on the bed, and rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy was so passionate that she suddenly bite on Rogge’s shoulder. He yelled and jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy exclaimed, she suddenly almost already had it, and quickly pulled the quilt to cover the long legs of Bai Shengsheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger caressed his shoulders, which now have thin prints on both sides. Originally, with Rogge's monster-like body, as long as the muscles are collected, it is not difficult to bounce off her teeth. Even if it is only tight, she will be completely scratching. Now leaving such a row of teeth, naturally I don't want her to know the secrets of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy sat up and whispered: "Sorry, our female Druid can't be before the age of eighteen... can't..." can't What, she can't say anything about life and death, but Rogge certainly understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy’s head is getting lower and lower, and the voice becomes almost like a mosquito: “I’m still nine months and eleven days...it’s eighteen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge gently put Amy into his arms, smiled and asked: "Is it still nine months?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy gently nodded Eat and say: "I'm sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hugged Amy and sighed: "Maybe... I can't wait that long. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy was taken aback and looked up and said: "Why, isn't it here? Or what is Grubpa doing?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles at the child, it's good. It’s even better after you have it. However, I am in trouble and have a lot of trouble. There are many people chasing me, they are very strong. I have been here for a long time, and if they find it here, it will bring disaster to the village. So, I have to go, understand? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy clung to the clothes of Rogge and said, "It doesn't matter." You will not bring any disaster to our village. Grandpa Jason is a very druid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jason? He is not necessarily my opponent, how can he resist those who chase me? There are a few of those who can easily beat me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy said confidently: "It doesn't matter, there is the owner of Trillhuw Hut guarding our village!" It is impossible for human chasers to defeat the adults of Trillen Hutt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, asked: "Who is the person who has been forgotten by Trillen Hutt? I should not ask this question." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy leaned on Rogge and gently said: "How can you be an outsider now?" In fact, the adult of Trillhuw... is a sacred and noble dragon! The adults saved several Druids hundreds of years ago. These Druids expressed gratitude and made secret wines for adults. The adults of Trillen Hutt liked it very much, and they agreed to guard the descendants of these Druids. The price was the wine and food of the Druids. It has been several hundred years since the date of this agreement. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is in a hurry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One dragon! At least a thousand years have survived The wise dragon! A dragon that easily shredded nearly one ogre! This is the secret of this Druid village!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue seems to have I saw the scene where the holy knights struggled in the breath of the dragon. He suddenly couldn’t help but laugh out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge brother, what happened to you? Amy asked strangely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, a dragon who loves to drink!" I heard it for the first time. Haha tell me about the story of Trillen Hutt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hand is taken out, so...so I can't talk..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Morning is a good time for young Druids to practice martial arts. Seven or eight young people are working hard on the wooden poles and hammers in the small square in the east of the village. Roger, accompanied by Amy, also came here, ‘pointing’ the druids’ skills. Druids have always been dominated by magic. When fighting, they rely on deformation to change into various biological battles, and they will recruit countless wild fierce creatures to help Warcraft, so their combat skills are not particularly important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Druid tribe has been closed for too long, and the practice of martial arts is really not very good. Even Roger, a pseudo-knight, dared to give pointers to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge first took the gun off the court, he still vaguely remembered several kinds of Orfey Roger's marksmanship. The fat man will seem to be full of enthusiasm, and the milky white light produced by the lighting magic is full of body, and even the guns are faintly light. He took the gunpower with his mental strength. When a gun was used, it was really unpredictable and difficult to guard against. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gun was shot east, the gun was in the south; it was a swipe, and somehow it turned into a head-on. Under a few tricks, Rogge killed five or six young people on the field. He laughed and set off his gun. He straightened Amy's eyes and his face was red, and he couldn't tell the pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lot of introspection, Rogge said the importance of equipment. This is his old line, some analysis is concise, concise and expressive, supplemented by countless examples. The young Druids looked at their own leather jackets, and the wooden sticks in their hands were simply shy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge cleared his throat and coughed. Amy immediately walked into the field with a small backpack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backpack opens with a small, lightweight magical gear such as more than ten wristbands, leggings, and magic boots. These are all Rogge's death from the dead sacred knights, law enforcers and jungle parade. It is in the Principality that it is a boutique, let alone a small village that is closed? In addition to the big trees or the big trees, these Druids have seen so many, such good magical equipment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are..." A daring period asks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The equipment is given to everyone by Rogge. Amy robbed the road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Druids cheered and came up to pick their favorite equipment. In this small village, the concept of wealth is very indifferent. Everyone is interoperating when they need it. So Roger's handwriting is not small, but everyone will not be too surprised. But the people in the village are very simple, without concealing their desire and joy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at such a group of energetic young people, Rogge’s heart was a little bit unbearable. He gently put his hand on his chest and stroked the black through his clothes. Crystal. The crystal is warm and moist, and there will always be a warm stream coming into his chest. Rog smiles and will swallow it when he reaches the mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, early morning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky has just had a glimmer of light, and the mountains are silent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge sits on a boulder on the top of the mountain and quietly looks at the small village in the valley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The mental power spread out, and the magical fluctuations in the body jumped again. This wave seemed to resonate with his heart, and it was getting stronger and stronger. Rogge almost couldn’t help but use his mental power again. Seal this magical wave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Able to become a major event, it will be informal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogg repeated In the heart of this sentence, a drop of sweat came out of his forehead. Amy's sweet smile, the simple face of the young people, will always appear in front of his eyes.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light breeze blew.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said, I am doing this, right? Rogge seems to be talking to himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a doubt behind the scenes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have forgotten it, as if I should not ask you this. How do you know? Rogge smiled bitterly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light fog behind him dissipated, *** standing on the boulder. She swung her right hand, that little The black crystal himself jumped out of Rogge's clothes and floated quietly in front of his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed a statement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the mountain over there, I feel the breath of the dragon. It doesn't seem to be very powerful, at least compared to our Devils, it is too weak. Gregory also jumped out of the fog and showed his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time it was a lord, it was at least very good, so it was rewarded by ***. The newly repaired body is now significantly stronger than before. A group of faint mists linger in its sternum, it seems that it will not take long, its chest will be formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sinks and replies: "We should go to Longfeng to see the terrain. I hope not to alarm the dragon. If you can directly teach the chase It’s better to have the soldiers lead to the dragon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three figures slowly lie in the morning fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Rogge has quietly returned to the village. He dragged the action and Cooper, who was inconvenient, went to the village chief Jason’s house for dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long life of the elves is an advantage and the source of their tragic fate. An elf slave often has to serve a generation of people in a family, and will show the old state and be resold. In order to prevent the elf slaves from buying and selling, the Elven tribes on the Big 6 once had a great union and fought against the various dynasties of mankind. But unlike the fate of the Dwarf Empire hundreds of years later, the war that lasted for more than a decade ended in the fiasco of the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are too convinced of myths. They sent to the god of hope, the great elf of the war, Hilo, never appeared on the battlefield; they were too proud to leave the familiar forests and mountains and even confronted the heavy cavalry of the humans on the plains. In the end, their cleanliness ruined the last hope of the elves. On one side is a jungle lake, and on the other side is a muddy wasteland. The human commander easily judged the escape direction of the elf's squadron and wiped out the remnants of the elves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this war, the elves were deeply hidden in the deep mountains and mountains that humans could not reach, and began a long rest and recuperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this vast and endless central mountain range, Rogge is almost certain to have the existence of an elf. Just want to find them, he also knows that it is purely delusional. The chasers of this church faction even had secret missions about the elves, so that Rogge’s heart was active again. If it is contained in the book, then the beauty, longevity, arrow skills and magic of the elves are of great value! Naturally, the number of humans that have traditionally been used by the elves to be willing to use them is extremely rare. If it is not the famous Druids in history, Rogge really does not know who has used the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if the use is not successful, plunder is always possible? The war of the Dwarf Kingdom fully allowed Rogge to taste the power of the robbers to get rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first fortune is often bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as long as you can get rich, Rogge doesn't care how much blood is on the gold. Unless these blood affects his future income. In this aspect of finance, the fat man is a rare and fascinating person. He has been watching for at least ten years. How to maximize the wealth in a decade or so is his goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to fight with a church that is so unimaginable, Rogge needs a huge resource site. These things often have to be attributed to a money word. Although money does not guarantee that Rogge gets everything, but there is no money, the church can send a dozen knights to chase Rogge to escape thousands of miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money is not a panacea, but no money is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Rogge’s deliberate efforts, this meal was enjoyed by the guests. Old Jason has not been drunk at noon for many years, but this time he was flushed and his tongue was big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves? Aha, I know...that are all timid guys! When I was young, there were several elves in the tribe! Actually, This mountain forest used to be the territory of an elf tribe. But later, the tribe gradually moved into the deep mountains... I moved over! At the beginning, I occasionally met an elf, maybe I still know them. I have never seen any elves anymore. These cowards are!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ruthless Rogge asks: What is it... Call them cowardly? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the Holy Land of the Elves suddenly dug up a large prophecy. Don't ask where the holy places of the elves are, and those cowards will never let people know the location of their holy places. The horrible prophecy on the monument says the year of disaster, and don't ask me what is the year of disaster, those cowards will pretend to be ghosts! Anyway, when the elves are in trouble, their gods will send his messengers to save the elves. You said that in the battle between the elves and the humans, the shit Hilo did not show miracles. Is it this time... What other messengers can be sent this time! Not as good as our Druid's Tree of Life and the God of Nature! At least four great Druids can communicate with our gods at any time! For the sake of what broke the prophecy, the elves gradually moved to the mountains. You said! This is not a coward and what! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason's wife knocked on his head. "You are a dead old man!" Every time you get drunk, you have to say something about the elves! You have been thinking about the elf Elena in your heart! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Old woman, you know... I have nothing to do with the elves! Don't knock so heavy, and then knock my deformation spells and forget them! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge firmly remembered Jason's words, and maybe he won't be able to use it in the future. The magic mark in his body beats a bit, and far away, Rogge has felt that a homologous magical wave is resonating with this magical mark. Looking at the carefree Druids, Rogge sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karajan and Chrisma marched with the pursuers without hesitation. A few days ago, Rogge’s trace disappeared completely. After a few days, he appeared as if he was flying in the other direction and hundreds of kilometers away! Hundreds of kilometers, but in the Central Mountains, it will take several days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma adjusted the direction. He already has experience and is not too eager to catch up with Rogge. The facts have proved Rogge's insidious blackmail. So Chrisma began to regard Rogge as a real opponent worthy of serious treatment. All the way, he and Kara Yang have already felt the strangeness in the forest. It seems that the entire forest has awakened and is watching them silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are silently marching through the forest. Chrisma and Kara Yang looked at each other. Suddenly, the long sword was squirted and pierced into a big tree next to it. Under the high temperature of the light, the tree shouted with screams and slowly withered. The forest suddenly rioted, and Kara Yang's figure flashed like a stream of water in the woods. The sword smashed dozens of trees into two sections, and the green trees shed green juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bright Master sang a spell in a loud voice, a white aperture spread out of his body. Some trees, birds and beasts in the forest began to glow with a faint yellow glow. The law enforcers have already plunged into the forest, and they have smashed everything that has a yellow glow, no matter what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest is returning to death. The wild and ignorant birds and beasts have escaped to be clean, so as to avoid the messengers of these gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Jason! Uncle Jason!" A loud call not only disturbed the tranquility of the village, but also woke up the drunken old Jason. He went out with his clothes and his feet were still vain. A young Druid ran to his face in sweat and gasped: "Da Jason! The big thing is not good! We should have changed their class in Gruba and monitored the forest around the village. But we are handing over Waiting for a long time, I don’t see Grubba’s shadow! And, I smell a death in the forest!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason immediately woke up. He hurriedly said: "Come and take me to the village to see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest outside the village is dead. Jason led the young Druids in the village to stand at the entrance to the village and looked at the forest uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long grass separates from the two sides, and a knight jumps out. One knight after another walked out of the forest and stood in a neat row in front of the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason looks ugly, he whispers to a young man around him: "Go and inform the people in the village to escape from Trillen Hugh." , inform Rogge, let him also hide on the Dragon Peak." The young man led the way, trotting all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang immediately asked, "We are the law enforcers of the sacred Light Church! Guided by the High God, we are chasing a god." Sinners! We don't want to bother your life, just want to get some news about this sinner and a place to stay overnight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason stepped forward and replied "I am the village head of this village. We have been isolated for hundreds of years. You are the only one who has been here for hundreds of years. The sinner you said, we don't have any news about him. As for accommodation. One night, this is no problem. Although our Druid is not rich, it has always been generous to friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends...hehe." Kara Yang whispered Smiled a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Chrisma’s whip suddenly shook and pulled to Jason’s face. Jason subconsciously flashed, and the long whip suddenly turned a corner flexibly, and rolled a young Druid around Jason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma grabbed the wrist of the young Druid and held it up high and shouted: "What is this! The old man, how do you explain this?" Origin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man wears a delicate magic wristband on his wrist. Chrisma indicated that the two law enforcement officers stood up and raised their arms high. Their wristbands were exactly the same as the wristbands worn by this young man! The only difference is that the law enforcement officer's wristband is carrying a sterling silver cross, and the same position on the young wristband is a sword scratch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
