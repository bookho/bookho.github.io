			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Russian Temple at the foot of the snow-capped mountains of Alaska is one of the nineteen great shrines dedicated to the supreme creation of the gods on the mainland. The entire temple was built of ivory white marble. In front of the temple are 24 marble columns that are held by two people. The pillars are engraved with praises of the god of creation and the gods who follow him. At the top of the temple stood an angel statue, and the wings behind it radiated a soft, creamy magical glow that shrouded the entire temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal Braun slowly closed the "Sacred Prayer" in front of him and ended the evening prayer. The white virgins of the choir retired silently, and the high and solemn hymns seemed to echo in the air. Gazing at the flames on the altar, there was no irritability and guilt in Braun's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifty-five-year-old Buren is not young in the twenty-three cardinals of the Holy Church, and his accomplishments in the light mana are also moderately low. However, he was particularly favored by the Pope and was governed by the Russian Temple of God. As the most influential religion on the continent, the sacred church has tens of millions of believers. The authority of the pope is recognized by the great empires, and even the kings of some small countries can be enshrined. The construction of the Russian Temple lasted for 16 years. On the day of the completion of the day, thousands of horns of the horns rang, the petals fell like rain, and the white light descended from the sky. An angel with a double wings loomed in the light. The temple is blessed with the "Blessing of Angels". Since then, the Temple of Oddi has been shrouded in the light of the Holy Light. It has also become the only temple in the Temple of the Nine, except the Temple of Light, where the Pope is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burn is thinking about his uneasiness. Located fifteen miles from the temple, it is located in the second largest commercial port on the mainland, Port of Pus. Every year, the Port of Puss offers five percent of its tax revenue to the Holy Church, and Buren can control one-third of this vast wealth. "It’s almost time to offer, and there should be two million gold coins to offer this year. I hope that the lord of the fat pig will not deceive the Lord’s wealth.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This night, Buren has no heart to sleep. "Is it the curse of the Necromancer?" Six months ago, the bishop of Buren led the 300 Knights of the Temple, and the 20 great priests went deep into the Alaska Mountains, destroying a Necromancer and his undead army hidden there. The mage is still not a climate, and the undead is not more than 3,000. This annihilation is better than tourism. Buren personally cast a level 6 magic "Holy Purification", watching the Necromancer burn in the Light and disappear. The curse of the mage before his death was not in the mind for Buren, but was dispelled by the gods around him before it happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Moon Mordes had passed through the air, Buren finally determined the troubles in his heart. Yes, it is the Virgin Vera who came to the temple today. The sculptural face, the straight nose, the knife-like lips, omnipresent sacred atmosphere. "That is an angel." Buren said to himself. The Virgin Wina grew up beside the Pope and no one knew where she came from. For the past 17 years, it was her first time to step out of the Great Temple of Light. She raised her hands and feet, and under the white coat, the faint curve was as if it was in front of Buren. Buren only felt dry in his mouth, but he could not find water. He cursed low and stood up and walked out of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wina's snow-covered neck, the sacred white robe can't cover the undulations of the most subtle movements. And that fluctuation seems to be expanding in the eyes of Buren, and burning his nerves. For the first time, Buren even hoped that he was a thief, so that... Bren smiled a bit, what kind of thieves couldn’t help the 16th-level Guangming Master, and he was only a 13-level Guangming Master in the church for more than 40 years. God is still eccentric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the moon, but found a blood red in the moonlight tonight. Buren was a little surprised, and he hadn't returned to God. The darkness in front of him, the holy light of the temple everywhere disappeared suddenly. Darkness is definitely one of the most disgusting things of Buren. He restrained his own panic, and with the low singing, he used his fingers to draw complex symbols to prepare the level 3 magical "light". In addition to expelling evil, this spell can also temporarily act as lighting. Quietly, a black, etched with numerous symbols on the hand, specifically, the hand bone, touched the throat of Buren from behind. With the gentle stroke of the index finger, Buren's Holy Light has no chance to cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full armored warrior stood by Bren’s body. Deep black body armor, a long sword with a black flame burning, can only be seen from the hand bone of the sword. As there was a silent shout in the armor, countless warriors came out of the darkness and swarmed to the temple. The undead knight who rode the flame bone horse rushed out of the darkness and disappeared into the barracks of the Knights of the Temple on both sides of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this!! Guard! Get up!!" With a commotion, the Knights of the Temple were awakened. The Russian Temple has a total of 400 knights. The speedy knights quickly wore simple armor, and some of them were killed at the gate of the camp to block the endless squadrons. Others quickly began to arm. Or a priest has begun to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
