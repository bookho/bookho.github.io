He suddenly had a headache and frowned. Ajani, standing next to him, gently helped him pick up the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, how do these adventurers have as many as the locusts! We burned four of them four days ago, but there are four hundred more these days. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni gently poked the face of Rogge with his nails. They have been more honest recently! No one dares to make trouble. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is exhausted: "Aka Ni, this is really terrible." The level of adventurers who are now coming to Dresden is getting higher and higher. As long as there is a small thing, there is a head, the silent volcano will burst out. We are sitting on the crater now! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani said: "But it is not the way to prevent them!" Adults are tired of doing this, not to mention those of the Legal Affairs Department. Greedy adventurers will not be afraid of death, and they will certainly not be willing to leave the Principality of Are. The sisters of ‘the dark side of the moon’ said that now if they are out of the small number, there will be adventurers behind them. Although no one dares to really do it until now, it seems that it is only a matter of time! The wise men of the elves and the elves have said that the best way to flood the sky is not to build a long levee before the flood, but to direct it to the sea. Since we can't stop the adventurers from coming to the Ayre Principality, then we will return to the Central Mountain Range. The life of the human kingdom is really not suitable for the elves. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to Rogge’s brain suddenly, immediately jumped up and shocked Ajani.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute! What did you just say? Don't stop the flood, but introduce the sea... Ah! I understand! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge embraced Ajani and kissed heavily, rubbing her chest and hips with both hands. Not waiting for her reaction, Rogge went out in a whirlwind, leaving only the red-haired, awkward Ajani in the house, she had not figured out what happened!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The old Dresden has now become a huge adventurer transfer station. A group of adventurers came here to chase the elves, rested and inquired about the news, and then quietly left the ancient city. Dive to the central mountain range in the southeast. Although there are hundreds of elves in Dresden, the dark side of the existence of the elves can be seen, no adventurer will be stupid to confront the army, not to mention this is a bloodthirsty magic. The wizard's Elf Guard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strong is Roger's magic, no one can know, but he used the first level of magic missiles to easily kill one is not weak. Warrior, this is enough to make all the adventurers chill. Not to mention that he does not have to swear, it is useless. Any magical props, dozens of magic missiles fall like pouring rain, how do you resist?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two highest-level magicians in the adventurer are present on the same day. After seeing this scene, his face was pale, and he only said one sentence: "He is not a person! This is the ability of the devil! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 17-year-old Martha has been in Dresden for a week. She followed her brother’s adventure team and hoped that the elves could It is a dream of their fame. Martha is very proud of his brother, a ten-level swordsman, and deeply trusts the abilities of his companions. This seven-person adventure team has successfully completed many tasks in the past year. But now!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now the atmosphere in the entire pub is very depressed, from time to time, the adventurer will whisper curse the demon's court magician and his elf guard They have become the nightmare of all adventurers!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous Fager combination in the adventurer is over, and the surviving Fergu and the other A warrior is close to the edge of madness, soaking in the pub every day, but no one will laugh at Feige, the wind butterfly and the pace, the flying wheel saw and the gentle killing have been deeply engraved in every adventurer. The hearts of the adventurers know that if they stand in the position of Fager, Can't escape the fate of death. If it wasn't for Rogge's stunned stunned wind butterfly and Ajani, Feige would not have the opportunity to get drunk in the pub.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Martha sighed, and she and her friends have seen the heavily armed Elf Guard on the streets of Dresden more than once.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Martha knew that the Elf Guard had a name, the dark side of the moon. When she heard the name, her young heart suddenly moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pub is only average in Dresden. But now there are too many adventurers, and even the most common ale price has tripled. There is the Demon Master and his Elf Guard. The adventurer can't play the elf's idea at random, so he has nothing to do in the pub. There are a few painful groans in the dull pub, and Martha knows that these wounded are adventurers who have just returned from the Central Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, the Demon Master suddenly mobilized the Snow Bear Knight and the Elf Guard to block the two levels leading to the Central Mountain Range. All the adventurers were allowed to go out only. Into the mountains. The angry adventurers quickly gathered over 500 people, and opposite them were the 300-strong team and the dark side of the moon. Finally, someone lost his mind and began to attack the Elf Guard. Just like a barrel of gunpowder was ignited, all the adventurers were controlled by anger and greed. They screamed and rushed to the Elf Guard, trying to defeat the dark side of the moon in one fell swoop. The elf with high martial arts is expensive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small-scale conflict ended with the adventurer’s disastrous defeat. On the way to the assault, more than two hundred adventurers were shot. One hundred elite elf archers are so powerful that they are definitely not comparable to human archers. The most deadly blow to the confidence of the adventurer is the arrow of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrows that roared and shone with the blue light were so beautiful, but with a deadly killing. Many long arrows hit the adventurer's arm or thigh, and some even wiped out a small wound. However, all the adventurers who suffered from the arrow injury had difficulty breathing, and the whole body was weak, and slowly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God! These elf's arrows are poisonous!" The exclamations came one after another, and the morale of the adventurers who still rushed in the arrow rain fell to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has heard that elves who have always believed in light will also use poison arrows? And still so violently poisonous! Rogge was once again seated as a devil. If not a demon, how can a good and peaceful elf be turned into such a terrible war machine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, no one naturally thinks about what the adventurers have done in order to search for the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge circular saw of the wind butterfly once again shocked the nerves of the adventurer. Her flying figure has become the spokesperson of the god of death, and the huge wheel saw can easily cut off the slightly smaller weapons. This time she did not wear a face helmet. All the adventurers have a moment of shock when they see the world of the wind and the butterfly. In this moment of lateness, the green saws that shine with the green brilliance will gently kiss their throats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her, ten Elf guardian warriors led two hundred Snow Bear knights and adventurers to fight close. The line of defense they formed firmly blocked the adventurers, and a sharp arrow that fled the life of the knights flew over, and the adventurers who were fighting with them were shot down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is very short. After paying more than 400 lives, only a hundred adventurers fled back to Dresden. Fortunately, the demonic masters did not have the meaning of chasing. It seems that the order they received was only to block the passage to the Central Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage was blocked, and if you want to sneak into the Central Mountains, the adventurers will have to walk nearly 100 kilometers. In the snowy Northland, adventurers have to bring a lot of support, and take so long roads, no doubt the risk is much bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this clearly makes the adventurers realize that their strength is quite different from that of the regular army, especially the dark side of the moon. . The adventurers who are now staying in Dresden are not reconciled. They are still waiting for the opportunity to wait for the opportunity of the elves to place orders, although this opportunity is really embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that many powerful adventurers are not hurt, Martha couldn’t help but thank her brother’s team for not having time to catch up with the battle, otherwise she wouldn’t think Can you have a chance to come back alive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Martha was thinking about it, a big man rushed into the pub, and he shouted: A great news! The demon magician turned away! The hunter certificate rumored these days is actually a real thing! It’s a very bad time to put it, it is said to be...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another middle-aged swordsman jumped up and hurryed He grabbed his mouth and looked around nervously. The eyes of everyone in the pub looked at him, and he barely smiled, greeted the team members and left the pub in a hurry.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, what is the hunter certificate?" Martha asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the adventure group holding the hunter’s certificate will be allowed to enter the Central Mountain Range and will be replenished on Rogge’s territory. I also served two days ago. This is a rumor, and now it may be true!" Martha's brother replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masha suddenly felt a little uneasy, he said, "Brother, you said, is this a trap? Maybe there is something evil in the Central Mountain Range." Warcraft is waiting for us! Brother, these elves are much more powerful than we think, we will go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother hesitated, finally Dao: "Masha said that it makes sense. We are still careful. However, if there is a hunter certificate, there is always better than nothing! I don't want to conflict with the elves who are armed to the teeth! Now, go out and see first. Look at the hunter certificate is not really to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really a hunter certificate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificate was placed in the Legal Affairs Department, and 20 hunter certificates were issued. Each certificate allowed the holder to bring ten followers to enter the Elf Guard. The blockade entered the Central Mountain Range. The conditions for obtaining a certificate are surprisingly simple, one hundred gold coins, first come first served, valid for two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a discovery task along with the certificate. It is said that the Grand Sorcerer Rogge has a huge and incomplete map of the Central Mountains. All adventurers who enter the Central Mountain Range are required to plot the terrain they are passing through. If the map of the adventure team fills the gap on the Rogge map, they will receive a reward of one thousand gold coins and become a formal knight in the Principality of Are. The choice of members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred gold coins are not decimals, but most adventurers are worth the money. Although many people are worried about whether there will be any traps behind this, more adventurers are more willing to grasp the opportunities at hand. Adventure adventure, no risk? As a result, the 20 hunter certificates were robbed, and the unsuccessful adventure team was reluctant to hesitate and miss the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day of the official hunter certificate, there were several teams of impatient adventurers. Arriving at the Central Mountain Range one day earlier, I had the opportunity to discover the secrets of the elves one day earlier. As for how to transport the captured elves out of the Principality of Aray, it is something that needs to be handled later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But two days later, there was even more shocking news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dragons in the Central Mountain Range! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing back this news is an adventure team called ‘forest silver wolf’. They entered the Central Mountain Range early on, when Rogge had not blocked the Central Mountain Range. They have been in the Central Mountain Range for almost a month, but they have nothing to gain. Just as they were desperate and ready to return, the dragon appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a gray afternoon, a dragon flew over the ‘forest silver wolf’! Its huge body is more than ten meters long, and the wings spread out to cover the sky! The range of Longwei is surprisingly vast, and even the 'forest silver wolf' feels the majesty of the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Forest Silver Wolf’ are hidden, fearing that the dragon is now on his own. They still don't want to be honored by the Dragon Slayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dragon’s flight attitude is strange, slow and swaying. Suddenly, a backpack slipped from the back of the dragon and fell off the ‘forest silver wolf’. The backpack cracked a hole, and it was all gold and silverware and jewelry! ‘Forest Silver Wolf’ couldn’t believe their good fortune, they actually met a dragon that was moving! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon hovered over the forest to find his lost baby. But it was awkward and clumsy. After several hoverings, there were still no places where the backpacks had fallen. Finally, they screamed a few times and flew deep into the Central Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wealth in the backpack is so huge that the 'forest silver wolf' is surprised! The value of jewellery and gold and silver itself is only about half, and the exquisite craftsmanship and long-term age have also added enormous value to these jewels. God knows how many years this dragon has been collecting this baby! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ‘forest silver wolf’ that had caught the unexpected winds hurriedly left the Central Mountain Range but was stopped on the blockade line. To their surprise, they did not suffer any martyrdom. After being told that the blockade line was issued, no hunter certificate would no longer be allowed to enter the Central Mountain Range. In this way, the 'forest silver wolf' returned to Dresden with their harvest. They showed some of the spoils, including a quaint purple gold crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The richest ‘forest silver wolf’ is determined to end their adventures, find a quiet place, and live a prosperous life. In the eyes of countless adventurers envious or embarrassed, eight ‘forest silver wolf’ adventurers left Dresden. Now they have so much money that they have hired a hundred Snow Bear knights to protect their safety until they are out of the Principality of Are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advent of the 'forest silver wolf', another rumor began to spread among adventurers. It is said that Rogge and his Elf Guards recently reinvented an ancient dragon, and now let the adventurers search the terrain of the Central Mountains to capture the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No adventurer dares to provoke a dragon, but when this dragon carries a lot of treasures, there will be a small group of high-level adventurers Take a chance. If the dragon that moved this house is still seriously injured, it is simply a moving Jinshan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha’s brother is as excited as a child in these two days! His luck was incredibly good, and he even got a hunter certificate! A hunter certificate can pass ten people, and their adventure team is only seven. So three high-level adventurers temporarily joined their adventure team at the cost of five hundred gold coins per person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masha is also very excited, the Central Mountain Range is tempting her young heart. Dragons, adventures, wealth, elves, heroes, these are enough to make any girl crazy. Everything is ready, tomorrow, Martha and my friends will be out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was deep, they came out of the pub. Everyone had some wine, and even Martha drank a few glasses of spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through a dark alley, Martha suddenly felt a little uneasy. Dozens of black masked people stood on the roofs and walls on both sides, and more than a dozen smashing arrows were aimed at them. Before they have responded, the arrow will fly like a rain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screaming and killing came from all sides, not knowing how many people surrounded them. But Martha can see that these people are also adventurers. She is confused and scared, but still calm. She raised her wand and rescued her partners with the most skilled fireball. However, the mantra had just mourned two syllables and was interrupted by a short sword that was behind her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before falling down, the last scene in the eyes of Martha was a hand, this hand holding a hunter certificate, the certificate still lingers Blood, that is the blood of her brother...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rouge in a nightgown is sitting on his comfortable lounge chair, while drinking red wine Over the huge floor-to-ceiling windows, staring at Dresden in the night. This ancient city is now not calm every night, and there will always be shouting, fire or magical flames to break through the tranquility of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another fire in the distance. I don’t know how many adventurers will fall in this battle. Rogge triumphantly figured out that he seemed to see a scene of hunter certificates that the adventurers were killing each other. According to the figures reported by the Legal Department, the number of adventurers has decreased almost every day since the hunter certificate. The adventure team with the certificate is doing its best to rush to the blockade line, so as not to be intercepted by other adventurers. More adventure teams moved the battlefield for the Hunter's certificate from Dresden to the front of the blockade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark side of the month only the certificate does not recognize people, even if they kill in front of them, they only see nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One kilometer outside the blockade line is the default boundary of the dark side of the moon. Entering this line means that it is protected by the dark side of the moon. Successfully crossed the blockade line. Countless wrestling and killings are taking place outside this line. Even the snow bear knight’s face was a little unbearable, and the dark faces of the moon were calmly facing it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the night scene, and he couldn’t help calculating it. "When the hunter certificate is obtained, the people have passed the blockade line. It is also the second batch of certificates. The second batch is only ten, so you can't let the adventurers who stay in Dresden idle and have nothing to do! The price can also be mentioned, five hundred gold coins should not be a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drank the glass of wine and figured out how to make more The adventurer came in: "Maybe the second batch of certificates should be secret. It is impossible for the adventurers to know which team got the hunter certificate so that they can suspicion each other and kill each other. As long as they kill, they hate. It will let the blood continue to flow. It is time to add two hundred months of dark-faced killers to the blockade line. It is necessary to dispel all the fantasy bait that they have broken through the blockade line and put more points on them. They have to give them some sweetness. A wounded dragon who moved a house is still not enough enough to dare to provoke a dragon. A dead tomb that is full of wealth? This idea is good, I don’t know if I will refuse to lend me any more. The open-air sands mine is also good, and there are adventurers’ relics. Aha, lure There are already enough! It should be able to divert their gaze from the elf. The adventurer wants to get wealth and can't get rid of the dark side of the moon, only the road to rob the hunter certificate. Kill it, grab it! The more people die, the better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
