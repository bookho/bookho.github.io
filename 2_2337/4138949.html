But the traces left by that war are everywhere. On the valley outside the fairy castle, there are broken swords, the embers of the trees, and the blood that penetrates deeply into the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc camp is quiet. The orc warriors who are still able to move have been removed, but they are exhausted and unable to take care of the bodies of the dead. Therefore, in the temporary camp, nearly seven thousand orc warriors are lying in the horizontal The body. On the side of the big camp, there are also corpses of tens of thousands of orcs, the bodies of orc warriors who were taken back from the battlefield after World War I yesterday. For the mysterious character who led the orc, any body is useful. So the orcs simply took back the bodies of thousands of Elf warriors on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs are now on their way home, but this is not a good way to go. The route they left was clearly marked, of course, the body of the dead orc. On the edge of the creek, on the mountains, next to the woods, the bodies of orcs that fell to the ground were everywhere. Occasionally, there will be an orc dressed in corpses, and they often hold a totem flag in their arms. The appearance of this scene often means that all the grown-up orcs in this orc tribe have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An orc body, like a green road sign, pointing all the way to the direction of the orc empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, there are tens of thousands of elves at the moment who are constantly busy. They have to take back the bodies of their comrades and bury them under the tree. The tall earth can grow its trees quickly. The roots must be extremely wide. The elves in the Green Sea believe that after the elves are buried under this tree, they can return to the embrace of the earth and the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs’ bodies were piled up together, and they were all burned, but the body was indispensable for Rogge, the necromancer. It was temporarily piled up there first. At this time, the northern country is still cold, and the body will not rot for a while. The fat man has asked all the wizard wizards to go all out to study the bodies of these orcs. See how they differ from the beasts of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this battle, the natural disasters cast by the orcs eventually became their own disaster. They have paid more than 40,000 soldiers. Only in exchange for the casualties of less than three thousand elves. After the disaster, the elves need to do it in the underground fortress, waiting for the orcs to evacuate. At that time, many of the elders of the elves had already fought exhausted, and they did not fight under natural disasters. The curses of Rogge and Adrienne would be greatly reduced, and the combat power of the orc warriors would be fully utilized. The battle will turn into a hard battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this battle, the elves who escaped from the Green Sea finally began to obey the orders of Rogge. Perhaps it is because of the lack of water and soil. The elders of the Green Sea elves who were held by Rogge suddenly became seriously ill at the same time. It was only a day's work, and they seemed to be dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few stumbling blocks to go, and Yu Wei, who defeated the orcs in a battle, took over the power of Rogge, and initially put these elves into his own arm. Anyway, the fat man has read the book of Hilo, and the identity of this god has finally hoped for righteousness, so the fat man commands the elf. The bottom gas is also a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Mountain Range has temporarily subsided. This time, the orcs suffered heavy losses, and the elves were almost lost in the Green Sea battle, and they were unable to counterattack the Green Sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a setback, the pragmatic voice of the elf has increased significantly, or straightforward. It is the elves of the city of God who have mastered the leadership, and the status of Rogge's god has been confirmed in the Green Sea Elves. Although he was unwilling, Hughes was appointed as a great elder by Rogge and was responsible for making many specific decisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the elves elders who were detained, they died of illness every three days at the end of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the elf does not adapt to the underground life after all. When the orcs are evacuated, they walk out of the underground fortress and go to the site of the city of the gods to rebuild this beautiful elf. city. The flesh and blood of tens of thousands of orcs in the city of the gods is the fertilizer of plants. Only the clear lake is polluted by many orcs and war behemoths. It is a bit of a hassle to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves of the Green Sea are only able to bring out a handful of the most important things when they flee. This includes three seeds of the Elven ancient tree. In addition, the original three ancient elves of the city of the gods, although still not enough to support the life of the 50,000 elves, but can also support. Vitality is extremely strong. Amorro performed extremely well in this war. Nothing is swaying at all. It is like a tamed dog. How can there be a majesty of the upper Mozu? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary elves don't understand the secrets, but they all hear how the Amorro is tamed. Therefore, everyone sees Constantine's gaze, and there is more respect and fear. In his tone of speech, there is no longer the inherent arrogance of the elves in dealing with other races. And for Effie, who turned the leader of Constantine into a mess, naturally no one would despise it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves watched sharply. Although they couldn’t understand what Amaro was saying, they felt that it would only have emotional changes in front of a few people. It is fear in front of Constantine, close to Effie, confused in front of Hughes, and angry when confronted with fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reconstruction of the City of God is a slow and arduous process. The limited magic is maximally distributed to defense and war, and the exquisiteness and beauty are ranked at the end of the list. This time the decision did not cause much controversy in the elf. After all, no one elf hopes that the scene of the Green Sea will repeat itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a relaxed atmosphere just after the war, the weather of this day is a rare clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the high sky. Effie sat on a large stone, and the cold wind gently picked up her long blond hair. Her beautiful eyes picked up slightly and looked at the mountains in the distance. I don't know what I was thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen deer can't get around her, and sometimes come over and kiss her boots intimately. This alpine short-tailed deer is very common in the Central Mountains. They are not big, but they have amazing jumping ability and can jump freely on the rocks. In addition to the birds of the raptors flying in the sky, it is difficult for General Warcraft to capture them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie patted the head of a deer around him. It seemed to be very comfortable, snorted, and then walked lazily. I don't know why, today these short-tailed deer appear listless, completely without the embarrassment and spirit of mountain creatures. A short-tailed deer squatted on the rocks in the distance, seemingly hesitating to jump. It did not decide, but fell to the ground. After a few twitches, I will not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the short-tailed deer screamed, they had no other way, and they could only continue to wander aimlessly in the mountains. After a while, another deer fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie looked at this group of deer, just sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie suddenly sounded a thick voice behind him: "Is they carrying the seeds of the plague to the orcs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin stood by Effie and looked at the deer and sighed. Road: "Now the plague has spread, their mission has been completed. But their final outcome is destined to be the same as the orcs. I can't help them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Effie turned his head and looked at Constantine. At this moment, the cardinal's hair is messy, the eyes are black, the eyes are covered with bloodshot eyes, and the tired color that can't be covered. These days. Constantine first treated the injured elves in the Green Sea. Then he gave thousands of elf warriors a blessing to suppress the natural disasters. After the war, he was saved to the wounded, and the elves who had misfortunes cursed in the curse of the Scourge were almost never combined. Eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in this war, Constantine did not directly attack the enemy, but he also made great contributions. If he did not exist, at least There are nearly a thousand elves who have died and died. Only the bright Master of Constantine, who possesses a very high degree of sacredness, can accomplish this almost impossible task. When casting a blessing blessing in the range of magnification. Even the first-class Master of Light can only be placed two or three times. It affects only a hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been busy saving people, how can there be extra mana to help them? They become like this. I don't want it! But this is No way." Ai Feier said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin was silent for a while, and reached into front of Effie, slowly said: "Effie, this thing, is it yours? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palm of the cardinal, there was a pointed, small, transparent bug that twisted and twisted and screamed. Constantly sniffing the flesh and blood, looking for victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie nodded and said: "You all know. Yes, they are what I put."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal finally sighed and said: "Effie, I really don't understand why your means are so hot, and your soul can be so pure? The teachings did not give me the answer to this question." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My way is hot?" Effie looked at Constantine a little strangely, but immediately said: "Oh, I understand, you comment like this Me, because there are too many orcs who died because of me! You have the larvae of the royal bees in your hand. Of course, they are not the original bee worms. I changed them slightly with the holy spells you taught me. They are all placed in the city of the gods. Also, the seeds of the plague are also placed on these short-tailed deer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know how many lives will disappear as you do? Have you clearly calculated it?" Constantine stared at Effie and asked word by word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many orcs will die in my hands?" Effie thought about it, putting a pair of hands in front of her eyes. Slowly count: "100,000...110,000, um, up to 13,400,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is in your opinion Is it just a number?" Constantine's voice is already a bit harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie looked at him, didn’t care that he had no swearing anger, just said: "Of course not. But killing the orcs. Not that we are The purpose of a war? Let's say that the orcs have killed 150,000 elves in the Green Sea. You see, the script you gave me also said. In order to spread to the glory of the High God, the pagans who kill the devastated believers are faithful. So, as an elf, what do I have to miss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie looked at Constantine and said: "If it is for you, you must What do you choose between the death of one hundred pagans and the death of a devout believer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her clear eyes, red The bishop suddenly felt pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. How will he choose? Does he have a choice? His only choice, which has been clearly recorded in the scriptures, is the one he gave to Effie. Constantine always felt that something wrong with Effie's words, or something that made him uncomfortable, but he couldn't say it. All her logic is so simple and correct. Her correctness has been proved by the teachings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Effie. Even if we have to destroy our lives for our faith, we have to...have a respect for life." Constantine carefully Considering the vocabulary, he first felt that the language was so poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you, but I have to kill you." Effie sang this sentence in an awkward way, then said: "Yes Is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that her voice is very clear and sweet. If you sing a poem in a church full-time, you will inevitably leave a mark in the teachings that record the history of the church. However, her discourse content is more lethal than sound, and the cardinal who thought that her eyes had penetrated the world's pseudo-images could not be refuted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pseudo! This is what your Terran likes best." Effie couldn’t wait for Constantine’s answer, so he gave him a direct The unwelcome conclusion, got up and jumped from the rock, and said: "The people are moving, and I have to go back and help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal Call Lived her, said: "Wait a minute! These are the larvae of the royal bee and the seeds of the plague. Where did you get it from? Where else did you use the divine method to transform it? How can I not remember to teach it? Have you ever been a spell like this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie said: “Every tribe of our elves has different beasts for different purposes. The royal bee is also one of them. As for Plague. All kinds of plague seeds that have happened in the Central Mountain Range in the past millennium. We have saved a little. This was originally intended to resist the plague. As for the sacred spells that improve them, you are teaching me the prophecy. It's really useful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prophecy?! This is not Can! "Constantine in any case would not think of even this! And he can't figure it out. Why prophetic techniques produce such an effect. Although this sacred method has always been known for its inability to measure results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is impossible. You are not always wondering why my soul will be so pure? That is because I have a clear purpose, the simplest and firmest Perseverance, or in your words, I have faith. For this purpose, no matter what I do, I think that what I am doing is right. So my soul is pure and pure."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
