			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the distant smog in the distance, and the smiling smile on his face was completely closed, and his eyes were completely turned into silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you see?" Androni, though wide-eyed, could only see the fog. Although the induction of power tells her that there are many powerful existences in the fog that wander around, her eyes can't see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is worthy of the graveyard of the North Dragons. There are so many cemeteries guarded!" Rogge's tone is very dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s face is also dignified, and she knows how powerful the guardian dragon’s cemetery is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dying, many ethnic dragons will try their best to go to the cemetery that their family formed thousands of years ago, and then quiet inside. Waiting quietly for the end of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent someone from disturbing the tranquility of the dead dragon, in the thousands of years formed by the dragon cemetery, there is always a powerful dragon to choose after death. Turn into the undead, and permanently guard the dragon's resting place. Because only the dragon with strong enough power has the opportunity to become the guardian of the cemetery, although the dragons who exist in the form of soul can only inherit the power and wisdom of the former part, the strength is still not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer the dragon’s cemetery, the more the number of guardian dragon souls will be. In some dragon cemeteries with a long history, there will even be a dragon lich! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of such a vast cemetery of dragons, in the pale mist, how many cemetery guards hide inside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger turned his head and said, "Annie, you have to keep up with me, you must converge on all the breath, you can't vent a little angry. These tombs The guardianship of the field is very sensitive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge then put an adjusted curse of weakness on Androni. The curse's effectiveness has been greatly weakened, but the magic used has multiplied. The only special effect that so many extra magic brings to this necromantic magic is that the cursed person will emit a very strong death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Rogge himself, the cemetery without the form and existence of the soul state is invisible under the scan of his spiritual power. As a Necromancer, Rogge simply wraps himself up with a sense of death. In the eyes of these cemeteries, as long as he does not move, Rogge is a pile of skeletons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger sneaked into the pale mist with Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the tens of square kilometers of the square hills, the east has a west, with many bones of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge observes the movements of the cemetery that has no purpose and wanders around, leading Androni to carefully move along the edge of the Dragon’s Graveyard. With. His gaze was searched for the bones of every dragon, but they ended in disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when from there, there was no guardianship around the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart suddenly burst into shock, he couldn’t think about it, he pulled over Androni and held her firmly in his arms, then he was so rich Like the real death madness rushing out of him, the two men wrapped tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A near-transparent dragon emerges silently from two people. It seems to have a high level of intelligence, alertly searching for the ground, and even passing through a giant dragon's cheekbones. Anyway, it is a form of soul, no form, and can completely cross the keel without hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that after all, Androni is, if it is close to the cemetery, even if it is a Necromancer can not be undetected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took Androni carefully and moved a little bit on the ground, then slowly hid in a hollow ground under the keel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cemetery guardian repeatedly searched for a long time, and found nothing, and this heart flew unwillingly to the depths of the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge got to Androni’s ear and pressed his voice very low. “It seems that you can’t enter the center of the cemetery. You are from Here slowly retreat outside the cemetery, then stay still, wait for me to come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at Rogge's figure under the cover of the dragon's cheekbones and gradually disappeared into the thick fog, and could not help but worry. She suddenly thought that the reason why Rogge sneaked into the cemetery of the dragon had not been asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time seems to have passed very slowly, and Androni waited more and more, not knowing why Rogge was not coming out of the dragon's grave. But if she wants to find someone in the graveyard of the dragon, she still has no such ability. Androni's swordsmanship has little effect on this stalker of the dragon's cemetery in the form of a soul, only passively beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Androni suddenly remembered something and his face turned white immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the natural goddess on Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she already felt that there was a little bit of natural energy in the dragon's graveyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is in a vibrant forest lake, such a faint natural energy cannot be noticed. But in this tomb of the dragon that is full of death, this natural energy is like a lighthouse in the night, and it is emitting a dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire dragon cemetery is boiling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big group of the celestial clouds can not help but swell, there are a lot of whistling sounds that people can’t hear, and I don’t know how many cemeteries guard the cemetery. It is gathering to the center of the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly remembered the windy month, remembering the pair of expressionless silver plaques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, why should I promise you? Forget it, I have already promised... I don’t want to see me more than a few times?" She Secretly sighed, and took out the blue sky, a little blue starlight lit up from her sword tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the vast white cloud and licked her lower lip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starry sky has already mentioned the peak, and Androni rushed to the dragon's graveyard with a blue brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the cemetery of the dragon suddenly screamed a dull sorrow, and then a strong death atmosphere rose to the sky, with the surrounding white clouds also hovering From now on, a death tornado is formed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni rushed into the Dragon's graveyard. It seems that all the guardians of the cemetery were attracted to the center of the cemetery, and no one came to say hello to the new intruders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the big dragon’s graveyard, she didn’t know how to look for Rog’s whereabouts. After all, if the fat man wants to hide her breath, she I am sure I can’t catch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the familiar figure rushed out from the center of the dragon's graveyard and flew back here. Behind him was followed by a large number of vaguely blurred white scenes, and it was not clear how many dragon cemeteries were chased out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni immediately turned around and flew with Rogge to the outside of the Dragon's graveyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two don’t know how far they have escaped. Most of the cemetery guards have to go back. Only one cemetery that looks particularly huge is still not ruthless. The ground is behind the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly stopped and stared back at the strange cemetery guard, sneer and said: "You still think that you are a powerful former student. Silver Dragon? Now that you have no companions, can't you clean up your undead? Hey! Just rely on the strength of your soul, and dare to chase me!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The cemetery guards angrily roaring a few times, a mouth, spewing a pale white mist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni can only stand by and watch this battle, there is almost no place where she intervenes. Although the starry temperament has some ability to attack the soul, but after all, the strengths are not in this respect. With the ability of this cemetery to guard, it is completely able to withstand her starry spirit. The cemetery guardian has no form and is completely immune to physical attacks, so Androni wants to help Rogge, and can't help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vicinity of the Dragon's cemetery, because of the death of the atmosphere is too strong, Androni's sacred vindictiveness can not be used. If not, she will not be so overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, Rogge has been close enough to the cemetery guardian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stopped, took a deep breath, and then a mouth, a very sharp whistling sound, with a faint visor Silver ripples, directly to the cemetery guardian! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sharp whistle, the cemetery guardian is like a shadow reflected on the lake, the body of the soul form does not follow the silver ripples, it looks like it Struggling very painfully, but completely unable to resist the attack of howling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger snorted, his hands crossed, and after several gestures, one chain after another surrounded by a pale flame appeared out of thin air, criss-crossing, and turning the graveyard The guardian locked the lock in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The Undead Control’ is almost a must-have spell for every Great Necromancer. Depending on the wizard's magic, objects, and usage, this magic can have many ways. Rogge is now using it to restrain the ability of the cemetery to guard. For some inferior undead, this magic can be used to enslave the undead and make it obey the command of the caster. For those who are more inferior, the effect of magical slavery is the permanent surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the cemetery has been successfully bound, Rogge began to try to suppress its resistance, but perhaps because the predecessor was a silver dragon, this one The cemetery guardian dismissed all kinds of threats to Rogge, but only desperately attacked the magic chain formed by the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger frowned and his face became severe. He also recited a spell that led to the fire from the Devil and began to burn the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Devil Flame has the ability to attack the soul. Under its burning, the cemetery guardian felt the unbearable pain, it roared, it struggled, it even cried! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger and Androni know how to know a few words, and Rogge, a necromancer, can understand the thoughts of undead creatures from the soul level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian of this cemetery, indeed because of the inability to endure the pain that has never been experienced, but crying in shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it just doesn't yield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! The soul guarded by the cemetery could not withstand the double oppression of the magical flame and the magic chain, and finally burst into the unconsciously dead energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked angry, he thought he could pluck a good servant, but did not expect the living silver dragon to deal with it, they still do so after death. stubborn. So that the fat man was angry, the intensity of summoning the flames of the devil was a little bigger, so he burned it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is angry and somewhat sorry. At this point, he had to start to absorb the scattered and pure death energy that the cemetery guarded out. These energies, which have just been separated from the soul, are extremely pure, and the ability of Rogge to control the soul can be absorbed directly to supplement its own power. However, this energy is comparable to a dragon with considerable intelligence and attack power, which is no different from the difference between sand and pearl. The more Rogge wants to regret the wrath of the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered that the sacred mention of anger, but also a sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, the main purpose of his trip to the cemetery of the dragon has been reached. Although not complete, the results are acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took out a large piece of dark black moss from his arms and handed it to Androni. Far away, Androni smelled the unbearable stench that was emanating from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "Don’t be this expression, this is keel grass!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Androni was shocked, and couldn’t take care of the stench and dirty. He grabbed the keel from Rogge and asked, "Is this... the keel that can prolong life? So, Fu Roya she..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! With keel grass, she won’t have anything for at least a few years. You bring this to the city of the gods. Well, then Flora should already be there. With her knowledge of magic, potions and alchemy, she should know how to use keel grass. I have something else, let's separate it here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
