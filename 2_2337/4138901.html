			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with a low voice, you can still clearly feel the excitement and joy. The tall man strode forward and opened his arms, and wanted to hold the rose in his arms. However, his arms were half closed, and he suddenly froze, and his fingers did not dare to move another point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May is opposite to him, his left hand is wrapped around his ears, the long five fingers are slightly open, the light flashes between the fingers, and the chill is close to the man. The neck's key points penetrated into the skin, and the lover's warm response turned out to be a smile of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove your magical camouflage!" Rose's voice is as cold and ruthless as her jade hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled bitterly, you are still so suspicious. "But to say that, he still dissipated the added magic. After the magic effect dissipated, the man became more and more handsome.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei looked at him The face, after a moment, the corner of the mouth finally reveals a smile. You are not recalled by the respected endless ocean adults? How come suddenly came here? The army is about to attack the city, the security is very strict, and at this moment There are also a few very powerful people. I came out once but took a lot of risk." The cold light between her fingers didn't know when it disappeared, and the soft lie fell gently on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo gaze at the rose, and gradually the flames begin to burn in the gaze, and the little flames of the stars have turned into volcanoes that will spray! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his arms and tightened his hair into his arms, eagerly looking for her warm lips, and firmly grasping the fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is close to him, completely drowning in the wild enthusiasm of Relo. The rising body temperature, the thin air makes her body soft, only to hold the tight and strong neck tightly, so as not to fall. The thousand-year-old frost in the scorpion melted like a snowman to the fire, leaving only a tender and fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo’s breathing quickly became heavy, and the pain of missing was like the most powerful aphrodisiac burning with reason. His palms are flat on her chest, covering the beautiful curves. The magical tights made of thin black silk are like nothing. Every shudder of the rose, every move is clearly conveyed directly to him along the palm. The heart forced him to be even more crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo’s palms flashed with green magical light, and the magical effects attached to the black silk were instantly removed. The black clothes, like the petals of a blooming black tulip, slipped from the shoulders of the rose, and the white and strong abundance jumped away from the bondage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo sighed heavily, greedily stunned the stamens in front of the eyes, as if the wild horses were sore and painful. Every time the friction brings a hotter heat, and the ** of the rose engulfs all his intellects. Relo’s hand slides down and explores the last Taoyuan more boldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predator just arrived at the outer edge of the unguarded virgin land, and the rose trembled and arched, the sharp pleasure was like lightning, and also hit In the midst of her mind. Mei Qingyan’s eyes suddenly passed a panic, and she screamed with eagerness: “What does Relo want to do? It will destroy my mark! Never...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice was just halfway out, and Relo whispered in her ear: "Let the mark go to hell!" Then she sealed her mouth with a hot kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a glimmer of cold in the eyes of Mei, and the blush and fire on his face were instantly replaced by frost. Her left leg was tightly placed at the waist of Relo, and the slamming sound of the heel was slamming, and two short blades flashing cold came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May calf knocked back, two short blades immediately fell into Relo's thigh! She took another look, and with these slight strengths, she rose up and swayed in the air with two heads and fell a few meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo screamed, there were two more fleshy wounds on the thigh, and the hot body cooled sharply. He slammed his head and asked for pain: How did you suddenly start, hell, what is this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May did not pay attention to Relo, but just sorted out the clothes, she was wearing a pair of hands, the black tights that rolled up spread and stretched, and she was close to Finished the whole land cover. The plum foot and the light meal, the two short blades slammed softly, and counted all the blood beads that were hooked on the barbs, and then shrunk back. In a piece of black.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Relo just wanted to go forward, he saw Mei’s long legs flashing through the air, and there was a sharp pain in his intact left leg! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo looked at the two bloody mouths that suddenly appeared on the thighs, his knees soft and almost fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo is standing still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bang, and the two short blades were taken back from the right heel. She screamed: "Relo! Do you know that your actions have been the same as betraying the endless ocean, and you are betraying the goddess of nature! I have not killed you on the spot, it is very tolerant!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo smiled a bit, he stared at Mei, whispered: the goddess! They have so many candidates, why must I choose you! Ten years, a full ten years! In the past ten years, have we been together for a few days? If faith is the result, then I would rather not believe this! I just wanted to get you, just want to destroy the damn blue paint in your body. Let me go! We can hide in the farthest place and hide in the places where the 'boiling sea' does not go to the warriors! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bright, faint sigh: "They chose me?" So, I will have a task soon. What is the mission? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo is looking at Mei’s expression, and the painful look in your eyes... Do you think of the task?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazingly watching Relo, slowly said: "The task of completing the goddess is the most noble dedication."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Relo was silent for a while, smiled bitterly: there is no task for the time being. But you are worried about you when you follow him! That fat man is a complete demon! And if there is a task, no matter what the content, ten will fall on your head, because only you can get close to the demon. But even if you can complete the task, can you escape? Remember? Ten years ago, we made a vow at the seaside. At that time, you said that the most hopeful thing in this life is to find a beautiful lakeside. Let’s stay together quietly for a lifetime. I don’t want you to die! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silence in the forest, only a slight and rhythmic ticking, when the blood on Relo’s leg was dripping.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the rose turned, no longer watching the rickety Relo, just faintly said: "If you say so, it means that my mission will come soon. For me, faith is paramount. For the sake of our love for ten years, I have not heard or seen everything you just said and done. Let's go, if there is no order from the endless ocean, if you dare to approach the Emperor's camp, I will kill you personally. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and said coldly: "I just don't kill you, close to the Empire camp, you only have one dead end." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo's face is pale, I don't know if it is because of excessive blood loss or other reasons. Finally, he has an action.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo cast natural healing on his wounds, which does not allow the wound to heal completely, but does not bleed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mei, I have also seen beliefs above everything else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo slowly turned and walked deep into the woods.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now is my whole world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo's figure slowly sneaked into the shadow of the trees...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love you..." A gentle word. But I don't know why, I always reverberate in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose stood in the same place as a lifeless statue, without looking back, and without opening, just a little sparkling water, falling from her cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woods have been in silence, and Mei just wants to take a step, and I hear a hoarse voice behind him: well, you have proved yourself Faith, it seems that the decision of the Presbyterian Church to hand over this task to you is a very wise decision. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermaine is a great man, you have come to need your guidance, should you go to kill Relo?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salinas sighed slightly: I was growing up with Reyro, and you are very clear about your business. Relo... Let him go, the goddess of nature is above all else, but it is not inhuman. This is your mission, let's take a look! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed a dark green scroll to Rose. Rose unrolled the scroll and read it quickly. Every time she swept a line of words, the scroll of that part It will turn into a light smoke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand why I want to do this? "Rose frowns.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Presbyterian order must have a reason, you are not to be suspicious, but obey. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nodded. After she gave a salute to Salinas, she re-entered the darkness and left the woods.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreamy floating city stays above the clouds at this time, its position is so high, where the passing wind is colder than the ground ice and the breath will become Very difficult. Except for the Sanctuary, even Mora could not stay outside for a long time. The Madman Master was left in the Empire Camp. At such a height, the time when the inferior magician can persist is The magic shield can last for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look up from the ground, the city of floating is the brightest star in the night sky.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glory of the glory of the ubiquitous city, there is also a darkness, this is absolute darkness, there is no trace of light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; That is the temple of the goddess.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the two doors slowly open, this is the absolute darkness Bring a ray of light. The magical radiance outside the door is not strong, but compared with the darkness in the hall, it is already a blind and glare. In the glare, there is an unusually tall figure standing at the door, that The Emperor of the Black Warrior.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respected ***, Elgra has collected 110,000 suitable souls, and the Dark Dragon Faction can already be activated. But it is about to attack Tiffany, Rogge and we all think that we should wait for the siege to start the Dark Dragon Faction. At that time we will have more souls and the chances of success will be even greater. And Elgra can also retain enough magic for the siege. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. *** faintly replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body is completely hidden in the darkness, but the silver eyes occasionally have a halo of light. If the past ** * It is indifferent to pay attention to everything in the world. At this moment, she reveals the unsettled loneliness, with a bit of pain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Wei Na sleeps The scorpion is no longer scattered, and it is completely integrated with the darkness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior emperor seems to sigh, he quits the hall, light Lightly close the two doors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The temple is once again in darkness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is there already 110,000 souls?" Rogge stood on the high platform and asked Elgara around him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. "Aergra's voice is still empty and hoarse, and there is a strong sense of death all the time. Perhaps because of the too many souls collected, the feeling of keen Rogge seems to hear the screaming cry from the witch. The demon's black robe rushed out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorce replied while watching the busy mad sage mage arranging the magic array at the top of the high platform. He needs to correct the mage from time to time. Our mistakes. Even the fanatical madman, when the lich approaches, will obviously feel fear and cringe, even though Elgar has already converged as much as possible in the fear enchantment range of the week.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This high platform is hundreds of meters wide, nearly 30 meters high, almost the same height as Tiffany City. And the distance from the Tiffany gate is only a few hundred meters away. This distance is just out. The range of the longbow of Delaware, and the elf shooters can smoothly pour the arrow into the head of Tiffany.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic of Elgar Next, the high platform grew for three days and three nights before reaching the current scale. Too heavy a big city, even with Lich magic, can not so before, will change the terrain display their magic directly to the city, shake the foundation walls <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;The number of wizards and the level of magic in the city of Tiffany are not comparable to the army of Rogge. The madman, the wizard, the sorcerer, and the squadron of the squad have more than seventy men, and they have an overwhelming advantage in number. However, the Tiffany Masters have a good location, and many wings-like platforms are the perfect place for their spells. After they cast the spell, they can quickly return to a safe place along the platform. It is a pity that they did not have the magic to destroy such a large platform. They could only try to kill the people on the high platform and delay the construction progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mad believers didn’t stop the magic attack in time, then the prepared heavy infantry would block the special giant shield and the magic armor. The magic of the other side protects the elf craftsman behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time this mobile fortress was built, hundreds of heavy infantry had already paid for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich Elgra sometimes occasionally counters Tiffany's mage during the break. In the hands of the Lich, the eighth-order magical death finger is quick and easy to play, and it is almost like a big magician putting a flame arrow. Before the Master Tiffany began to cast a spell to return to safety, the Lich was able to cast two death fingers. The demon sorcerer has lost the finger of Algra, and has never survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the Master in Tiffany City was not too arrogant. After all, no one knows the next goal of the Lich from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at Tiffany's brilliant magic light, the more frowned the brow. He suddenly said to Elgra: "Get 10,000 souls out! I think we need to make some dark green corpses, just in case. Anyway, after we have taken Tiffany, we can get enough souls." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aergra smiled incomprehensibly and thought that you will be eager to resurrect as soon as you know the number of souls is enough. I did not expect your patience to be so good! Haha! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s eyes flashed, but the tone remained calm: "Ilgra, I know the Dark Dragon Faction." Now there is a dark black dragon, and 100,000 souls can only say that it is just enough. I am not patient, just don't want to take risks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elgra said: "Tiffany city defense is strong, but there is not only one guy named Wenna in the city?" Although he has made a lot of things, he can't replace the magician. In this world, the magic power of many great magisters is not strong, at least this Wenna is not worth worrying about. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elgra, I admit that you are strong. But the complexity of this world is far beyond the world of death! Is there not only one Wenna in the city? There is no harm in preparing for more. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aergra sings: "Everything about war is up to you." Since you insist on making dark green corpses, I certainly have no opinion. The night is over, we don't have much time, we have to hurry. I am waiting for you below, you go to the body, anyway, you need to know what kind of body you are. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sorcerer floated down the high platform. All the people next to him turned their heads subconsciously. They dared not look at the black robes. The bleak green light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger sent an emergency call to Wallace and Bauhinia, and told me: "Give me five hundred strongest soldiers." ! I have no other requirements, as long as their bodies are strong enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stepped down the high platform, and he suddenly reached out and grabbed it in the void, and smashed the statue. Rogge stared at Hughes, 哼With a cry, he let go of his hand. Of course he knew that if the old fox didn't want him to be present, he would definitely not find the traces of Hughes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hughes, I need to go to the city of floating, talk to the goddess O'Reilly in the siege war tomorrow. I always feel that there will be some changes in the war tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes is a secret smile to talk to the goddess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously silent For a moment, I was faintly said: "Tomorrow, no matter what, I will definitely take Tiffany! Before the battle, I want to... look at it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hughes nodded the big Austrian Reich said, must not let you go up! He deliberately aggravated this <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Must not let me go up?" Rogge was taken aback.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge looked up at the night sky, thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany under the night sky is like a jewel, she not only has a gorgeous appearance, but also beautiful inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tallest building in the city is not a royal garden, but a tower with a wavy arc and a huge disc at the end of the tower. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disc is actually a maze-like alchemy lab, with dozens of magical arrays scattered throughout the lab, with different functions. Dozens of gnomes and various odd-shaped metals or baboons made of other non-living materials are running back and forth to serve their owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bald, slightly fat, ugly old man is busy in front of a surprisingly large experimental bench. He picked up a gear and carefully distinguished the magical array etched on it. He took a sigh of relief for a long time and praised: "The craft level of these gnomes is no worse than the alpine dwarf or the elf!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenner! Do you still have time to study these things?" There is another old man standing in the lab. His voice is very strange. It seems to be composed of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner is still admiring the gear and don't look down on this little thing! With it, my cute and sophisticated killing machine can increase by 5 percent, and the power can increase by 3%. This is a great achievement! If they can attack the city one day later, I can put this stuff on my little babies. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wynner, although you have opposed it eleven times, but I still have to prepare an escape portal for you!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I have to oppose the twelfth! Even if you build the portal, I won't leave. It took me twenty years to build Tiffany, she is my daughter! A father will not leave his daughter to escape alone. Besides, my Tiffany can be different from your Cloud City. I have long advised you not to build the city of the Clouds, you just don't listen. what's the result? In the end, let people dig up? Haha! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man behind Wen Nai was the great Druid of the North that escaped from the city of Yunzhi that day - the wrath of the sky.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky is not angry with Winner’s gloating, he knows Wenner’s personality too much. But although he knows Wenna’s stubbornness, he still advises: “Wenner From the battle report, they have at least one big magister and two sanctuaries. Although I don't know who the great magister is, but you see, he can display 'terrain change' for three consecutive days. At that time, you only know the guy who is playing with metal fragments all day long? And since Rogge is here, the mysterious woman who has been secretly protecting him will definitely come. Her force is far beyond the sanctuary a. Even if you and I join forces, you can't stop so many strong things. Don't think that your Tiffany is omnipotent. The 20,000 people in the city are really worthy. There are still less than 10,000 elite warriors. As for the civilians who have not received any training, they don’t have to expect them to play a big role. Don't be stubborn again, we can give them a heavy blow, as long as killing a sanctuary is a success. Then you will go with me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The click was soft, and Wenna carefully installed the gear in a fist-sized strange metal. The stubborn old man shook his head." It’s the thirteenth rejection! I said, even God does not want to drag me away from Tiffany! Cancel the portal built for me, after my control magic array, those magics are enough for you to release Two lightning storms. Can help me kill hundreds of enemies, but you are worthy of the 40 years we have known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky With one cry, I finally gave up the effort to persuade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy Wenna’s light-colored baldness has begun to shine, and he glanced at the delicate golden magic hourglass floating in the air, his face. Showing the joy, he called: "Aha! It is already noon. I haven’t heard the siege warning now. It seems that the Astrofiks will not attack the city today! There is time for me this day. I can completely refit all my little ones! Just one day is enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it already at noon?" The sky sighed with a sigh I know that even if Wenner took a day, trying to hold Tiffany is almost impossible to accomplish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky looked out of the window, his face suddenly changed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
