			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting sun shines on the hills, forests and farmhouses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offik is standing on a hill overlooking Ron City in the distance. In the forest behind him, five thousand and one hundred knights are resting inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than ten days of the 20,000-year chase of the Ron Principality, he has become familiar with the terrain within the radius of Ron City. He has repelled more than ten times of chasing troops and killed more than 3,000. Counting, there are more than a hundred lives in my own hands in this war. At the cost, these lion-hearted knights and the golden lion knights who have followed their own, have also fallen for more than three hundred rides forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officrock sighs, if not Ron’s greed is afraid of death, leaving the most elite 10,000 non-day knights in the king’s guard, maybe now It was on the way to the embarrassed escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war has so far, under the anti-drug tactics of Marshal Rougerio, the Ron Principality has been in addition to a small number of defensive cities, other small towns and villages have been The war was turned into ruins. The army of the Confederate seized the rations of the people and drove a large number of refugees into the big city of Ron that was not taken down to exhaust the memory of the city. Numerous spies also took the opportunity to mix in, set fire to poison, assassination, no It is not necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to all this is in yourself. The most elite 50,000 troops of the Principality of Ron were shackled around the kingdom and yelled with themselves. Orphee shook his head, why should he use this tactic? If this war is won, it will only be a run-down country. Let a million people be displaced, can they really feel good in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was annoyed with a sudden pain in his fingers, and an obsidian ring worn for years was broken into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of white mist smashed out and slowly condensed into a transparent ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod’s face slowly became pale, and unconsciously, a stream of blood had flowed from his mouth, but he was unaware . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A holy knight in the ball of light is heading for the hill. He occasionally turned back, and Orfey Rok felt only a pain in his heart. It turned out to be Kara Yang! The Templars that suddenly appeared after the miracle, one of the three giants of the Last Judiciary! Why did the Doomsday Judgment appear here? They should be thousands of miles away! Why is the ring of Elysses on him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod is hardly thinking about it anymore. This ring is for her to inform herself in a critical situation and inform herself to save her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Karajan in the ball of light walking into a magical array, the ball became dark inside. After a while, the ball of light finally disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc was planted from the beginning and spit out a blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses should be foolproof in the Grand Duke! The church is not going to search the Grand Duke anyway! Even if there is any, she also has the means of emergency escape - the magic general Artest! And I know the horror of Artest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod was barely sitting up, he only felt cold in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult! What's wrong with you!" A round table knight now had the unusual shape of Orphey and ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm fine, go on." Orphee took the tree and slowly stood up, slowly suppressing the chaos of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight of the Round Table did not retreat, his body flashed, helping Orphey Rouge calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc forced himself to calm down, think about it for a while, and finally looked up. His eyes crossed the city of Ron, crossed several military fortifications, crossed tens of thousands of Ron's army, and looked at Lille city thousands of miles away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron City suddenly opened the gates, the knights of a team rushed out, formed a square outside the city, and began to set up camps at important intersections. The prosperity of the military capacity and the high efficiency, it is known that it is the most elite non-tian Knights of the Principality of Ron! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the man behind these plots... he didn't dare to think about it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the command of the adult?" The round table knight replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Among the Knights of the Round Table, your military strategy is the brightest. From now on, the Lionheart Knights and the Golden Lion Knights will be led by you. Bring back to the Principality!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The grown-up you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officrock sighs A must now go back to Lille City as soon as possible. Now my heart is in chaos and it is no longer suitable for taking troops. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie silenced the person, Ron Principal seems to be aware of something, and suddenly sent a non-day Knights to hold our way back to the east, you alone... Is Miss Elysses having an accident?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offik sighed and replied, turned to the horse, said to Charlie: “We are all sacred knights. I am now determined to leave everything behind, but you still have a future and a belief. You don't have to go on this path of no return like me! Don't worry, I am alone and flexible. The non-day Knights want to catch me. I don't think about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offik went down the mountain and, by the cover of the terrain, slanted toward the direction of the Bavarian Principality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the top ten Knights of the Innocent Knights, the Ten Thousand Knights were divided into several units, and the road to Orpheco’s return to the East was tightly sealed. To get around their control, you might have to spend a whole night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officoke sneered, turning away from the military camp, he decided to use the cover of the night to pass directly from the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls by little by little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cathedral of Lille, Kara Yang is kneeling on the ground, bearing the silent anger of Augustus. Both Dess and Chrisma stayed with him on the ground, hoping to leave him a little life from the anger of the blood angel Augustus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a soft bang. The cracked obsidian ring was thrown in front of Kara Yang, and Augustus’s voice was as cold as the smog in the millennium: "What else do you have to say! If you bring this ring back, how can it be? Let Orphey Roch know about it? If he finally betrayed the church, do you know how much the loss will be?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cara’s screaming Dess saw Augustus subconsciously sorting out the shorts on his lips and couldn't help but fight a chill. Whenever the head of the Holy Knights and the blood angel Augustus are subconsciously doing this movement, it is the time when he can't suppress the inner fire, and when he is going to massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in order to save Kara Yang’s life, Dess can no longer take care of that, and daringly said: “Adults, how do we say that they are direct angels? At least, the potential and strength will not be much worse than Orphee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far!" Augustus suddenly violently sipped. He immediately realized his own grievances, sat back in his chair and closed his eyes. For a long time, I slowly opened my eyes and slowly said: "In time, Orpheek will be the god of war in this space. As long as he is there, it is not impossible for the Church of Light to dominate the world within a hundred years. I thought, how many times I was planning, I was afraid that he would be shocked to go out of the church. But now, your waste has broken my big thing! With your three, if you can use the church to the equivalent of Orphey One of them is not bad! The mouse is in the light! Let me roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three giants of the Last Judiciary, such as Meng Huangen, screamed and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus walked into the back hall, standing in front of the altar with a thin, withered figure, so thin that it seems that the wind in this house is slightly larger, he It will fall the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus has lowered his voice, for fear of disturbing the old man, and carefully said: "Adult, Orpheq, he should already know what is happening here." Well, maybe he is already on the way. I have already instructed the Ron Principal to intercept it, but it will not be useful... If he rushed back to see it all, I am afraid I will never be able to change his mind again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said slowly: "The Lord said, the one who is coming will surely leave. Since it is here, let him come. God's Glory is full of this world, and it doesn't have to be done in your hands. There is no Orpheus, we have dozens of angels coming, 100,000 holy knights, hundreds of thousands of clergy, thousands of Believers. After I return to the Lord's embrace, there will be young people who will perform their duties for me. When you return to heaven, you will also be inspired by the believers to continue your unfulfilled wish. This is the great cause of glory in the last few hundred years. What are you afraid of? Why do you have to realize this ideal in your hands? ?. Augustus country do you want to remember, vanity, it is most likely to ignore the original sin ah "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Orphee Rock approached the camp of the non-day Knights. Suddenly, there was a riot in the military camp, and the rushing horn continued to blow. The knights who have entered the camp are rushing to the top and assembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offi Rock seems to be aware of it, looking back and seeing the knights on his own place, there are faint knights coming and going. Orpheco’s heart is sour, and the traces are exposed in this place, and there will be countless hard battles in the future. He secretly said: "Charlie, you bastard..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are constantly orders from the handsome account, the non-day Knights not only chase, but strengthen Vigilance everywhere. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officrock can no longer wait, he squats down, almost sliding on the ground, like the wind like electricity to the military camp side copied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights on the hills saw that the Knights of the Days were not moved. After a while, they even listed a neat queue, slowly descending to the side. Forced to come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn is long, the non-day Knights finally open the gate, two thousand heavy rides, three thousand light rides out camp, five miles before the camp Lined up, waiting for the Lionheart Knight and the Golden Lion Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron City also ran four thousand knights, slantingly enveloping the golden lion knights and the lion-hearted knights. Then 10,000 infantry also went out of the city and began to approach the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve round table knights are riding in the forefront of the queue, behind them is Kate's lion tooth camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five thousand and one hundred knights slowly settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound, no horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie looked around the 20,000 enemies of the encirclement, and said to the round table knights: "The easiest way is to be from the non-day Knights. Killing out! Since they dare to fight with the same number of troops, today we are going to ruin their nest! Only after this war, we don’t know if we can meet again."<br /><br />&nbsp Another roundtable knight faintly said: "I can't betray the church, and I can learn from the ignorance of Ron's ignorant for Orpheq. Even today, with the embrace of the Lord. , then how!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie nodded, no longer said anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three enemy forces slowly gathered up, standing in the distance between the Lionheart Knight and the Golden Lion Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie guns held high, a piece of steel forest appeared on the plains. With his guns pointing to the non-day Knights, five thousand iron rides like a steel torrent, turbulent, rolling to the non-day knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoof is like a thunder, but there is no sound of killing! Since everyone has the heart to die, why bother to shout? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only feels that there is no pain in the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to move his hands and feet, but there was a pain in his heart. He stopped moving, pretending to faint, but slowly glanced around with his spirit. Until it was determined that there were no people with considerable strength in the vicinity, they slowly opened their eyes and looked at the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dark and damp dungeon with an inch of deep sewage on the ground. A few large mice squatted in the cell. Rogge looked at his hands and feet and saw the small chains of the four chopsticks passing through his hands and feet, and the wounds had begun to white. A collar engraved with magic symbols is placed over your neck, and the inside of the collar is a small barb. Rogge felt that his magic would only flow out of the stab in the flesh as long as he gave birth. An iron chain is attached to the collar, and the other end of the chain is fixed to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on? August isn't there any point to value yourself? Why is it so different? I want to turn me into a waste!" Rogge was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog tried to sit up slowly, he tried not to exercise the muscles of his neck and shouted, "Come on! Anyone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to hit the wall of the cell with a chain, and every tapping hurt him cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, someone walked along the long corridor. A hoarse voice shouted: "What are you doing, are you tired of living? Do you have to be hungry for ten days to be happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big brother, it’s convenient I want to see Bishop Hart at the church. I will definitely repay you." Rogge tried to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where will the great people of the church meet you? Now they are busy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they busy with? What?” Rogge asked? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jailer is alert to think about what to put out from me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger thought about it, and now gave him a big benefit, just to buy some news. The jailer is still hesitating, Rogge gave him The location of a treasure, also said: "If I am telling lies, you spend an hour to go there to see, you will know immediately. Waiting for you to come back, do I still have a way to live? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jailer thought that it was also the case, and he revealed to Rogge a little bit of news. Although he knew very few, he still surprised Rogge. According to the jailer, there will be a very important ceremony in the church at noon tomorrow. Everyone is busy with chickens and dogs, even if they are roaring, even if they are Ge really knows Bishop Hart and even higher-level figures, and they certainly don't have time to pay attention to him. The jailer finally let Rogge feel at ease here, in the dungeon of Lille City prison, stay for a while, to him twenty Looking at the prisoner's experience of the year, it seems that it has been half a month before someone can think of it to deal with Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge The jailer was very grateful. The prison guard said: "Don't be too busy thanking me. If you really take care of the villain, don't blame me on the treasure. If you are small, you have to change your class, just to get your reward. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: "When you go, if you can't find it, come back to me!" I can't run, isn't it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When watching the figure of the jailer leaving, Rogge whispered back and looked for me, it was your limit! Enjoy your wealth in power." Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meditation for a while, inferring that most of the rituals at noon tomorrow are for Elysses. But it is not the time to worry about this. He quietly pondered the way to get out of trouble. At present, the great churches in the city gather and summoning *** is too risky, not to mention that it is estimated that it has already been listed on the church, and it is still safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priority is to restore some physical strength first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced around, and after the jailer left, the rats got out of the damp corners and screamed and ran down the ground. The blood in the sewage climbed over to Rogge, and he was timid and even began to bite his ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled, the silver flashed in his eyes, dozens of mice were marked with a thin blood arrow, and the blood arrow slowly condensed in front of Rogge Make a big blood ball into a bowl. The body of the mouse quickly shrank and eventually turned into a dry fur over the skeleton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge keeps his eyes closed, the blood ball does not tumbling and condenses, slowly turning into a blood drop. This drop of blood is crystal clear and finally condenses into a small crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge mouth, sucking this red crystal into it. After a long time, his pale face finally had a blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to condense his mental power on the finger of his right hand, satisfactorily looking at his right hand and slowly covered the purple-black scales, sticking out on his fingertips. Inch long and bright, sharp nails. He grabbed the chain through his left hand and pulled it hard. The chain finally had a point of deformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the cold sweat, Rogge smiled smugly, and it seems that the person who is holding himself really regards himself as a hand-free Ordinary magician. Ruan Lang, Lang Lang, Rogge tried more than ten times, and finally broke the chain of his left hand. He fell to the ground and gasped with a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took an hour to work, and Rogge finally pulled out the chains that tied the limbs. The collar was better to deal with, and Rogge made the effort to break the copper lock. He shook his body and finally stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rushing footsteps sounded in the corridor, and Rogge smiled slightly, and he slowly fell into the dirty water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the treasure of your father's ancestors? I won't let you take off a few layers of skin today, you really can't remember who Laozi is!" The roar echoed in the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yelled through the iron door, but did not open the door. He took a bucket of oil and stood outside the door. He took a spoonful and poured it over to Rogge. He still groaned: "I have fried your skin!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot oil turned a corner in the air, bypassing Rogge, all spilled on the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog suddenly opened his eyes and smiled at him. The jailer was terrified, and shouted at the end. The eyebrows marked a blood arrow and fell to the sky. It quickly became a dry corpse. After Rog swallowed the blood, he faintly said: "The taste is not good." He stood up and the key of the jailer flew into his hand. He immediately stripped off the jailer's clothes and thought about it. He put his clothes on the corpse. He pierced the skin of the body and injected the water from the ground. Looking at the body gradually full, he just laughed and turned to the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that the church is having a big deal, maybe it feels that the dungeon is too safe, and Rogge easily mixes the black prison all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a partial door, he twisted the rusty lock and sneaked out of the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a starry sky outside, and the moon is already slanting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred knights of the team patrolled the street, and the atmosphere was unexpectedly tense. Rogge is hidden in the darkness, approaching his goal a little bit. He is very familiar with the terrain around the central square and has already chosen the hidden place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge came to the back of a small building. He looked up and leaped up and slid through the window on the second floor. As soon as he landed, he covered the window behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who!" A voice rang in the room, and then a strong man in a pajamas held a candlestick and walked out to see. Rogge greeted him like a ghost. When he called out, he put his finger in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little blood crystal formed. Rogge sneered, thinking that this is going on, he is afraid to be considered a vampire, right? Although he is absorbing the vitality, the realm of the world is much better than the vampire family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty young woman in the room came out again. She saw the dry corpse on the ground and wanted to yell, but was smothered by Rogge! Rogge sensed that there was still a vitality in the room. He walked into a bedroom next to him and saw a little girl about ten years old sleeping on the bed. The young woman struggled desperately, and Rog smiled and brought up the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky gradually lit up, and Rogge looked out through the gap of the attic blinds, just to take the entire central square to the eye. The little girl was lying at his feet and tied up to be solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps on the stairs sounded and the smell of food came up. Rogge smiled with satisfaction, and the panicked young woman placed the full plate of food in front of Rogge and couldn't help but ask him to let go of his daughter. Rogge is faintly authentic, and today, I will spare you. Now you are sitting down here, no sound. After all, he observed the situation in the entire square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge central square has already erected a tall stone pillar, hundreds of sacred knights are busy, pressing a large rosewood to a certain figure Placed under the stone pillar. A bishop of the red robe commanded the knights, and the position of the rosewood was wrong. He had to correct it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this towering stone pillar, Rogge wriggled in his heart. This is the first time he saw the stake. Did the church cost so much effort to capture Elysses, just to burn her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked around, and now the entire central square has been arranged into a huge magical array. At the intersection of the square, there are holy knights stationed, and no one is allowed to approach the square. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west side of the square has built a high platform, a high chair with a scarlet velvet pad and various ancient jewels just placed on the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
