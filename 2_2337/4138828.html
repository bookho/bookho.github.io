			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Heavenly Chapter 5 Overture in Hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge’s Unfinished Again With a whip, Marika screamed and stood in front of the beautiful body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and still waved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical whip like Duron not only tears apart Marika’s clothes, leaves a heavy welt on her smooth and delicate skin, long whip There is also a hint of attacking power that directly stuns her and then wakes up with the stimulation of this energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong pain comes quickly and goes fast. It is the pain between this moment that has completely emptied the energetic Malika. On her close to the red luo, the whip marks have been swollen and began to ooze. However, compared with the acute pain directly affecting the spirit, the pain on the simple ** can be said to be negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...what are you dare to beat me?" Malika couldn’t accept the fact, she suddenly screamed out: "You actually hit I! The blood of the imperial royal family flows through me, the blood of the emperor is flowing! You insult the dignity of the emperor's room, I am going to the Imperial Court to appeal! Your ugly pig will be burned alive, this whip is Evidence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled, and the magic whip danced again and flew to Malika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika scared her hands and shook her head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the whip is only silently passing over her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the panicked Marika, Rogge said leisurely: "Dear Marika, I did hit you. But the whip on you." Before the mark disappears completely, you can't go anywhere. In fact, there is no room for me in the future, you can't get a step in the room! Here is the Principality of Are, in this place, only I am the person who issued the order, you must Remember this! If you can't remember it, it's okay, this whip is the best tool to help you improve your memory. You are indeed the daughter of the Emperor, but only one of the more than forty princesses. That's it. The only value you can use is your princess status. Without this, you are actually nothing. If you are just a civilian daughter, you may go to the most famous poet with the imperial capital to perform a vigorous battle. Love? I don't deny that there is love in the world that transcends material, power and interests, but unfortunately, I don't see this in your love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika Filled with wild eyes now only panic, she stared at the black magic whip whiplash, but kept trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "After I will invite Lord Relo, I will give him a full opportunity to show your loyalty to you. I hope very much." Love between you can transcend everything, including life and death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relalisted, Malika finally recovered some of her instinct, she trembled and asked: "You devil, what do you want to do to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge explained patiently: "I have to do very simple. First, the whip and The soldering iron will then increase the pain a little bit by the person who knows how to use the sentence. If he can still persist, then I will do it myself. Believe me. Dear, even in the empire, I am also a good magician. Under the ground, even if Relo has only one skull left, he can maintain his complete mind and even continue to create poems for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... You are a demon! Why are you doing this to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was originally in the upper class. The friendship between you and Relo must have a well-deserved name. But you are not avoiding it or even preaching it. I understand what you mean, you want to put pressure on me so that I can’t honor my reputation. Don't terminate this marriage. You think it's right, I really want to keep my reputation. So although I can't do anything about you, but if you don't do anything to Relo, how do you let me govern my future?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rush of footsteps outside the door, and then the door was gently slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika’s eyes lit up and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened quietly, and a full armored elf warrior came in. Malika disappointed to find that the elf warrior just looked at her indifferently and hurried to Rogge: "Rogge, Relo broke away! We couldn't stop him, and the butterfly was also affected. Seriously injured!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger's face changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika was also taken aback, she did not know that Relo had such a strong ability, even in the unexpected search of Rogge, Can also break through and escape. Although Marika looked down on Rogge, the entire empire knew that Rogge had a very powerful Elf Guard. Even she knows that Lero, who only has a few swords, can't be the opponent of the Elf Guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was silent for a while before reaching out and provoking Marika’s chin, looking at the face full of wild beauty, slowly said: Dear, you see, this is the result of your love that transcends everything. You, the princess of the empire, is just a bitch that was used by Druid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was said, Roger strode away with the Elf Warrior, leaving only the unconscious in the room and the empty Marika in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the corner of the house with a disappointment, and suddenly fell to the ground and burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another large room, the wind butterfly is lying on the stage. Her armor has been completely removed, and her upper body is red. At the moment, in the middle of the dizzying **, there is a wide wound. The wound is a thin seam, there is no bleeding, and the skin is as usual except for a little light gray in the color. If you don't pay attention, you can hardly see that there is still a wound there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the gray is slowly spreading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s forehead has oozing fine sweat, she has set up a delicate gold frame above the wind butterfly body, with a shelf The crystal bottle, the colorless and transparent medicine drops on the wound of the butterfly. Each drop of the drug drops. The gray area will shrink and then continue to spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the table with dozens of large and small bottles, Fu Luoya is nervously blending potions. The two elf guardian warriors are also anxious, but they have no other way, only help Fu Luoya from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge strode in, his eyes fell on the wound of the wind butterfly, his face changed again. He has sunk. Stretching your hand and gently stroking the wound, the gray is like life. Climb up his fingers and spread his arms over his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted, his hand revealing a black flame, burning the gray. He couldn't help but frown: "A strong curse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria didn’t go back to the ground: "Relo land is probably the assassination. I I have thought a lot of ways, but I can only stop this curse from temporarily spreading, and I can't eliminate it at all. And this curse will soon adapt to my magical potion, I have to use more powerful potions to suppress it. But you know. This can't be supported for a long time. In my opinion, such a powerful curse can only be solved by the sacred sorcerer. You still have three days to find such a person."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a bit. He himself is good at cursing the undead mage, so it is clear that with the powerful power of this curse, if you want to crack it, you must at least be a bright mage close to the level of the Berke Cardinal. Such a person does not say that the Ayre Principality does not, that is, the entire Asrofic Empire can not find a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days, how is it enough? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge once again put his hand on the wound of the wind butterfly, the hand reveals a faint silver light, and it takes a long time to recover. Just frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly whispered low and slowly opened his eyes. She turned her head hard and finally saw the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge...Adult, what happened to me? Why...I can't move?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge patted her face and smiled. "You have been hurt. But it doesn't matter, you will get better soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The wind butterfly has a beautiful face and a painful color. Road: "You lied to me... I am very sad, I know... cursed. Ah, thirsty... blood, give me blood..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking at the wind butterfly that was once again in a coma, Roger looked sullenly: "I don't know what a ecstasy dagger. But this curse will eventually turn her into a monster that only knows killing and bloodthirsty. At that time, she didn't even die. The creatures are not counted! Some of her soul will be locked in the body, and the other part will be locked in the weapon of the curse. This means she will become a slave to Relo, become his killing tool! And she actually It’s already dead. Now it’s the power of the curse that sustains her life. This sacred dagger is really powerful!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stopped I got the job in my hand and looked at the wind butterfly that was still wrinkled in the coma. Sigh gently: "If you can't stop the curse, only I will seal her with ice magic. When Anne comes back, let her... let her kill... her starry spirit can free the bound soul. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is watching the wind butterfly, and finally only to Froya: "You try to control the curse first. I think about it, if As soon as she changed the situation, she told me immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also called a guardian warrior, coldly: "You go to the room of Malika." Throw the damn Julie to me in the penalty room! Tell those who use the scam, don't kill, don't hurt too much! When I am empty, I will personally clean up her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the command, Roger went straight to the room of Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes is reading tea in a leisurely manner as usual. Rogge did not go around with the old fox, and directly said the situation of the wind butterfly, asking him whether the method of cracking the curse was recorded in the ‘Elves’ borrowing.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening carefully, Hughes’s face was also dignified, and he said: “There is nothing wrong with His Royal Highness, it seems that this curse is by the soul of the soul. The ecstasy dagger is also an artifact, and the curse that comes with it is very powerful and even invades the person who holds it. It is said that each of its masters eventually becomes like the victim who falls under its blade. The slaves only know how to stop killing to ease the hunger for the blood. Rogge, the soul of the dagger is a very troublesome artifact, in some respects similar to Miss Androni’s blue sky. The people who are vindictive are basically impossible to recover. The same is true for the wind butterfly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stares at the plain and unwavering face of Xiusi. Dao: "The wind butterfly is a rare talent in the elves. Do you leave it alone? With thousands of years of magic accumulation in the genius of the elves, I don't believe that even a curse has no solution!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed: "The soul of the dagger The curse is not impossible to crack, the sacred master has a natural advantage in cracking the curse. Just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger snorted and said: "Just Their mana must be at least close to the level of the Magister! I only have three days, where do you let me find such a person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I came to the window, I said indifferently: "Although the elf has a life span of hundreds of years, in the eyes of the gods who are high above, this is just a fleeting, insignificant time. It is the destruction and destruction of the whole family of elves, in our own eyes. It’s an incomparable event, but in the eyes of the gods, I’m afraid it’s just a little more glance. In fact, it’s no different to die of a wind butterfly than to kill another elf. It’s not worth it for her. People influence your plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also came to the window and silenced for a long time: "Is it embarrassing, I think it’s strange, why I will I don’t see that Relo has such a powerful force. You also know that not many people can completely hide power in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes thought for a moment: "Rogge, maybe Relo It is the goddess of the natural goddess. The believers of the natural goddess are committed to maintaining the balance of nature, eliminating the factors that undermine the balance, and spreading the faith. Most people know that they can live in harmony with nature, but they do not understand the goddess of nature. One aspect is that it can be dissolved into nature. The more believers with powerful power, the more they can integrate with nature, or even become part of the surrounding environment. In the eyes of our killers, this is actually invisible. A hidden killer can't escape your perception, but a killer that dissolves into the surrounding environment is easily overlooked. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge recalled several times with Leroy, and nodded: "It should be for this reason." It seems that the goal of this ecstasy decapitation should be my throat! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sneer in his mouth and said: "The believers of these natural goddesses want to murder in front of me, I am afraid it is not so easy!" Although I will not crack the curse, but a curse that is more powerful than this curse, I happen to know a few! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
