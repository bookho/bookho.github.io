			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight Twelfth Movement Chapter Two Chapters of Artifacts<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls quietly, but The entire city of Sild is brightly lit and noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals were all red-eyed and shouting at the soldiers who were screaming, and they looked a little angry. They are working hard to carry out an expedition for the early 70,000 troops in the morning, an almost impossible task. Both the generals of the Chaoshan Legion and the Bauhinia Butterfly, who led the army of the Ayre Principality, had to work all night for Rogge’s sudden decision. For the first time, the Principality’s army and the Chaoshan Legion worked closely together because the generals of both sides were real soldiers. They were unwilling to let their soldiers fall on the battlefield because they lacked the necessary pre-war preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arms warehouses of all sizes have been opened, and a box of ordnance, armor, and spare parts have been removed and stacked in designated locations, waiting for their new the host. The staff of the two sides gathered in front of the big military map and repeatedly tweeted the order and route of marching tomorrow. As for the two thousand soldiers who stayed in the city of Sirde, they have also been selected. They are all from the Principality of Are, the soldiers who have been selected from the various units and have the worst combat effectiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood at the window and looked with satisfaction at the city of Side, destined to spend a sleepless night. In the distance, the magnificent Chaoshan Legion headquarters exudes a divine sacred light, which is extremely eye-catching under the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building is now completely occupied by the goddess and her entourage, and all the generals, including all the generals of the Chaoshan Legion, are expelled, even the headquarters. No one dared to approach the square in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the square is inhabited by the goddess' car, the huge silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you see the majestic, grand, tall and mysterious building. Rogge's poor heart would jump wildly uncontrollably. His fingertips recalled the gentle and creamy touch of the day, whether it was barefoot or other parts, he finally touched the goddess! Rogge suddenly had an impulse, and he wanted to see what was hidden behind the dazzling light of the group at all costs. For a time, countless past pictures floated from the deepest part of the memory and were intertwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these pictures. All the memories of O'Reilly, but he is puzzled. There are still countless pictures about Fengyue or Serafi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s whole body is like a shock from the picture of countless flashes of light, but when he searches carefully, the moment’s feeling is flashing again. Passed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Moon, O'Reilly, Serafi, Death Scythe, Black Devil, and the familiar world of death...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered that he had seen O'Brien and Fengyue appear at the same time. Perhaps from the O'Reilly, I can find out the whereabouts of the wind. There is no news of the wind and the moon...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the goddess walking in the world, O'Reilly, seems to remember his last rude behavior. . Not to be embarrassed at all. Each time, the closer the distance between Rogge and her, the stronger the energy storm that condenses around her, and it becomes extremely unstable. The violent energy accumulated in that small space is so powerful that as long as a hurricane of energy is released, it is possible to penetrate Rogge's strong **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and suddenly remembered Macbeth, not knowing that this is still trapped at the headquarters of the Chaoshan Legion, facing O'Brien and his own A high-ranking angel with many horror entourage. What is the situation now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogra took the curtains and blocked all the noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no interference from the outside torches, magic lights, lighting fires, the various lights and shades that flash from time to time in the room become clear, dark gold, silver and bronze The light is chasing each other, and there is a little mystery in the beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the large experimental table at the other end of the room, Froya will bundle a pair of blonde hair. Holding a special pen with a thunderbird tail feather in his hand, he is copying the magic on the blank scroll in front of him. At the other end of the lab bench, there are dozens of magic materials with different functions. On the delicate pen holder made of pure gold, there are dozens of magic pens made of different materials and different functions. There are three reeled scrolls on the left hand side of Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge moved her heart and wiped the sweat for her. She screamed: "Froya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She snorted, listened and didn't look up. There is no work on the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this magic scroll is finished. She looked up and covered her hand. I yawned lazily. The wide and tired silk sleeves blended with the gold thread, all of a sudden slipped to the elbows, revealing a dazzling white arm, full of smashing magical light, from time to time on the bare skin to draw a variety of patterns It is like a beautiful view that can only be seen in the famous "Ukiyo-e" made by Thrace artisans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Fu Luoya’s tired and bleak eyes, Rogwen said warmly: "Okay, go to sleep! Go marching tomorrow." "In the face of this little goblin, he rarely has a serious time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stretched his body, and the flamingo that spun the flamingo spit the ball and gently nodded, as if the spring flowers of the branches trembled in the wind. . She slightly adjusted her posture. If she intentionally showed Rogge a proud figure, Robo's boneless waist made a seductive gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing Rogge’s gaze began to become fascinated, Froya smiled lightly, it was a smirk with a smug smile. Suddenly, she sat up straight and regained her sense of concentration at work. She opened a new blank magic scroll in front of her and said, "There are two reels! After reading it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was angered by her cold and hot attitude, but she could not find a way to go out. He smiled helplessly. Road: "Why are you so anxious? Is there still tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria didn’t lift his head: "Who can make you fight every time?" Going forward, rushing to die? I am of course more prepared, do you think I am willing to stay up late? You. How to say is also the prince of the great empire, even so poor that even the magic scroll can not afford to buy, say Who would believe it when you go out? In short, you will send me to the back site tomorrow, and the scrolls will be saved. They are not white for you. If you are really dead, let me enslave in the future? After that, you can make money for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and said: "You can rest assured that this time I must be charged. Because this The war is different from the past. It is not a death, but a rush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria groaned and looked up at Rogge, no What are you talking about? Half a sighing sigh: "Blessings and sorrows are twins, don't be too big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence, Rogge’s hand suddenly disappeared Sighing from her arm under the sound. Then he squeezed heavily on the round and very flexible hills on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin’s hand trembled, and the unfinished magic scroll was scrapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat! Don't get too early, this scrapped scroll will be remembered on your head!" The little goblin is angry and sweet. The sound resounded throughout the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is a wonderful thing that adds value to almost anything that can stand the test of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, this crystal stemmed from the Kensington period, there is no place in the workmanship, but the history of three hundred years has made it Very valuable. And it is full of red wine, also a famous wine with more than 80 years of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand holding the glass is pale and slender, and the upper aristocratic man wants to have such a noble and elegant complexion. The huge emerald ring on the ring finger is even more morbidly pale in this hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the hand is a tall and thin aristocratic man. He looks like he is about 30 years old, looks very handsome, and has a careful trim on his lips. A mustache. The slender shoulders are wide, and the black dress of a style is elegantly decorated with the emerald inlaid on the cufflinks. It is a perfect match with the huge ring on your finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the beard with one hand and looked at the huge military map in front of him, thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, he looked up and asked a tall middle-aged knight around him: "Have our Masters kept training these days?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez nodded and said: "This is a big event for them. I don't dare to practice them, let alone train you to ride them. I am also very relieved. How is the report of the newspaper? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The battle report was sent to the Imperial Capital two days ago. The battlefield was cleaned up today, and a total of 760 tidal light cavalry were found. Badge. I will send a special person to the Imperial Capital in the afternoon. But, how many casualties do we report to adults?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez pondered, said: Let's report a hundred or so first, which is enough to make a brilliant victory! It will not take long for the Astrofiks to come to Sorato for revenge. Whenever they hold the city, no matter how many casualties, they will be regarded as military merit. At that time, we will add extra casualty figures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is indulging, repeatedly scribbling on the military map for a long time, finally point A mountain peak: "If the Astrofiks come Fu, the tenth of the ** is going through here. You send a few powerful guys, and bring the ten best riding masters here to lurk. Let each of them bring two Western-Western purebred horses, this kind of The horse is running faster than the Asrofike. The strategy is still like the last time, the magical array is preset, and after a round of magic, it will immediately escape. Let us first give the arrogant Asropiks a Let me talk about it. After you have arranged this, you will come back to me. Let’s take a look at the situation of strengthening the city defense.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged knight responded, but hesitated Did not retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez raised his eyebrows and asked: "Do you have anything else to say? Don't worry, just say it!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, from last night, our reconnaissance cavalry has never returned. I have sent three batches of detectives to look for, but they have no news after they leave the city... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez trembled and fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red wine in the crystal cup slowly began to sway, the dark red cockroach became more and more intense, and finally, a drop flew out of the crystal cup. It happened to fall on the military map, which represented the icon of the city of Sorato, and quickly broke into the paper. The one that spreads the dark red flowers, and looks at it like a piece of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sun shines on the high watchtower of the city, where six soldiers struggled to push open the gates with bronze cones, then Run away quickly and stay close to the city wall. Dusty. A team of knights with clear armor ran out of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of a knight holds a flag of warfare, and the flag waving on the flag is embroidered with the emblem of Rogge and the family. The Astrofic embassies are decorated with dragons and lions. As the prince of the empire's surname, Rogge can use two lions in his own badge. In the middle of the shield, seven spears are arranged in a dense manner. These spears are the hallmarks of the imperial warfare. Looking over the past, the fat man has a lot of military power. Coupled with the three goshawks that came to the forefront of the empire, there are almost no such marks on the badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle flag is made overnight, and the fat man prefers the color of gold. Therefore, the dark red-based coat of arms is filled with various gleaming gold signs, and the badge that is enough to make any nobles admire is like a huge golden shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly 10,000 cavalry stepped on the fine steps, followed by the flying flag and out of the city of Sirde. After the cavalry, it was an infantry that rolled like a tide. phalanx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Wallace and others will be led by Ma Li on the side of the road, watching the army roll toward the southeast. The fat man is full of enthusiasm, and the generals such as Wallace are worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the army. There are countless carriages that carry a lot of military supplies out of the city. This time, the tide marched, and all the horse-drawn carriages in the city of Sild had been requisitioned, but the munitions that could be transported were only a small part of the 70,000-strong army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Sidde, there was a burst of touching dragons, and the two dragons rushed in the sky and circled the army below for weeks. Going away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few soldiers in the Aley Principality queue began to cheer and pray to the sky. They look at the believers of the Eye of Wisdom. Then more and more people cheered toward the dragon, and even many soldiers of the Chaoshan Legion joined the ranks of cheers. After all, the soldiers who went out of the game did not want to sleep on the battlefield. It is natural to have two dragons standing on their own side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
