			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunset. The afterglow of the setting sun dyed the whole forest into a golden color, and the large birds flew back to the forest in large pieces, and the wolf and the birds sang in harmony, a peaceful and peaceful weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of a clear stream, there was a small tent. There was a bonfire burning in front of the account, and a deer leg was being grilled on the fire. Rogge sat leisurely by the fire and turned the roast deer's legs. His two ears moved and listened carefully to the sound of the water coming from the creek in the distance. There is a small lake outside of a mile, and Androni is taking a shower there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has a heart, but does not have the ability to approach her without being aware of it. What's more, where did Androni haven't seen it from top to bottom? Although it is absolutely not enough to look at the beauty of Andreoni, it is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light suddenly flashed in the distant stream, followed by a roar of the beast before his death. Rogge secretly rejoiced, but fortunately did not go to see Androni bathing. She obviously set up a lot of traps around the bathing field with starry air. Needless to say, this is against myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sipped a little song and baked his meat in a comfortable mood. With the great beauty of Androni, the life in the forest has become rich and colorful. As for the two seriously injured angels, he is not worried. According to the magic mark under him, the two men’s two-day effort only escaped 200 kilometers. It is impossible to use the martial arts level of the two. There is only one explanation, their injury or poison. Already done. After tonight, tomorrow, he and Androni will have to catch up with these two unlucky ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Roscio family, it’s just a short check. ? I really don't know why David and Androni have been pulling themselves together. It’s hard to get down from the chariot in Bavaria. Is it going to be on a new chariot? Just kidding, let's talk about it for two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered David and the things he had mentioned, wouldn’t he be Androni? He smiled and shook his head. No, certainly not. Androni's quirks that his brother won't know, and it seems that he can't restrain this sister. If you let Androni marry yourself, then you can offend Princess Flora at the same time. The princess is by no means a good temper, and Rogge has a deep understanding of this. When I thought about it for a long time, there was almost nothing that really caused him to suffer, and he was once picked up by the princess. Naturally, it was counted when it was betrayed by Artest, but that was not his fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge takes out a magical short sword with gold and silver from the Dragon Cave, and cuts the roast deer's legs into small pieces and small pieces. Square meat. In fact, this short sword itself is not so sharp, just after the initial enhancement of magic. But the benefits are in the carvings and inlays, which are real works of art. It seems to have been a collection of great aristocrats who do not understand martial arts but are proficient in art. In the eyes of Rogge, the value of the gold coin represented by this sword is higher than the others, and that is all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat was cut, and a light breeze passed, Androni had returned. She took a blanket from the small tent, sat on it, and spread the wet long shawl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at her barefoot, barefooted, and smiled: "Miss, you still have a good time as a paladin, so you walk in the forest." And it won't dirty your feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted and said coldly: "Are you so interested in men?" If the dragon of the dead dragon ruined my elf cloak, can I use this? But you want me to use the things that the stinky man used, don’t even think about it! You are not saying that you are an alchemist. How? A pair of boots did not do a good day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "I don't have the material to make magic boots, ordinary boots are no problem. But this thing can be different from the cloak, you must fit your feet. I am not a shoemaker, I don't know your foot shape, how can I get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want a pair of suitable boots, you can only grieve the Miss Miss." Rogge smiled Risk, reaching out and touching Androni's bare feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s face was blue and white, her hand twitched, and the starry sky fell on Rogge’s throat. Her beautiful big eyes picked up slightly and gently said: "Are you thinking that after I didn't kill you, it means you still have a chance? Don't challenge my patience, okay?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was so angry that he couldn’t help him. She took out a scarf and threw it to Rogge. She hated: "Put your dirty paws! If you dare to touch me with a finger, I will kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said, she closed her eyes tightly and nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was overjoyed, took the silk scarf in his hand and caught Androni’s left foot. Androni’s body swelled and closed her eyes and endured hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge squeezed her little feet one inch at a time, quietly using many means of picking massage. From a close look, her slim and delicate skin, the white skin is almost transparent, but the delicate lines seem to contain great power. He immediately remembered the beauty of her body that day, the heart swayed, the other hand honestly touched her calf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you touch enough?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger suddenly slammed, Venus is straight ahead. It was originally taken by Androni on the head with a blue sky, but it was a scabbard. But this is the case, the starry temper that is revealed also makes Rogge dizzy, his chest is bored, and he can't help but vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for him to spit it out, Androni was already floating like a gust of wind, crouching on the side of the stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is not expected to be this scene, red-faced and sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew past and wanted to pat her back. Although in vomiting, Androni's scabbard is like a long eye, sticking out from her armpit, heavily and accurately hit Rogge's stomach, let the fat man suck the mouth, the whole person is stiff. In situ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still want to touch me! Stay away from me!" Androni screamed, the scabbard was hooked and sent, and the fat man was like a broken kite. The same, flew back to the original place. She turned her head and vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Androni came back, her face is now completely bloodless. Roger next to the campfire was squatting on the ribs, a look of weakness, and the greenness on his face was a bit heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andro, it’s just that Rogge still has a lot of money. How bad is the poison of the dragon's breath, it is a miracle that Rogge is not dead. How can it still withstand such a strong blow? Besides, the difference in the physical condition of the magician is well known. The person who stepped into the sanctuary by her foot gave a subconscious mind, but she still had not broken a row of ribs. The fat man was thick and thick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing! "Androni was apologetic, but the voice was still cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge rolled over and gave a sigh of relief.... The bones are not broken! Missy, I am a magician. Can you start with a lighter one? Which magician can withstand your record? If I don’t work hard, I am lazy and have a fat. This fall does not kill me half a life? If the dragon poison is again, this time I may not be able to pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni has some distress I don't know what to say. She faintly felt that things did not seem to be said by Rogge, but did not know exactly what was wrong. After a long while, she opened her mouth: it was impossible for the unconscious to fight back and was touched by a man... I couldn’t stand it anymore...so...you didn’t fall to death! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting! Rogge squirted out of the water. "It’s good to die!" "What is this? He stared at Androni with a strange look. She looked straight red, and then looked around, then bowed her head, and finally glared at him, staring at Rogge in one fell swoop.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two had finished the roast, and Rogge took the buckskin and cut it into several chunks with a short sword. Then he stared at Androni’s foot mammoth There is a resignation in the mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is furious, but Rogge says it is necessary to prepare boots. She knows that this is not true. However, I really don't want to walk barefoot. When I bite my teeth, I will extend my feet and let Rogge see enough. I will turn my face and appreciate the scenery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge did not dare to go too far, anyway, the water is long, the days are still long, there is always the opportunity to thoroughly subdue this beautiful woman. Even the confusion has passed, the other is still difficult? She is extremely disgusted with the man's quirks, and she has to think of a way to give it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man took back the mourning in his heart and condensed the spirit to the deer skin on the ground. He was the first to use a five-level magic construct. This magic can only turn the material into general equipment, neither the material can be turned into magic equipment, nor can the magic equipment be modified. In addition to this kind of poor life or adventure adventure, the use can be said to be zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magical flame flashed through, and a pair of ugly boots appeared in front of Rogge. He threw the boots aside, and anyway, Androni would never wear such a thing, it would be better to touch a nail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed another buckskin and started casting again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second pair of boots have at least a boot, but still have to throw it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third pair is much better, although the taste is not good, but can you expect magic to know fashion? In fact, this is just an excuse for Rogge. The real reason is that his taste is too bad. However, these boots are a lot smaller. So Rogge took the opportunity to look at Androni's barefoot, but this time, she had suffered bitterly, and she would not let Rogge move her finger anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, Androni had the right boots, and Rogge’s magic was also exhausted, lying on the edge of the fire and falling asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon is in the sky, the star river is like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his sleep, Rogge suddenly heard a slight sob into the ear. He violently wakes up, the person does not move, the mental power scans over the body for a long time, without any abnormality, this is sitting in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sob was heard from the little tent that Androni slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue silently screamed for a moment: "Androni..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The sob suddenly stopped, and after a while, her cold voice came: "What? It's so late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog sighed Lying down on the sky, watching the Star River in the sky think of Princess Flora? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small tent was quiet and only her voice was heard: "Is it yours?" I just have this hobby, what about? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog slowly said: "I also miss Elysses very much..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the tent, Androni's head came out, and a pair of red eyes with a big red eyes stared at Rogge. "Alice is not a person of Orphey?" The person you like is her? No wonder you will run away with her. Speaking of it, it’s really not like you! But my two brothers are very appreciative to you. It is just that you are still a man in this matter! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and knew that she was Orphey, and only Orpheco. In any case, I have no way to He compares, so I never imagined that I could have her one day. But... the night with her to avoid the church, it was the happiest time of my life."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder, the guardian knight who is in your church will suddenly become a sorcerer and a heresy. Your career that has been working so long, is all put down?" Androni The icy face is softer at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else can I do if I don't let go? I am still young and I can't afford it. If the money is gone, I can earn it again. If the power is gone, I can fight again. But Elysses... I only have one chance... If it is to become a demon with her, how good it is.” Rogge sighed and asked Androni:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you Rocherio family not always the ministers of the Rhine League? You and Princess Furoa should be very close to the door, though... understand what I mean, how do you still Will you be alive with her? Are you afraid that you can't fight the church and the Bavarian Grand Duke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our family...breaking with the Rhine League. The father has decided to fully support the Bavarian Grand Duke," Androni said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was shocked! Did Marshal Rosello rebel? All the heavy members of the Rhine League are not in the Principality of Ron, and it is the Marshal of the Marshal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni covered his face with his hands and sobbed low, choked: "Rog, you said, why can't I just like you, leave the family and go with her?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "Well, Androni, don't cry. How can you be like me? What I left is nothing but power, but if you are with Fulu Ya left, and later on the battlefield of life and death is his father and brother. For me is you, I am also difficult to choose. It turns out that you let me help you to save Fu Luoya is very dangerous, the strength of the alliance is It’s all in your father’s hands.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and slowly said: “Maybe, when the time comes, it’s not not to save her.” Maybe. But you must cooperate with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sighed for a while, it doesn't matter, that guy, too embarrassed, there are two Artifact. But I was afraid that she would die in the king, then...then..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly remembered something, and there was some trembling in his voice, asking: "While the Marshal supports the Bavarian Grand Duke, how can it... How will Orpheus come back to die? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni thought for a moment...I don't know too much. I haven't been interested in their things. I seem to listen to my brother." Once mentioned, my father said that it was very suffocating to Orfey Roque."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was in a hurry and asked: "So, he knows the church preparation Burning Elysses?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni shook his head and said with a certainty: "We only knew this news on the same day. Previously only I knew that the church had a very important ceremony to be held, and the square was closed a few days in advance. I was curious, so I went to peek, and I realized that it was Elysses who was going to burn."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge calmed down and was puzzled. How did the Bright Church learn about the identity of the Elvis Princess? Perhaps the crux of the problem is in the rebellious Artest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily put this question behind his head and smiled and asked Androni: "David always told me to recruit, not to refer to you. If this is the case, I should have agreed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s face suddenly became red and angry: "You dare to beat me." Idea! Do you want me to turn you into a crystal with starry air? Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and asked: "Who can that? I have to seriously consider I don't know if you have a few sisters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni gave a sneak peek at Rogge and said: "My two sisters are Already married, I have three younger sisters. Catherine now claims to be the first beauty of the king, you don't even think about it. Carolyn is a bit possible, her temper is bad, her body is poor, and her mother's family is not long enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wangdu is the first beauty?" Rogge looked at Androni’s face with a smile and looked at you. Wang Du A beauty bar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s face is cold and late, I am not going crazy with you. Remember! I must catch the two pieces of the mess tomorrow! I am going I slept." After that, she turned and got into the small tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertently, her mouth showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderney and Rogge are out when the day is not yet bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-serving the tears of angels, Androni obviously has a layer of martial arts, she walks through the forest like a ghost, quick and incomparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge followed her closely, never falling behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the sound of the closeness in the woods behind him, Androni didn’t know whether it was good or funny. She turned and fell into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗拉, a huge gray spider jumped out of the bushes, and he did not hesitate to chase down Androni disappeared. Rogge gave his own feathers, and Zhengan sat firmly on the back of the gray spider, and he was free and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way to go for Rogge. He summoned a giant jungle spider to attack Androni and sit on his back. Androni ran in front, and the jungle spider only knew that he was chasing after him. Although Androni is fast, the jungle spider is not slow. The two of them are one person and one spider, so they are moving in the forest, stirring the quiet forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was shocked. David gave her the crystal ball, but it was said to have passed the famous heavenly roulette of the church, but it was not so accurate. Can Rogge dug a longan to do this? How can I not see what this longan is doing anyway? She faintly smelled a hint of conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing wrong! Let's go, don't let them run!" Rogge seems to be unintentional, pulling up Androni's little hand, I want to go down the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted, and with a deduction of the hand, Rogge took two *** in the air and then turned him The ground is heavy and throws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger shouted at her feet: "Miss, you are too heavy, oh! No more fast, they have to run!" Brd/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted, his eyes twitched and his body rose. She rushed into the valley with a blue flame tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge climbed up and looked at her far away figure, smiled and added a spell to her, brute force, bowed down and rushed down the mountain go with. The speed is even worse than that of Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered the valley, he saw Androni standing there dumbly. He is a bit strange, and he has been stunned in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two huge rocks on the open space in the valley, with huge crosses on the rocks. Karajan and Chrisma are being nailed to the cross and are dying. Several bows and bows wandered around, and when crows or vultures wanted to fall on them, these guards would shoot at them and shoot the greedy scavengers one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley is filled with a strange atmosphere of terror, and you can’t see any slightly larger beasts or traces of Warcraft, otherwise you will be guarded by these low embarrassments. The strength is not to behold here. But what makes these beasts and Warcraft avoid this place? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Androni still in his mouth, Rogge looked around for four weeks, and finally his eyes fell on the four nailed hands of Carayan and Chris. The roots are dark gray bones. He sensed a familiar taste from above. These are the bone spurs of Gregory? These bone spurs are inserted here, and in the eyes of those beasts and Warcraft, it means that this is the site of the bone dragon. The natural nature of the beasts allowed them to circumvent the valley far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the two giants of the deadly Judiciary Judiciary, Androni could hardly believe his eyes. She can't believe that this is Karajan and Chris Ma, who have the power to kill and kill, and have amazing strength and prestige. Who has such a big skill to make these two people like this, nailed to the cross and slowly wait for death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni can’t completely sense a wave of vindictiveness from them, and the invisible pressure of the two has disappeared without a trace, or These two people are now even worse than ordinary people. The average strong person is injured and heavier. She can more or less see the strength that the injured person had before. But these two people, if she does not know, will definitely judge to be ordinary people. Where did their strength go? This is not just the temperament of being exhausted, but all the roots of fighting are gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang opened his eyes slightly, and there were two blurred figures in front of him. He opened his mouth, but only a hoarse voice was heard. The blue light flashed in front of his eyes, and his body was soft and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni left hand and waved, ** a gentle airflow, gently placed Kara Yang on the ground. She picked up two spurs from Chrisma's wrist and dropped him from the cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her action immediately attracted the attention of the guards, and several arrows spurred her. Androni waved a few swords and twisted the guards into bone powder. She looked at Rogge a little strangely and asked: "There are so many undead creatures here, why don't you put a magic to dispel the dead spirit? Do you have to wait for me to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a master of swordsmanship here, do you still need me?" Rogge smiled. In fact, he has a hard time. He is a necromancer. This magic becomes a control of immortality when he makes it out. Advanced undead creatures will run away, but these lower ranks will only be fully controlled and come to listen to his orders. In this way, Androni will immediately know the true face of his Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
