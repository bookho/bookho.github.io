			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the seventh day of the book, the last day (5)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more effort, At this time, he must have determined that everything is in his grasp, and it is impossible to turn back." Xiusi sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but I can't wait, I have to do something!" Ai Feier hugged a lot of magic crystals in her arms, hurried The ground passed by in front of Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Effie’s figure disappeared, Hughes sighed and took the teacup and drank it. But now his cup is no longer a good tea that is heart-to-heart, just a glass of water. Xius looked at the empty teacup and stood up and walked in the direction of the disappearance of Effie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a quiet and beautiful valley, a clear river winding around the valley, and in the mountains around the valley, there are countless clear streams. Join this nameless river. There are huge houses built in the valley. Almost all of the houses are made of wood and are purely made of wood, blending in with the natural beauty of the valley. There are no tall buildings in the valley, and the highest hall is only over ten meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seemingly ordinary valley is full of unimaginable magical achievements. Not to mention the many magical tricks that walk through the valleys, the magnificent magical hall in the middle of the valley is amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall is full of sculptures and embossments, and in terms of artistic attainments, these decorations are enough to make the so-called masters of art They are ashamed. The hall is made of an unseen bism crystal, and through the crystal, you can see the decoration in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple exudes a light and majestic atmosphere, as a god looks down on everything in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true. It is overlooking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not how high its body is. In fact, the hundreds of millennial trees in the valley are much higher than it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks down because it floats in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several steps that spiral from the ground and lead to several gates of the Temple of the Air. They are made up of first-level translucent steps, each of which is a separate entity and is not associated with other steps. These steps floating in the air can also be called magical wonders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley is quiet and busy. Each of the elves wore a strangely dressed gown. Keep on moving around and busy. If there is a mainland historian here. It will be ecstatic, because these elves are different from the elves in the green mountains of the Central Mountains. Here, all the costumes, decorations and customs are the most original elves of the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this valley, the only thing that seems to be incompatible with the surroundings is Hughes and Effie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stepping into the air temple slowly. Effie's magic lab is located in a large room at the back of the temple. Unlike the neatness of other elves, her lab looked messy, and all sorts of weird items were piled up indiscriminately, but there was only an empty place in front of the window. It seems that this is where Effie made predictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Effie rolled up her sleeves and was grinding a piece of magic crystal. She could see the fine sweat on her forehead. Although she is working, she still wears a loose dress that is inconvenient to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes pushed the door in and then stood there. Quietly watching Effie busy. Finally, Effie grinds the crystal in her hand and holds it in her hand, closing her eyes and praying. She prayed for a long time, and couldn't hear what she was swearing. She only saw her crystal in her hand slamming into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awkward. The magic crystal fell and shattered. But nothing else happened. Effie snorted, swiftly wrapped up the crystal fragments, and then dropped it out of the window, then smashed through the magic material pile in the corner and found an unpolished crystal. She didn't know where to find a hammer and a chisel, carefully carving the pattern on the crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes looked at Effie and sighed: "You are useless to do these things. He can't hear your call now, for all the land. The warnings will not be in your heart. Hey, your current body can't spare the magic of these times. Rest peacefully! I don't think it will take long. He will come to the door,"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled bitterly: "What happens at that time, I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie got the action in his hand and looked at Hughes. The eyes were not good, said: "Why do you want to give the book to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed: "If there is no book of Hilo, he again How could it be supported today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also true." Effie muttered, and she suddenly reached out to Hughes and said, "Get it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes snorted and said, "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hilo The book!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes was shocked and said, "What do you want for this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Curious, just want to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the gaze of Effie’s clear eyes, Hughes was a bit unnatural, he coughed a few times. Sound, said: "The book of Hilo has already been given to him, and where is my hand..."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under the steadfast gaze of Effie, the voice of Hughes was getting smaller and smaller. Finally, he finally sighed and found a huge and beautiful decoration from his arms. The thickest book, look at the cover of the style, is the "Twelve Elf King Wars", that is, the book of Hilo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie snorted and grabbed the book of Hilo from the hands of Hughes and said: "I know that this kind of thing must not There will be only one copy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes only smiles, he really can't speak, and can't explain why Hilo's book will be in his arms again. appear. But he just smiled a bit, his expression has solidified on his face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie's frowning eyebrows, has opened the book of Hilo, is quickly brushing the pages. At this moment, she is a little beautiful in the beauty and cuteness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing brush! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silence in the room, only Effie kept turning the book. In the stunnedness of Hughes, Effie's fingers are dancing, in a blink of an eye. She has turned over a thick book! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes has changed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after seeing Effie close the page, he still stands there, wrinkling his eyebrows and thinking about something, Hughes’ face I have to look at some. He calmed down and smiled. "How, is the story of the twelve great elves kings look good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The story of the Great Elf King? What are you talking about. The book is clearly about the secrets of the gods, and there is a different kind of divine power on every page! But this book has only seven pages. It’s weird!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie is as fast and crisp as ever, but every time she says something, Hughes’s face will be ugly. At the end of the day, this elder elder who has always been calm and embarrassed is as old as a sudden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses finally sighed and said: "Do you know that you will open the book to be the book of Hilo? So why do you want it? Turn to the seventh page?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie show Yan Yixiao. Road: "Yes! Because there was a god who told me that it would help me open the book of Hilo, and after I read this book, there will be nothing. So you don't have to worry."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground color of Hughes slowly gloomy, and suddenly asked: "Which god is there in your prophetic surgery?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie looked up to the sky and thought for a long time, and this was a confused look: "This... I can’t remember it. The gods that responded to my predictions are too many. And it It doesn't happen, I remember so many gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes sighed, just looking at Effie. The elf girl smiled and said: "I said you don't have to worry about it..." The words on her face suddenly faded rapidly and quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiusi took a step forward. Supported Effie, slowly leveling her body on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Effie’s beautiful ground was renewed. She opened her eyes again. However, in the past, she was so clear that she was not cold, and it was already cold and cold, like the cold wind of the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are countless arrogances in that gaze, just like after the pupils, it is actually a god on the top overlooking the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie pushed away the Hughes, and then did not see any movements, the body floated on its own. Stand up slowly. Xius looked at her cold eyes. I looked at her belly again and smiled bitterly. Road: "Effie, how are you feeling now? This child... is nothing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie gently stroked the slightly raised Belly, faintly said: "Everything is in my hands. Since I have woken up, of course he will not have anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did not wait for Hughes to answer, and she came out from the outside. Effie didn't walk the door and didn't wear the window. She flew straight to the wall, and then in the moment before touching the wall, her figure was like being in the water, constantly changing and twisting, hidden from the house, and in the wall. Appeared outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just passed through the wall and walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one person in the room. This elf elder who once held everything in his hands seemed a little dazed. Looking at the messy magic lab, Hughes couldn't even laugh out with a smile. He subconsciously touched the body, not knowing where to take out a whole set of tea sets. It was only when he opened the tea pot that it was empty. Hughes looked inside and poured it out hard. There was still no tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses suddenly stunned and threw all the tea sets in Effie’s magic material pile. He turned and just about to step out of the room, a shiny crystal fragment just entered his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a crystal fragment that was just broken when Effie made a prophecy. When she cleaned up, she missed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes bent over and picked up the crystal fragments, and for a long time, his eyes finally filled with anger that could not be concealed! He threw the crystal in the air, and the right hand had already used the sleek, all-spirited sword, and the sword stabbed the crystal fragments! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air faintly screams! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Hughes is unchanged, and the sword is slowly drawn out. I don’t know when the sword of the sword has completely become nothingness, only A few drops of gold blood indicate the position of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuss slashed the sword in front of him, pointing to the sword. His fingers are passing by. The imaginary sword front re-emerged as a physical entity, restoring a bland look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder elders hanged the swords back to the waist and walked out of the prophecy room of Effie. Behind him, the closed door fluctuated and merged with the surrounding walls to seal the prophecy room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes knows, in the future. Effie will never use this prophecy room anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind carries the coolness of autumn, passing over the mountains and crossing the river. Crossed the entire continent. It shakes the treetops and also disturbs the blonde hair of the beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya took the spring-on-the-shoulder finger to the blonde in front of the forehead, and the beautiful polar tourmaline picked up slightly and looked at the endless mountains and rivers. . She sat on the rock at the top of the dangerous peak and stood on the cliff of the kilometer. The white bare feet hung in the air and swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the position where she is sitting, the peaks compete. The river runs through the river, and the scenery is unparalleled. However, her tourmaline is reflected in the vast sea of ​​clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that direction, under the same piece of clouds, there was a person who worried her that she could not leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight smile on her face, which seemed to remind me of the past. At this moment, Fu Luoya, still beautiful and unparalleled, raises her hand. It is a landscape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fu Luoya chanted a short spell, one arm, and floated under the support of the magic. She turned around in the air and smiled slightly toward Miro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Flora is floating in the air. Under the barefoot of the snow, it is a kilometer cliff, attacking the mountain wind and picking up her clothes, it is like a god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro opened his mouth and looked at it for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirro reacted until Froah flew past him. He silently followed Fuliah and flew to several stone houses not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were silent all the way, and Miro opened his mouth several times, but did not say anything. Finally, he couldn't help it anymore, holding the hand of Froya. Trembling: "Froya. Follow me... Go with me to the Devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya turned around, a pair of tourmalines Look at Miro. Smiling and said: "Don't go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro's face changed, and in an instant, he suddenly felt a burst of pain, and he was so painful! He couldn't help but scream: "Why don't you go? The war here has already been lost, and it is very likely that the entire plane will die out! Do you think that if you have more power, can you reverse the fate?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiled slowly, but slowly and firmly pulled his hand out of Miro’s palm and said, “I’m too lazy to manage the win or lose of the war. It’s this plane. The survival of me also has nothing to do with me, but since he is here, then I will not leave. As for destruction..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and said: "... I don't care!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro's face is slowly pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria said softly: "Miro, you are very good, if... If you come earlier, I might go with you to the devil world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that she said this, Miro’s heart was aching again, and he barely smiled: "What are you going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait. Wait for him to come to me. If he doesn't come, then after I recover, I will go to him."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the autumn of the mystery is completely different from the fall of the mainland. The autumn scenery here is beautiful, and the mountains are bright and bright. It’s just that the secret season is like this year, and next year’s is the same, every year, there will be no change, and the autumn scenery on the mainland is changing, always giving people expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blood angel Augustus, Rogge is the first time to experience the fall of the mystery. However, he did not have any interest in this beautiful autumn scenery. He did not look at the window at all, but stared at the huge magic map in front of him. And Augustus stood in front of the huge floor-to-ceiling windows, quietly looking at the burning mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how many times you have seen it, Augustus is not tired of the autumn landscape of the mystery. He likes autumn, likes the bloody scenery, and prefers the sorrow and desolate before the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely, sometimes it’s really enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is enjoying loneliness. In addition to loneliness, he also likes all kinds of emotional changes such as anger, joy, anxiety, etc., no matter what, it is better than the ignorant existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only lonely, it will last long enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has no such enthusiasm as Augustus, and his mood at the moment is not fluctuating. Just looking at the magic map in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope stands at the other end of the magic map, with the scepter pointing to the mountains on the south of the mainland, slowly saying: "There is a breath of natural goddess here. You may be able to find a way to the goddess of nature here. But the goddess of nature is powerful, far from the goddess of ice that you have been against, and you have to be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s mouth floated a cold smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope seems to have never seen Rogge’s expression and coughed a few times. Only with a scepter, the scepter pointed to the location of the Moonlight Dragon City and the Prisonfire Basin. "You are familiar with these two places. You don't need to say much. But what you need to pay attention to is that Dragon God is It is composed of three different divine powers, and its connection with this plane is not very close. It would be very difficult to find the kingdom of the dragon god. And how the god of the dragon god is, I am not Clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scepter once again pointed to the Central Mountain Range and said: "There is a passage to the Devil's Land. It used to be guarded by the Devil General Artest, and now it is unguarded. You can enter the Devils along this passage. It is said that In the deepest infinity of the devil, you are sleeping in the dark demon. Of course, the endless magic is the place where the stars of Andreioli are not willing to enter, you do not need to enter there. According to the god of salvation, Isaac Look, the dark demon can't leave the endless magic, so you don't have to worry. Go to the devil world. As long as you can find the devil's agent and harvest its soul, it should be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s expression finally changed a little. He faintly asked: “The devil’s Artest is very strange. I have a feeling now that it has a heavenly atmosphere.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope slowly nodded. Road: "Your feeling is right. In fact, the soul that dominated Artest's soul at that time was the lord who had hundreds of millions of avatars, and lie and fraud."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s eyebrows are slightly raised, saying: “Does Heaven still have lies and deceitful landlords?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The vastness of the heavens You and I can imagine, so in the face of the glory of the gods, be humble." The Pope answered some questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded indifferently and held his hand and did not continue to ask. At this point the Pope's scepter points to the last place, which is the mysterious Chichinaco Mountains in the western part of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here. Just born a very powerful atmosphere. Although it has no godhead. But if you are interested, you can also go and see."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said with no expression: "Is this all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge faintly said: "It is indeed enough. I will be back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me talk about it. He did not say goodbye to the pope, his body fluctuated, and it was hidden into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus finally turned around and looked at the ripples of space that Rogge had not dissipated after leaving, thoughtfully. The pope coughed fiercely, and it seemed that he was old and faintly lit by the wind, and could be extinguished at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge’s figure appeared in his room, the mystery was near dusk, and the golden sun was full of room. In the big room, only Nafi sat at the table, staring at the green plants in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the wind?" asked Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie’s gaze did not leave the potted plant at all, just pointing in the direction of the large terrace. Rog nodded and walked up the terrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge terrace is full of tens of meters. From this position, you can take the beautiful autumn scenery of the entire mystery. It is already the best room in the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is on the terrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that at this moment, the wind and moon are not floating in the air as usual, but sitting on the wide stone bar on the terrace. Her hands clasped her knees, almost huddled, her body trembled slightly, seemingly chilly, and seemed to be afraid of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly turned back and saw the standing Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue silver eyes slowly became angry, her body moved slightly, and she flashed into Luo Ge’s arms, and hugged him tightly with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She buried her face deeply in Rogge’s chest. His chest is wide, thick and warm. This piece of chest is now enough. She deserves to feel safe and dependent, but somehow she can still be peaceful at first, and slowly, her body begins to tremble again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and gently held her into her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under the comfort of Rogge, she shuddered even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she raised her head and looked up at Rogge, gently said: "She...wake up, isn't it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Rogge's eyes and said: "This body belongs to her, is it? When she wakes up, I...it should be gone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Fengyue buried his head in Rogge's chest, tightly, hugged him tightly, and said lowly: "I know, I should not have existed. But I... I don't want to disappear..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body, like ice, is cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge patted her back gently and said: "You don't have to worry about this, everything is already in my... my..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, Rogge suddenly discovered that this sentence, he can not be complete in any case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a soft sigh, and the sound is soft and sweet, and it’s power and majesty. This sigh is only from the mouth of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has crossed the clouds, and is now standing in the air, looking at the distant gates of heaven in the distant sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter the sky above, the cloud below is a bright red at the moment, and the waves that are coming in from the array sometimes make Weiner feel some Unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar abandoned land has become a world of flames. There are no mountains, no land, and some are just a wave of *sweeping and burning. The fire waves that emerge from time to time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this flame world that is enough to instantly smash steel, only the radiant heavenly gates are always shrouded in holiness. There, it is the restricted area of ​​the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the tall and majestic gates of heaven, Wella suddenly felt an indescribable weight in her chest, almost pressing her out of breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the gate of the day, what is waiting for her? Is it an endless battle, or is it instantly overwhelmed by the glory of heaven? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden cross star began to shine in the eyes of Wella, she spread the wings, as the wind passed through the heavy fire clouds, flew to the gates of heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, in front of the gates of heaven, there is a huge figure of up to 100 meters slowly emerging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly stopped in the air, opened her mouth and looked incredulously at the figure that was becoming clear. Her wings were trembling, and her body lost her ability to act. Even her weak hand could not hold the dragon soul gun, letting it slip from the fingers and fall to the endless flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she loses all her memories, she will not forget that figure. Even if she has thousands of strengths, she can't resist in his glory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the god of heaven who created her and gave her emotions, Tiramis! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what you want, you don't have to go into the heavens to take it." The spirit of Tiratemis instantly caused the flames of the entire abandoned land to be One is dark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved slightly, and a radiance fell from the sky, covering Weiner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unimaginable huge memory is like a shocking*, repeatedly smashing her soul, almost driving her crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, all the heavens and the past have emerged in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wella finally woke up from the dizziness, the figure of Tiratemis had disappeared, and the gates of heaven were slowly closing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's wings are quietly widen, facing the place where Tiramis has appeared, slowly crouching down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, she has already made a tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is light in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory will dissipate and the darkness will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
