			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**, the mysterious night passed, and in the early morning, Rogge had to face a bunch of trivial things in the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the day was not yet bright, Mora left Dresden with a tired body. Mora restored the holiness and nobleness of the past, although the relationship has become intimate, but invisible, the distance between her and Rogge has become farther than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mora left, Rogge was dealing with the affairs of the Principality. When he learned that Mora had left the news, he first glimpsed and then smiled and continued to handle the official duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ayre Principality is not peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new chief executive of the occupied area, Xia Shang, is very competent. In less than two months, the levy of taxes and torture and tyranny of torture have already made people angry. He thought he got the favor of Rogge, and he desperately got stuck in the aunt, so he didn't put anyone in his eyes, including Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xia Shang’s men’s actions were stopped by Charlie, so Charlie, who took over the power of public affairs, became the character of Xia Shang who wanted to get rid of it. Don't look at Xia Shang's rule that Anmin does not have the same ability to pass through, but in the internal struggle, it is a lot of tricks and means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to limit Charlie’s military power, he came up with a way to set up a limit card between cities. The team of more than 100 people wanted to pass the customs and must be appointed by the local administrator. Approved. Xia Shang said that this is to prevent the large-scale movement of the rebels, and to protect the security of the occupied area of ​​the Principality. But when will the Rebels openly sway in front of the cities? Therefore, this restriction is actually limiting Charlie’s power to dispatch troops. As a result, Charlie’s tens of thousands of troops stationed in various cities were immediately unable to move. Xia Shang also issued a secret order, so that local officials could be harassed by Charlie’s garrison, waiting for an opportunity to frame it, so that the military power would also be robbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie is naturally extremely dissatisfied with these actions by Xia Shang. However, Xia Shang's action is strictly within the scope of the authority given by Rogge, and does not give Charlie any handle. Under Charlie's temperament, he simply moved to a small town not far from Latvia, and transferred most of his direct troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Xia Shang is a Hu Lai, but he still has some self-knowledge, he dare not start with Charlie’s elves and the Tikton warriors. He knows that these alien warriors have always been valued by Rogge. Once they are damaged by their own reasons, they will not be able to explain them in front of Rogge in the future. On the other hand, Xia Shang knows that no one can resist these fierce alien warriors. If they are in a hurry, they may dare to kill the door and cut themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 10,000 elite warriors in the Ayre Principality, some of them are stationed in Dresden, some are under the hands of Frey, and about 4,000 are Charlie. Direct force. Coupled with the Elf and the Tickton Warrior, this is all the hands that Charlie is free to mobilize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resistance movements in various parts of the occupied area have come and gone, and Charlie has carried out thousands of elites to go back and forth to extinguish the fire. What puzzled him was that the rebel army’s news was too well-informed and almost knew his actions. Most of the time, Charlie will be empty. Charlie knew that Xia Shang would have secretly revealed his whereabouts to the Rebels. The rebel forces in the occupied territories have grown stronger, and the greater the responsibility of Charlie as the highest military chief. However, he deliberately gave false information to Xia Shang several times, but he was still swayed by the rebel army and escaped the trap set by Charlie. Charlie knew that there were only two possibilities. One was the emergence of military genius in the rebel army, and the other was the existence of another traitor, and the level of traitor was high enough. In any case, Charlie firmly believes that Xia Shang did not have the ability to see the false information he distributed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After observing the actions of the Rebels, Charlie was more inclined to have traitors in the Principality. But this is not Charlie’s strength, he can only turn to General Horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one month has passed, and the always efficient Horne is still making no progress in exploring the traitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not everything is in accordance with Rogge’s plan. This is a world of change, and any prior plan will encounter unpredictable unexpected factors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rebels are indeed on display, but the degree of exhibition is too fast. The two rebel forces established by Horn are uniquely strong and powerful, each with hundreds of fighters. However, a rebel army led by a young girl has suddenly emerged, and in a short period of time, nearly 2,000 people have accumulated. This largest rebel army has gathered a large number of former Latvian warriors, many of whom will be killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge returned to Dresden, Horne had begun to fully investigate the information of this rebel army, but it has not yet produced results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, there are three or four rebel forces active in the occupied area. Horn's report believes that the emergence of such a large number of rebel forces in such a short period of time is certainly the result of third-party forces intervening. He has already sneaked into the occupied area, and there are reports that more mercenary units are coming to the Principality of Are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger snorted and threw the report aside. He also turned over other military documents, mostly Charlie and Xia Shang's mutual accusations. Rogge didn't look at these documents and threw them aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the fat man, these rebellious forces lacking the strong are all rabble. When he finishes the matter of the city of the gods, he will personally bring the most elite troops and thoroughly suppress all the resistance movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes him unhappy is that the armaments of the Principality are much less efficient. But Rogge knew about Auntie’s heart disease, and at this time he could only sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess of the Empire, Princess Marika, was accompanied by her mother, slowly coming to Dresden, and did not know if the Relo had that Courageous. However, Rogge did not wait for her at all. At this moment, the fat heart has already flown to the city of the gods. After dealing with the affairs of the Principality, he hurriedly left the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the square of the city of the gods, Rogge silently looked at the huge silver dragon statue that suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue is so vivid that it is so vivid that the fat man who always thinks that the dragon is all the same can be distinguished. This is the silver that fell in front of him that day. Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of such a statue, Rogge only felt uncomfortable. He even had some concerns that the statue would have survived some time and to tear his great enemies into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lakeside square, countless elves are busy, and a new high hall replaces the small building that was not surprisingly placed and placed with silver dragon eggs. Under the command of the Master, the elf craftsmen carefully placed the magic symbols cast by metal in the designated position on the outer wall, and then the wizards carefully injected magic into the magic symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new hall has no windows and only two doors. A huge and complex magical array on its outer wall is nearing shape. Looking far away, it is more like a huge cage. Rogge scrutinizes every magic symbol, but every time he walks around the new hall, he will see the huge silver dragon statue not far away, and there will always be some uneasiness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the fat man who knows the intention of the statue to build this statue, he has already ordered it to be demolished. However, the silver dragon egg is hidden in the place close to the statue of Christine Ferrena. This idea is also really worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days of the City of God, Rogge was fully involved in the design and layout of this magical array. There are many wizards in the city of the gods, and Fu Luoya has helped each other. This magical array is designed to be smooth. Rogge repeated the magical magic recorded in the black crystal and the undead spells from the memory of Ella, and finally completed this huge magical array. Only if it can be effective, you have to wait until you start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the elf city maintained by the magic of the ancient trees, almost all buildings were built by the elves with their natural skills. The reconstruction of the City of God is not small, but it took two or three days to complete it. This is an architectural level that the human city can't imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, all the magical arrays are arranged. On the early morning of the next day, Rogge opened the door of the palace, with a large number of wizards and warriors, and even included the death squad and the two old foxes of Xius, and entered the new hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** of the magic illuminates one by one in this windowless high hall, almost nothing in the hall, only the central part of the Amorona Horrible huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro has an indigo-brown body, a lower body shaped like a lion, and four giant claws lying on the ground. The upper body is a devil's body, with a small fleshy wing behind it, and an incredibly thick arm crossed his chest. It has a long, protruding, dragon-like giant mouth with a deep pit in the center of the forehead, which looks like the position of the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A low voice sounded in the hall: "My servant, I smelled the familiar atmosphere! Have you already taken your eyes back for me? Resurrect me, I will give you infinite power, wealth and power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quietly gestured behind him, stepping forward to the respect of the Amaro adult, I have brought your eyes. Please forgive me for your offense! I have to take the shackles that make up the seal for you, and then put your eyes back. Finally, please ask for a little discomfort. The time you have slept for too long, the power will inevitably suffer a lot of losses. I have found many sacrifices for you, and will bring their blood to you through the magical array. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro laughs very well! You are very loyal, my servant. I will generously reward your loyalty. Come on, resurrect me! I have been sleeping in the cold temple for too long, I can't wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rogge, a large number of elf warriors rushed into the hall quietly. The group surrounded Amoro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro seems to be aware of what is the sound of a huge body moving? Why are these humble creatures here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge went to the Amorro and said: "Amorous adults, they are your servants, and you are willing to witness your resurrection." For a great moment, please give them this glory! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro's laugh echoed throughout the hall: "Very good!" My servants! After I am resurrected, I will give you strength to reward your loyalty! I will lead you to conquer the whole big 6! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to correspond with the laughter, the wizard wizards began to slowly recite the spell, the magic array in the hall slowly lit, bursts of bloody The gas is scattered from the magical array. The magic symbols on the outer walls of the temple are also quietly lit one after another.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro is on the ground, but it The huge body was also as high as ten meters. Rogge stood in front of it like a small bug. He tentatively grasped a cockroach on the front paw of Amoro, and finally pulled it out. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro snorted, but it knew that Rogge was cracking the seal, so he couldn’t hold it. After the cockroach pulled out, the wound left was wriggling, swiftly Healed, and there will be no traces after a while. Rogge can't help but admire Amorro's powerful regenerative ability. It's no wonder that such a powerful seal, after such a long time, has taken its eyes, and still can't take it. Destroy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped up and down the body of Amorro A branch was thrown to the ground. Amorro even adjusted his posture to facilitate Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he was inserted in Rogge When Amo's throat was groaning, a burst of ice and ice suddenly spread throughout the hall! This ice-cold with a pressure that does not belong to the world at all. In the temple, are the elites of the elves, but except for 寥寥In addition to a few people, the rest of the elves involuntarily played a chill.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge’s body showed a dazzling brilliance, a faint sacred and solemn atmosphere I can't help but spread out. Although this layer of light curtain is not very strong, it is extremely protective and dripping. This is the skill that the fat man used to resist the holy water of the bright church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The icy cold can't stop spinning around Rogge, but there is no place to break through. And the mirror in his arms is softly light, offsetting most of the cold and cold breath. Power.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog finally pulled out the cockroach slowly <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro screamed at the horror of the entire hall, and finally stood up! But it was still filled with dozens of cockroaches, and it was painful to force it. Once again, fell to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at the frosty sorrow. Although there was an invisible but deadly cold chill, but the cockroach itself looked There was no surprise at all, not just a little light, even a little rust. Rogge smiled and put the donkey in his arms. It seems to have sensed the power of the goddess of ice and snow contained in the mirror, and slowly converges the chilly atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge pulled out the last shackles, the entire hall was already immersed in a thick bloody sigh, and the magical array on the outer wall already It is fully activated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro made a terrifying roar and stood up again! He shook his body at random and threw Rogge out. A touch of blood red soaked the eyes of the Amorro, and the pupil finally recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s light! I saw it, and it’s wonderful to resurrect my new body control! My feelings are back, I smell the sweetness of the blood, and the elves! This is my favorite food! My servants, I will eat you and turn you into a part of my body. This is the highest reward for your loyalty! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in front of Amoro is gradually clear, it does see the elf. But it sees a large number of elves around the group, each There is a strong bow in the hand of an elf, and countless arrows with purple magic radiance are pointing at themselves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? Want to rely on these slender arrows to resist me? "Amorro felt something wrong, and roared in a demonstration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has climbed from the ground, his hand waved, and countless magic arrows formed. An orderly arrow rain, shot at the Amorro.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro’s body is too big, and its activity has not been revitalized, so it’s not sensitive. Every arrow is in the middle of its body. Every time an arrow, a feeling of numbness will spread once on the Amorro. These magic arrows are attached with adjusted paralyzed magic, which is a fusion of the devil After the magic of the crystal, these magic arrows have special effects for the creatures from the demon world. Although the regeneration ability of the Amorro is very powerful, the number of magic arrows is too much, and it can not withstand the effect of paralysis, screaming and slowing. Slowly fall to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humble little bug! You dare to lie to me! When these numb magic works, I will tear you all into pieces! "Amorro screamed angrily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rughaha laughter is just using each other! If I really raised you up, not Has it become a part of your body? Oh, I am humble and can't afford this kind of glory. The noble Amoroc, in order to show loyalty to you, I decided to make you part of this elf city. Only The whole city of gods can be worthy of your identity! Do you want to lower your noble head and have a good look at what is under your feet? Hahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro looked down and saw the ground of the temple. I don’t know when it gave birth to countless thorns, and it was climbing and growing wildly along its body. These thorns are dark red with purple and black, and are full of horrible spikes of several inches long. As the thorns grew, these spikes still couldn't stretch, and they pierced into the body of Amoro one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the relationship between the magical arrows, the Amorro consciousness is completely lost. If it is not Rogge’s reminder, it does not know that the body has been covered with these terrible thorns. It is intuitive that these thorns are definitely not easy to deal with, trying to stand up, but the magical arrow's paralysis has not yet passed, it still can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro is so red-eyed that he wants to drop blood, staring at Rogge. It has a huge mouth and wants to spray something to Rogge. But it was empty and there were no attacks like a half breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger saw the situation is not good, has already picked up a huge, three-inch steel shield, and firmly cover himself. The magic light on the shield shines, obviously adding a lot of magic protection. The fat man is empty, only the Xius and the death class stand there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cumbersome and huge shield, in addition to this occasion, can not see what other uses. Obviously this sinister fat man is ready to do everything, and he has planned everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro is very arrogant, but can only scream a few times, the body is becoming more and more powerless, and there is no remote attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s awesome, every time your own power regenerates a little, it will be sucked up by the thorns of these thorns. And these thorns seem to understand its body structure, and can't stop the spiking to the source of countless powers resurrection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the thorns draw more and more of the power of the Amorro, their branches gradually reveal the blue and white color. The thorns are still growing wildly, and they climbed into the chest of Amoro in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the thorns of the devil's thorns, no. But why do they absorb strength? How can you understand this humble thing to me from the devil? "Amorro is not screaming, and the anger in the voice has been replaced by surprise and suspicion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
