			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory leaped from a small hill and ran back and forth two laps. It has fully adapted to the life of the outside world, and is also familiar with the laws here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside world is an extremely barren world. Apart from the ubiquitous death energy, there is almost nothing. Undead can't solve their hunger and thirst, so they often kill each other. Anyway, the death energy will always give birth to new undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Lyons has challenged the undead creatures around them. Slowly, one by one and the zombies woke up from their slumber and gathered toward Gregory. This time there were actually three zombie warriors, and the vanity bone dragon secretly complained. Gregory suddenly threw a cockroach that was closest to him, biting its skull and sucking one of the essences clean. Before the other crickets and zombies were gathered, Gregory turned and fled. But its operation was slower, and the tail was patted heavily by a zombie warrior, and a small piece of bone was hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf dungeon was disintegrated with the ***, and the Gregory after the rebirth was also very weak. Fortunately, there is a powerful soul of the Demon Dragon family, and it can still maintain a little bit of a bone dragon. However, its former bone wing is leaking on all sides, and now it is simply a bone shelf. This vain bone dragon that can't fly, relying on its four small short legs, is not much faster than the zombie warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory with a bunch of zombies around the ***, and occasionally can throw a few cockroaches, but three zombie warriors tight Followed by it. The current bone dragon is just a mighty appearance, not an opponent of three zombie fighters at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fallen behind the brigade, but it is still trying to follow. Just as it barely caught up with another seemingly much taller cockroach, suddenly, it grabbed the sly neck bone with one hand and pressed him into the stucco on the ground. . The squad's scorpion zombies did not have this little episode at the end of the team, and still happily chased the strange bone dragon in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***There was a crush on the lower jaw, and the right hand gently pinched its neck. A little essence in its skull was slowly inhaled by ***. *** I feel that I have a little more strength, although it is insignificant compared to my previous strength. Since I broke free from the contract, the spiritual energy that came from another world stopped. However, she did not cut off the line of contact in the depths of the soul, which also made the contract not complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** leaped up and chased down the distant zombies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has turned around the hills twice. It takes less time to absorb the energy it consumes. With the soul contract connection, the helpless bone dragon sent a message to the host with pity: "How long do you want to lead them, my dear master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*** Pull the right hand out of the heart of a zombie. It looked at the undead creatures running in the distance and returned to the poor bone dragon: "Turn around this hill for another thirty laps!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long talk with Elysses, Rogge closed his door and thought hard for two days. On one night, he quietly visited Bishop Gnard Hart. Although Rogge received a lot of benefits, from the point of view of living, the life of Bishop Hart seems to have not improved, and even worsened. At least one antique crystal vase that Rogge saw last time was replaced by an ordinary crystal vase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This old thing is not too young, why do you have so much money? Are you ready to take to heaven?" Rogge sat in the living room thinking evilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of work, Bishop Hart walked into the living room with a tired face, and he sat on the sand and kept licking the sun. Rogge immediately said very eloquently that the bishop's adults worked hard day and night, and should be relaxed in ‘Helen’ to avoid getting tired of the body, but it is the tragedy of thousands of believers in the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is very embarrassed to mention that there have been a few good waitresses in the recent 'Helen'. Hart laughed and his eyes narrowed, but he refused with great regret. Rogge was surprised. In the past, the bishop was always not polite with them. The income will be collected, but it is extremely measured. Hart is not an insatiable person, but he never pretends to deny anything. what is it today? Is he really busy at this point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger tempted to ask: "Bishop, I recently asked the Archbishop Burke a few times, but I have not received the interview. You see, is it a bishop? What do you have for us... How do you say, what is the dissatisfaction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand Holy Knights have been in the city of Lille for a month, and now the streets are swaying to meet two holy knights. Of course, more are the reloading knights of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. For a time, it is really doubtful whether this Lille city is still not the residence of the Bavarian Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it’s not a scorpion and a scorpion, no one will not know the changes in Lille. Rogge knows that Hart’s question is inevitable, and the old fox is not so stupid on the surface. He respectfully said: "The little man knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart slowly said: "The force of the church is divided into three parts, some of which are bishops and pastors. Most of them are Masters of Light, and a few are Gods. The second part is in the religious trials, which are mainly law enforcement, and are mainly responsible for sanctioning infidels, especially various magicians." Hartton paused. Don't look at Rogge with a deep look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sweat slowly oozes out from Rogge’s body. He tries to calm his heart and thinks: “Don't he see something? What to do, do you want to kill him and escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart did not seem to see Rogge's anomaly, continued: "This third part is the Holy Knight. The group is divided into three parts. The outermost part is the ones that are being trained by the Guardian Knights led by the guardian knight. The Guardian Knights are mainly to maintain the safety of the church territory and the local church. Well, it is a 50,000 official sacred knight, and the three thousand knights in Lille City are. This last part is called the Templar, the least number, the strength is the most powerful. In fact, Orphee Roque and his twelve round table knight They are all sacred knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge couldn’t help but be astonished at the amazing strength of the Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart finally said the topic, "I heard that the Holy Knights will have some big people coming to Lille, and several of them are even the Archbishop of Burke. Be careful to entertain the Lord. So these days, Burke adults have been patrolling to meet the progress of the work, and naturally have no intention of taking care of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat in the dark Thinking about what kind of big person can let the Archbishop of Red personally arrange the hospitality work? The Guardian Knights are obviously impossible, and the ordinary Holy Knights are far from qualified to make Burke, who is the Archbishop of Red. Hart was so expensive that he was obviously waking up to his identity: the Templar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was yesterday that Rogge knew nothing about the existence of the Knights of the Templar. He always thought that Orpheus and the twelve round table knights were born in ordinary The Holy Knights. If the Templars are free to come out more than a dozen of these standards, then in addition to the three great powers, there seems to be no country in the Big 6 that can stand alone against the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge’s understanding, Hart smiled with satisfaction and placed a letter in front of Rogge. Rogge opened it curiously, and suddenly his hands shook violently. Before he finished reading, he fell to the ground and said loudly: "Hart! You can't listen to the gibberish on this letter! In order to show your heart, the villain will... donate another one to the church. Church! No! A church plus three thousand gold coins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter paper is falling on the ground, with the words of the meandering song: "Be the most devout of the Lord Believers, I am now unveiling a demon who is mixed into the church, a pagan who will summon the most evil and ugly shackles! Lord, believe me, the fat and blood of his whole body is the blood and sweat of the believers. Green blood! Looking at his disgusting eyes, it is like a dead fish rolling his eyes, his stomach must be filled with vicious plots! Lord, how can you let such a person put on a robes? ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart smiled and watched the fat man lying on the ground constantly raising the amount of donation, and bent over to pick up the letter. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge resisted the urge to ruin the letter. Since there is the first one, the person reporting the report will definitely write another one. I just don’t know who is and how much hatred I hate myself. Do you have to put yourself to death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay! Get up, don't donate as much as 15,000 gold coins. As for the summoning..." Hart indulged, just standing Rogge got up and scared again. Hart patted Rogge's shoulder: "Summoning is not a big deal. After all, the undead call is basically learned by every magician. However, it is better not to summon it later. Although there is room for debate. However, some people, such as a certain bishop, may make a fuss about this matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge repeatedly said, but his heart secretly swears Be sure to kill the guy who reported this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge quickly patted the bishop and flattered, and a gift from Bishop Hart was naturally indispensable. He also carefully asked: "The bishop, I don't know who is constructing the villain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case...I will let it be natural when I find out You know." Hart later said: "This time the big man in the church is coming, maybe he will want to see the situation of the Knights of the Church in the new parish. I will find a way to arrange for you to go to work. I don't need to talk about it. There is also your own preparation work, so be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence of the bishop seems useless and let Rogge The heart is raised. Activities with the great figures of the church, but you can be seen through your identity at any time! Is Hart a victim or a cultivation? But after thinking about it, as long as you can mix this time, hiding in the bright church in the future is the best amulet. Forgive me, no one will find any trouble. It is someone who has his or her identity in the future, but also has to consider whether it is not. After all, it is about the face of the big man in the church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let a Necromancer mix into the church, and it is estimated that the Pope will not go to heaven after his face is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asks the bishop to arrange it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot Bishop haha ​​a smile, you are really very discouraged! You must know that this time, but there is strength to not lose to Austria Philok's sacred knight! But of course, I won't arrange for him to go, and I don't have that interest if I want to come. If I don't gamble, how can I make a fortune? Haha!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, thank you Bishop! ! Rogge was not too scared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart patted Rogge’s shoulder, meaning profoundly: "Do it well!" "Then the meaning of the drop-off was revealed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Hart's house, after the wind blows, Rogge immediately slammed a cold war. The cold sweat has already soaked a few heavy clothes. The fat man cursed a few words, and made up his mind to send a few gifts to Burke and Hart. If you didn’t know how to advance and retreat, don’t forget to donate the church... ... Of course, who said that donating to the bishop is not donated to the church?... Otherwise, the letter is estimated not to be seen by himself, but directly on the trial table of the religious trial.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qing Ben Jia, who is a thief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly remembered these two words from the East "I don't want to be a Necromancer!" Can this blame me? "The fat man grievances, but this is the end of the matter, can only find a way to go around. The road to power is not flat, Rogge, this anti-inflammatory wizard is certainly not easy. Fat man sighed, so go, really do not know When and how can you realize your dream of happiness!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep and wake up naturally, count the money to hand cramps.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger tightened his clothes and went straight to the 'Helen' hotel. The fat man was shocked tonight and needed to find a gentle and pleasant girl to comfort his sensitive and fragile heart.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night slowly deepened, and the *** of every household was extinguished one by one. The "Night Return" hotel was still warm and ***.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two drunken guests slept on the table, Lilys was cleaning the table with two waitresses, it was time to close the door.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door was suddenly pushed open. A cold wind blew into the lobby, the two sleeping guests Awkward, reluctantly woke up, they cursed in a low voice, staring at the blind eyes, want to see who disturbed their good dreams.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The people who came in took off their hats, and the long chestnuts fell down like a waterfall. The delicate face was so pulsating in the lobby that the heart was moving. The drunken guests stared at them in obscurity. When you came, there was a little disappointment. The present is a man’s costume. However, the expression of another person is even more unbearable. Obviously his hobbies are special. Although they are fascinated, they can’t endure. Say two words of teasing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith greeted her and smiled: "Sir, we are already closing." If you want to stay in the store, there is still an empty room, but there is nothing to eat, only bread and salted ham. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man raised his head and looked at Lilith intently, and his mouth slowly smiled. Lilith saw his face. The small mouth was slightly open, and she sighed softly. Then she could not stand the glaring eyes of the coming, and her face was red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith exclaimed and struggled desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guests looked at each other and stood up and said coldly: "We are the people of the Knights of the Wolf, and they are protected by the orders of the head of the group." Here. If you don't want to get into trouble, it's better to get out of the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come and listen, come back and laugh at any trouble, I will naturally go with my dear My brother said. You still have to sleep a little longer for these two wastes! "When it was said, the figure swayed and suddenly disappeared in front of the two.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guests were just taken aback and the back neck was hit hard. Fainted on the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei held Lilith in his arms like a hoop. He stunned the two in the store. The maid, holding Liliths, went upstairs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liliths struggled desperately, her hands were caught by Andre, and she was desperate Kicking on the ground. Andrei only wants to tickle him, laughing and watching Lilith.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is changed, the handsome is close to the demon Andre’s smile is fascinating to 10,000 girls, at least fascinated by 8,000. When Lilith first saw Andre’s appearance, she also had some heartbeats and hot faces. But now she’s close at hand, she only thinks this Smile can't tell the evil and the inferior.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liliths bites her teeth. The girl looks beautiful, that is, her teeth are also cute. Andre is more and more happy. ,flash I kissed Lily's little mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith is very sweet, but her character is very staunch. She was kissed, she First, I was shocked, and then my face was flushed, slightly bowed, and shy. Although the girl loved this scene Andre had seen it countless times, Lilith still made him feel. Not to mention the girl's body elasticity. Amazing, the chest that is rushing out is tightly pressed against his chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not help but conceal Rogge’s good fortune, he could find such a People.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing Lilith’s shy look, Andrea’s eyes were pregnant and smiled slowly.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the lips meet, Andre suddenly flashes in front of him! Fortunately, his martial arts is amazing, his head is eager to lean back! When the sound is soft, Lilith’s two rows of white The teeth bit his empty cheeks, only biting a little girl. The girl hated the head and slammed Andre’s The silk is long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes come suddenly, Lilith, who seems to have moved at the last moment, suddenly became obsessed with biting down Andre’s two pieces of meat. Andrei was still stunned for a moment. He took a moment and suddenly laughed and looked at the hateful Lilith: "The temper is really strong!" I just like some aristocratic ladies like you, I have long seen them are not pleasing to the eye! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you? Do you think that martial arts is taller than others, your face is more delicate, and it is the son of a big man. Do women in the world must like you? You said that others are idiots, I think you are also an idiot! I didn't bite a piece of meat from your pretty face. It's really lucky! Lilith retorted her lips.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of the girl is obviously far from Andre’s surprise, especially the ironic tone that hurts his self-esteem.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiles secretly, do you say that I need you to like me? I am totally uncomfortable this time!" said, Andre Freed up the right hand, unscrupulously stroking from Lilith's chest, where the tiny palms passed, Lilith's clothes were like a thousand years, and quickly decayed into a fly ash. Lilith exclaimed, and the two dazzling fleshy groups jumped out lightly, and the two red cherries kept vibrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre sighed and held one hand as soon as he raised his hand, but he could not fully grasp the softness of this group with one palm. Lilith slammed into Andre's face, but it seemed to hit a stone, and she felt dizzy. When she was not awake, she felt that his other cold, cold hand did not know when to bypass the beautiful arc of his hips and went deep into the bottom of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith shouted, desperately ** legs, but only made Andre more excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Andrei had already taken the girl to the door of the second floor. He kicked open a door and walked in. With his martial arts, he naturally knows if there are any people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre embraced her arms and stared at her leisurely. She couldn’t help but sweep around in her parts. She couldn’t help but admire: "It’s a perfect body! Rogge’s stupid pig actually puts you away. Oh, it’s a pity! Oh, let me comfort you. Don’t call it, now the voice of this room can’t be heard outside.” After a pause, he said proudly: “It’s just people who can hear, who else? Dare to be a good thing for you, a civilian woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith heard the name of Rogge and suddenly calmed down. She jumped out of bed and stood in front of Andre, almost with his nose to the tip of the nose, word by word: "You didn't dare to look for him, only courage to bully me!" Lightly patted Andre's face, softly said: "Look at your beautiful face, are you really a man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre Furious, he really can't do anything about Rogge, but Lilith is different! Playing a civilian woman, what can be a big deal for this big aristocrat? He pushed Lilith on the bed and smiled. "I am not a man. I will let you know in a moment. Don't worry, the night is still growing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; On the empty street, Rogge hurriedly walked. Suddenly he felt a sense of uneasiness in his heart and looked at the direction of the 'Night Return' hotel. Then he shook his head again, thinking that David’s men were watching there from time to time, and no one dared to make trouble there. He turned in the direction and went home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This useless scum! ... will bully a woman's pig! Lilith's hands were tied to the bed, her face flushed, and her body kept twitching.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre sat on the edge of the bed and teased skillfully. Her body. "Look, what is this? What are these slippery things? You are also very debauchery! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith replied: "If I smoke you a whip, you can not call, but still feel pain." So, you are also a pig with no courage! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre said leisurely: "You also know that today these things can be said because of that Rogge." If it weren't for him, you wouldn't lie here and let me play with it. If you hate you, hate him! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was bitten by a dog and didn't hate dogs. Do you want to hate the dog?" You are an idiot! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre added a lot of effort and smiled: "Look, you are his person, but he can't protect you." Don't you hate him? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love him!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it seems that he does not love you. He didn't look for you, and didn't want to take you home! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith's eyes began to have a little sparkle, she said loudly: "I don't care, I love him!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know how many women he has? He is going to marry a daughter of the Grand Duke, how can he see you as a civilian? If he looks at you, he will pick you up early. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith couldn't help but finally cried out. She still shouted: "I don't care about him!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know how many people he has harmed? Do you know how many bad things he has not done yet? He just took a fancy to your body! You are a prostitute who is not spending money for him! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what kind of person he is!" No matter how many women he has, but I... I still love him! I have no way! Hey! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith suddenly yelled at Andre: "You big nobles!" Just know how to use marriage as a tool! Also know what is love! You are all a group of pigs who only know the power! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre’s face suddenly dimmed. He was silent for a moment, gently said: "Marriage is a tool, but love... I know no more than You are less. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently smashed the rope bound by Lilith's hand. The girl stayed for a moment, but immediately eased her mind and hid to the corner of the bed. After a bed of quilts blocked my body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith looked at him with vigilance. She couldn’t understand what happened to this person, but anyway It’s always good to escape from the clutches. The girl’s hand is extremely light and light, holding a two-inch long hard object sewn in the quilt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
