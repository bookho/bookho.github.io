Around her body, a silver magical array is slowly moving, unable to produce a silver mist, neutralizing the thick blood of the wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the war, the wind butterfly, completely controlled by bloodthirsty and killing, killed more than half of the Druid warriors, and the more life harvested Her strength is stronger, but it becomes more and more difficult to control herself. This is the power of the dark curse. If there is enough time and killing, this curse can completely create a god of death walking in the mortal world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the strong people of all races will obviously not tolerate a completely out-of-control killing machine. It is that all kinds of powerful creatures with higher intelligence will not sit and watch such a god of death, which regards all life as an enemy, grow and grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the Dark Curse, the curse attached to the Soul Dagger is indeed a level worse, so it is completely suppressed and dispelled by the power of the Dark Curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of Rogge couldn’t be such a powerful curse at all, but the Mozu is the master of dark magic, the black crystal left by Elysses. Not only does it document the way to cast a dark curse directly with magic, but it also explains in detail the principles of the Dark Curse and the system that supports the continued operation of the entire curse. In a sense, the powerful dark magic left by Elysses may not be as valuable as the principles of these magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magic of Elysses, of course, you can use no external force to cast a dark curse, but Rogge does not have this strength. Fortunately, he also has some knowledge of the undead magic of the Lich Ella. In addition, Fu Luoya modulates the powerful magical pharmacy aid, which is based on the consumption of a large amount of rare magic materials, in the form of magical coat of arms, the difficulty of casting the dark curse is successfully reduced to the level of the seventh-order magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price is the consumption of a lot of magic material. This is exactly the theoretical perfect reproduction of the magic equivalent of gold coins proposed by Fiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After every kill, the butterfly will fall into a sleep. When she woke up, it was possible to be controlled by the power of cursing. At this time, Rogge will rely on the soul contract with the wind butterfly. Work with her to suppress the power of the curse and restore the clarity of the butterfly. But what makes Rogge strange is. There is a new force in the body of the wind butterfly against the dark curse. It is because of this power that the wind butterfly successfully escaped the curse of many times. Otherwise, the magic of Rogge is very It is difficult to suppress the curse of the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge once asked the wind butterfly not to kill, but she could not control the killing. Later, this request was changed to not kill too many people, but every time I saw Druid. The wind butterfly will almost completely harvest the life of madness, completely ignoring the possible consequences. In her words, hunting as many Druids as possible is the only meaning of her existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the wind butterfly sleeping in the blood, Rogge suddenly remembered her first encounter, remembering the moment when the helmet was taken off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the elf with the great white tiger was still simple, kind, proud and with a little innocence. She was able to succumb to Rogge's shameless demands in order to save the lives of the two giants. She even planned to sacrifice her life and die with Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later, the butterfly, quietly sleeping in the blood mist, although the face is still as beautiful as ever. But what about her heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed quietly. If it weren't for his appearance, the wind butterfly would still be so proud, simple and happy, even if the entire elf would slowly die out in the Central Mountain Range, then what? She is just an ordinary elf woman, why bother to worry about the millennium? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge feels more and more that God makes it true whether it is true or not. It’s just a little trick in the river of destiny. Since coming to the north, as his status and strength have improved, his horizons have become more and more open, and all kinds of strong people have begun to appear one by one. In fact, how should these strong people live, how can they live now? Except for a few directly related to him, Rogge's appearance did not affect them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he is now in power, the magic is progressing fast. But in the eyes of these long-established powerhouses. The fat man is still a clown. He has never overestimated his ability. If the future rise and fall of the elves is pinned on him. That is pure nonsense. If the elf's revival depends on one person, then such a race should have been destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly has some intentions. He is eager to win power, only thinking that one day he can defeat the bright church. But if that day really came... He suddenly felt an empty, unspeakable uncomfortable feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed. Now that he has been riding a tiger, there are too many enemies in front to be knocked down, and countless people are watching at the back. If you don't move forward, then his fate is to bring down the latecomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going against the water, if you don’t advance, you will retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sneaked out of the room and told the Elf Guardian to look after the wind butterfly. He went to the eye of wisdom to supervise the progress of the Holy Baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of Wisdom The sacred and solemn main hall is now a big market, noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the open space next to the main hall, dozens of tents have been set up for parents living in the distance and to provide food for these distant people. . As for those nobles or rich people, they will naturally find a decent hotel to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of baby girls have now been handed to the eyes of wisdom. The Holy Child is the god of the goddess, so the church has attached great importance to the following. The houses on the street behind the main hall were requisitioned to temporarily house these girls. Fortunately, the eye of wisdom has reached hundreds of thousands of people, and there are enough people to take care of these baby girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked by and accompanied by Mora. More than 20 baby girls are placed in each room, and each baby girl has a nameplate in the neck. The above information about the parents is written to prevent confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow is the goddess personally selected the date of the Virgin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who want to rely on their daughters to climb up and have a little way, all hurry to fight this last day, trying to make their daughters a little more goddess through some channels. Selected opportunity. It is said that the front row of the ritual closest to the altar of the altar has been fired more than a hundred gold coins, although close to the altar does not necessarily mean that the goddess will pay more attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all things that Rogge knows. However, he not only did not mind, but even secretly supported the underground activities of the auction ceremony location, and more or less made a small fortune. The philosopher once said. Living in the attic of the neighboring water, you can see the moon in the water first. Secular people. Most people share this heart, and the gold coins are spent, and they feel that they have tried their best. As for whether this move is really useful, few people are willing to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking through a dozen rooms, looking at the gallery that still looks like there is no end, Rogge is finally impatient, can’t help but ask "How many baby girls are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora recalled. Wen Wei said: "The total number is 3,086. But tomorrow, when the ceremony is held, there will be baby girls being sent one after another."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge nodded, satisfied with the authenticity: "It has been a lot. You take care of them, I will go back first." As he said, Rogge walked outside the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora still sounds warm but without emotion: "The goddess's baby will receive the best care...ah!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sign of a shiny, delicate brown bootie on the outside of the door, on the way forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was caught off guard and slammed on this boot and fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden change. Rogge is still in danger. He sighed low, and the whole body appeared a faint silver light, so he kept the forward-looking posture in the air! Then the fat man's body suddenly turned amazemently a meter, while a black flame ball screamed to the sneak attacker! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown boots suddenly retracted, and then fell from the air, just let the devil flame ball. Stepping on the fat buttocks, Rogge fell heavily on the ground, as if he had known that he was going to pan in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's mantra was eager and fast, and the powerful force could not be poured out from her. In terms of casting speed, it was much faster than the ordinary mage. It seems that this is one of her abilities as a theologian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sneak attacker stepped on Rogge. The other fiber volley caught it. A strong force made Mora fly over. Mora had already read more than half of the spells and suddenly had no sound. It turned out that her little mouth had been firmly sealed by the sneak attacker's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora struggled desperately. But the sneak attacker is very powerful both in hand and tongue, and it is not what she can resist. Mora was ashamed and panicked. For a moment, she only noticed the eyes of the sneak attacker, just like the bottomless pool of water...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora In desperation, what gods have forgotten a clean, she only took a bite to bite the tongue that is not evil. However, her silver teeth are so divided, why not the unscrupulous tongue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge heard a cry from his feet: "Annie, don't mess around! Mora is not something you can bully."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak attacker is the long-lost Androni, she smiled and let go of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's face is red, shameful and angry. When she struggled, she caught Androni’s chest. Then she took a closer look and found her daughter. She has never encountered such a strange thing, and she is in a mess, and she does not know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s boots were loose, and Rogge stood in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked up and down Androni, nowhere in an inch, especially her chest and legs. Androni showed him more and more uncomfortable, only to feel that the place swept by Rogge was hot and unspeakable. In the fat of the fat, Androni suddenly felt like he was not wearing clothes at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, she is as as upset as Mora. With a wave of hand, Androni covered the eyes of Rogge and said: "Dead fat! Still dare to look around! Believe it or not, I will beat you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She threatened to threaten the voice, and her face was white. The slender hand was recovered as a bite by a poisonous snake. Not only that, but the whole person subconsciously slipped back a few meters in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled smugly, reached out and rubbed his lips, smelled under the nose and said: "Your hand is still so sweet!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was so angry that he suddenly rushed to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a pass, her body suddenly slammed! It turned out that Rogge did not know when a transparent magic barrier had been laid between the two. Androni’s body flashed away. Rogge's magical barrier was easily broken by her, and a hand was quickly bolted to Rogge's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is totally unresponsive this time. Allowed Androni to buckle his throat. To be honest, Androni’s hand is cold and greasy. If it’s not too big for her hand, it’s really enjoyable to be caught by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, it seems that you have entered the sanctuary! But the level is still a little worse, you have to continue practicing. How can you be angry when you are excited?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora was amazed. She never imagined that this fascinating and eccentric woman was already a sanctuary, and she was still young! What surprised her even more was that Rogge, who always felt that he had nothing to do, could still teach Androni seriously. And Androni actually listened seriously! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, Mora suddenly felt the world chaos, and she involuntarily began to secretly pray to the goddess. The prayer was just halfway through, and Androni suddenly glanced at her. The smile that looked like a smile made Mora feel a panic, and immediately forgot the second half of the prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s eyes fell on Rogge’s face again. The fat man’s smirk made her hate her teeth. Her hand tightened and completely ruined Rogge's throat. But the fat man did not care, and stopped breathing completely. In terms of his physique, it is not a matter of breathing for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly took out a piece of paper from his arms. Looking at Rogge with a smile, he said: "Can you explain this, what is this wanted order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder was very ridiculous, saying that Androni had robbed the purchasers of the Grand Duke, robbed a few of the money bought, and injured several servants who would not have martial arts. Aside from these wretched charges, the general order condemned Androni as insulting the reputation of Prince Rogge, so the reward of live capture was 30,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "You have disappeared for so long, and there is no audio at all, so I thought about this. This is not to find out for you. Haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted. The left hand was loose, and a white hand was spread out in front of Rogge: "Do you want me to stay? Easy! But since you have made a wanted order, now I have brought myself, so... 30,000 gold coins Come! A gold coin can't be less! Dead fat man, this time you want to play with me! Let's take the money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, round The face to Rogge has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Androni has been sitting in the high back chair of Rogge in the Grand Duchy, a pair of long legs unceremoniously resting on the magnificent On the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She right-handedly flipped through the file on the Rogge desk, and the white left hand was spread out in front of Rogge, meaning it was very clear: take the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog stood on one side and whispered in a low voice: "Miss, what do you want so much money? What do you want, just let me say nothing?" "He said, staring at Androni's legs, the luscious heart beats unstoppably." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni shook the file in his hand and said: "The money is of course useful! Eat, live, play, what kind of money? Can you let? I can see that the equipment is not worth tens of thousands of gold coins. You see, this document is very clear, a hundred people cavalry units need to spend 10,000 gold coins, hehe, this Hundreds of cavalry are not enough for me to kill in one day. Instead of spending money on them, you might as well give it to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue snorted two times, "Annie, actually, with your ability, want to get some money... Isn't that easy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said what he meant. Naturally, it is said that with the strength of Androni, whether it is stealing or grabbing, you can make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at Rogge strangely and said: "Dead fat, I really didn't think you were so stingy! You are now the head of a country. Even if you are so embarrassed, then I will go back to the South. No matter whether you open a mouth to your father or brother, tens of thousands of gold coins always have to come. But this is fine. I finally know I don’t even have tens of thousands of gold coins in your heart.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she stopped, she wanted to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stopped Androni, who was about to leave, and smiled bitterly: "Annie, I am not reluctant to give these gold coins, but I have no money at all. There have been too many things in a while. The treasury of the Principality has long been empty. The 30,000 gold coins are nothing in your eyes, but the money is enough for the entire Dresden institution to operate for three months! Anne, you have What needs to be said, if you really need money, I can find a way for you. But... I am not afraid of your jokes, and now I really have no money to squander you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at Rogge with a clear gaze and said: "Rogge, I am going to any country for a year now, nothing else. The monarch is at least one. The annual meeting will take out one hundred and twenty thousand gold coins. So I don’t think that I will take you much money. In fact, you are right. The money is nothing to me. But why should I be plain and unreasonable? Are you selling your life? You are now more powerful and strong, whether it is a silver dragon or a city of clouds. Or is it the bright church that you want to deal with, which one is not a strong man? Even if I already have the power of the sanctuary, I still can't say that I can absolutely protect myself. What can you give me for paying so much?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t say that there is any reason for Androni to sell for him. All along, Androni has done a lot for him, even if Androni can not care about Rogge's ingenuity and get her body, he has not given anything to Androni. There is no money or equipment. If you say feelings, they don’t seem to have any feelings between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said again: "Rogge, you are not looking at me, just the sword in my hands. Or you think I am long I have to go through it, and I am still interested in it. But I put it bluntly. What you want to use most is the power of the sanctuary I have. If one day I lose the power of the sanctuary, or if you have a stronger person around you, How would you treat me? You will value me like you do now? Don't be kidding. Since we are just using each other's relationship, I certainly have to pay the price. This is just to remind you, don't think that only the world is smart. , always able to use others without any benefit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Androni's face changed, then returned to normal, and snorted: "If you want to take advantage of it, you may wish to try it. If I interrupt you before I interrupt you several ribs Touching it, I will take care of you in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ignored her fierce gaze and kept the upper body clothes off. He picked up a small, inconspicuous fine scale, and handed it to Androni: "This breastplate, you have been helping me for three years. How do you see it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took over the breastplate, looking left and right, except that the gray rushing seems to have been buried underground for hundreds of years, I can’t see what this breastplate has. Surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What good thing is this, is it worth wearing? Well, you will not have guessed that I am going to pay, so I will temporarily change it. Piece of breastplate to lie to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted, a small group of blue awns on the fingertips of his right index finger, point to the breastplate. Her power of this finger is comparable to a sword of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the breastplate made a muffled sound, but it was unharmed. Androni was able to pierce the whole body of a steel arm, even a little dust attached to the fine scales did not scrape down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was shocked, this time the entire right hand wrapped in the blue mans, slammed to the breastplate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it still failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni carefully observed this breastplate. The breastplate is still composed of tiny pieces of gray fluttering. It looks like it is covered with dust. No matter how she looks at it, she can't see why this breastplate can have such a terrible defense. Although it seems that the breastplate does not have the ability to defend magic, but the defense alone is enough to be among the artifacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your life-saving thing? Are you willing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles lightly. Road: "I have already given you, can I still come back again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a magician, although a little different. This breastplate Is it important to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "I am not as vulnerable as a normal magician. It is not so easy for others to kill me. You too I know that my body is special. But you have always been fighting melee, this breastplate is more important to wear on you. Besides the artifact, I think there is basically no magic weapon to break this breastplate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly smiled and said: "Dead fat man. You pretend to be generous, I want to convince me. Let me be moved!" Then I will give you back the breastplate? Hey, since you take care of me so much, of course I can’t but you are kind, I will accept this breastplate!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The fat man laughed and didn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said again: "But this is not enough! Think about it, you pay for the death class to protect you." Dragon gun, I want to tie me with a breastplate for three years? Although I am worse than the Death Class. I can't say how you can send me like this."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his mouth and said: "But the dragon gun is not mine. Please come to the death class, that is the elders of Hughes. What else do you want? I can There is no artifact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, you can help me a little more." Androni said: "I like Moura very much." "You help me get started, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hurriedly looked around and whispered: "Absolutely not! She is the eye of wisdom." Virgin! I have seen the arrival of O'Reilly in my own eyes, knowing. If you angered a god, it is not a trivial matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andro Nie’s eyes lit up, Close to Rogge, he lowered his voice and said: "I heard that...Ou Ruehe chose the baby, the real purpose is to come to this world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge is not surprised that she can know such secret news. Any sacred strongman who is willing to put down the shelf will be a very difficult to watch out for eavesdroppers and voyeurs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni's eyes are getting brighter. She bit her lower lip, and she was awkward at the moment: "If O'Reilly is on a baby girl, it must be very weak at first. Dead fat, if... If you can help me get O'Brien to get started, Don't say that it will help you for three years, that is, you will be able to send you for a lifetime!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was shocked, and he could still instinctively remain in the heart of O'Reilly. He’s fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually want to play a god's idea? Are you crazy? Annie, you are just entering the sanctuary, your strength is not at all Compared with the power shown by Reich! You have to anger her and kill us all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is dissatisfied Rogge glanced. Quietly said: "She is so powerful. It will definitely be limited to the baby's body just after the fall, and it will not exert much power. I just want to seize this opportunity to approach her. You don't have to pay anything, afraid to be like that. What do you do? You just have to help me observe how the power situation is after her coming. Let's discuss it again when we are young."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time her voice has been The pressure was extremely low, and the small mouth was almost attached to Rogge's ear: "... If this is done, what do you want me to do in the future, how can I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge is heart-warming, but on the other hand, he is also stunned by Auger Reich's Yu Wei, not afraid to come. He set his mind and began to carefully consider the pros and cons of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni dropped the rogue, and went away. Her mouth has an irrepressible smile, just thinking: "Dead wind, I see how you can escape this time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death World . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly moved to stop the windy moon that was going to go across the air, saying: "Fengyue, where do you want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out!" The wind is cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina chuckled and said: "Do you want to teach the coordinates that dare to disrespect you? But I think she is very interesting! Fengyue, you really It’s very good to pick the coordinates, each one is so different. Of course, this one is even more special. How many times have you escaped?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The hand of Fengyue suddenly waved, and the bone dragon who was concentrating on listening to it screamed, and was thrown to the far-reaching sky by an invisible force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon seem to have an invisible wind blowing, her black hair and gray robe are fluttering: "Weina! Let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina ignores the threat of the wind and the moon, just smiles: "All in all, I won't let you hurt this coordinate. It's so rare to have such a small personality. Ah! As for how many times you have escaped, it’s okay if you don’t want to say it. I will know the memory in the source of God. Hey, Fengyue, are you improving your strength? Are you angry or shy? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue raised his right hand and punched Wei Na! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crisp laughter of Wella, an earth-shattering war broke out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory uses various terrains to hide from the Tibetan area and approach the center of a terrible storm in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can't hear anything so far, it must be closer to something. Intuition has told it that this time it is very likely to hear something. Bone Dragon knows that there is a famous saying in that world, curiosity will kill a cat.

Looking back, I couldn't help but whispered: "Annie! How could it be you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled and said: "Why can't it be me?" I just got a good thing for you.
