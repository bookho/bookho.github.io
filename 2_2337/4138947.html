So when Rogge was standing in the middle of the underground fortress, the urgency letter of the Bauhinia Butterfly had just been issued. After the goshawk watching the newspaper went to the sky, the Bauhinia butterfly kept himself alone in the room and stayed alone for one night. No one saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the early hours, the Bauhinia butterfly came out. She changed her armor and completely covered her delicate face with a full-faced helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside her door, is standing tall swordsman. Ett had a layer of frost on his gorgeous armor and seemed to have waited for her for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly glanced at the magical swordsman who was full of melancholy and anticipation in his eyes, with a feeling of no emotion: "Come with me, we must Prepare early, before the arrival of the orcs, certainly can't wait for the return of Rogge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is dry and hoarse, listening to Etter’s heart pain. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, all the military and political leaders of the Ayre Principality gathered in the Grand Duke, and everyone’s face was worried. They already knew the orc army’s pressure in the Central Mountain Range. Message. However, although they are worried, they are not confused. Since Rogge took power, he has done a lot of cleansing of the bureaucracy of the entire Ayre Principality. Although this small place does not promote too many talents, compared with those who have taken power in the Principality, the officials are now much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is excited is the aunt. She has recovered from the pain of losing her son, and now she is only looking for new stimuli. I heard the orcs coming. The first thing she thought of was the scene where the corpse was everywhere and the blood flowed into the river, so she smiled sweetly and her face was full of eye-catching colors. I think that thousands of warriors will cling to the swords that she has supervised, and rush to the tall orcs, and then the screams and the bloody scenes of the sky, and Auntie is too excited to make herself. Only this kind of excitement can stimulate her to be ashamed. Therefore, I received a notice from the Bauhinia Butterfly. She immediately got busy late at night, until the early hours of the morning. A well-prepared plan has been drawn up, and the weapons and equipment stored in the public can be sent to the soldiers in the fastest speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is ready to take a day off, once again mobilizing the already weak state power of the Ayre Principality, arming each soldier to the teeth, and then sending them front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We still have 40,000 troops, although they are not trained and equipped enough to fight the orcs." The Bauhinia butterfly looks around for a week and is on the map. . Dao: "You, our 20,000-strong army that went deep into the Central Mountain Range to clear the orcs has been wiped out. From the information brought back, we are now unable to resist the orc's attack, unless we wait for Rogge to bring back the reinforcements. And our food has already been At the end of the day, I was unable to support large-scale operations. Therefore, I will deploy troops in these three places, and I will not be able to keep them and withdraw the residents of the west to the east."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in the room who immediately notice that the Bauhinia butterfly is extremely poisonous. The strength of the Principality of Iare. It is impossible to compete with so many orcs. But she shrinks the line of defense and uses limited military power to defend the strong fortress, which can last for a while. And she gave up the passage to the north. The unobstructed orcs can take the road to the territory of the Principality of Layton in just two days. The meaning of the Bauhinia butterfly is to bring the water to the north, and drag the water to the Principality of Layton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the underground fortress where the elves are stationed. Rogge and Hughes circled a water plate carved in amethyst to discuss the situation today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will immediately inform the Bauhinia Butterfly to prepare her for defense. However, the 40,000 troops in the Principality certainly cannot count on it, even if they catch it, they will play it. Not much effect. The elves here..." Rogge frowned. "It seems that there are more than 10,000 battles. I want to deal with nearly 200,000 orcs who are chasing afterwards. I am afraid it is harder."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water tray in front of the fat man also clearly shows the terrain of the underground fortress hundreds of kilometers. In the position of the city of the gods, there are large chunks of thick green aggregates at the moment, which looks like a large floating algae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hius looked at the water tray. Dao: "It’s definitely not enough to compete with the orcs. Rogge. Do you remember to hold the bloody double flag and slaughter all the way to the battle of Tiffany?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes nodded: "Of course! You certainly don't want the elves to have any more damage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the more than 100,000 elves that have been degraded in the Green Sea battle, The fat heart is so painless. In his heart, all the elves have long been regarded as their own private property. Although the detained elf in the Green Sea stubbornly refused his leadership, Rogge had no doubt that one day he would be able to earn all the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! I will go to the windy month!" The fat man made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If she refuses?" Hughes asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If she doesn't, oh! Then I will... I will..." The fat man obviously has some guilty conscience, and after ‘I am’, there is no following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked at the smiling Xius, and snorted heavily, indicating that he is not afraid of the wind, and then said: "Even if you have gathered enough Strong, we have to think of other ways. Well, this underground fortress is surrounded by mountains, the fortress is ventilated smoothly, not afraid of smoke, there is enough groundwater and food, I can gather in the orcs After that, put a big fire. Now we have more time in the day, enough to prepare. Of course, the poison is also going to be under, but I don’t know what kind of poison the orcs are afraid of. No matter how much, we poison There are still some reserves. First, the elf shooters who came to the Green Sea sent 20 poison arrows each. Then nearly 200,000 orcs are a little hard to kill..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat is sinking, Hughes suddenly said: "Not 200,000. It is about 150,000. You see, I don't know why, the number of orcs seems to be a lot less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge probe at first glance, sure enough, Amethyst water tray City oracle land position, the representative of the green orcs suddenly empty a chunk out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" asked Rogge frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, but it's a good thing. It's not the time to take the reason." Hughes shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stared at Hughes and slowly asked: "Old guy. This won't be what you did again?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of Hilo, this is not what I did!" Hughes looked solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! In the name of Hilo...well!" Rogge was not entangled in this issue, just said: "Let's think again, what else? The way to keep these orcs forever here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled a little and said: "It is a good idea to use poison, but the orcs' physical resistance to poison The sex is very high, and we have a limited number of poisons. We can't kill too many orcs. I think of a way, but I don't know if it works. Of course, this matter requires you to go out in person."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it!" Rogge immediately came to the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two people’s secrets, Rogge frowned for a long time and said: “There is some difficulty, but we might as well try it.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have all kinds of ways together, in short, we must leave these damn orcs here! If you let them go. When the winter is over, they have enough food. It’s even harder to deal with. In case they rush into your territory, the loss can be great at that time. I think it’s time for you to ask for help from the wind and the moon. It’s too late to come.” It is said that all of them are in the tone of consideration for Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at Hughes with hatred. Snoring, just ready to call the wind and the moon, the air suddenly added a space door, which took out a squatting figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have no expectation that the space door will open in the air, and when it comes out, it’s just a foot out, only to have an exclamation, and straight to Rogge Fell it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogello stepped back, grabbed her, and hugged her in her arms, smiling: "Mora. Every time you play Is the way so special?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora is freed from Rogge’s arms. Restoring the sacred appearance of the past, he smiled slightly: "Of course not. Just because I am unfortunately a victim of the struggle between the two great beings. So my appearance will become so embarrassing."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora Road: "The great O'Brien knew that the orc dared to invade her country, so he lowered the gods and asked me to help you defend the enemy. I think Miss Androni, Miss Froya and the Death Class. Adults should arrive soon, and the dragons in front of the goddess will come to the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge overjoyed and took a hand to Mora. Mora smiled and took a step back, just letting Rogge hold it. The fat man bowed and looked a little weird. He actually stopped and did not try any indecent Moura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing that was stunned was the Weina, which was hidden in the void. The dragon soul gun in her hand had already risen, and only Rogge moved forward. He would hit Verna's gunpoint himself. However, this fat man actually stopped at the tip of the gun. If it was a coincidence, it would be too clever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s eyebrows wrinkled and meditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her, Gregory’s huge faucet came in and carefully said: “He’s luck is a little better. Hey, just rely on him. I want to avoid the ambush of the most beautiful Wella owner with real ability. I am afraid I have to practice for another thousand years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina immediately released If such a shot can also let Rogge escape, the fat man's ability is also somewhat terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man let go of Mora and clap his hands, and Effie came to him in the same breath. She opened her mouth: "God makes an adult, are you looking for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Rogge to answer, she looked around and frowned: "Do you want to Are you going to bed with me here? There are more people watching!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces around everyone became very weird at once, even Mora could not keep themselves The sacred appearance is secretly snickering. It’s a bit embarrassing to have a fat face. He coughed and covered: "Not this thing. You can help me find some materials. I need these things when I cast spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie Look. It seems that the atmosphere is a bit weird, so I said, "Okay, I will go. If you want to go with me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said nothing When I finished, I was stunned by the fat man and slammed the second half of my sentence. Rogge looked around and saw the fierce light, so everyone turned his face to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Rogge just wanted to say. The corner of his eye suddenly swept to the door of the hall with a figure. He suddenly jumped in his heart and immediately shouted: "Stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person was immediately established. Slowly turned around. He was a servant in his attire, and there was no strength in his body. It turned out to be Constantine. He faintly settled: "What do you have to order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s eyes are getting more and more fierce, he pulls his face to Effie Behind him, instead of pushing forward, he slowly retreated two steps and opened a distance with Constantine. This is the way: "Your sacred power is so pure and powerful, where can I tell you? Now, can you tell me that you are so worried about hiding in the elves, what is the plot?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin was slightly surprised, he did not expect his disguise to be seen by Rogge. He looked at Rogge and said faintly: "I just want to help the elf. If I don't welcome me here, I can leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie Childhood: "His name is Constantine. He has been teaching me holy spells. How do you say him.... Well, he is a good person, just annoying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge said coldly: "He is so powerful, he can never be a nameless person. How can he be idle like this and run to teach you holy spells? He must have another plot. No. This feeling. ...this feeling is very familiar! Let me think about it... Master Constantine! Are you from the Bright Church? How can a big man like you suddenly appear in the Northland thousands of miles away? Also teach a common place Elf girl sacred spell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin said quietly: "I really have no malice. If you don't believe it, then I will leave. Anyway, The teaching of Effie has been taught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to go, is it so easy?" Rogge smiled coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
