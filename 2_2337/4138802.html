			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint morning light is quietly scattered in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-faced warriors of the month have packed up their clothes, just waiting for noon, they have to go to Dresden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the bright sunshine, Rogge came out of the meditation room. After suffering the magic control of the night, Rogge, who is as strong as a violent bear, is slightly tired. Anyway, the fat man has the carriage that represents the peak achievements of the gods in the city. In the car, he can meditate for a day and make up the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, Rogge always felt that something was missing this morning. After thinking about it, he suddenly disappeared from the small ice owl that had always been inseparable from him. Rogge called a few times, but there was no response. He closed his eyes and searched the entire temple of God, but the ice man had no life at all, how could he find it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge screamed again, and suddenly saw two people who had two teas by the lake. How sharp his eyes are, immediately recognizing that it is the Death Class and Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge jumped out of the window, slid through the air, and stood in front of the Shusi and Death class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ban Daren, when did you come back? Our 30-day agreement has been completed, it is not easy!" Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s death class is very old, he looks at the sparkling lake and sighs: "Yes, the agreement has been completed. You are doing very well." Ok...very good, in the past 30 days, Ai Luoote was very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog feels something is wrong, frowning asks:" Where is Ai Luoluote? We should be out right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad leader sighed, and the voice revealed an indescribable old man. He just looked at the lake in front of him quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the past with his eyes, his face changed and he changed her. She...does..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was originally a piece of ice, but now it has melted into the lake. "The death class at this moment is more like an old father than a killer in the dark world: "Ai Luoluote likes this place very much. She smiles and walks into the lake..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog only felt that something was blocked in his chest, frowning: "But... why?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This child is actually dead when I first killed you, but her will made her the icy wind of Yunxiaocheng. Once again, I got a life of just a few dozen days. When the icy heart in her body runs out of power, Ayellot... will become an ice image. She wants to know your life, wants to know the most real you, wants to guard you, wants to watch you quietly, so this thirty-day agreement is her last wish..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Rogge said: "I am a weak Necromancer, but why Not her soul? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class has smiled a bit. This is a dead person. The price of a short life from the wind of ice is the complete demise of the soul!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is silent, he just quietly watching the calm lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to be condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Rogge said faintly: "I will go out after an hour." Then I will go back to God to make the temple go. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effie, holding a lot of clothes, hurried through the corner of the corridor and slammed into the suddenly appearing Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you left yet? Has it passed the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I delayed the time. Effie..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl raised her eyebrows and said, "Do you want it? Okay! Where? I put the clothes down and went over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come here! Then I refuse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger's brow is a command!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Effie The brows also wrinkled: "I still refuse. My martial arts is too bad. Going will only give you trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge whispered Get up: "Follow me! There are enough strong people around me, and you don't need to fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Effie’s stubbornness is still out of reach Rogge’s surprise: “Don’t go! I don’t have the ability to protect myself. Except for the city of gods, your side is not safe.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is Rogge Did not think of it at all. Looking back on the past, he is indeed not safe, and can even be said to be the most dangerous place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog thought for a moment, and touched Effie’s delicate face, so you are here to wait for me to come back!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog went down to the fifth floor, and Fu Luoya rushed out of the room. The little goblin had the artifact lost, so I couldn’t see the luggage when I went out. Being late, that is the instinct of every royal princess.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge, the little fairy smiled: "It's not too late." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria, you still stay in the city of the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small The fairy snorted and asked: "Why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I arrived in Dresden, I would meet with Pompey and go to the emperor to be sealed." Rogge gently stroked Froya’s gold and didn’t know what would be waiting for me in the emperor. It’s really dangerous to think about it, you still stay!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria said: "Don't forget, I am a great magician! At least I can protect myself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog If I sighed something in the emperor, even if I had the protection of ***, class, and Xius, I would not say that I could escape. You still stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya heard the name of the ***, and the body shook a little.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya raised his face and smiled and said, "I am going!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! This is the case! I don't want to be tired." Rogge smashed the ground and then went away without answering Furoya's answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya got angry and angered: "Dead fat, What are you fierce! Waiting for you to come back, I will settle with you again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge’s back disappears, the little goblin suddenly feels a little sour nose After all, this is the first time someone has cared about her safety since Andronie left.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at night, Rogge and his party I finally returned to the Grand Duchy of Dresden.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Rogge spent the same time dealing with the affairs of the Principality. Already on the right track, under the control of Auntie, Hilley and Charlie, everything is in order. Going to Asturfike, at least in the public affairs, Rogge has nothing to worry about.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the days of singing and dancing are always very short.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the next day is not yet bright, Rogge Sitting at the desk, I looked carefully at the report about the military expenses. Suddenly, the magic light in the room suddenly disappeared, and a crystal statue in front of him was blown up! The murderous murder was not The house infiltrated into the room, although the murderousness was fleeting, but the incomparable majesty contained in it still surprised Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of murder is actually There is still a distance from the Grand Duchy. This murderousness is from the government of the state book Shanglai.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge, Hughes and Death Class have already Standing in the village of Hilary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, if the big Hilary is dead, it will be dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid and the servants are actually doing their part. Just at the last moment, they were still cleaning the courtyard and cooking water. But at this moment, everyone fell to the same place, just like falling into a dream. But everyone's look is very peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilay also fell in the bedroom, his clothes only wore half. Two maids who seemed to be serving him were also falling around his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of people in the entire government of the Hiley House were killed by the god of death at the same time!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, Hughes and the Death Class have a look at each other, can have this kind of killing means, and can also inform the strongmen who come to them with murderousness. The whole big 6 is also very few, invariably, a name Since their hearts slowly emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of Nicholas’s death to hundreds of guests on the same day seems to be Rogge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s Nicholas right!" The Death Class carefully examined the body of Hilley and made a slogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s brow wrinkled this is a demonstration. However, why did Nicholas kill Hilley now? When I was in the City of God, he had too many opportunities to get started. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes slowly said: "According to my old man, this is to force you to hand over the silver dragon egg." According to this estimation, his next goal should be Mrs. Auntie and your son. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My son? Rogge first gave a slight glimpse, and then he was shocked: "He wants to lead us out of the Great Government, and then sneak in!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man is secretly sneer: "Very good, Nicholas, I have to see if you can get it cheap!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people already know that Nicholas’s tiger is out of the mountain, but they are all old and slick characters. No one is rushing back to the Grand Duke. Anyway, even if they are rushing back. It’s too late. In the past, the arrogant and direct silver miracle actually used it. It’s really unexpected. So this strategy is simple, but it still succeeds in bringing the people out of the Grand Duchy. And Nicholas’s shot is very accurate, old. The government of Hilley and the financially-friendly auntie are now the two pillars of Rogge's handling of public affairs. Losing Hilley, the attack on Rogge is indeed not small.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes coughed and reminded: "Rogge, the little son now must have fallen into the hands of Nicholas. What are you going to do?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger found a small piece of silver-sized flakes in his arms, which were etched with dense magic symbols, each of which was cast with gold. Juice. This round piece is cut from the silver dragon eggshell and is specially used to strengthen the unique atmosphere of the silver dragon with a magical array, and it can last forever.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon was solidified into an elf on the same day, and it was seriously injured. But everyone knows that Nicholas will never stop here, and when his injury recovers, he will inevitably retaliate. Elf Nicholas is still tyrannical, but it is not like In the form of the silver dragon, Rogge had almost no resistance. However, Nicholas had vowed to kill all the people related to Rogge, so Rogge was worried that he would start with the people around him. The film is magically processed, and the eggshell of the silver dragon will be scattered from time to time. Nicholas protector is eager to cut, and his eyes will be concentrated on Rogge. And Rogge is always strong, and if you fight hard, you will only lose the elf. Nicholas.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge unconsciously throws the eggshell of the dragon egg, sinking and saying: "Ban Daren, what do you think?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class is faintly authentic: "The Elf Nicholas is getting smarter. If you don't get rid of it earlier, if you find the way to crack the seal, we will There is a big problem. As for the child, one is dead and ten can be regenerated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes said: "Although Nicholas is still solidified in the form of the elves, if the adults are not there, it is only because of the three of us that he can't." Master Rogge, do you have news about adults? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a bit, but I don't expect it to be in this battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge walked into the lobby of the Grand Residence, the expressionless Nicholas was sitting in the lobby, and a baby who was only a few months old was floating on his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Rogge unexpected is that the aunt who is wearing a head is also standing a few meters away from Nicholas, like a lioness, staring at the eyes With the silver dragon, do the momentum. Everyone in the lobby knows that there is a magic shack in her sleeve. The magical fluctuations of the cockroaches are very obvious. Even Rogge can’t get rid of it. How could it be that Nicholas could be won? However, for Nicholas, she is totally threat free, and Yinlong’s attention is all on the three people who enter the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas looked at the Rogge three calmly. Although he had nothing to do on the surface, the silvery magic pattern on his cheeks showed that he was in a state of full-spirited alert. Even if he holds Rogge's son, but in the face of the mysterious Xius, the powerful class and the ***, Nicholas is still uncertain that he can successfully escape. But this time, he clearly felt the breath of the silver dragon egg, and could no longer suppress the desire in his heart, and finally took the risk. As for the shameless act of taking a baby as a hostage, will it discredit the silver dragon’s noble honor, and Nicholas has long stopped considering such problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nicholas, you are so bold!" Rogge said coldly: "Kill my men, dare to wait for me. Is it the last time? Is the injury completely good? Or can you restore the dragon shape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas sneered at a human being, if not you use the trick, you can hurt Got me? But now your son is already in my hands. If I want, I can kill all the people in the Grand Dukes immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue Haha A miracle of laughter will kill innocents and hostages, haha! You can kill hundreds of people who have no resistance at all. Silver Dragon is really worthy of the most powerful creature!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas faintly said: "Since Christine Ferrena died, I abandoned the honor and dignity of Silver Dragon. My work has been with Moonlight Dragon City. No relationship. Don't talk nonsense, hand over my child, or I will kill your son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog 嘿嘿一笑月光龙城有有 relationship, this can be It’s not that you say it. What's more, the great silver miracle, do you think I will agree to the deal? Just give me two years, my son and daughter, I can at least give him a seventeen or eight. But what about you? Even if you find a new love, how long does it take for Yinlong to produce an egg? How long does it take to hatch it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas said: "So, you are not going to want your son's life." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't!" Auntie exclaimed and pleaded to Rogge: "Rog, please, don't let him kill the child." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved a hand, a silent enchantment shrouded Auntie, and then a body-fixing technique, let her move in place Then he was not in a hurry: "Respected Nicholas, your offer is actually lower." I want to make a pen transaction with me. If you open the conditions that make me feel good, I will return the silver dragon egg to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas is sinking, Rogge suddenly said: "I really admire your final metamorphosis, the skill of the silver miracle is unfathomable, said Maybe you have done something on this kid! For example, take another baby to pretend to be my child. I need to confirm if this is my son. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas angered: "Humble ugly necromancer, don't insult me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Even if the baby is taken hostage, I can still believe what you are saying?" Rogge sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Rogge’s gesture, the Death Class slowly moved towards the child. Nicholas snorted and let the death class approach. Although he has been solidified into a form of elf, it is more than enough to deal with a death class. He is now fully guarded, only the mysterious Hughes and the *** who do not know when it will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class stopped at two meters from the child and suddenly called: "This child is fake!" He shook his hand and the sword was difficult. Describe the high spine to the child's throat!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas was shocked and said: "What are you doing, how could it be fake!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm in the lobby suddenly started!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas had already handed a hand to the Death Class in a blink of an eye, and defeated this horrible killer. There was already a stream of blood at the corner of the Death Class. But now, the silver demon pattern on Nicholas’s body suddenly dimmed, and he shouted in an alarming way, angered: “The shameless things, you actually "It's poisoned again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare to go one step further, I immediately smashed the silver dragon egg!" Rogge's cold voice immediately made a rush The silver dragon stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat looks at the mad silver dragon, mysteriously laughing at the big silver miracle, you are now not a dragon, but also poisonous, is it? Still escaping? My son can have a big man like you to be buried, it is worth it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas face changed, seeing Xiusi and the death class are all rushing to themselves His hands waved backwards, the silver light shone, the walls behind the lobby suddenly collapsed, and the two women flew into the lobby and fell into the hands of Nicholas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;One is the wind butterfly, the other is the Furoya!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The shameless necromancer, what do you say now!" Nicholas said. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue looked at the past, and the wind butterfly calmly waited for death. She did not expect her position in Rogge’s mind to let him let go of killing Nicholas The opportunity. Fu Luoya seems a little panicked. She does not want to die, but she knows Nicholas' threat to Rogge, will Rogge give her a good time to kill Nicholas?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at them again and categorically said: "Leave people, let me go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas sneered a sneer to believe you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue said coldly: "Well, my son, you can take it away, Leave the two women behind! Let's fight again later. This is the last condition. If you don't agree, then the great silver miracle, in your capacity, is worth two people to bury!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas looked at the expressionless death class and looked at the smiling Hughes. He increasingly felt that Hughes’s smile was not good. The strength of the silver miracle has been greatly reduced, that is, during his heyday, he is also reluctant to face the mysterious Hughes. Although Hughes has never really played a positive role with him, the strength of occasional shots is really insignificant. But every time I looked at Hughes, it seemed to have a glimpse of everything, and Nicholas was happy. This time, if the arrest of Rogge’s son is taken hostage, I hope that I can exchange it for the silver dragon egg. He will never appear next to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, there is still a very difficult *** that has never appeared. But what is certain is that she must be waiting for the best time to attack. This *** has never understood the aesthetics of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this despicable and dirty Necromancer first exchanges the silver dragon egg for his son and then conducts a siege..." Nicholas couldn’t help but think about it. Dark inside is chilly. At that time, he would definitely lose his life in order to take care of the silver dragon egg. Moreover, the toxicity of his body is being made bit by bit. At the moment, it is necessary to cure the poison first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas took the initiative to put the wind butterfly and Froya on the ground, and then slowly exited the lobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shameless necromancer has always been keeping his promise and letting the silver miracle leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver miracle, wind butterfly and Fu Luoya do not know, *** can not come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the solid atmosphere in the lobby melted. Unconsciously, Rogge is already sweaty. The face of the Death Class was slightly pale, and the fight with Nicholas had already caused him to suffer a minor injury. Only Hughes is not damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the banned by Nicholas disappearing, both the wind butterfly and the floya stood up. Froya’s pretty face was pale and apparently frightened. At the moment they looked at Rogge's gaze, but they all had some confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge!" Auntie cried angrily: "Why did you kill my son just now!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie may have just been too nervous and her emotions have been out of control. She struggled from Rogge's arms and screamed: "But why don't you tell him, it's not your son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby suddenly A silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at Auntie with a blank expression, and suddenly waved his hand, five black flames were created out of thin air and flew out of the lobby. The five maid guards standing outside immediately ignited a raging black fire. They screamed and beat, and there was no sound in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog snorted, and the chill in his eyes made Auntie fall into the hail. He stared at the aunt for a while and left silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie couldn’t support it anymore, sitting softly on the ground and sobbing in a low voice. Other people in the lobby felt that it was not appropriate to stay for a long time and they left in a hurry. When Xiusi passed by the aunt, he sighed and whispered: "The little son has nothing to do this time, and the fate must be very difficult in the future. You still have to do something else."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the study of the Grand Duke, Rogge is coming and going in the house. In the corner of the room, Froya stood there with a little uneasiness, and a pair of green eyes secretly smashed Rogge from time to time. Somehow today, the little goblin who has never been afraid of the sky is suddenly afraid of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is silent, his pace seems to never end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya finally couldn’t stand the invisible pressure any more, and said: "Dead fat... Rogge, I did not listen to you and stay in the gods." City. But...but you didn’t give the wind butterfly to you. How can my skills be stronger than the wind butterfly, at least it can be self-protected, and it will never become your burden.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she thought about it again and had to add: "Of course, Nicholas is so powerful, it’s normal for me to beat him..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stopped in front of Froya and frowned at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin is authentic: "I have been here anyway, let me go to the emperor with you." But her green eyes flashed The light shows that she is no longer afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is a little dumbfounding. He knew that even if she was sent back to the city of the gods, the little goblin would surely sneak out with her. In the unlikely event that she meets Nicholas on the road again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not think that Froya is in love with himself and will come and go. This eccentric and stubborn goblin must have its own ideas and reasons. He didn't know the reason, and he knew that the little goblin would never say it. Rogge suddenly angered. The death of Hilley originally made him unprepared. Now, because of the child's affairs, it seems that Auntie can't rely on it. In the future, if the big internal affairs of the Ayre Principality are left to whom? The people around me have their own ideas, and they are all who are really willing to think about it for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog couldn’t help but smile a bit, what did he bring to them? Moreover, everyone has it, and knowing how to coordinate people is the essential skill of the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will take you to the emperor. But remember that you should not be too far away from me. If you must go out, at least with the death class or It’s one of the people in Hughes.” Rogge muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s eyes flashed and asked: “The death class is too scary, and the elders of Hughes are not necessarily available. In case I want to go out, Can you be with ***? Oh, yes, just listen to you, but I have never seen her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge The brow wrinkled again and whispered: "***...very special. Don't think about it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria doesn't have What to say, but her eyes are bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, a soft knock on the door sounded, and then Roger answered, and Auntie pushed the door and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tear marks on her face are still dry, her eyes are red and swollen, obviously she has been crying for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie rushed to Roger like a lioness, staring at him, biting his teeth: "Rogge! I know about this child. I am sorry for you. But... what is this among the nobles? I am doing less for your Principality, can you not let him go? If you look at him, he can send him. Far away, send it to a place you can't see..." Later, Auntie couldn't help but tears, and slammed it in front of Rogge, pleading: "I beg you, Luo. Gee, save my son, you want me to do anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie will stand up in doubt. Rogge gave her a good word and finally let the aunt's heart settle down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the aunt left, the smile on Rogge’s face disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s face was white, and some looked at Rogge with a flinch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sound, a magic ring on the tail of Rogge suddenly smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sneaked out and took Roger’s hand. She is also a master of magic, and feels that Rogge's hand has uploaded a burst of magical fluctuations. But she is practicing the most orthodox magic. She doesn't know how to deal with the situation at hand. She can only hold Rogge's hand tighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical fluctuations in Rogge's body are weak and strong, and the impact is getting stronger and stronger. Later, even Flora is surprised by his surging magic. Leprechaun is very convinced that Rogge is not convinced. He always feels that he is fighting for him several times because the fat man has too many strange functions. The true magic is actually unremarkable. Now that Flora is finally there, even if it is more magical, Rogge is no worse than her. But it is not surprising to think about it. Since the reunion with Rogge in the North, the Leprechaun has never seen him doing nothing, and when he is free, he is practicing magic. Now the magic used by Rogge is no longer in the orthodox magic system. It is even the first level of the magic missile, which is displayed in Rogge's hand and is completely the same as the average magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the magical fluctuations in Rogge’s body finally subsided. He took a sigh of relief, and he was so tired that he had already been soaked by sweat. He gently patted Froya's face and smiled weakly: "I'm fine. Froya, I treat Auntie like that, are you not afraid of me?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiles and doesn't do anything sorry for you, why are you afraid of being fat? Besides, although you are already bad, you are still very good to the people around you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and hugged the little goblin and kissed him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The little goblin smiled lightly, and poked a fat man with a dark purple nail on the chest of Rogge. It turned out that your magic power has been so strong, you can really wear it, even I have cheated you. Later, those of you "Weird magic must be taught to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "My magic is from the cleverness, very unstable, and slowly The orthodox magic that has been cultivated is far worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's green eyes are dark, whispered: "My magic is not the same, both It’s a coincidence...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge didn’t say anything, just held her in her arms and patted her back gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage once said that happiness never comes together, and disaster always goes hand in hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s troubles are far from over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of death, the bone dragon is extremely boring on a mountain. Its owner is now floating in the distant sky, just recovering from an infighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon also has no time concept, it can't remember how many times the two masters fought. From this point of view, time will certainly not be short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a long time, the clever bone dragon already knows that there is one more Vena master in the owner's body, and the new owner seems to be more than *** The master is still very powerful. At least most of the battles were picked up by the owner of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon is hesitant and struggling. Of course, Gregory will not be able to participate in the battle between the two masters, but will hide far away from the endangered students. Whenever *** and Wella fight in the sea of ​​consciousness, there is always an uncontrollable energy spillover from the outer body. These pure sacred energy is fatal even for the most powerful undead, and the clever bone dragon can never be close to *** at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Gregory has a choice, it will certainly not hesitate to choose ***, but now it has no choice. It seems that most of the time is in a disadvantage. If the *** fails completely, the bone dragon must seriously consider how to face the Wella owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success requires hard work, and flattering is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, will your luck be so good next time?" Wella's spiritual volatility passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have said this sentence many times." *** Indifferent spiritual fluctuations also spread to the bone dragon's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** and Wella can't support each time they fight to the source of God, and they will start playing again after the break. They always watch out for each other and wait for the flaws of the other side. They have no time to take control of the fluctuations of the spirit. Because of the relationship of the soul contract, they can clearly hear every sentence in the sea of ​​consciousness. So the bone dragon knows the origin of Wella. The bone dragon of the trend of inflammation is afraid to provoke Wei Na. Every time I think of Wei Na in my consciousness, I have to add the word of the master. Bone Dragon knows that if one day, Wella vacates, the past disrespectful history will immediately become its own cause of killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***When you are quarreling with Weina at rest, rest and fight, just like this, I don’t know when it is the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines that they threatened each other when they quarreled had long been ruined. Although they all have the power of the peak, but the number of quarrels is really one of the few, even a small mix in the devil world is not as good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, the words of Wella and *** are not bad with the memory of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, you dare to move this body idea, I will kill your Rogge first!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will destroy the original of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can never stop me from letting out the storm of faith!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...destroy together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experienced dozens of such spiritual bombardments The bone dragon finally couldn't stand it. It screamed: "Noisy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death suddenly fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** in the air turned slowly and looked at Gregory quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the headless angel image of the left eye and the golden cross star in the right eye, a chill from the deepest part of the soul makes Gregorian tremble It’s up. Lian Bianlong didn't believe it at all. At this time, it still had the courage to beg for mercy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two masters... Master, I don't mean that... Ah! It’s not me, it’s really not me, my God! Help!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desperate bone dragon escapes from the distance with a scream in hysteria . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** snorted, a pair of white hands and a small hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distant sky, the blue light flashed, and the bone dragon fell to the ground like a meteor, and then there was a vague mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The pattern in both eyes dimmed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea of ​​consciousness, Wella is cold and cold: "***, I know that you have been looking for a chance to ruin this body so that I can fall asleep." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina's brow wrinkled and extended her right hand, and the five long fingertips on the long, five-finger fingertips showed five golden threads again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said coldly: "In order not to let you play with fire, I feel it is necessary to let you see the power of the belief storm. You can rest assured that I will control the power." Will not ruin your coordinates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's middle finger, ring finger and tail finger are in turn, three small golden sparks follow three The golden silk glides like a lightning bolt, and disappears into the void in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of the Wisdom of the Virgin Mora is hosting a ceremonial ceremony for thousands of believers in a large city in the Kingdom of Layton. Her voice like a scorpion suddenly broke, and suddenly she spurted a blood, and fell to the ground in the sky, and the personnel did not wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
