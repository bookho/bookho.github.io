			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Heavenly Chapter of the Heavenly Gods in Hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 12 Serrafi < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two doors that have been closed for 17 days have finally opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ragged Rug took a weak foot and walked out behind the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two heavy gates are purely cast iron, nearly half a meter thick, and their switches are all driven by hydraulic machinery. As soon as Rogge walked out the door, the heavy iron gate slowly closed behind him. In the moment before the iron gate is closed, you can see a small piece behind the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dead body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looks exhausted, his feet are vain, and he is even thinner. However, his eyes have recovered from the clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warden who is two fatter than the fat man has long been respectfully waiting to be there, and personally put a new set of clothes up. In the process of changing clothes, Rogge’s black and white skin could not help but fall, and the warden was frightened. He immediately turned his eyes to the ground and pretended not to see anything. The warden has long been in the officialdom, knowing that the biggest way to blame is to know too much about the secrets of the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Rogge is standing now is the bottom layer of the big dungeon. When the Holy Alliance was just established, the dungeon began construction. Traditionally, a country has been established. The first to build is the military camp and the prison. The Principality of Aray is no exception. In the long history of Alai, the Dungeon has been expanded three times, and it can hold more than 1,000 of the most dangerous prisoners. After Rogge took over the power of the Principality, despite the financial constraints, he set aside money to repair the dungeon. After all, the fat man’s power to win the country is not glorious, and there are many rebels. The original local dungeon was not enough for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the place behind the iron gate that has the most souls in the dungeon. The space behind the door is wide and wide, but there is no light, no way out, only a little pitiful water. If you want to kill a prisoner in a dungeon, you will often close several people to this Jedi and let it die and rot in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the Jedi, the mortal prisoners will not be able to use it for a long time to fall into the final madness. The person who is still awake in the end is often the most unfortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of years. I don’t know how many fierce grievances have accumulated in this Jedi; in the open space, I don’t know how many of the most vicious curses are echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge returned from the ‘Wind Rift Valley’ and plunged into the Death Jedi. He is the master of undead magic, and he needs to take advantage of the soul and curse power here to counter the curse attached to the steel war. Perhaps the whole country can't find a place where the undead and the curse are more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse attached to the steel warfare scroll is meticulously complicated, although the initial power does not seem to be large, but it is extremely difficult to remove. Rogge thought that he could completely expel the curse effect within five days. I did not expect to stay in the dungeon for 17 days. However, this time the fat man is also a small gain. After personal experience, Rogge is more familiar with the use of the curse power, and the various cursing spells he sends are even more difficult to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is innocent for his magical progress, he hurriedly put on his clothes and returned directly to the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because cracking the high-level curse is related to the fat man's life, so before entering the Great Dungeon Jedi, Rogge made a strict order. No one is allowed to bother. But he did not expect that this stay is seventeen days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen days, too many things can happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge carefully removed a magical institution in the corner of his room. This magical array is powerful, and if it is accidentally triggered, it will be half dead by the fat resistance of the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blue mirror in the magic array is shining with a flash of light. This is a magical item that Rockefeller specially sent to Rogge for remote communication. As soon as I saw the flashing light on the mirror, Rogge knew that at least a dozen messages were stored inside. The mirror is extremely expensive. However, the total number of uses is only 20 times. During the seventeen days, Rockefeller continued to pass the news, showing his anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and simply replied with a message saying that he would leave within five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discarding the factors of the wind, dealing with the city of Yunxiao and the imperial prime minister, Straw is the top priority, but in addition, the Principality can say no major events. . There are five days. It should be enough for him to deal with the backlog of the Principality over the past ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long. Rogge, who was in a hurry, appeared again in the main hall of the Eye of Wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mora of the robe seems to know that Rogge is coming, long waiting at the door of the main hall. The fat man said nothing. Follow her tacitly to the back of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has no idea how many times the eye of wisdom has entered the main hall. But this time is different from the past, he always feels a subtle change in the atmosphere here. But where the specific changes are, he can't say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the front of Mora, Rogge’s heart suddenly moved slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora is very rhythmic. With her footsteps, the tempting curves under the loose robes flickered, especially the plump, rounded buttocks, which swayed slightly. For a time, Rogge’s heartbeat seemed to echo the rhythm of this rippling. He suddenly remembered the lingering stagnation with Mora, her beautiful body, seductive eyes, time and heavy shackles, crazy movements and the panic of the timelessness, one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with today?" Rogge secretly wondered. If in peacetime, he will never suppress his lascivious heart, but as long as there is a business in front, the fat man's resistance to beauty is extraordinary. As it is today, it is almost impossible to suppress the ** of Mora, and this is the first time in recent times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked into the prayer room in tandem, and Mora carefully covered the door. In the prayer room, there is the power of O'Reilly. As long as you close the door, you are not afraid of the general prying magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames on the altar burned as usual. Sitting in front of the flame, a little baby girl is eating her own fingers. A pair of beautiful big eyes curiously looked at the silent Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... is the goddess after the arrival?" is to calm the kung fu like Rogge, but also can not conceal his own shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goddess has indeed come." Mora was quiet and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog stared at the little girl and looked left and right. If he was not afraid of angering O'Reilly’s consequences, he could not afford it. He also wanted to put a baby. Pick it up and look at it carefully. He even secretly glanced at the baby with his mental power. On her body, she did find a trace of the gods of Ao Le Reich, but the power of God was too weak. But a baby. Even if the qualifications are good, it is impossible to have much power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it has always been. Rogge felt very strange about O'Reilly's choice to fall in a baby's body, which seems quite similar to the reincarnation of angels in the Church of Light. But Rogge knows that it seems that the bright church has been popular in recent years in the mature body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also wants to study the baby girl carefully, at this time, Mora’s deliberately low voice came in time: "Rogge, you The current move is disrespectful to the goddess..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was shocked and immediately stepped back a few steps. I don't know when. Mora had stood silently behind him, and the fat man retired and immediately smashed with Mora. Where did Mora hit the fat man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saint immediately fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s back felt Mora’s soft body, and the flames in his heart slammed and burned again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said nothing, turned and rushed to Mora, who had not yet climbed. Mora had just supported the half body and was immediately crushed to the ground by Rogge. Under the brute force of the fat man, she has no resistance. In a twinkling of an eye, the robe was torn open. Rogge whispered in his throat and buried his face deeply in the familiar two soft peaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora did not panic, she just screamed at Rogge’s ear: "O'Reilly is here..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora saw that Rogge was awake and pushed him away if nothing happened. Cover the bare chest with a broken robe. At this time Mora's robe was almost completely shredded by Rogge, and she could cover it and hide it. But Mora didn't care too much, she calmed her voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goddess passed down two gods, all related to you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has completely recovered his mind at this time, and he is afraid to go to see Mora. Attempting to try the indescribable goddess before the altar of the goddess is an unforgivable sin in any religion. The fat man can't help but feel strange about his accidental loss of control. It seems that he was so out of control when he was lingering with Morah last time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not waiting for him I have to understand. Mora said: "The goddess asks the eye of wisdom to hold a grand ritual in a month. Only the loyalty of more than 50,000 people who are present at the same time can reach the requirements of the goddess and gain the grace of the goddess. But you I know that there are only 100,000 people in Dresden. To get 50,000 devout believers, we can only call on the believers from other places to come to Dresden. This will be a big expense, but the eyes of wisdom are not So rich, but the omniscient goddess has taken this into consideration, and she asks you to supplement the sacrifices for this ritual for the eyes of wisdom. I have calculated that this ceremony requires you to donate 200,000 gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge doesn't make a sound, but his face is already ugly, how ugly it is. The tax on the new season in the Principality has just been in the warehouse for a few days, and it is only 250,000 gold coins. In the last two seasons, the tax revenue has taken up most of the annual tax revenue. However, the money that has just been collected from the national treasury has been used by the eyes of wisdom at once. What should he do to pay the salaries of the officials and the soldiers of the soldiers? Not to mention the manufacture of sophisticated instruments and the perfect training camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge does not know what this ritual is for, but a goddess who frequently displays miracles is in front of him, if he does not want to satisfy her god Oh, that is definitely a fool. And regardless of whether O'Reilly's power is high or low, she not only showed countless miracles, but also appeared in front of Rogge. Of course, every time she came, she scared the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of all pragmatic fat people, such a goddess can be much stronger than the goddess of ice and snow that has been extinct for decades. The gods that believe in do not need to be strong, as long as they are willing to help its followers. That's enough. If it is like Hilo, it will not come out for a thousand years, then what do you use if you believe in the highest god? Before the millennium war, the powerful elf empire swept through all the powerful creatures on the mainland, but after losing the blessing of God, the glory days have not completely ended in just a few decades? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thoughts passed in the heart of Rogge. The fat man is shocked, is it? You must also embark on a god dedicated to an activity to create a world. Then wait for the reincarnation road that the latecomers will knock themselves down? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger," Mora asked softly: "Are you willing to perform the goddess of the goddess?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" Rogge thought without thinking. He temporarily put aside the proposition that fate is far beyond his ability, and instead considers how to get a foreign wealth, so that he can make up the financial hole of the Principality. Speaking of collecting money, this is the fate of the fat man who relied on his family to turn his head. His brain turned rapidly and blinked. Dozens of methods of collecting money have flashed one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War! Only war!" Rogge suddenly gnashed his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only war! Only by establishing an external enemy can we not only set a target for the disgruntled people in the public, but also take the opportunity to send a war. Of course, the premise of all this is to win this war. So the choice of this enemy is crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let Rogge know if it’s the triumph or the frustration is that his enemies are numerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even without the 200,000 gold coins that Auger Reich wants, Rogge will definitely not support this year. Therefore, he must make a fortune before the bankruptcy of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Eye of Wisdom gathers 50,000 devotees to sacrifice ceremonies is by no means a trivial matter. In history. Every similar event has its cause. The goddess O'Reilly will never hold such a ceremony for no reason, but the true sense of God is not something the fat man can guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saint of Mora has no strange or disgusting expression of Roger’s sinister war declaration, as if he already knew Rogge’s answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was shocked and happy. He never imagined that the goddess would send a servant to help him directly! How can the goddess of the goddess be a sanctuary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the servant? Let me see you soon!" He liked the resort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here." A cold, cold voice suddenly sounded behind Rogge, sounding less than a metre from the fat man, the fat man could almost feel her exhaled Blowing in the cold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man did not dare to move over the ground, but slowly turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s sudden dizziness, for a moment, he couldn’t see the knife-cut, full of sculpted face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this face, many years ago. He once met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger blinked. After a closer look, I found out that I didn’t know the beautiful woman who was on the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman has blonde hair. The blue eyes are covered with a delicate light armor, and a cross sword is hung around the waist. It seems that she has nothing strange except for her exquisite equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse your..." Rogge cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman interrupted his words coldly: "I am the goddess of the goddess Seraf, you do not have to increase the name of people or respect. I am As a spokesperson for the goddess, I will judge everything by myself in the future, and you should not try to order me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a closer look at Serafi, his eyes glanced at the stunning face, and involuntarily stunned. But what surprised Rogge was not her appearance, but her strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goddess sent to assist his servant Serrafi, only fourteen levels of vindictive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and scanned it once again with mental power, finally convinced that he had no mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 14th-level servant, is this joke a little bigger? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the fat man has a chance to complain, Serafi has already made a mistake. She glanced at the untidy Mora and said coldly to Rogge: "You insulted the goddess' sacrifice and insulted the goddess' dignity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗The grid will still be answered in the future, and you will see a dazzling bright sword in front of you. Look at this momentum. This sword is necessary to lick his eyes! Roger was shocked and instantly cast a transparent light shield, stopped in front of him, and then the whole person lightning back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has reacted very fast, and the instant transparent light shield is very sinister. If the opponent wants to take a virtual attack, most of them will hit the static light shield. It is not necessary to be injured. It is a big surprise. That is certain. As long as there is such a short time. Rogge's mentally-driven low-level magic will be attacked like a storm, and it will easily pull back the unfavorable situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dazzling Jianguang blinked away, and Rogge was empty in front of him. How can there be a statue of Serrafi? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge felt a chill in the back of his neck. How rich the experience of the fat man, immediately felt that the Serafi cross sword was parked there, quietly waiting for himself to send his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Rogge’s backlash is extremely great, and he can’t stop the momentum of retreating. The fat man is in a hurry. Immediately scream! His snoring implies a magic spell. Although this method of casting is not as fast as instant casting, the spell that can be cast is higher than the instant magic. Coupled with the precise magic control of the fat man and the undead, dark magic specialization, other wizards cast a time of the same level of magic, Rogge can release two or three magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wall of white bones appeared behind him with the roar of Rogge, and he stopped his body. Even in the face of the servant, Rogge will not die. The tail of his tail pointed to a dark black ring, and a dark gray cursed fog flew back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
