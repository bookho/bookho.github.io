			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter nine is ruthless<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie’s first real power, Rogge is very uneasy, secretly swearing that Hilley will organize all the words and deeds of Auntie into a brief report, secretly handed over. for myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he expected was that although Auntie appeared to be inexperienced, she was able to go straight to the subject when dealing with things, without any delay, a few things. It is also well organized, and the priorities are very clear. Although this is only the first day, it is very valuable for a woman who has never really dealt with the military affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think it’s too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge comfortably took a hot bath, which relieved some of the fatigue. He wrapped a large bath towel at random and walked out of the bathroom with a little song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden murder suddenly came over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glare illuminates in the bedroom, and for a time the whole world becomes a white one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge whispered and suddenly fell to the ground! Then a strong mental shock filled the entire bedroom, where the pale silver ripples went, all the mirrors, glass, and porcelain burst! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seven-color magic shield was attacked by Rogge’s spirit, which quickly protected the assassin, but also allowed Rogge to lock the position of the assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glare in the bedroom flashed three times, three large lightnings instantly fell on Rogge, and the hot electric fire completely changed the towel on his body. It became coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assassin’s hand waved, and a huge electric fireball flew over to Rogge. Rogge eagerly mourned the spell in his mouth, while condensing a silver magic shield on his left hand, blocking the electric fireball aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly doubled and rushed to the Assassin! He has completely swayed the role of permanent curing. His degree is obviously out of the assassin's expectation, she is thinking of a long spell, and sometimes it is too late to react! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge appeared in front of her magic shield, when his magic spell was completed, a right hand that was completely enchanted by the black flame of the Devil Hardly inserted into the magic shield, holding her throat in a virtual way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assassin was shocked, the magic spell that was going on was naturally interrupted, and the magical energy that was out of control flowed around. Rogge snorted again, his spirits sweeping for a week, and expelling these magical energies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assassin suddenly smiled, and the fascination between the moments made Rogge’s mind sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue Master! Rogge Great Sorcerer! You suddenly become so powerful! It seems that your wife is not wrong!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled, the horrible right hand after the demonization still succumbed to her throat, his claws were too sharp, if it was stained with her throat It will definitely be cut effortlessly. So although Rogge is only a sham, the assassin does not dare to move a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Princess Froya, I don’t have the courage to marry you! Now, if it’s a careless, I’m killed by you, I don’t know. What happened? Back then, you didn’t take care of me in the past, I haven’t forgotten it now. It’s painful to cut the skin. I’ve been hurting. I’m a greedy, wicked person who wants to live for a few more years, which "Dare to marry you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly stretched his left hand and slammed Froya's bra, revealing a large white plump chest muscle. Rogge ignored Froya's exclamation and inserted his hand into her deep cleavage. The slippery and rich touch that the hand had uploaded did not delay the fat man's movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and looked at a talisman in the palm of his hand that was still slightly magical, and threw it behind him. He no longer disguised, his eyes completely turned into silver, and in the horrified eyes of Fu Luoya, she glanced up and down several times on her body, and then said: "Princess Froya, there are fifteen magic props on you. Four of them are the most powerful, but the place to put them is not very convenient. You should not start any magical props anymore, lest I take them out one by one, everyone will be jealous."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge looked down and saw that the bath towel had already been turned into ashes in Fu Luoya's electric fire. He laughed, his right hand returned to its original state, and he took a suede cloak and wrapped it on his body. In the same year, you have not seen it, will you be ashamed? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger sits comfortably on the recliner, and can easily reach the big bed! Princess. You come to me so late, I don't really want to be me." Wife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya fluttered on the big bed, then raised his jaw and looked at Rogge deeply. This position is really awkward, her corset has just been torn by Rogge, and now her surprisingly full chest is almost all squeezed out of the clothes, white dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Rogge, if I said, I came tonight to be your wife, what would you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roghaha laughs of course! I wanted to get you into bed that year, but it was really bad! Can I have this kind of good thing now, how can I refuse it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are you going to hold a wedding? How can the scale not be too bad? People are also a princess! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge, some unbelievable: "His Royal Flora, you will not be true?" Haha, it seems that I am too tired recently, and I can’t even hear a joke! Your Highness, can you change your posture? If you do this again, I can't guarantee that I can control myself all the time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiled and lifted his body up slightly. The arrogant twin peaks were almost all in front of Rogge. This little fairy has a beautiful face. The body is thin and thin, but the chest is surprisingly full. The strong contrast was that Rogge was stunned by the color of the heart. This reunion, the impact on the fat is not seen at all.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Rogge, you are becoming so powerful now, even if you can't control yourself, I can't resist it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles, if you don't have a light enemy, I won't win so easily. Of course, this is not a bad thing. You are too much too much." I don’t know what will happen now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What else do I have? Now even a magic device can’t start. What! If you don't rush, how can you know that it won't work?" Fu Luoya smiled purely, letting Rogge feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of appearance, the wind butterfly is no worse than Froah, but the difference in the means of teasing and temptation is as simple as an ordinary person and a sanctuary The gap between martial arts is the same. Therefore, Rogge can be indifferent to the wind butterfly, but it has always been disturbed by the fury of Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog calmed down and had to be careful with Froah. For example, what is the appearance of the lost paradise in her hand, I don’t know it at all. Naturally, there is no way to guess which of the more than ten magical devices in her body are in the end. More likely, since it is an artifact, it is normal to detect it yourself. Moreover, the real role of Paradise Lost is completely unknown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful with everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Froya carefully and suddenly said: "Your Highness, you are very strange tonight. Is it something between you and Androni? ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s face turned white for a moment, and he returned to a charming smile. But at this moment, Rogge saw her eyes sullen, and in the twinkling of an eye, it was cold and cold. This look is fleeting, and her deep-eyed eyes are infinitely flamboyant and versatile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge already has a few words in his heart, smiles lightly, and has nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya chuckled Rogge, you really changed a lot. Maybe I should call you Rogge. How suddenly did you become so fast? But I didn't see the curse or use any magic props. Is it solidified? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that this must not be her, nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you Said, my beauty is Andromeni? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden problem immediately stunned Rogge. Androni is an inexhaustible hero with an unspeakable charm, her figure is in the man The middle is also high, from which point of view, it is so thrilling. And Fu Luoya is a beautiful and refined beauty, but it contains a little goblin heart. Especially when she deliberately seduce a man, simply It is unstoppable. How does this compare Rogge? What's more, this kind of problem, no matter how you answer it, will not please.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not a butterfly. Although she is beautiful, she still hasn't got the ability to grab someone from me. She is... she is..." Froya suddenly burst into tears in bed and choked: "I know, I know everything." Can't compare with her. Anne, she... she can never look back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was shocked, the woman who could make Froya so frustrated what kind of person? This is far from his imagination. He recalled all the women he had seen in his life, only Elysses was possible. But she has forever turned into a fallen angel in the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides her, there is only Verna and the mysterious gray robe girl from Rodriguez’s memory. But the former has long been completely wiped out by Roger Riggs, and Froya has no chance to see her; the latter alone is not like human beings. Rogge met the mysterious gray robe girl, and because of too much fear, she did not remember her full face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles bitterly, who knows what happened between them? He is also not interested at all. The fat man must deal with the king now, and the second is to guard against the old fox of Xiusi. He not only knows that he will erode, but he can even erase the ability to erode from his soul! This is absolutely impossible to do with a 16-level killer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge meditated, Froya also put away tears, she looked at Rogge: "Little Rogge, I will ask you again, I Is it good to marry you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is now, she is serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I know that this is a bit rude, but I still want to know, what conditions do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only condition is that you can never marry Annie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, what is the condition? Although he went to Androni with despicable means, he continued to entice her to marry herself by political marriage. However, if she was to be held, it would not be impossible, and the difficulty would be the same as letting him go empty-handed to kill the dragon. as if. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess, I still don’t quite understand what you mean. If you just want to find someone to marry, I am stronger, more handsome, and have more background than me. There are so many people. Even I am still a heretic who is wanted by the Bright Church! Or do you just want to hang a name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, If I marry you, I will do everything that a good wife should do. You see, I am a magician who is not too bad, and there is an artifact missing in the hands. Besides, I am also very smart. My beauty is better than your current wife, Auntie?" Froya is like a profiteer who is desperately trying to sell inferior goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded. "In all respects, His Royal Highness is a woman among women. But I don't understand, my thing in this matter. It’s too much cheaper. I’m somewhat self-aware, knowing that there’s no cheaper to get from you. The more I get, the more I will lose in the future. Your Royal Highness, Mr. Fraya, I think we The conversation should be a bit more serious. I want to know your true requirements and thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya almost cried again, she whispered:" Ever since I met Annie, she was all my world. I was still unwilling, but since I saw the woman, I knew that I would have lost Annie forever.... I can’t bear the pain of losing her. I need a pillar. Since she doesn't want me, then I don't want to be myself. So I want to marry you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Rogge just wanted to say And he was gently covered by Froya's little hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Rogge, you listen to me. I am a very careful woman, I am also a very fair woman. I can be your good helper. Good partner, but I can't give you a little love. But in the aristocratic marriage, love is a dispensable thing. Yes, I also need you to help me, I want to avenge Anne!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally had a chance to speak. "Marrying me is also part of revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. She knows me. If I am with a man, it must be sad. She will never be better in her heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to this How do you retaliate?" Rogge is carefully calculating how much a great magician or a swordsman close to the sanctuary, which will help him more in his future plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
