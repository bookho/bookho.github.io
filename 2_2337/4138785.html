			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unwise to anger a lion. Now the Kingdom of Livi and Latvia already know the consequences of this kind of behavior. Although the anger of the Kingdom of Leighton was not caused by them, they unfortunately became the target of anger. In the past two months, King Romon has commanded the army to fight the defeat of the two countries' coalition forces and continue to attack the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the costly attack also caused the Leiden Kingdom to pay a lot of warriors' lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no war on the western front of Rogge for many days. The fat man was reassured in the city of Bola, where the city was strong, and there was no plan to go to the city to fight. The Latvian army he faced was low morale, the number did not occupy much advantage, and he did not have the heart to attack the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is very satisfied with the situation in which he can attack and retreat. He waited with confidence for the results of the main battlefield, and even some felt that the days were too dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he is sitting in the city of Bora, he is well aware of the movements of the Latvian army dozens of kilometers away. The Elf Griffin Knight is a very good scout, the only drawback is that the flight radius is shorter. As long as the Latvians began to retreat, Rogge was prepared to pursue it without any politeness. Even if there is an ambush, there is Rafael, and Latvians can hardly count Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as Rogge thought that everything was in his hands, the leisurely days suddenly ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Bora is already in full bloom. On this day, Rogge inspected the city's defense training for a day, and did not return to the city government until the night. He thought that this night, as in the past, would be spent in the fight with Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the study, a soft knock on the door sounded, and Rogge’s heart suddenly burst into a groan. He seemed to feel the wind butterfly standing outside the door. Rog smiled and felt that he must be too tired. At this moment, the wind butterfly is far away in Dresden. How can it suddenly run to the front line? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the study opened, and it was really windy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the wind butterfly that has not fully recovered is still a little pale and pale, and the chill of the spring night makes her eyebrows wrinkle and wrap up inadvertently. The cloak of the body, the exquisiteness and weakness of the moment made her beautiful as a layer of light smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did Rogge see his eyes bright, but even Androni showed a fascinating look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roger, I want to see you, so I am coming." The whisper of the wind butterfly is like saying other people's thoughts and feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned: "But your body has not recovered! Now the Holy Alliance is in the war, the road is not safe. Who escorted you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't tell anyone, I came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger frowned. With the peerless beauty of the wind butterfly, and serious injury, the danger on this road can be imagined. This temptation is enough for anyone to take risks! She dared to go alone to the front line, it is too capricious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind butterfly seems to know Rogge’s thoughts, and can still be self-protected with a smile. Moreover, the road is very peaceful and nothing is born. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the room was quiet and suddenly no one was going to care for her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and Ann Droni was stiff and staring at the wind butterfly. The expression on her face was very strange.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly slammed back, behind her, I don’t know when, A handsome elf has stood there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a tall, rare body, a face that inherits the beauty of the elf, but has a rare elf. Hard lines. His silver and gold enamel, standing on the hand, the skin of the exposed skin can be seen everywhere with silver complex magic lines.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly can not help but stunned, only the legend An elf's power is so powerful that it begins to overflow, and it will form a magical pattern on the skin. Is the power of this elf stronger than the elders of Hughes?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The feelings of Rogge and Androni are completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this elf appeared quietly at the door, a strange sense of oppression almost completely paralyzed their muscles and disintegrated their fighting spirit. Even let them not even say anything. They only felt that the air in the room seemed to be solidified, and the invisible pressure caused them to lift their fingers and effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Androni looked at each other and saw an indescribable horror from the other side. In front of this elf, they couldn’t even fear, and only the despair in their hearts!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence containing the endless wind and thunder was broken, of course, capable There is only one person who breaks this silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This elf looked at the wind butterfly and said coldly: "With me, you are safe in this way. Those who call you are sent by me." Seeing the gods. But you are very good, very good, brought me here, I have not worked hard. I have a hard time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His tone is a little bit Overlooking the arrogance of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at Rogge, the first hand: "Mage, who is both dark and dead, I met for the first time, my name is Nicholas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly felt pressure on his body, and he could speak again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nicholas..." Rogge only felt awkward. In a blink of an eye, he remembered what the name Nicholas represented. Through the silver eyes, Rogge saw that it was not an elf in front of him, but an elegant and powerful silver dragon! And the power of this silver dragon Farther away than the day of Chris Ferrena comparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge feels like a baby, and what he has to face is a storm that runs through the world!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogburn did not take the class warning as one thing. There are many heroes in the history of human beings, but when did you hear that the relatives of the Dragon's Dragon will retaliate? What's more, in the long sea of ​​people, a dragon wants to find out Rogge, it is no different from finding a needle in a haystack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how horrified he is, Nicholas is already standing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked around, the wind butterfly was a bit stunned, and apparently still did not understand what happened. Androni’s face is not a little bloody. Her pale hands clasped the blue sky, but she had no strength, or no courage to pull it out. Rogge couldn't help but smile. The three people in the room were rare in human society, but in front of Nicholas, they didn't even have the ability to do it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that this is not because of the difference in strength. The powerful silver miracle Nicholas's Longwei is not something that ordinary people can resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, opposite Nicolas, Rogge really felt his power. He spoke in the city of Bora. Although the strong is like a cloud and there are tens of thousands of troops, it can't stop Nicholas from taking his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that might fight with Nicholas is the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogello thought about it and immediately took this thought out of his mind. In an instant, he has made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nicholas, your wife is killing me, the dragon egg is also in my stomach, this matter has nothing to do with them. You do it! Hurry up "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Rogge stepped forward and closed his eyes and died. His heart is a blank at the moment, with no thoughts at all, and no emotional fluctuations. He only hopes that at this time, don't let *** feel any abnormality. Faced with the angry Nicholas, even if it is as strong as ***, it can only be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft body suddenly flew into the arms of Rogge, and Rogge blinked and saw that it was a butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly turned back and said to Nicholas: "He killed the silver dragon entirely for me! I have the blood of the silver dragon in my body. You should feel it? The matter has nothing to do with him. I am the culprit. If you want to kill, kill me! Anyway, my life is also coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s heart was in chaos, and the wind butterfly’s move was completely unexpected. He couldn't help but ask: "Wind butterfly, what are you talking about? How can you have the blood of the silver dragon in your body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bitter smile, Luo Ge said again: "Wind butterfly, haven't you always wanted to kill me? It seems that I can't escape tonight, this is not the right thing for you. Stand behind and stop talking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly shook his head reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and pulled the wind butterfly behind him, proudly saying: "I am afraid of death, but I will not let a woman block me." In front!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas faintly said to the wind: "Humble creatures, I already knew that you have the blood of Kris Felena." If it wasn't for her blood, I wouldn't have found you so soon. But the murderer who killed her is this ugly mage, this is not wrong. You want to lie to me, I am afraid it is not so easy! However, I will not let you go. This time, as long as the people involved in the murder of Chris Ferrena, no matter how many, I will kill the light! As for the two of you, it will not die so soon..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Nicholas’s mouth suddenly hangs with a strange smile: “I have read many books about elves and humans, especially those about revenge. The story. I am not the most painful way to make you humble microbes now. Just like the dwarf, the most painful The punishment is the same as ban on life. But I have to admit that there are so many ways for humans to torture their enemies, and I have already made it clear how I should choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He glanced at the wind butterfly and said: "In contrast, the elves are too simple, killing each other is the most fierce revenge. But rest assured, I am ready to use the way of the human race. On the body. Humble creatures, you will pay a price for killing the evils of the noble silver dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face suddenly changed, his eyes The silver awning in the room suddenly illuminates, and the forehead is bulging, which is extremely difficult. But although he did his best, he still could not stop the arrival of ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air suddenly burst into a groan, a black demon ***, as if floating from the water, slowly appeared in front of Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas stood up and looked at the *** leisurely, not at all in her eyes: "Even the Master knows that calling you is in vain. You should be more clear, with your ability, can't stop my revenge! But the things related to the wizard, I will destroy the same, and finally I will kill him. Since you are here, don't want to go back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas, still in the shape of the elf, smiled twice and laughed like a resounding dragon: "If you don't come, I also I don't know your relationship with him, I don't know how to find you. You come very well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in his eyes is full of magic Also lit up. Nicholas stares at ** the most difficult to find, I will kill you first! In front of my Nicholas, don't think about escaping back to your world, this time the destruction will be your complete demise!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***! This is not allowed to intervene, give me back!" Rogge shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He has tried to communicate with *** several times, and the mental fluctuations have been completely blocked by her. *** It is clear that he does not want to hear anything from him, and Rogge has no choice but to communicate in a big way.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden laugh outside the door, and Hughes came in. He smiled. "Without her help, how can my old man clean up?" Got a great silver miracle? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas did not change his face, but the light in his eyes did not fluctuate, and he looked suspicious. Even the arrival of the *** was a silver miracle. But when Hughes appeared behind him, Nicholas didn't know at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to kill him, you can't stop me!" Nicholas stares Hughes Road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and said: "Nicholas, I last let you go back to Moonlight Dragon City, you don't listen to me, the result is moonlight Longcheng loss is heavy? Now that you have experienced several wars, you have been seriously wounded and rushed to kill people here. It really doesn’t put me in the eye! I can’t stop you from killing him, but after killing him, you still want to leave. Here? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes and *** are totally protective against Nicholas, fearing that he will suddenly start. The Silver Dragon of the Incarnation Elf is also hesitating. Considering how many chances can be survived in the hands of Hughes after the raid, even if he does not kill Rogge, it is difficult to protect him from serious injury. Rogge, who is the target of the Silver Dragon, is afraid to move a little, but he is afraid to provoke a murder. Under the dragon of Nicholas, Androni still can't move. Only the wind butterfly can move freely, but she will not move at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the interior became a deadlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden sound like a dragon in the distance: "You can keep him for a while, can't keep him forever! Even if it is God, it can't stop me." Revenge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is so fast that it disappears in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hius has changed his face and lost his voice: "Be fooled!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The black gas flashed, and the Death Scythe had already cut dozens of marks on Nicholas, but they all fell empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas's figure swayed, twisted, and finally turned into a room light, disappeared clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes and *** face each other, they did not expect Nicholas to escape in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A smoky figure floated in from the window and turned out to be a death class. He shook his head and sighed: "The silver miracle is really powerful! This can make him escape. Fortunately, he is still scared by us, hold back, or else you don't have to die." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes nodded: "It’s not easy! If it wasn’t the last time he gave him magic in the wine, so he could trace his whereabouts. We also don't know that he actually has a way to find God to bring the adults here. And now it seems that he has a lot of strange and very complicated things. It is extremely difficult to fight. If it is not too smart, too much concern, we I really can't help him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class frowned: "How did he find the butterfly? This is a bit strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes thought for a while, his face changed and appeared in the Moonlight Dragon City, the dragon prophet? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Death Class immediately became ugly. The thieves and killers have always hated the role of the prophecy, whether it is a person or a dragon, the same annoyance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes said: "We have to think of a way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death shift: "Since we can know the general whereabouts of Nicholas, it may be a good idea to inform the Black Dragon King of this news. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense, let's find a time to plan well." However, the Black Dragon King will not be deformed. If Nicholas is always unable to succumb to the human country, the Black Dragon King will not openly attack people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death class is evil: "It doesn't matter! Can't besiege Nicholas, can't you besiege Moonlight Dragon City?" Let Moonlight Dragon City suffer another blow, and forgive that Nicholas would not dare to run around again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes nodded: "This is a solution." It’s just that the Black Dragon King suffered heavy losses this time. I don’t know if he would like to attack the Moonlight Dragon City again. We can now grasp the whereabouts of Nicholas, which is a great advantage and must be used with caution. This silver dragon is very embarrassing. If it is not right, it is very likely to break our magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Always keep silent, Rogge is stunned. He never knew that his life was so dangerous.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think slowly!"*** Leave such an idea to everyone in the room and go across the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart whispered Gregory’s voice: “You are so great! Too brave! You dare to talk to the owner like that! Let me reincarnate ten times, and I don’t have the courage. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog couldn’t help but tremble.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class is not good. He still has a place to ask for Rogge. It is not convenient to watch the jokes of the fat man at the moment. Then I coughed a sigh: "I still have some things, take a step first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of angry Rogge, this time, Xiusi has no reservations. Telling Rogge about the revenge of the silver miracle Nicholas. Only the part related to *** has been omitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more ugly the face is, the more ugly he is, the more ugly he can’t help but swear: “Mom, so many people who have been slaughtered in the past, how can I be the worst "The Lord who is the least irritating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes laughed: "God makes adults, your luck is not the worst."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why am I not the worst?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have it, those who have history can carry the dragon Heroes, are the middle and lower dragons like the red dragons and green dragons with limited wisdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is also a group of books, carefully I think, this is true. He stared at Hughes, waiting for his answer. And this answer, sure enough, he did not expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is because the heroes who have slaughtered the wisdom dragons are often not hospice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was so angry that he really wanted to kill the old fox. He shouted: "Since you know so clearly, when I arranged the silver dragon on the same day, why didn't you tell me this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have always been vigorous and vigorous, and there is no objection. Besides, I am not a god. How can I know that the female dragon who is out of the group actually has such an incompetent husband?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glared at Xius for a long time, and finally sighed, helplessly said: "Mom, this silver dragon is so powerful, what do you want me to do? You three can not be around me every day, hehe!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has nothing to say, if Nicholas is really hands-on, I am afraid that only one of these three people will fight with their lives. For the Death Class and Hughes, Rogge is completely unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes comforted Rogge: "This is not all that is impossible. Although the silver miracle is known as wisdom, but he is the silver dragon, thinking way. He has been very different from us. He has been concentrating on cultivation for hundreds of years. He has never been to Moonlight Dragon City. If he is intriguing, he is definitely not an opponent of the adults. Now it is no longer useful. It is useless. We have to plan well. Think more about it. Whether it's a poison in a trap or a blame on others, try it all, and there won't be any harm anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog I snorted and I knew that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is very worried, and at night he naturally has no intention to go to Androni’s room. He also did not notice that Androni's face has always been very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night, Rogge was in the study room to read the night. Whether it is national history books, celebrity biographies or military strategy, even adventure travels will be taken out in a hurry. Reading the books in front of them is to get inspiration, to set up a vicious trap scheme that can kill the silver dragon. As for the adventure travel, as long as there is a part about the dragon, he will not let go, in order to try to understand the dragon's hobby habits. Can prescribe the right medicine, kill Nicholas in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an almost impossible task, but he has to do his best for his own life. Of course, Rogge wouldn’t just talk about it on paper. He was ready to wait for some mature ideas to go to the Hughes and Death Classes to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, the sky is already slightly brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quietly opened, and the wind butterfly came in. She had a plate in her hand and put some refreshments on it. The wind butterfly gently placed the refreshment on the Rogge table and turned to prepare to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated, still stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly, when Nicholas wants to kill me today, how can you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The wind butterfly smiled lightly, and a pair of clear eyes looked at Rogge, I thought you would blame me for bringing Nicholas. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
