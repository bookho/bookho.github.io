			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes looked back and saw that Gregory didn’t know when he was quietly behind him, and that huge faucet was almost attached to Hughes. The old face, a pair of long-eyed eyes with a golden stripe and a square foot, stared at Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the sacred dragon is not large in the dragon, but if the dragon horn is included, the length of a dragon is already The height of Xius. It’s a terrible thing to be stared at such a close distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes stood up and moved two steps to the side to be the sacred dragon in front of the goddess, to your noble status in the dragons. Is there anything about finding this old elf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floating Gregory falls on the tower roof, the narrow space is almost It doesn't have its huge body. But Gregory can put a dragon's tail out of the tower, and he also has a four-clawed ground and a posture in front of Hughes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Dragon respectfully said: "I am the most faithful servant of the goddess, you can call me Gregorian. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the old fox of Hughes was shocked by Gregory’s sudden respect. He immediately swayed his hands and sneaked to the side. Two steps to Lego, you are a sacred dragon that claims to fly only in the glory of God, and I only walk a humble elf, you talk to me with this attitude, it is entirely noble to you. A kind of identity! You can't bear the weight of your body when you look at my knees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory still reverently Although the earth does indeed go to the sacred dragon, I may be the weakest sacred dragon in history. Dear Mr. Hughes, your wisdom, strength and greatness, it is not difficult to see this. What's more. In the presence of the most beautiful goddess, all creatures are equally humble, people respect and even fear me, either because of the legendary dragon dragon's magical power, or because of the goddess' glory, not because of my own true strength. I can lie to others, but in front of you, all my disguise is completely useless. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes, a smile is really a very interesting sacred dragon! But I think you are reading the wrong person. If you have something to come to me, it is better." Go find other people. I can't even have a sanctuary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Others?" The sacred dragon’s eyes looked disdainfully: "There is you Here, I still need to find other people? What's more, at this moment in the floating castle, only you can point me. The three guys from the desolate world of death have strong power, but The insights are too shallow. This can't blame them. For thousands of years, they only deal with zombies. The gods will also become stupid. As for the other two guys, I can use them to say that they are shameful!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes is silent. From his point of view, you can see a large terrace in the other corner of the floating city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of the terrace, Androni is holding her starry sky, leaning against the stone wall behind her, and staring at the low blue moon. Her mouth was full of laughter, she was self-defeating, and she didn't know what she was thinking. I will laugh out loud all the time. Her face is filled with happiness, and her face is more amazing, and her posture is even better than in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the other side of the castle. The Death Class was looking back and forth over the fine sword with the radiance of earthy yellow, and every wrinkle was laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will stand up from time to time, walking around in the moonlight, still squatting, excitedly talking to himself: "There are still eleven days, It’s ten days! It’s only ten days.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes regained his gaze and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory said again: "Sanctuary? What is the sanctuary? The sanctuary only makes sense for those humble existences that understand the power of understanding! How can a rough measure be used to measure your unfathomable power? What's more, power has boundaries, and wisdom has no limits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smacked a kind of insight, forgive you can't think of it! Is your two masters teaching you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Dragon suddenly screamed: "Look, you know everything about this!" I have said long ago that you can never be just an ordinary elf. There is still a bit of eyesight in the wisdom of Gregory! It’s easy to know how the owner of Wina can catch you. When I was a sly, she saw me from the world of death. Ah, no, I took the initiative to stand in front of her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory also woke up and knew that it was not only the master's taboo, but also shouted it out loudly! For a time, it scared the whole body, the four claws were soft, and the front and back stretched out. Suddenly, he became a veritable five-body caster. Where is the sacred dragon's demeanor?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One dragon and one elf erect his ears as much as possible, alert him Search for the movements of the four, prepare for a strange sound, and immediately slip away. They waited for a long time, seeing the castle below, there is no movement, this is a bit of a shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni and the Death Class are still immersed in their own world, listening to the screaming of the Holy Dragon, I am afraid that it is a human sentinel. Now they are more alert than they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes glanced at Gregory with a hate, then shook his head and sighed: "Gregory. You are really smart." The sacred dragon. Can mention your master... Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory raised his front paws and thought for a long time, and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed and sighed in this pretense, how can you understand these dragons?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you don't understand, you have to learn!" This time Gregory answered the resoluteness and surprised Sius.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes turned around and recruited the beckoning: "I am just an elf killer who is going to the end of life. How can I teach a god dragon? You can still go!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, okay. Gregory reluctantly turned his head and turned around on the narrow terrace, muttering: "It seems that you are not willing to give me some advice." I know that you are not unable, just not willing. but. It seems that no one knows about the owner and the owner of Wella, and the owner does not want others to know things, very, very unwilling! Maybe, maybe I should remind her, someone has noticed that I have Two masters. After all, if there is no master, there will be no loyalty to Gregory, even if the owner is furious, I will be re-demolition into a skull dragon. My loyal heart is still eternal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay!" Hughes stopped Gregory, who was about to fly. I can't help but cry: "You sacred dragon, what you can do now can't be sacred with the sacred!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come?" Lego said, while inhaling the capacity, squeezed a large sacred light on the body, "Look, the sacred Gregory. That is also my name. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes is not too angry to find out what I want to do, just say it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gregory is overjoyed. The faucet looked forward to show intimacy, but the dragon's horn on the left almost poked in Hughes. It gently swayed the dragon language magic. When there was not too much, a Wenyu written in the dragon language appeared in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes glanced at the text and frowned. "The ultimate deformation technique? I have never heard of the Holy Dragon and want to learn this." The ability of your talent, just use a few dragon language deformation techniques to not go home is easy? Do not need to practice this ultimate metamorphosis! What do you want to become? What other creatures can match the sacred giant Dragon? What's more, the sacred dragon's spellcasting and spell-casting ability is the best for the dragon. How can you not understand the ultimate deformation technique and want to smash my old man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Lane: "The great Shusi Chang, even if you don't consider your strength behind the goddess. Your wisdom alone is enough to crush all the enemies! How can I possibly win you? But I think, you must have seen that I have just become a sacred dragon, and even the basic dragon language magic is not fully understood. In time, I can of course master the ultimate deformation, but..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dragon has a long stretch of the neck and looks at the temple The huge dragon's eye is jumping with a fiery flame: "...I can't wait any longer! When you are separated from the most beloved things, but you can't touch it, what does it feel? It's pain! It's too painful! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry. He smiled and approached the giant of Gregory, staring at his sacred, loyal, noble eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, given the huge gap between the two sides, Xiusi’s staring can only be one of Gregory’s eyes. But even then, the fierce gaze of the old fox almost penetrated its entire soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hidden, sneak, disguise, and listen.” Gregory replied without hesitation, apparently brewing for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are all very common thieves and killer skills! Why don't you use the dragon language magic instead, as far as I know, the dragon language magic The invisibility is still very easy to use. And you will drift, you don't need to sneak!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the eyes of God, all magical energy is not As long as these most basic abilities can be swung to the extreme, they will have the effect that the dragon language magic can't replace. They are completely possible to pass the eyes of God!" Gregory seriously said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's too much to know about Dragon's magic! Forget it, but you also have a way to talk about it. These basic abilities are matched, and even God will If you want to pry into your headache, is it a god? Is it God, is this god around us?" Hughes smiled and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory immediately said: "I just want to learn art from you, walking in the dark, not the art of humanity." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes laughed: "Very good! The ultimate variant can choose three creatures, how are you going to choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has at least thought about the choices he has made, and immediately said: "Gnomes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hius Eyes Confucianism is indeed Match the best races of these skills. It seems that you have some talent, ok, I will pick you up and explain the use of ultimate deformation. The power at this moment is too low, but I can change the final deformation. If you only choose one creature at first, you can still master it. This skill. but. After you have learned, you have to do something for me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory immediately promised that although he couldn't do anything, he couldn't do it, but in order to learn the ultimate transformation, he had already quit. He will do it if he is hard-working. It can’t be done, it’s just that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the shining city The elf and a sacred dragon are secretly studying the art of darkness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory!" After the initial teaching of the Holy Dragon. Hughes coughed and said with a strong heart: "These are the most basic skills to walk in the dark. Can also take the most useful skills. After you practice, do you just want to be a bystander and watch the exhibition of events?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory thought about the moment I was very satisfied. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, before mastering these skills, Gregory did not say to be a historical observer. It is occasional to be an observer, even if you can only hear a few words, it will make it happy for several days. But what is heard by Hughes, is it possible to go further?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the sacred dragon is itchy. Unstoppable itch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to ask for noble, intelligent, elegant, and tasteful people who are so old-fashioned." Gregory respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like the weak existence of the trick, it is impossible to compete with those powerful guys, so we can only choose to hide in the darkness. But even if The strong existence, even the gods, the balance between them is very subtle. Sometimes, only a little bit of external force is needed, and it is clear. Just a little bit, you can break this balance and make things happen to us. The direction of the exhibition. The power to break the balance does not need to be so powerful. Even people like us who dare to hide in the dark have this power. Think about it, when those powerful beings change because of your intervention in the darkness. The fate of the trend, that should be a sense of accomplishment! Of course, this is also a huge risk, depending on how you choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Each piece of gold in the Geli high-powered dragon eye is in the light, and of course it knows its own choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, a huge figure passed the sky. The sacred dragon is eager to find a quiet place to practice the new master of the final deformation. It also looked strange when looking for the right place. It and the Hughes conspiracy have been contemplating for a long time, and many of them have been smug, but why do you feel that the master’s keen sense will be ignorant of such close disrespect?<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge quietly held his hand in front of the window, watching the blue moon in the night sky, unable to remember the fighting skills of the Black Warrior and the Bone Emperor. The more Rogge recalls each of their movements, the more frowning the brows are. He concentrated almost all his attention on the two kings. The most terrible part of Bone's Emperor is his powerful attacking power and instantness. He doesn't have much combat skills and doesn't need these skills. The Black Warrior Emperor is somewhat similar to the Paladin or Ranger of this world. Its combat power is balanced, there is no special place, but all kinds of auxiliary skills can be adapted to any environment. fighting. As for Elgar, Rog didn't think too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that the power of Elgar is not as good as the two kings, but most of the magical knowledge of the lich has been installed in Rogge. Just in memory. Of course, knowing that you know, you want to rely on magic to knock down the lich who has lived for thousands of years, it is almost impossible to complete the task. In the long years of the millennium, although the lich did not dare to enhance the magic because of the fear of the heavens, but it spent all of its time on improving the magic control and researching new applications, if only the amount of proficient magic, it is enough I have several great mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge repeatedly thought, if he stood in front of the three kings, what would happen to the battle. He knows that every king's power is much stronger than him, but pure power is not everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiles coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the world of death constrains everything as the first rule of the king, there are rules that bind the strong in this world. Fat people are familiar with these rules. The power of the kings is so strong that they can rely on and use only the power of death. Even Rodriguez, who was in the past, was worried when using the power of death and did not dare to be too public. However, it is impossible for the kings who have survived countless years in the world of four deaths to know this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man couldn’t help but regret that the day was so excited that he challenged the kings. Since I have said that the king is engaged in war, what kind of respect and morality is used to take care of? The war is not a decisive battle. Why should we expose the intentions too early and let them prepare for it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he turned to think, this is not necessarily a good thing. There are always opportunities, just to see if he can use it. The three kings have powerful powers, and they may be able to adapt to the world and grow quickly, but they will never be able to familiarize themselves with some important rules of the world, such as the attitude of people towards the dead. The stronger the power of the king, the better it must be used...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Rogge has figured out several plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly remembered that the servant Serra had only fourteen levels of vindictiveness, and when she was teaching herself, the flying fists even even Fourteen levels of vindictive disdain. Ten levels of vindictiveness! Just ten, Serrafi has already beaten the fat to the north. Every time the shiny and exquisite boots stepped on Rogge’s belly, they squandered the tenth level of exhaustion, and even the weakest one refused to waste, and all of them were sent to Rogge’s body, which was inextricably Each vindictiveness seems to have long eyes, and the rogue that Rogge tries to condense is smashed, and there is even room for torture to distort his nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge repeatedly thought about the steps he had stepped on. The more he thought about it, the more he felt the endless aftertaste. If Serrafi is present, I am afraid that Rogge will ask her to step on more feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly sighed, only that the world is so vast and boundless, but unfortunately time is fair to the individual, never give him a point Go to explore and experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge put his hand in front of him, the blue moonlight quietly fell on his palms, and suddenly the mercury-like glory of a lake like a bay In the same way, it slowly accumulated in the palm of your hand, like a liquid, and it overflowed from the palm of your hand at a certain height. As soon as the moonlight left his hand, it was again turned into a light, projected on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moonlight, the shadow of the hand has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled slightly, with a little bitterness. If he is focused on the improvement of strength as soon as possible, then, ** how is this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is no shortcut to the path of strength, even if he pays more attention to personal strength, the result will still be the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge understands that he looks up to the blue moon, only to smile bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
