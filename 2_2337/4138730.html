			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day is not yet bright, a line of knights with a bright armor will come out of the city of Say, and go to Dresden, the Principality of the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind that didn’t come to the wind did not make Rogge curl up, but he untied the collar and let the biting cold wind freely drill into the clothes. . He is really too excited, a brand new magical path has been launched in front of him, although he has just stepped on a foot, although this road is not just him alone, but after all, this is not much The road people have traveled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in Rogge’s head, how to combine mental and magical advantages with his strong body. As for what to do after arriving in Dresden, he has no thoughts to consider. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he still has many tasks to complete in Dresden, since this is a duchy ruled by the great aristocracy, since everything in the Holy Alliance advocates imitation The civilization of the South, then he has the confidence to stir up a storm in this ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes that are of concern from time to time fall on Rogge’s back. Rogge smiled and looked back inadvertently. Not far behind, Ajani immediately turned her face and turned her head. The corner of the wind butterfly behind him was gently stunned and turned to look elsewhere. Although her face with delicate squid blocked most of her face, Rogge's sharp eyes were still a little bloody on her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man turned back and smirked and smiled. The fifty elf knights who followed him were once again selected from the eight hundred elf warriors, and they would execute their orders without compromise. Even if it is a butterfly, it will not defy. In his life, there has never been such a happy mastery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shouted and beat the horse. Dozens of Elf Knights keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave all the way to the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the heavy snow stopped, all the snow on Dresden Boulevard in Dresden has been cleaned up, revealing that it is neatly laid out Qi's bluestone plate comes. Two rows of tall Arctic icy pines are planted on both sides of the boulevard. In the cold, the dense needles have turned dark green. This kind of green has not only added a light atmosphere to the tall buildings with dark brown surrounding, but has increased the dignity and chill of the entire avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fewer than ten giant houses on the long Dha. Here are the prominent aristocrats of the Ayre Principality and even the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the magnificent palaces, Hilley is sitting in his luxurious living room, carefully reading the letters in his hands through crystal glasses. He was tall and straight, and he was meticulously white. He wore three large, ancient rings on his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite of this majestic old man, Will is sitting in a gorgeous embroidered gold armchair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing fire burned in the fireplace, and the living room was as warm as spring. But Will's forehead was full of sweat, his hand clutching the placket tightly, and the knuckles became white because of the force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will is very nervous, he is just a small civilian tax official, the boundaries between the hierarchically sacred alliance, the civilians and the nobility are very clear, not to mention The Marquis of Silla, sitting in front of him, is one of the most powerful aristocrats of the Principality of Ayre, and holds the title of the state affairs of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humble Wil can sit in front of the Marquis of Hiley, this is a great honor. Will knows very well that this is not because of how important he is, but because of the letter in the hands of Hilley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short two-page letter, Hille repeatedly looked at it three times, and then he looked up and asked in a slow voice. "The great magician Rogge wants to play for the Grand Duke of Tikick. Why do you have to find my useless old man first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Will will quickly put the words that have already been memorized in the chest: "The meaning of Rogge, the Hillei family is an ancient family that assisted the Tikick family to establish the Principality of Are. It is his honor to be a referee." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyce stroking the long beard, pondering for a moment, and asking: "Rogue adults can have a private Elf Guard, must be a great magic." In the Holy Alliance, the position of the Great Sorcerer is much higher than that of the small aristocrats in our remote areas! He directly seeks to see the Grand Duke, and he will receive a grand reception."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Hilley smiled lowly. "Roger is really worth watching my useless old man! Very good, please go back and tell Rogge, I am very honored to be this big man. The magician was in the court and the referee of the upper class in Dresden. When he arrived in Dresden three days later, I thought there would be a welcome ceremony in his identity."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheila personally sent Will out of the gate, and now he is falling into the snow, and then turned back to the government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pale middle-aged man and Hilley sent Will away, until the heavy government gate closed, he asked: "Father, In your status, if you send the great magician Rogge, you can say it. But he is a small tax official and a civilian. Is it worth your cold to send out the house? What's more, he has not sent any gifts yet. It is very rude!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jorgen, you are the deputy of the Legal Affairs Department of the Principality, will not know what happened in the territory of Count Luck? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean the resurrection of the demon born ten days ago? Now the news of the entire Principality to the Holy Alliance may have spread. You know, The degree of rumors is unimaginable. I heard that this Rogge has subverted the ancient demon. From the report, this demon power is so powerful that even the castle that Luck has been reinforced for hundreds of years has destroyed most of it! It is really difficult. Imagine, I have been to the land of Earl of Luck this summer! The castles are all built with two feet long and half a foot thick granite!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillley interrupted his son’s words impatiently. What did you say and what you saw, didn’t you see anything else? Use your brain more! Ugh. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorgen tried hard to think for a moment, but obviously, as a child of the family, the wine and wine talent is his strength, from the facts and analysis of the report. Inferring something new, some have his ability.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro-American! I know! You see, after Mr. Rogge sealed the demon, actually let His elf warrior occupied Sayy Castle, and he himself lived in the castle of Count Luck. He must have wanted to occupy the territory and wealth left by Luck, and hope that we can give him support! Aha! Father, this is not a trivial matter! He didn’t send a gift, it’s a miser! Maybe we should ask him for two elf slaves. I heard that every elf under him is the best! Maybe The elf slaves of the Grand Duke of Bidrick are even more beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheilai sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jorgen, he wants to occupy the territory of Luck, maybe it is really to guard the devil's seal. In this case, for all of us It’s a good thing. However, a powerful magician like him has a guard team composed of hundreds of elf warriors. This strength is too strong for us in the Ayre Principality. No country will welcome one. A powerful magician, the Ayre Principal is no exception. Of course, our dead rival, the palace magician Gennawara should be excluded! This Mr. Rogge is obviously not an ordinary magician! Pointing for wealth is nothing for a senior magician like him. He has no need to covet this. There is a big magician with such a strong group, and he is ready to settle in the Principality of Aray. What happened to me? My dead rivals will try to win over him in the first place! But now he has asked me to be his referee, this is a good thing falling from the sky! Jorgen, The goodwill of a great magician is the best gift for us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But father, maybe he is ambitious..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to travel to the South when I was young, and I have also been exposed to the magical civilization of the South. Every magician has ambitions. But their ambitions are more in pursuit of powerful The power, not the secular power of wealth. The ambition of the great magician Rogge will never be limited to the Principality of Aray. This country may be enough for a magician like Gennawala, but For a great magician who can seal the demon, such a country is too small. When his eyes are on a farther goal, the trivial matter of this remote country will inevitably require people to take care of him. So, his ambition is bigger, for us, maybe it is a good thing. I only have such a son, I am so old, still worrying about the size of the Principality, this is for you. If I am not in the position, you ?. Why get the better of those old fox now, if we can get a family to support Rogge great magician, then I will be assured retired "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Sheila sighed, and he only hoped that the indulgent son would pass on the family safely. The two grandchildren are less than ten years old, and they fear that they will not be able to support the day they grew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sat in the sand from the south and carefully calculated. After a few moments, he ordered to prepare the carriage, and when the Grand Crit of the Creek was over, he was ready to meet the Grand Duke and arrange a welcoming ceremony for the Roger Great Sorcerer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge and his team stopped in a small town, it was only at noon, just a few tens of kilometers away. He went straight to the largest guest house in the town, wrapped it all over, and drove all the guests out at twice the price. A six-person adventure team is obviously not happy with Rogge's hegemonic behavior, and he has put on the battle frame. But in the twinkling of an eye, they were knocked down by the wind butterfly, throwing out the entrance to the inn, and they had to go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of dozens of elf knights sensationalized the entire town, and countless curious townsmen flocked to see the legendary elves. Rogge intended to let the townspeople see the beautiful faces of several elves before they completely closed the door of the inn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is not in a hurry to rush to Dresden, he needs to give the Aries Principality a little time to react. He does not doubt that Hilley will reject his proposal. No one will reject the goodwill of a great magician, not to mention the great aristocracy of the Ayre Principality is not just a family of Hilley. If this old guy doesn't know, he has several candidates! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, he still has some preparations to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just sat in the room, the door was quietly opened, Ajani flashed in, slammed, the hot body was put into Rogge's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger waved his hand and a light breeze covered the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature in the room suddenly rose several degrees. In a moment, Ajani had already been stunned and thrown into the bed by Rogge. Her skin is pale and pale, and the soft curves are mixed with power and softness. As a shadow swordsman, she is full in the elves, but the elf's body is naturally thin, she looks very slim. Only the rounded buttocks and long legs are full of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim light, Ajani is covered with a layer of smoke, full of sly beauty. She closed her eyes, her face was already flushed, and she grabbed the sheets with her fingers, and her legs were twisted together, not dare to move. Like most elves, she is not very big, just a grip, but the win is beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not the ultimate beauty, but the shyness of that moment is enough to captivate everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at her for a long time before she gently grasped her feet. Ajani shuddered and the fingers tightened even tighter. Rogge touched her legs and touched her legs, slowly opening the legs that Ajani twisted together. Suddenly his hands and hands, Aga Ni's legs were greatly separated, almost a word, the mysterious and plump square inch, no hidden reservations, completely in front of Rogge's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajiani exclaimed, this posture is too shameful, and feels that Rogge’s heavy breath is sprayed on his most tender and sensitive place, where Got it? She hurriedly sat up, trying to cover the shame, but her legs were lifted by Rogge and she fell on the bed again. Rogge lifted her legs high and couldn't help but smack her. Ajani’s snoring spit out from the throat, and the skin was already dyed with a layer of bright pink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue couldn’t stand it anymore, rushed up and filled her heavily...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sound of a faint teacup bursting next door. That is the room of the wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smiled smugly and suddenly increased his movements. Ajani’s unstoppable snoring was poured into the room of the butterfly through the thin wall. Among them, the silk is lingering and resounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Rogge climbed from Ajani's body, she was already soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani lazily stretched out his arms and hooked Rogge’s neck and fell in his arms. Rogge gently hugged her and whispered in her ear: "Ajani, there is something you can do for me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's face changed a bit, cold and cold: "Don't you say that "I can go to hell" is a fake?" He put down Ajani and began to sit up and dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani hurried up, hugged Rogge from behind and said in a panic: Ge Daren! I don't mean that... you know, this is too incompatible with the beliefs of our elves. I am really embarrassed, I am afraid of me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted coldly, blocking her "can't do it" In the throat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani put her face tightly on Rogge’s back, and a few drops of crystal tears slipped from her cheeks <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to be angry with Rogge. I will do it, for you, I will do everything! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned to be happy, turned back and hugged Ajani, and kissed heavily. Ajani snorted and stretched his arms. I hooked Rogge's neck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has thrown everything away, even if she is going to hell tomorrow, that’s tomorrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saying goodbye to Rogge, Ajani dressed and sneaked out of Rogge’s room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and Rogge’s business, except for the wind butterfly and the rest of the guardian warriors, no one else knows. Rogge repeatedly said that she would not say it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog I relaxed my body, fell on the bed, thought about my heart, and suddenly laughed out smugly. Although he rectified Ajani, the physical strength of the 12th-level swordsman was absolutely not bad. It was also full of fatigue after the war. He stunned and fell asleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room suddenly became strange, a small group Light smoke There was a mysterious snoring in the room. There was a slap-sized flying insect that didn’t know where to dig out and hovered slowly in the room.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has four transparent thin wings on its back, and the body is composed of the forest white bones, followed by a black, full two-inch long tail. Its head turned out to be a pigeon-sized hoe, and its mouth could not open and close, and the hollow eyes flashed a little bit of light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the house After flying for two laps, I smelled the flesh and blood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying worm hovered for a week, and the thin wing received it, and swooped down to Rogge! The sharp tail was desperately Stretching forward, the tip of the six thin legs also found a small pointed claw!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocking in the sleep is dreaming, dreaming The wind butterfly had to give in under his chain of means, and began to undress, seeing a pair of snow peaks to be revealed. Just then, he suddenly felt a cold! A Roggen instinct turned over and fell from the bed to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound, the flying worm’s spikes were placed in the place where Rog was lying, two inches Long scary spikes pierce the bedboard almost! After struggling for a while, he pulled out the tail thorn and quickly flew to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge scared a cold sweat, and all of his sleepiness flew out of the clouds for nine days. He took up the table and the flying insect slammed into the table, but then he wandered around in the air, and the little hoe was on the fangs, and then bite into Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty is now very rich in combat experience, after the initial panic, it is no longer so busy. Moreover, this flying insect is a kind of undead creature. Although the appearance is extremely terrifying, how can he, the necromancer, be afraid of undead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger left his hand to open a light shield, blocking it outside, then two magic arrays appeared in front of him, ten intensified magic missiles flew out The worm blasted into bone powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s scary! Unconsciously, Rogge was already sweaty. He wiped the cold sweat on his body, and now he is not afraid. This inn has already been checked by the elves. How could it suddenly make such a fierce and undead flying insect? It stands to reason that these undead creatures are absolutely unable to escape the search for the eyes of the elves. Moreover, this flying insect is not fatal. It can be used to assassinate others. It is concealed that Rogge is thick and thick, and is most affected by a little injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fat man thinks about it, he immediately knows that the most likely person to do this is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog couldn’t help but be angry, this *** is too unreasonable! I have been working hard to cultivate magic and spiritual strength, and I have made a major breakthrough recently. After some rest, I have to send a flying insect to bite myself. Even if you want to improve your strength, you don't need to be so desperate! ? Also, the smell of this little thing is very weak, if it is not active search, it is difficult to exist. Just in my sleep, relying on the intuition of fat people to escape a robbery, but intuition of this thing, it is luck. Fat people can't expect to have such a keen instinct next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is there more than this strange and undead creature? Even Rogge, the necromancer, has never heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to scream at Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, calling ***, it’s only a bone dragon, and it’s only a few times before it’s called. Now, Roger’s sex begins to call the bones directly. The dragon is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is too small, Gregory can only bend the body as much as possible to stay, and squeeze the table. Rogge also had no place to stay, he simply climbed the back of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory! What is this flying insect!" Rogge angered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the meaning of the owner. She has waited for you to improve my strength and has been impatient! The owner said that your situation is very dangerous now, always beware of someone’s calculations. You. This kind of training is very helpful to improve your intuition about danger.” Gregory replied very docilely. It knows that Rogge's power is now overwhelming it. The wise Gregory has always been very obedient to the strong, not to mention the sinister despicableness of this strong man far from the imagination of the bone dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is the knot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this not to say that I didn’t sleep well every night? How is this going! For the sake of future happiness, this thing must not be accommodating! How can I be in danger if I have a group of guards of the elves' guardian warriors? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace of mind is Rogge's instinct. He thought deeply about the first layer, in case... When he was a woman who was really cool, he was bitten by a big worm on the cock or bitten it. It was not a joke! Don't look at this bug is not big, but just a needle actually pierced the bed! The fat man secretly measures his own strength. If he does not gather mental protection early, how can his fat meat be hard but not wooden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is too noisy! I will never agree!" Rogge sneaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The owner said, this is the case!" The bone dragon replied categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory eased his breath and said: "Master, master, you know, when will the master give you a test, but it is totally unacceptable. So I thought, for your good, you usually pay more attention! I can't sleep too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go back and tell ***! Never allow it to do this! It's too noisy!" Rogge is getting angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is very embarrassed to look at Rogge: "Master of the master, this words...you still have to talk to the owner yourself!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man immediately made a sudden attack, subconsciously blurted out: "nonsense! If I dare to say, still use your message!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly woke up, and he was so rare that he was red. A magician would be afraid of his pet? If you say it, I am afraid that people will laugh at the big teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gregory understands Rogge’s mood very much, which makes the fat man less embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner is always right. I don’t even dare to tell the owner about your words! Even if the story is passed, the master has decided what is going on, certainly not It will be changed. It is better to do it than to let the owner anger! This is good for you, what do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue silently took a shot The head of the bone dragon sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
