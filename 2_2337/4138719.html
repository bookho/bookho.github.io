The knight on the left hand has a long chestnut color, and the color is cold and charming. The knight on the right is bloated, but his eyes are very spirited. These two are Rogge and Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They suddenly stopped, Androni faintly said: "We are surrounded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge smiled a little, raised his hand and drew a few simple magic symbols, and gave Androni a "family power" and "additional skills". He used to be familiar with the oldest three. magic. Androni flashed the magic of the whole body, but she did not appreciate it. Androni turned his head and said coldly to Rogge: "You bless me with so much magic, do you want me to be a meat shield for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Don't you want me to be a magician in the jungle? Isn't it enough to be kind?" Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni stared at Rogge with a sullen look, neither pulling out the stars, nor raising the vindictiveness, only screaming: "Who is sneaky?" Where are you hiding? Give me out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing, the agile figure constantly appears on the trees around the two, a dozen green The longbow aimed at Rogge and Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure flicked from the tree with lightning, and the sword was like a rainbow, and rushed to Rogge. Rogian sat still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted, and the whole man flew up from the dragon, and grabbed the sneak attacker and threw it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is very heavy. She was originally a 16th-level swordsman, and was also blessed by Rogge with the oldest three kinds of magic. The power between the gestures is not the same. So the man took a long time to climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very handsome warrior, a gold fluttering in the wind, wearing a delicate green half-length breastplate, behind a green magic longbow, work The elf's long sword has fallen and is inserted in front of him. But what makes Rogge more interested is his two pointed long ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warrior stood up and looked terrified. Although Androni didn't mean to shoot again, he didn't dare to pick up the long sword that fell on the ground. He carefully observed two dragon horses, and stared at the elf horns roaring around Rogge's waist. Rogge and Androni have a lot of heart, calm and calm, sitting still and not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warrior finally saw enough, and this was a ritual for the two, with the slang of the big 6 slang: "I am the warrior of the Sarah tribe. I ask the two, what is the horn of your waist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge replied coldly in Elvish: "Since you are an elf, at this time When I appear here, how can I not know what this horn represents? Or do you have doubts in your heart, want to try our identity again? In fact, this test, you are not convinced, you are. I still want to try a test. You know the results of one-on-one. I think you are still together! After waiting for the Elf tribe, I will go back and count you with this disrespectful account!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barron was shocked. He just attacked with the idea of ​​trying two people. I didn't expect it to be slammed by Androni and almost broke the bones. As the grandson of Sarah's elders, he was the best fighter in the tribe, but it was so easily packed by Androni. It seems that the twenty soldiers he brought together will never be the opponent of Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White one-horned beast, horn horn, absolute strength, even a few small ornaments on the body are exactly the same as the legend. Everything is so consistent with the description of the elders before leaving, that's right, this is God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is looking forward to seeing the legendary beast of the elves, the unicorn, these two dragons are also the ultimate gods, the faint dragon Wei is to hesitate and can't recognize what it is. But since it is exactly the same as described in the prophecy, there is no reason to doubt it. After all, white unicorns don't have to be unicorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warriors in the surrounding trees also fell and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked closely, the name of the beauty of the elves was really well-deserved. These warriors were all handsome and handsome, and he was very happy. Under his careful resolution, most of these elf warriors are male, but there are also two women. The elves have bows and arrows, and most of the melee weapons used are long swords. There are also a few people who use short swords and scorpions. It is exactly the same as the description in the book. It seems that the elves are not enterprising. Although they have been scattered throughout the millennium, there has never been any change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a closer look at the equipment used by the elves. It can be seen that these warriors use mostly magic-enhanced equipment and are very skilled. The most impressive thing is the complex and beautiful patterns and ornaments on the top. Under the heart of Rogge, he secretly compared the products of the elves with the products of the hammer of the god of war, and the quality of the two is actually not much different. Although the hammer of the god of war is already very flashy, but compared with the elves, this aspect is still inferior. The pattern of the Elf's light armor has no magic effect, just for the sake of good looks. For example, in front of this Barang, the light armor on the body has a hollow pattern! Don't wait for the enemy to attack, do you first empty the armor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally got to know the elf's obsessive attachment to beautiful things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The strength of these elves is barely arguable. They are all about ten fighters and archers. But this is not the most elite warrior in their tribe. Androni said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barang is furious. These soldiers are the elite of the Sala people, and they are considered to be just a matter of strength. This is a great insult to the dignity of the elves! Even if this beautiful and over-sworded swordsman is a servant of God, he can't insult the elf! But he immediately vented his breath. I am a 11-level elf warrior. I can have no resistance under Androni, and I know how terrible her strength is. And God cast three magics between the adults and the laughter. The speed of the spell is that he can't think of dreams. It is clearly the style of a great magister. Where does he know that Rogge is nothing more than a ten-level magician. He relies on a large amount of mental power and casts low-level magic to pretend to be a master of demeanor and deceive the innocent elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are straightforward, that is, they are not right, they are not elaborated. Since Androni is far better than the already, she said that the elves are not very good, and the elves have only defaulted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barang remembered the repeated embarrassment of Sarah’s predecessor, knowing that this welcoming of the gods caused the rise and fall of the family, and never dared to be willful. The land led Rogge and Androni to the depths of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge jumped down to Malay and walked side by side with Baran. Sure enough, as the fat man expected, the elves have lived in the mountains for thousands of years, and their minds are very simple. How can they compare with the merchants who are soaked in the conspiracy? Rogge easily put out the information he wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the jungle of the Central Mountain Range, there are more than ten elves of the tribes. The Sala people are one of the small tribes, but the whole family is only over 500 people. The Sala people have a total of 100 hunting warriors, 20 senior guards, and one of the Presbyterian warriors. It is Baron himself. In addition, the Sala family has two magicians and a sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf tribes of the Central Mountain Range will jointly send highly respected elders to form a home for the elderly. In the event of a major event, the elders have always ruled that all elf tribes must abide by the constraints of the elders. The Presbyterian Church is composed of 81 elders. Each elf tribe sends different numbers of elders to the elders according to their strength. But even if they are small tribes, there will be at least one elder. There are three tribes with only one elder, such as the Sala, and the most powerful ‘forest light’ tribe holds the appointment of eighteen elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sala people are so hard to send all the senior guards to meet themselves, and they are also selfish. There is a powerful elf tribe that lives next to the Sala people. It is a "flying seven-color deer" tribe with six elders. On the mountain where the Sala people lived for generations, there is a very rare ancient tree of the millennium, and each time there is an elf old tree, there will be an elf sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of thirteen elves in the Central Mountain Range. Correspondingly, there are thirteen elves. Three elves old trees are grown in the 'Emerald Sea', the elf capital of the forest. In this way, with 18 elders, the Forest Light Tribe has three sacrifices. It is the name of the Central Mountain Elf. The first big tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Flying Seven-Colored Deer" tribe has been in the past 100 years, and the number of seats in the Presbyterian Church has grown from three to six, becoming the fifth largest tribe. But the tribe is large, but there is no sacrifice, which is not in line with its status. On the other side of the Sarah tribe's residence is adjacent to the fierce orc tribe. For many years, to defend against the orcs, the soldiers suffered serious damage and could not be displayed. The "flying seven-color deer" tribe repeatedly proposed to help the Sarahs to resist the orcs, but the elder Sarah was afraid that the other side had other plans and strongly disagreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten years, the exuberant fertility of the orcs has made the Sala people always in a storm, so the "flying seven-color deer" once again took the opportunity to the elders The hospital proposed to increase the number of troops in Sarah Pass and will vote in the near future. What is further, therefore, the emergence of the second god, the gods will also come, the elves will hold a large sacrifice in advance, and the young talents of the various ethnic groups will compete for various skills, and the top five will be qualified to choose their favorite. The elf woman is a wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Flying Seven-Color Deer" tribe elders' son, Huron Arrow, is the crown of the younger generation of elves, and the swordsmanship and other skills are not bad. Popular candidates. He has already said that once the sacrifice is won, Ferrina, the granddaughter of the Sarah elders, will be proposed. This marriage is 10%, and the "Seven-Colored Deer" tribe merges with the Sala tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, the elves received a message from the horn of the elf, and God made it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara Elder is pleasantly surprised that his tribe is actually the closest to God! He took the initiative and made a good effort to get rid of the gods among other tribes, so as to please God's favor to prevent the fate of the seven-color deer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding all the causes and consequences, Rogge could not help but laugh at the elves who also had the right to fight for power. It’s just that they are too simple, and all the conspiracy is almost plain and clear on paper. It is no wonder that the millennium has lived in the mountains. The elves are not facing the Warcraft Orcs, or the ancient tree snakes. How can human rich conspiracy culture precipitate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barang led Rogge to take some remote trails. Rogge understood that he wanted to avoid other tribes who came to meet God's ambassadors. They didn't say anything at the moment, they talked and laughed all the way, and they walked into the depths of the Central Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is more eye-catching than the Roger of the Far Elves. She is also very interested in the exquisite, clean and beautiful Elf woman. One day, Androni was very close to the two Elf female warriors. When she is daring, she will shoot the face, ears and even the chest of the Elf female warrior from time to time. And the two beautiful elf girls, except for the red face, have no resistance to Androni’s ghostly shots. More importantly, the elves are naturally incapable of resisting beautiful things. Even if Androni does not take the initiative, the elf girls will take the initiative to entangle them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei’s men’s wear has always been a playboy. With her illustrious style, high sword skills, and outstanding identities, both the singer and the aristocratic lady are all hand-to-hand. Her many romantic methods are now used casually. Where can these simple elf girls resist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Androni’s old illness, and the Elf girl came, Rogge only had a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, another line of people came to the old tree of the elves. This team has a strong lineup and is amazing. It consists of more than 100 knights, magicians and Druids. Everyone is not weak. Their mounts are also strange, from ordinary horses to fierce Warcraft. A tall, imposing man is riding a dragon! Beside him, he was a charming woman, wearing a dark blue cloak and riding a tall elk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Taniguchi, the man waved and the whole team stopped. His rough face and Founder's big face have been slightly imprinted with the wind and frost. The long brown shawl is scattered, and three different colored gemstone earrings are attached to the left ear. The man turned his head and said to the woman around him: "Miss Carmela, you are the noble hero of Hilo. With your wisdom eyes, you can distinguish the old tree in the valley in the front. Is it the elf we are looking for? Ancient tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took off the hood of the hood, revealing a charming face and a pair of pointed long ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Frey, I have already said that although Hilo God appointed me to be his god in the gods, I hope more You can treat me as an ordinary elf, instead of treating me with respectful words all day long. You will be sad like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Carmel, we still have to do the right thing first. There seems to be some weirdness. How is this valley dead? There is a place where the old trees exist, it should be alive. According to the news from the church. The people who escorted the horn of the elf should have arrived here. Why can't one see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See him, Cameron The eyes stared at him with a grudge, and then he looked back into the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fried across the three-meter fire red dragon suddenly a little uneasy, from the huge nostrils constantly squirting. It slammed the ground hard, slammed it, and wanted to go backwards. In the heart of Frey, he shouted: "All.... Alert! Send one to see in front, what happened!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fare Druid sang a spell and then turned into a goshawk and flew forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned back and fell in front of Ferry and changed back to human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Freak adults, there seems to be a fierce battle in front of them, killing a few people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Frey and Camela looked at each other and led the crowd to look carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tragic battle around the ancient tree of the elves. Within a few tens of meters, the ground is a black. Several corpses fell to the ground and could not be said to be dead bodies, but a blackened cockroach. Only a few badges on the scattered leaves indicate that they used to be members of the Holy Knights of the Light Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak is heavy, he can't tell who made these members of the Holy Knights look like this. Look at this black mark, it seems to be burned out by the fire. But if it is not magic, how can it burn a living holy knight? If it is magic, he can't sense the residual magic fluctuations. The skill of the Knights of the Holy Knights, Frey is also heard, and according to the news from the church, this time, among the people who escorted the horn of the elf, there are two of the three giants of the last jury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak, although I don’t know who the three giants are, but I don’t think it’s too bad, at least it’s a 14th-level knight. Can it be said that these two giants have now become awkward? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freid is in the middle of a headache, and Camela exclaimed. He was busy passing by, seeing Camela standing in front of the old tree of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A donkey was nailed to the old tree of the elf, and in front of him was another embarrassment, still maintaining the throwing posture . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that time is fixed at this moment, a mysterious force burns all creatures within tens of meters into ashes, while the elves are miraculous The ground is intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small, sleek, swaying horn swayed the eyes of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a horn? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera stepped forward and leaned over to pick up a small white jade horn from the skeleton that was nailed to the tree. The exquisite trumpet horns flashed with soft luster, engraved with countless fine patterns, and it can be seen that it is a very complicated magical array, with a burst of strong magical fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the horn of the elf?" Frey came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like it is exactly the same as described in the gods! It is not known who killed the sacred knight who escorted the horn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freunding is not a human being, it is also a powerful Warcraft or a beast. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freak, you are really wise! Observed so carefully, even my elf can't compare with you. In fact, as long as there is a horn, you can find the elves by playing it. There are Frey adults, I don't need the guards of the holy knights at all, they are dead or not dead, it doesn't matter. Carmela said with a flirtatious manner, and posted to Frey again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak frowned, subconsciously away from Carmela. In the distance, his two men saw this scene and couldn’t help but sneer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah yeah, unfortunately she is wrong, oh! It's a pity, in fact, such a beautiful elf, I haven't seen it in my life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful, if you let the Frey adults know that we are talking about him, they will clean up us! For example, a crow that makes you three days and three nights..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The man was scared and hurryed: "Okay, don't say it, don't say it! Work and do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak is watching Carmela, who plays the horn of the elf, sighs Miss Mela. It’s weird here. I can’t see what power is capable of burning these people alive. Maybe there is something terrible in the vicinity of Warcraft, or wait for someone to thoroughly search around and talk about it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera has thrown a stunned adult to Frey. In the forest, what forces have dared to offend you? Your father, the four great virtues The strength of the sky wrath of one of Ruyi will never be worse than any big magician. If it is World of Warcraft, even if a dragon is hiding next to it, Frey adults, these people who are coming to you are enough to deal with. What's more, even if there are any traps, I am also a 14th-level Elf Knight, fully capable of self-protection. Frey... You care about me so much, how can I repay you?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fry frowns. In the face of Carmela showing love so naked, he only knows. However, this Camela has a rare appearance on the body, and only three or five people can compare it with his own strength. She also has the noble status of God, and is definitely worthy of the identity of her son of Druid. If not... If not... Carmela would be a good candidate for a wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmela is also a bit anxious, since Hilo lowered the gods, appointed her as a god, all the elves around her attitude is respectful . According to the instructions, I came to the North Druid League to find help. When I saw Frey at the first day, she was very worried. But Frey is very respectful to her, but it is actually frosty. The more and more explicit love for her, just to be crazy and stupid. Carmela has outstanding looks and talents in martial arts, so he has never looked at the elves around him since he was a child. Now it’s hard to meet a Frey who can be fully worthy of himself, but he is totally unmoved, so how does Carmela not be anxious? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is anxious. Carmela is very smart, she has been secretly calculating how to get Frey to go to his bed. People like their status, if they have gone to bed, a lot of things will be logical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While thinking about things, Carmela put the horn of the elf at the mouth. She whipped up her anger and covered her with a green smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn horn rang. There was a very powerful energy suddenly in the green fog, and Frey only had time to scream and ‘be careful! ‘, I can only watch a blue light spread to Cameron’s body and turn her into a blue crystal statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light breeze blew through, the blue crystal statue turned into a little bit of a mans, disappeared into the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak only felt a blank in his mind, he reached out in vain, trying to get something in the sky of the stars, but nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t believe his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is actually dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of the war, the hero of the hero, Hilo, blessed, and the god of God, died? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's wrong with the world, isn't the devil coming? Or is the end of the day coming? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred is unable to believe everything he sees. As the eldest son of the Great Druid Sky Wrath, his natural magic power is already strong enough to feel the natural god that Druid believes. He knows the power of the gods, and it is so vast that it is not at his level that can be speculated. Even the father whose one foot is already approaching the gods, I am afraid it is difficult to test the power of the gods. But now, Hilo’s god is dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freund's men are all around, and everyone's face is a panic. All of this has gone far beyond their cognition, and more importantly, it is slowly destroying their long-standing absolute belief in Divine Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freaked by the storm, he made a quick decision and said: "This is a conspiracy! Someone has committed the evil deeds of God! Maintain God's authority and keep nature." Balance is the law of our Druids. The gods will be severely punished! This devil is powerful, but we, the gods of nature, will laugh to the end!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freid, God is dead, what should we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not panic. This devil is so familiar with Hilo's gods, Also killing the gods, it must be a plot to the elves. We will go to the elves, he will certainly appear! Just, the elf tribe 'forest light' has always been good with my father, I know them Where are the territories, we will go to them to disturb for a few days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Frey turned over and rode the dragon, leading everyone to the north. Go. But his heart is not as calm as it seems on the surface. He knows that waiting for him in front of him will never be a smooth road. Perhaps it is the most dangerous part of his life journey of more than 30 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge has stepped into the territory of the Sala people. He has clearly felt the difference in the forest. Although it is also a towering ancient wood everywhere, the sun shines from the treetops without any hindrance. The old trees, small trees, shrubs, and grass are scattered and all share the sunshine. Small animals such as rabbits and civet cats are not afraid of being born. They will always pass through the front of the team, but they are afraid to enter the Longwei range of the two dragon horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a forest full of life, peace and quiet. It is very different from the sallow forest that he has seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From afar, a verdant mountain rises. In the middle of the mountain, there are faintly small green buildings, and the volley is on the old trees. At the top of the peak, there are several huge birds with strange shapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at it, the birds were actually the lion's head, and the claws were sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Balran, how many strange birds are the achievements of the Griffin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barran Very surprised at the high-spirited Rogge's eyesight, although the elf is also known for his good eyesight, but from this distance, he can only see a few black spots. If you haven't known that the few are just the griffins raised in the tribe, he absolutely can't see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults, those are the lions of the Sarah tribe. You are full of miracles, it is hard to imagine, your eyesight can be with the elves Compared with the most famous archers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and asked: "I heard that a lion can carry a warrior, is that the case?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, the griffins themselves are very heavy, so although they are extremely powerful, they can only carry lighter warriors. Our elves are light because of their posture. You can sit on the griffin to fight. But even then, only the adult strong gryphon can carry the Elf Warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gryphon and Elf The archers, that is a very powerful combination! How many lions are there in the Sala? Is it true that all the elves will raise lions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Griffin is the pride of the Sala people. Baron replied proudly: "Our Sarah tribe has more than 50 lions, and only a dozen of them can actually carry the soldiers. But these dozens of griffins are enough for us to resist the orc's attack and hold the Sarah Pass. Many elves have lions, and some tribes will raise other beasts, such as 'The Light of the Forest 'The tribe has raised a few five-color sacred cows. But Rogge adults, to be honest, these sacred beasts are not very good at serving, and the cost is large, so they can’t raise many heads. The lions are among the elves of the elves. It’s a lot of power.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Balan, how did the tribes in the elves form? You know, I am very interested in history." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes the adult a little embarrassed, "I have spent a lot of time on swordsmanship, so I am not very clear about history, I can only tell you Probably. Some of the dozen or so tribes in the Central Mountain Range are the elves who originally lived there, and some of them are tribes that were formed after the defeat of the elves of the millennium. The local elf tribes have their own unique beasts, while the foreign tribes specialize in one or a few skills to keep the elves inherited for millennia. Of course, foreign elves will also raise some beasts, but most of them choose the Griffin. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quietly asked: "So there will be any friction between the local tribe and the foreign tribe?"
