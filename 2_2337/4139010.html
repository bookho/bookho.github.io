			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book, the sixth day of salvation (six)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge discussed with Hughes For a long time, I have not been able to figure out exactly who has such a wonderful ability to destroy the source of faith hidden in the deepest part of the space secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of Xius is completely different from this mysterious character. If the source of faith is likened to a grassland that can nourish all things, then Xiusi will use a channel of his body and soul to drain the water and nutrients under the grassland, and eventually the entire grassland will be exhausted. The mysterious figure spreads the plague on the grassland. Although the speed of plague expansion is not fast, the plague is extremely sinister, and the past is not alive. As long as it takes time, the entire grassland will be dead. vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two young foxes discussing and discussing, just at this moment, a series of footsteps sounded on the stairs, and a crisp voice came immediately. "Elders of Shusi, who are you talking to? Why can't I feel that there are people around you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the words, Effie is like a gust of wind The same goes from the second floor. Her pale blond hair curled slightly, and most of the blonde hair was bundled into a ponytail in the back of her head. The forehead horns and the silky hair of the silky hair were added, adding a little maturity to the clear water elf. Effie was covered in crystal armor with a crystal bow engraved with twelve statues of the Great Elf, and the other hand was holding a lot of pieces of piece of magical material. I don’t know. How much is the magic material she has caught in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie turned the corner of the stairs, suddenly stopped and opened his mouth. For a time, just standing still in place. With a bang, the magic material and the crystal bow slipped from her hand and fell to the ground, but she was unaware of it, just staring at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is also very surprised. Like Effie, he has not sensed anyone on the second floor. For the current Rogge, this is simply an incredible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very quiet hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes quietly stood up. Silently flashed out of the building. But he just walked out two steps, and if Effie had a hurricane, he blew from behind him and slammed it with Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes had not had time to scream, and a strong force came from behind and blew him out of the broken door. Behind Hughes, there are countless pieces of furniture and tables and chairs. Immediately after the small building was shaken, the outer wall was loose, the vines broke, and even the thick pillars began to crack, which was a catastrophe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes has just established a steady pace, and when he smiles and wants to say something, he hears a slamming sound, and the crystal is flashing. The crystal bow in the hands of Effie was wiped by him from the side of the body, deeply immersed in a boulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar can’t keep coming out of the small building, and the small building is constantly shaking, like the saplings that can’t live in the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another roar, and the small building suddenly stopped strangely, in a blink of an eye. It has been scattered into countless tiny pieces of debris, falling down, and pressing Effie and Rogge in the fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original exquisitely small building has become a ruin, completely still ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves in the valley are doing their own thing and continue to conduct the magical ritual without any hope in an orderly manner, completely turning a blind eye to this earth-shattering battle in the corner of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound, there is a breeze blowing from the small building. The breeze immediately turned into a horrible tornado, with countless pieces going to the sky. This tornado is quite different from the ordinary tornadoes, and it is more than a hundred times more violent. However, it is delicate and gentle. It is also very imaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie is standing on a green grass, just looking at the sky. There was still some faint red on her cheeks. The silk hair was also wet with sweat, and it was tightly attached to the delicate forehead of the curve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is standing on the ground, the grass is covered with filth, and there is no trace of debris. I can’t see that there has been a two-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, he always has so many things to be busy, even now." Ai Feier said, there is a vague sorrow and sadness in the plain voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hius looked at Effie’s back and sighed, saying: “He is also involuntarily, and the time he can do for him is no longer More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie snorted, she took a shot, the crystal bow flew out of the boulder and returned to her hand in. She gently stroked her hand to make a crystal bow. After a while, she said: "Elders of Shusi, you are just preparing to sacrifice yourself to destroy the source of faith in this plane. This is not the elephant's style!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes haha ​​smiled and said: "This is very simple! In fact, my old man has a body outside, and there are countless bodies, although not as much as Silro can be said to be worth hundreds of millions. Lord, but there are always hundreds of avatars. The source of the faith that destroys this plane consumes at most one of my old people's avatars. What's the big deal? Hey, even Rogge's kid knows how to try to give How many old people can leave this way, how can my old man make such a sacrifice to himself and take care of himself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Effie looked Hughes glanced at him and suddenly said, "Do you have only one teacup in your tea set?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes didn't answer, just coughed twice. I found an excuse to leave in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any time, troubles and pains seem to be the rights of a few wise men, and most people live daily and mechanically and repeatedly. Day after day, year after year, they care only about a small area around them, and how tomorrow's life should continue. They also have pains and worries, and they are worried about things that are very important to them, but these things, no matter how important they seem, can be ridiculous if they are viewed from the perspective of the whole plane. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wise men are not happy, they sometimes sorrowful, sometimes cynical, they try to make the world wake up, but most of the time. They will only be treated as mad. In the eyes of these secular people, the interests of the individual in front of themselves are far more important and real than the emptiness of the existence of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge can also be said to be a wise man. He strolled on the streets of Lille, and looked at the crowds who were rushing through. There is a passionate and enthusiastic atmosphere in the city of Lille. Whether it is aristocrats or civilians, most of the talks are about the Civil War. In their view, the most ambitious war in the millennium is nearing the end, since Dagong has personally led the army into the Asrofik Empire. Then this northern hegemon has been doomed to the fate of demise. In addition, the Dro Empire has been defeated and surrendered, so the three empires of the world have only the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But now even an ordinary civilian knows. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was beaten by Alexander in the war. The main force was almost completely paralyzed, and it could not be compared with the Principality of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is only one overlord, the great Bavarian Principality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats of the Principality are concerned about the title, power and wealth of the newly added vast territory, while the civilians are immersed in the uniqueness of the victorious people. In arrogance, I talked dissatisfiedly about other countries. And unrealistically imagine how much wealth the residents of the slavery can bring to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Rogge, these people are like pigs that have been placed on the woodpile, and they will turn into other people’s meals, but still I don't know, I still talk about how delicious tomorrow's food will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly, a trace of mercy rises from his heart, but then it is like a smoke. Rogge’s heart was as light as ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not care about the lives and deaths of the world, this is where he differs from the wise. So there are no worries of the wise men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue, as an ordinary person, walked leisurely through the city of Lille, and in a twinkling of an eye came to the Grand Residence. Different from the past, today the Grand Duke is cold and clear, the door is closed, and only a few listless soldiers are standing in front of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is on the move. A step has already appeared in the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duchy is quietly, with some dust everywhere, under the corner of the corner, and even a few spider webs, obviously no one has been more than one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaguely, Rogge has already guessed what happened here. Occasionally, his eyes can not only see the future, but also the past. He walked inwards. In the study of Catherine. Have a familiar taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her study and Rogge’s memory are exactly the same, very neat. All books and documents are well organized. On the large purple gold sandalwood desk, there are piles of files waiting to be processed. At the corner of the table, there is an ink stand, and there is a quill pen decorated with a gold pattern on the stage. In the middle of the desk, there is an open file, and half of the review is written below the file. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word is like a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review is written with the aristocratic common deer flower body, the perfect power reveals great power, Rogge knows, this is Catherine's handwriting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the owner of the study seems to have just left in a hurry. Only the floor and the desk have accumulated dust, and the ink in the ink station has completely dried up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time in the study seems to have solidified some time ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood at the door, his eyes swept across the study, and finally landed on the ground in the middle of the room. There, a dagger was lying quietly. The dagger is dull, covered with rust, and looks like a baptism for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked over and leaned over to pick up the dagger and gently stroked the blade that had been corroded by the rust. He knew that just a few days ago, the dagger was still shining, just like the dagger in the hands of Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul blade is not very famous, but it is a very unique artifact. There are two soul blades, they are completely consistent in all aspects, this is another magical thing. With Rogge’s ability today, it is natural to know that only miracles can create two things that are exactly the same. The soul blade has the singular effect of absorbing and erupting the soul. Originally, this is a supreme weapon for dealing with undead creatures. However, in the hands of Hughes and Catherine, the nature is an alternative effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This soul blade in the hands of Rogge has been completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and carefully noticed the bit of information uploaded by the soul blade. Gradually, an intermittent picture was generated in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, Rogge sighed deeply and opened his eyes. His hands are empty, and the soul blade has turned into countless particles, dissipating in the breeze that passes through the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and walked outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than the study, the entire Grand Duchy is full of unbearable sorrows and sorrows, even if the mind is hard and cold, if you don't want to stay here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every step in the way, Rogge’s heart will be filled with some little about Catherine. Almost all of the memories associated with her are full of blood, hatred, conspiracy and sorrow. For Catherine, Rogge was initially neglected. After Andronie’s death, the fat man hated the bones of this woman who had nothing to do with it. But just after he betrayed his past and converted to Dissmason, he still can't help this woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She killed her own sister and killed Androni and Rogge’s children. But she also gave birth to a child for Rogge, although the fat man has never been able to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is perfect and ruthless, intelligent and able to break. The fat man thought he had a good understanding of her, but he did not expect that she was so staunch at this last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of what? proud? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly discovered that he never really knew her from beginning to end. Originally as an rival, he should know her very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a bit, maybe because of this, he never really defeated her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the slight sigh, his figure gradually became blurred and disappeared from the Grand Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
