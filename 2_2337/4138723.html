Frey said incoherently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" The more you smile, the more happy you are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the fat man’s smile disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" Rogge said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to play Androni’s idea? No doors! Is this idiot geek man also seeing Androni is a woman dressed as a man? Rogge thought secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this transaction does not need to consider Rogge. Androni is full of grace and strong swordsmanship. Behind him is a wealthy family. The master is a contemporary Juggernaut. Both brothers are also a momentary talent. Just because of the small price of the North Druid League, which is the same as the Farmers’ Federation of the Country, I want to change to Androni? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You *** Spring and Autumn Dreams! Want to grab my woman?" Rogge yelled! He turned to think again: "No, this kid seems to have a lot of background, although I don't know how he is, but I don't want to be afraid of everything! Be sure to guard against his back!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not just a deal for Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of Alexis, Rogge’s world seems to have lost its center of gravity. In the runaway, the last little warmth in his heart also passed away with the wind. It is. The design has killed two adventurous angels to increase his self-confidence. In this world, absolute power is not the only way to win. Although in the battle between angels and green dragons, the biggest siskin is actually ***, but Rogge knows that if he is really dangerous, it seems that he will never be obedient, he will certainly not hesitate to save himself. his. This is an intuition derived from the depths of his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni, after getting along these days, he really has the idea of ​​marrying her. Elysses is dead, and the statue of the angel who broke into the hell is taken from the pope. I don’t know what year to succeed. From the perspective of marriage, Androni is really the best object that Rogge can find. What's more, let's throw away her quirks, she is a big beauty who is a country. Under the unruly appearance, she is actually a very simple girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer I get along with her, the more Rogge feels that she can’t give up. Now the fat man is no different from the past, although facing the deep-rooted organization of the North Druid League, but Rogge is not the little role that has to be traded under the suppression of power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For today's Rogge, Androni is absolutely not tradeable! Here, Frey will answer this question. The wrath of the sky is here. He will answer this way. Even if the Pope is in front of him, the answer is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak looked at Rogge’s face, his mood was uncertain, he was happy and angry, and there was a meditation, then his face floated with tenderness, and at the end he glared at himself, fundamentally Without any consideration, the possibility of all transactions was blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frei asked himself to make such a daring gambler with a false god, and the price he offered was really high. Judging from the thorough anti-drugs of the Eroge plan, his vision is definitely not going anywhere. It should not be an unreasonable person who asks for the price. Then why would you dismiss the proposal that you are so generous? Unless there is a very large organization behind this fake god, the whole elf is drawn. But Frey thought about it. In the vast north, all the powerful forces of the city will not be unaware. These forces will not attempt to the elves, because that means a full-scale war with the city of clouds! There is no power to be willing to fight with the city of Yunxiao. This is very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He privately advocated giving more than 10,000 elves to Rogge, but it also took great risks. Going back this time, the wrath of the sky still doesn't know how to punish him. It’s just that since I saw Androni’s side, Frey’s heart is full of blue-eyed figures. As long as they can be together, Frey can no longer bear any consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally realized! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, only the word love can make countless heroes bend, so that thousands of heroes can be crowned with anger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only love words are not tradable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak 骂 骂 骂 骂 , , , , , , 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂 骂It seems that this Rogge is also deeply rooted in the blue-swordsman's sentiment, and he is also the same person with himself! At this moment, Frey suddenly had a kind of sadness in his hometown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out to shoot Rogge’s shoulder, but was stopped by Rogge coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak understands the smile, very intimately whispered: "Brother, you are also the same person, I understand! I am so sorry! I know that my request is too rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly stunned, and said when did I become a fellow with you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will refute his mouth, but Frey snorted and stopped the fat man’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, you don’t have to say anything, I understand your mood! No matter where we are, we are always a minority, we can only always Your true thoughts are hidden deep inside! Our pains are the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat face begins to white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French took advantage of Rogge’s shoulder and sighed with a sigh: “It’s still a good life outside. I heard that among the nobles of the Terran nation, You and I have a lot of people with the same interests. It is not difficult to find a friend! Even many nobles can publicly announce this matter!" He lowered his voice and was a brother. Do you know that we must pay attention to nature and balance in everything we do? . People like you and me live in the Druid League, and this taste is really bad! Looking for thousands of people in the family, but there is no confidant! When I was twelve years old, there was a maid who wanted to recommend her pillow. It was the first time I knew the true thoughts in my heart! You think about it, a little boy, this kind of thing can't tell others, how painful it is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, regardless of Rogge's complexion How, Frey poured out the distress of burying in his heart for more than 20 years. This includes a few episodes of love. Fortunately, the fat man knows a lot about the evil things in the aristocratic ***, and the fellows are good. They are not just one or two, they can still stand it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s face is blue and white, facing Frey’s endless confession, it’s really not I know what to say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy for him to come to an end. Frey is very affectionate: “Brother, I have worked hard for more than 20 years. Tolerance, until today, I met you a know. This kind of feeling is not enough for outsiders! Not enough for outsiders! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took another shot of Rogge: "Brother!" Although I am as good as you, I envy your good fortune and find him such a fascinating lover! But I will not give up, I will try my best to take him away from you! The love field is like a battlefield. I will not be polite on this, and I will do it all by myself! In addition, if there is a place where I need help, you open your mouth! As long as I can get it, there will never be any dodge! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally got a chance, Zhang mouth said: "In fact, I..." was exported and was stopped by Frey.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know! I will keep you secret! Although we only met for the first time, we saw it as it was! You can rest assured that I will never say anything about your business! If you have a confidant in life, what else do I have to ask for? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger opened his mouth and tried to speak, but he still took Frey back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"brothers! Everything is gone! "When it was said, Frey turned and strode away. It was awesome and full of domineering look at this back!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; far away, there was a cry Long sigh: "Life is really lonely! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha ha!" Androni laughed so arrogantly that he hated Rogge's teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei, who changed back to men’s clothing, has always been very arrogant. She leaned back on the chair and a pair of amazing legs were placed high on the table. Have fat eyes straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Laughter! I kindly let you beware of that Frey, you actually laugh like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that you just spit?" Androni suddenly looked tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha!" She was laughing again, through The ground was planted and planted from the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is very angry and hates the earth: "Good! You laugh at you! Don't blame me for anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge!" Androni stopped him and walked up. The big eyes of a pair of dead people were all dangerous temptations. She put her hand on Rogge's shoulder, and placed her chin on the back of her hand. She looked at him like this, almost to the tip of the nose with Roger's nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty frowns: Don't seduce me! You can't be touched by a man? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni put a long finger on Rogge's chin and smiled: "I have been touched by you anyway, and again." what is the relationship? Besides, now I am touching a man, not letting a man touch me. I suddenly said, you are also a little cute, so you can stand it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up straight, stretched out, lazily said: "I don't play with you, I have to sleep, go out." You lie to the elf, and I am also working hard. So 20% of all the elves belong to me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smiled bitterly and shook his head out. He was now very angry with Androni, and he was still in the hands of God. There are countless beautiful elf girls there, but they can only see that they can't eat. This kind of depression is not enough for outsiders.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferry returns home After that, he was unhappy, and he sat alone under the moon, sighing and sighing. His men were all face to face, although they knew that the master’s knot was there, but they could not be applied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short time, Prague also came back. After listening to Frey's situation, he immediately came to the courtyard and shouted: "Freak adults! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak looked at Prague with a glimpse of Mr. Lager, you should not persuade me. This time it is really helpless."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prague smiled: "Freak, I also understand that you are different from the past. I saw you so seriously for the first time, naturally I can’t sit back and ignore it. The name of the blue-sworded swordsman is Andrei, and I heard that the sword technique is not weak. The old man used the eyes of nature to observe it for a while, and now he has a very light purple gas on his body. This is the soul-bound magic. Traces indicate that the god has given him a bondage. Although I don't know what it is, I still have some confidence in unlocking it. Maybe you will have some surprises!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye’s eyes lit up and said, “Really? Really?! Good, go get ready!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a short time, the small courtyard was like a pot. All the Druids, Rangers, Knights, and Jungle Warriors were called by Frey and told them to follow the cloth. Grid instructions must be in by tomorrow night, he gave everything a good layout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone in the hospital was too busy to fly, Frey smirked and walked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly frowned and thought: "Although the situation is like a battlefield, it is too much to be sorry for the brothers. Well, I will help him a little. How much is apologetic. In the future, the brothers have something to do, how much can I help? How about it? Fortunately, I left the first hand, and did not say to the elders of the 'Land of Light', the elders of Elmer, Cameron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted: "Where are you! Prepare the horse! I am going to see Elder Elvin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The second day of the Senate’s debate was greatly out of Rogge’s expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fat man has a well-thought-out attitude. He pointed out that the elves have not been tempted to make progress and have no change in the past millennium. Then they turn around and turn the millennium back into a prosperous pre-war battle. The holy place is in his god. Under the leadership of the whole, all the elves will build the cloud little by little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods are vague, and the prophecy is that no one can really understand what it means. It seems that the prophets of the past and the present have liked to be mysterious. In fact, this is normal. If people can understand at a glance, how do they appear to be inscrutable and profound? The prophets made prophecies, and most of them were afraid that they would not be right when they did not, and they ruined their own future generations. Therefore, the prophecies often made such explanations, so the explanations are correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the prophets are always right, no matter what happened in later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophets of the Elves did not think that after the millennium, they were cheaper and fatter, so that he would make this fake god in the elders’ home, in front of the tree of life, arrogant and chaotic. Solve the meaning of God. But the fat man's solution is still in the blink of an eye, plus the identity of his god, can not help but the elves do not believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is not interested in what the Holy Land is built to lead the elves in the forest. The promotion of official wealth can only be realized in the human kingdom. As for the real thoughts in his heart, treating these elves as the team that climbed up in the human world, can't now shed the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, 'The Light of the Forest' is not willing to leave their land in any case, and is unwilling to leave the capital of the elves - the Green Sea, to set foot on that Unpredictable journey of the millennium return. The elf tribes that accompanies the 'light of the forest' account for the vast majority. In particular, Rogge’s explanation of the gods is not necessary to leave the land. This made Rogge couldn't help but conceal that he didn't think enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Sala and the ‘flying seven-color deer’, two other elf tribes are willing to follow the steps of the gods and make Rogge happy. Originally, this abduction of the elves, with the nearly 10,000 elves of Sarah and the seven-color deer tribe, he is already very satisfied. Although the newly added two elf tribes are small and small, there are only more than 7,000 elves, but the benefits of white, the fat can complain too little? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day the meeting of the Presbyterian Church is still unhappy. On the way back to Rogge, Frey had already waited there. He already knows the results of the meeting of the Presbyterian Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frera took Rogge’s hand and took him to the side to talk. In just a few steps, Rogge got a shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brothers!" Frei’s heart was long and thoughtful. "I already know the results of the meeting of the Presbyterian Church. The water can carry the boat, and it can also overturn the boat! You get With so many elves' trust, this burden can be difficult to pick. Some words don't need me to say more, you are a human being, not a druid, in the middle of so many fanatic elves, what if there is something wrong, then It’s not a joke. There is something that needs my brother and me in the future, even if I send a letter. My brother is too sorry for you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good word. When the fog is full, when will Frey live on his brother? The fat man couldn't help but have a cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is sorry for me? What did this kid do with me? He did not tell the elves about what I am a fake god!" Is this sorry for me? Haha, it’s an idiot geek!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fat man was thinking, Fred was holding the hand of Rogge’s hand. Take care! "After waiting for Rogge to say something, he turned around and left, and disappeared in the blink of an eye on the other side of Long Street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is busy with his hands on clothes I rubbed it on.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a moonless night. In the evening, the elves who love nature are not willing to go out. Not to mention the cool outside of the late autumn style.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge returns to his residence, Ander Ronnie has not returned yet. Since the day of the Green Sea, Androni has become a celebrity, even more famous than Rogge. The name of 'Water Blue Juggernaut' does not know when it is in the Elf girl. It’s spread. Although the nickname is exaggerated, it’s not too far from the facts. Now Androni is half-something into the sanctuary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In addition to loving beauty, the elves also worship heroes. Androni has both, and has the etiquette and elegance cultivated by the rigorous training of the giants. Elves are now fatal among her every night elf girls hang out, often transit through the month, will come back <br <br /> & nbsp />;.. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;What's more, the black crystal stores almost all the magical experience of Elysses. Faced with such a treasure, but there is not enough magic to try to dig, how does Rogge not worry? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he had ordered the guard to guard the meditation except for Androni before entering the house, but by convention, Rogge was still around the meditation room. There are several magical warning traps. What is true about Faye's mouth, what is the real face, remains to be seen, Rogge is not simply able to believe him from the first impression. God knows if this kid will make some means behind the scenes. Rogge is a very good person, and he is doing a very comprehensive job of prevention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was set up, and he went to the Chamber of Meditation with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge did not expect that, Frey did make some means behind him, but not for him, but for Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Androni is silent and marching like a ghost. Not far from there is an elf warrior in front of her, who is leading her to a remote woods on the edge of the Green Sea wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni with a sneer, holding a starry sky, flying in the air, the whole person is filled with murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf male warrior actually ran to himself and said that he had teased his unmarried wife and insulted his honor, so he must challenge himself! Joke, I have more elf girls in Androni, who remembers which one? What's more, I sent it to my door. Why don't you care for your unmarried wife? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, since he dares to challenge the door, it is really sorry for him not to interrupt his legs. This kind of self-reliant guy must be good. Lessons, or else I will come to fight with me one by one. If I have those leisure workers on Rogge, I will not kill this guy who offends myself. Just knock off a few bones." Androni sneered Think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elf warrior led her away, Androni felt that it was wrong. Although this is a trap, she is not afraid at all, she wants to see, and who is the ambush in the end. Now she has the dual attributes of sacred and starry sky, both offensive and defensive, plus the sword skills are erratic, even if the number of elves is no more useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siege is not working for the current Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Warrior was just set up on a clearing in the woods, and Androni’s cold voice almost rang with him: “You have successfully cited me. Come, the role of your bait is over. To punish your poor acting, let you lie a few more days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elf warrior suddenly turned back, this scare is not the same! He had a crisp bone shatter on his knees, and then a huge pain was uploaded from his legs. He was screaming at the mouth, but he was shot in the back of the brain by Androni and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked around this seemingly uninhabited forest, and it was faintly confusing. There seems to be something here that is faintly touching the depths of my mind. a place. Androni took a deep breath and faintly revealed the blue light. He said, “Get out of the way!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a low and melodious sound in the forest. Sigh, "Life is really lonely..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stalwart figure came out of the forest, tall, handsome, and full of charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked slowly, like a mountain, but there was an infinite ** hidden in the voice: "I finally saw such a beautiful blue! Ander Strong, why is it? Why are you killing the elves of the elves? But this is not important, the important thing is that we can meet and meet here. I am the son of the wrath of the sky in the Great Druid of the North. Ray."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni frowned and looked at the ridiculous man who was facing the opposite. This idiot, will not see that he is a woman, right? She suddenly remembered, Frey? Is it Rogge and the man he mentioned? Androni immediately had a cold all over the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Frey, Androni’s smiles are so perfect, so brilliant! Because of her existence, the entire forest is filled with the sun at noon on winter! For the sake of laughter, what is the 10,000 elf? It is worthwhile to hand over the entire Elf family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a spell faintly in the woods. Androni's face was cold, and he slammed into a bullet, and a thin blade of starry air struck the direction of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak suddenly wakes up, and he never imagined that Androni was so keen, and instantly felt the position of Prague where magic was cast. Now that the spell is too late, he only had time to roll a reel, a row of vines suddenly appeared, blocking the starry air, and then all the vines turned into blue, dissipating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak is not too small, you actually built a 16-level vindictive! Who is your teacher? Really Pross? I am really stupid! The obvious characteristics of the starry sky are not seen! It turns out that you are the most proud disciple of Star Sword Pross! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately made a fuss in his heart. The wickedness of Prosecus is notorious among the people who stepped into the sanctuary. He was going to break Andrew. After Ronnie's bondage, she was forced to take him down, and then slowly let him change his mind. But if he wins him now, he will offend Pross. If this sword saint is brought to the door, can his father It’s really hard to say that it’s hard to win.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, even if Prossi doesn’t know, Androni has already completed 16 temperament, from Sanctuary Only one step away from the strength, how can I retain her when I am sure? In fact, he still does not know that Androni has the duality of the temperament, if you know, I am afraid to immediately evacuate.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is still going on.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiles coldly, the blue flame never stops, will Her whole person is covered, and there is a faint white light from the inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is any magic, may wish to release it Again. She looked at Frey slantingly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was as good as electricity, and the sacred attribute greatly improved her magical resistance, trying to deal with her with magic. It's not that easy. Unless it's a wide-ranging killing magic, the average magician wants to lock her with a single magic, and the door doesn't.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is finally Finished.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash of light...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everything is as before, just like this The lightning has never happened the same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sneered, waiting for a long time is such a strange magic? She is about to laugh at it, but suddenly I feel that something is broken in my brain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like a crystal cup on the ground...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly has a clear mind, her world has been covered with a layer of gauze, and now this layer of gauze has been removed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She is stunned, The scenes of these days have flashed like a flash of lightning, and finally settled in the dragon cave, and then there is endless pain...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously Between her, she has already made a tear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, she really understood what was born, like a nightmare to wake up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did these pains hide in the past? Who was hidden?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath, Ben The extremely white and pretty face is now completely without a trace of blood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni opened his eyes, now more than ten people have surrounded themselves, Ray was slamming his hands across the opposite side, and his eyes were filled with enthusiasm and uneasiness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to leave me? "There is no feeling in her voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... is a bit abrupt. I am not malicious, not malicious! I just thought... no..." "Freid suddenly became stammered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said nothing, turned and left.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay! You dare to despise the wrath of the sky..." Before the reaction of Frey, the two men stopped in front of Androni.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is like a walk, and he wears the encirclement. She was relaxed, but disappeared in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven or eight encirclement members suddenly fell down, and when they touched the ground, the whole person was divided into several pieces, and the blood poured out from the body as a fountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak was overwhelmed by the sudden change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freida, she actually puts such a heavy hand, clearly did not put the sky anger in the eyes! Even if she is a disciple of Prossis But the wrath of the sky will not be afraid of the starry swordsman!" One of his men said angrily, but his voice was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prague does not know when to drill out of the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Freak, Pross and Andre are arrogant, not so rude, it seems that the god made a lot of things for Andre. And these things are still very important. Now we successfully broke his bondage on Andre, and made him so rude. It seems that the god is a very brilliant magician, although the magic is not good, But what is the magic of this soul bondage, even my 13th-level magician can't see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and watched The body of the land, the voice is a bit awkward: "Freak, Andrea's strength is far beyond our estimation. I think, even if we can catch him, the loss of manpower will be too heavy. And the old man is afraid that he will Injury to the Frey adults. With the old man's meaning, after returning to the North Druid League, be prepared, and then go to Pross to calculate the account is good! Stars Juggernaut is strong, there are only a few apprentices Only, that is comparable to our North Druid League, just the advanced Druid, The Master, the Warrior, and the Assassin are not only one hundred people. Let's go back first, and the sky wrath will come out, even if Pross is unreasonable, this time must let him bow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak understands what Prague is saying. Although the main characters present are magicians and Druids, the vision can be different. He and Prague both saw that Androni had a few swords, and if he had the heart, he could also cut Frey into several paragraphs. This is like the lightning-fast swordsmanship of the light stone, which is unstoppable. If Andrea was forced to rush in the Green Sea, there would be no senior soldiers who could stop him. At that time, he could completely fly away after killing Frey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fry nodded, his eyes were full of pain. In any case, he didn't expect things to go to this point. I didn't expect Androni to actually leave so much room. There are many people living in it, and there is no reconciliation between the wrath of the sky and Pross. Even if Frey wanted to reconcile, Prossis was notoriously arrogant and unreasonable, and would certainly ignore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Andre, after that, fear is no longer possible. He suddenly felt a pain in his heart and finally passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak's life, or to be lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is sitting in the quiet room and is immersed in his spiritual world. Three cups of hot tea floated in the air, and it was slowly moving around him along the track that contained the mystery. When the teacup is slightly tilted, there will be tea overflowing. In this way, Rogge exercises his own control of mental power while meditating. He hasn't figured out ways to improve his mental strength, just to find more ways to use that huge amount of spiritual power. His spiritual strength is like a treasure, and none of the ten that can be used now. In addition to this stupid method, he can't think of other ways to increase his control of mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his familiar blue energy rushed to the side with amazing heights, it was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bang, the door of the quiet room suddenly shattered, and the watery blue swords that flowed around blew the teacup into pieces and splashed with hot tea. Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked, his blue light appeared in the blink of an eye, and the blue sky was pointing at him with an unparalleled height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he no longer wants to hide what he is. Fortunately, the exercise of mental control is not necessary to re-aggregate the spirit. With his spiritual strength, he made a full effort under the blue sky, and his feet were on the ground. The whole person, like a big ball, flew backwards. With a slamming sound, he hardly knocked down the half of the wall and ran outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s blue sky suddenly became almost out of control, rising upwards and stabbing the air. She was taken aback, and in her many years of fighting, she never had this kind of thing! However, although she was surprised, her men were not slow, and they still followed Rogge to the outside of the house. In the hands of the stars, the peacocks opened their screens, and they burst into a large piece of Blu-ray, and sprinkled them to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Rogge, the glaring silver light shone. He raised his hand and pointed at Androni. There were more than ten black flames in the air, and they hit Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was surprised again. This seems to be the magic used by Elysses. How will Rogge also? And he didn't swear at all, nor did he draw any magic symbols! But this low-level magic can't help her. Androni was shaken by hand, and dozens of stars and temperament shot from the sword, and scattered dozens of black flame balls. She can feel the power of the black flame is quite large, more than the power of the general fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this breathing, Rogge drives his magic with his mental power, and he becomes seven or eight black flame balls to Androni. Throw it. She calmly waved her sword and picked up the flame ball one by one. The third Rogge has only three flame balls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sneered a little, she knew that Rogge’s magic was running out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars of the stars once again brought up a starlight and pointed to Rogge’s throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge flashed a trace of despair, his hands stretched out, screamed, and rose to the last magic, his left hand condensed half of the black light shield, and his right hand appeared half silver Light shield, double shield, and meet the blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a glare in the intersection of the shield and the sword, and Androni couldn’t help but shake it. Rogge sat down on the ground, his coat disappeared, and his body was filled with countless thin blood, and the starry sky was just at his throat. Although the tip of the sword is one inch away from his skin, the starry temper that is constantly spurting out condenses a small piece of blue crystal on his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Rogge, the silver light dissipated and restored a clearing. He snorted and didn't look at the tip of the blade at the throat, struggling to stand up and look at Androni, without shrinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s big eyes are full of tears, and she bit her teeth and said, “You stunned me when I was in a coma. I!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Did you know it today?" Rogge was shocked and he added himself to Androni. The magic has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have known it for a long time, but today I really understand what happened!" Androni hates the extreme, and the tip of the starry sky is moving forward. I ordered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and said: "I didn't expect to die in your hands. You are because I have been there once, afraid of the future." And Froya no longer has a possible combination, so I hate me so much? It’s good, it’s a bad thing to die under your sword! It’s a pity that I planned to overthrow the bright church for so long, but it just started. It’s already the fate that Furo said! Let’s do it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni closed his eyes and was stabbed with a sword, and Luo These days, when the grid met, but the scene flashed in front of the eyes. She and Rogge talked about the ancient road together at the foot of the mountain. Rogge made a pair of boots for her. The two together prepared for the gods, and they bargained with him to help Fu Luoya and the allegiance family. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, it seems, very warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has experienced this warmth since the hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge struggled under the poison of the dragon, he laughed at his green face for a long time...<br /><br />&nbsp ;Andnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni opened his eyes and gently said: "No matter what you did, after all, you saved my life with the tears of angels. I have always had a grudge, Androni has never I owe you humanity, I will save you three times and then kill you! You will... let yourself be good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said, she put away the stars, but she looked Extremely lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reached out and pulled the blue crystal in his throat, and a blood was marked. Androni's face changed, but she still resisted. Rogge tore off a piece of clothing, blocked the wound, and sneered: "Besides the person I trust suddenly started to deal with me, otherwise, it is not so easy for others to kill me! I want to save me three times, I am afraid that you have to wait." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was sad in her heart, she bit her lower lip: "You are good! I am gone!" She leaped gently and landed. Wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
