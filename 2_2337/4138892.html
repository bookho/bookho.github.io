			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelfth twelfth movement of the twelfth chapter of the first chapter of the tale of the late chapters<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two-story stained-glass window shines in the grand and magnificent hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the hall is a high platform with the only luxurious seat in the entire hall. The simple style cannot hide the art masters two centuries ago. Zhe's extraordinary taste, the elegant crown-shaped hand-carved woodcut on the top of the high backrest is the only decoration on the entire chair. At this time, a majestic middle-aged man sat in a high chair. He was bathed in the morning sun, with his hands on his jaws and his eyes closed and closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the top floor of the Chaoshan Legion headquarters. It was originally used as a military conference room and doubled as a hall dedicated to the goddess of nature. Frederick is the most devout believer of the natural goddess. His intention to do so is to ask the natural goddess to protect the military operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s not the same thing for the fat man. He hates the goddess of nature and his followers. As for the military conference, he is now against the Chaoshan Legion. The military operations are laissez-faire and there will be no military meetings at all. Therefore, as soon as the fat man grasped the real power, he removed it and cleaned it up and re-arranged it into a model of the Temple of the Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the natural goddess is not in heaven, then she naturally belongs to the kind of heresy. Repression or probation of heresy is a sign of faith and piety, so Rogge’s move is of course strongly supported and appreciated by Macbeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that at the moment the gods are not the supreme god, nor the god of any one god. Rogge puts a throne directly, let Mike White sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth also deported at the beginning, but Rogge said that people in the vulgar are too mean. Direct worship of the Lord God is a disrespect to the Lord God. They should dedicate to Macbeth, and then Macbeth will pass on the faith to the Lord God of Heaven, so that they can behave in a proper manner. When it comes to speaking, Macbeth is certainly not a rival to Rogge. After he lobbied, he had to sit on the throne of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, the people of the Chaoshan Legion never entered this hall. But the generals of Rogge’s own troops are reporting here to Rogge. The fat man stood in front of Macbeth side, and the generals would first bow to Macbeth. Then it was Rogge. Rogge does not have tables and chairs, and everyone stands alone in the matter of discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said that no one is qualified to sit before the glory of Macbeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, Macbeth suddenly remembered the Pope and Augustus who had sat in front of him, and of course a Catherine. However, Catherine's later respect for Macbeth also made him very satisfied. Therefore, the four-winged angel of tolerance decided to forgive her initial disrespect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days, Rogge’s real power in the Chaoshan Legion has increased. The most direct reason is that Wallace, who led the invasion of the city of Solatu, failed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace’s initial actions were very smooth, but there was an accident when attacking the second supply relay station. Although this transfer station has increased the defending army, but after the increase in the number of soldiers, it is only more than 500 people. How can it resist the 5,000-strong light ride of the Chaoshan Legion? However, the five hundred warriors belonged to the squadrons of the gram cavalry. They were tenacious and occupied a large fortification. They stood up five meters long and slammed them. Just as Wallace ordered a full-scale attack. The magic array preset under the fortification suddenly started, turning the square within 100 meters into the sea of ​​flames! Moreover, the Delaware Empire ambushed more than a dozen mages, and they suddenly poured a wide range of attacks from the hundreds of meters into the head of the Chaoshan Light Cavalry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These magicians immediately fled after the first wave of attacking magic, letting the Chaoshan sneakers still in chaos catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most vicious thing is whether it is the default flame magic array, or the magician's long-range attack. All of them are completely ignoring the lives and deaths of hundreds of soldiers trapped in the fortifications, and some even simply target them. Because the distance is too far, these long-range attack magic will deviate from the target when flying. Therefore, if you aim at the fortification, you can at least get a few light cavalry of the Chaoshan Legion. It seems that this is the purpose of the Delaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flames went out, Wallace, who was shocked and angry, immediately counted the casualties and found that the elite light cavalry had killed more than 700 rides and two seriously injured. More than a hundred rides. The result was only the death of the enemy's 500-strong squadrons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime of defeat can be big or small. Basically, the military officers’ power to kill is already in the hands of the fat man. Because of the many men’s lives. Wallace’s attitude towards Rogge is naturally much more polite. This little thing about the demolition and construction of the fat man at the headquarters of the Legion has never been asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s strategy is to do everything according to the military regulations, waiting for the Chaoshan Legion to make mistakes. No matter the size, once he is caught by the handle, it is strict punishment. Wallace has nothing to do with this. If he is disobedient, it is a rebellion. The empire is extremely strict with the insurgents. Not only the insurgents are guilty of death, but also the direct blood relatives of the insurgents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the day, Rogge appeared at the headquarters of the Legion. He picked up the ranks and went to the Guangming Temple on the top floor. Mei was inseparable behind him. Her willpower was amazing. She recovered from the thunder of the lightning frenzy in just half a day. She endured the pain in her body and followed Rogue around the clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May is always ready to report the movement of the Legion to Rogge, so as not to fall back on the crime of arbitrarily acting. Now that Wallace is new, the Chaoshan Legion is reluctant to let the fat man grasp the handle on procedural matters. At that time, who knows that Rogge, who is guilty of viciousness, will be guilty of many crimes against the sinned officers, and will be executed on the spot? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, while walking, she reported to Rogge the intelligence of the owner of the city of Soratu that had just been collected. Rogge is very interested in this sultry and well-intentioned city owner. It is not only a little clever to let Wallace eat a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of the city of Solara, Fernandez, has just arrived in any month and is a little-known aristocrat. I have not heard of any blood relationship or in-law relationship with the Imperial Chamber of the Delaware. It seems that the Viscount is not crowded, or is desperate for the drilling camp to go to the front line of the city of Solatu to be the city owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger listened to Mary’s report and pushed the door of the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe, sitting on the altar, opened his eyes slightly and saw that Rogge and Rose came in. He stood up and walked down the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Macbeth, what are you going to experience today? ‘Rogge trots all the way to meet Macbeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth went to the temple. Asked: "Rog, what is your problem with the understanding of the power of light?" ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the terrace is already a morning light. Macbeth is standing on the terrace. Enjoy your crystal clear air with your head tilted up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sunny day, the sky that is gloomy for many days is bright and deep blue, and the lead clouds gathered over the red clay plateau for many days have already dissipated, only There are a few faint clouds left. There is almost no wind, and everything is so quiet and peaceful in pure sunshine. It's hard to imagine that the city of Sidde had such a big blizzard the previous two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is one of the few necromancers who do not hate the sun. As he accompanied the warm sunshine, he said: ‘I feel what you have taught. But now there is a lack of props that can store magic, so there is no way to experiment. There is no way to turn the power of darkness and death in my body into the power of light. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Bai Shen said: ‘This place is indeed a problem. When I return from heaven, the strength of your light power will directly affect the results after redemption. It is time for me to return to the Church of Light, so let me see if there is such magic equipment in the Church of Light. If there is, I will bring it to you first when I return to heaven. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a result, Rogge is of course overjoyed and grateful. The fat man is too excited to see himself, and his eyes will see tears falling. If you don't care about the noble status of Macbeth, maybe he will pull the sleeves and kiss the tip of the shoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Macbeth is ruthless, he is very touched by the sincerity of Rogge’s piety and affection. He warmly comforted a few Rogge, saying that nothing more than will arrange his words of salvation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the main entrance of the temple is a large terrace with a radius of several tens of meters. Rogge accompanied Macbeth and walked to the edge of the terrace, and looked at Macbeth and flew to the sky with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the brilliant morning light, Macbeth’s handsome and tall figure rises. Flying towards the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a sudden footstep came, General Wallace hurriedly walked onto the large terrace with more than a dozen capable men, and it seemed that he had to discuss with Rogge what important military aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace knew that Rogge had never been in a habit of sitting, so the generals with their men stood next to Rogge and looked away, as if A bunch of old comrades are intimately talking. Mei took out a small notebook and made a record. At this delicate moment, what should be remembered and which should not be remembered, it is a test of her efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace started with a few polite compliments. The voice is falling. The two generals beside him couldn’t wait to come up with a military map with various military markings and arrows on it. It seems to be a large-scale battle plan. Sure enough, Wallace is all about getting to the point, just to lobby Rogge to agree to a massive attack on the city of Sorato. This time, the force to be used is far beyond the authority of Wallace, so it is necessary to get the consent of Rogge. Otherwise, it is a crime of not listening to the order and arbitrarily playing the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogue heard Wallace’s intention, he immediately interrupted him, smiling with a smile: 'It’s not good to use so many troops...' <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just said half of it, at this time, the sky suddenly faintly floated a few long dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gave a slight glimpse and thought that he had got it wrong. How could a dragon appear in a place like Side City? However, seeing Wallace and a few highly skilled officers with martial arts, if they heard something, the fat man couldn’t help but feel a little shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just looked up and looked at the sky, and saw a large piece of eye-catching golden light falling in the air! There is a sacred atmosphere in the golden light that can't be opened, and Roger's skin is sore. When the golden light dissipated, Macbeth appeared on the terrace again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked. Quickly crowded out and shouted: ‘Macbeth! You are back from the Bright Church so soon? ...... ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Macbeth’s face was stunned and he turned a deaf ear to Rogge’s cry. He just stepped back and forth involuntarily. It seemed that he was extremely nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his mouth and stared at Macbeth step by step. He has been retreating to the door of the temple and still has not stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few more in the sky. This time, the clear dragon screams spread throughout the city of Side, and the city was in chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An invisible pressure has quietly fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly felt a suffocating heart. At that moment, he had to turn upside down and his heartbeat had completely stopped! The fear and awe from the deepest part of the soul completely control his body and consciousness! This battle is similar to the Dragon's Dragon, but it is far more horrible than Longwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge still retains a bit of reason in Lingtai, but can’t completely control his body. The consciousness of Wallace and the generals is already blank. And the retreat of the mainland Macbeth seems to be unbearable to endure the pressure of the pressure, brushing a bang, a pair of white wings actually unfolding behind the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth and both wings are full of exhibitions, and the sacred flames of the clouds like fog can not escape from the body. In the clouds. The hidden petals are falling like rain, and there are sacred songs. But the powerful sacred atmosphere can only circle around Macbeth, and it is impossible to break through the invisible pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the white-winged Macbeth still involuntarily retreated, and has retreated into the gloom of the light temple. Behind him, the outline of the second pair of wings has been faintly revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge shadows pass over the terrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Dragon! That is a dragon! ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘God! There is still one over there! ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Run away! Let me out of town! ‘‘Stupid! Are you running a dragon that flies? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Schilde is completely chaotic. The dragons of the two dragons are not completely resistant to ordinary people, although they are still flying in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge trembled, he wanted to escape, but he couldn't move at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge silver dragon hovered in the sky and rushed straight toward the headquarters of the Chaoshan Legion, which gradually slowed down in the air. Finally hovering at a distance of only a few tens of meters from the large terrace. At this distance, Rogge can even see the fine ribs on the curled dragon's corner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong Yang Tiansheng resounded through the clouds! This includes the power and the sacred dragon to almost let Rogge fall to the ground! As for the generals such as Wallace, they have completely lost control of their bodies, and they are all supportive and supportive. Everyone has a desperate color in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon floated in the air, and it was originally caught in two claws in his claws. Two rows of magicians in black robes sneaked out of the carriage, stepping on an invisible road in the sky and embarking on a large terrace. More than 20 mages split the two rows on the large terrace and then squatted. At the same time, the poems that praise the miracles are low. Leading these magicians. It is Mora who combines holiness and smoke as a fascinating water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon slowly lowered the huge dragon head, revealing the car with a low curtain on the back. It is darker than the dark night, and the flames of gold and silver are the edges. The thorns of roses in the flames are coiled up to the top of the car. The side of the car is inlaid with a gold shield, engraved on the upper coat of arms, is a silver headless angel statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately jumped a few times in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge adult silver dragon, is it actually the role of the rider? What kind of existence would it be necessary to sit in the dark black carriage? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compartment door is open, and the perfect hand that holds the door is enough to suffocate everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the figure of the fallen country falling slowly out of the carriage, Rogge only felt a roar in his head, and his eyes were full of chaotic colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the silver eyes, he can't tell the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only woman who will appear in the deep and sweet dreams, there are only two colors in the whole body, the most stunning silver and the most pure and distant. The ultimate contrast color creates a perfect peerless radiance. She wore a silver dress, and the collar in the neck was made of squid made of unknown metal, flowing with silver brilliance, and the left arm was wrapped with dark black rose branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her black hair hangs down the waterfall, the silver shackles with the arrogance of the world and the indifference of the sentient beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stepped through the neck and head of the silver dragon, stepping down from the void step by step, where the fiber fell, and immediately appeared a silver step in the air. Undertake her generation of glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗒,嗒,嗒. Every touch of the black crystal heel and the silver ladder on her slender foot will make the souls of all beings in the city of Sidde sway! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dreamy woman, who is proud of the worldly beings, goes down the stage and walks straight ahead of Rogge, going straight to the Temple of Light. go with! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several figures in the sky that are falling. They stepped on the silver ladder one by one, and followed the woman behind, and slowly stepped down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the woman are three mysterious characters wearing black robe and not even revealing their skin. But from their majestic and rich death, which can't be concealed, Rogge seems to feel the endless gale of the world of death is coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw the fourth person in the queue, Rogge couldn’t help but look at it. It turned out to be a dead class with no audio for a long time! How did he appear here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Androni in fifth place, Rogge was numb, and the sixth person, no matter who he was, would not make him feel How strange it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the last person in the team suddenly turned his head and filled with helplessness and looked at Rogge with a bitter smile. Look at the clear and elegant figure, not who is Xiusi? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman paused a little while on the terrace. The slightly curved silver eyes are patrolling the land of the heavens, the mountains and rivers, and the worldly beings! Then, she walked through the mad believer and stepped into the Temple of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
