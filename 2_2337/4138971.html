			<div id="content"><br /><br />############ Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything really, as Robsky said on the same day, since the official believers of the Holy Church can be exempted from war-related taxes, the Dro Empire civilians flocked to join The Holy Church became the devout believer of the goddess. At this time, the Holy Church established three temples in the Dro Empire. Every day, the believers who want to join the Holy Church will surround these three temples. They show their piety in various ways, in order to become a formal believer through the increasingly strict conditions of membership of the Holy Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the development of the Holy Church is even very unexpected for Rogge himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one month, the number of official believers in the Holy Church has increased by more than 300,000. Recently, the strength of the Mora has increased greatly, and the speed at which the believers have faith is also greatly increased. And now she has five assistants who can help the believers to have a belief in the goddess. Although the speed is much slower than Mora, it can also share a lot for Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite the fact that the number of believers waiting to join the Holy Church is still more than a million, and is still growing at a rate of tens of thousands per day. On the one hand, it can be said that the Holy Church and Pope Rogge have great success, and on the other hand, it can be seen how much the efficiency of the Droan Empire bureaucracy in exploiting and crushing civilians. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Rogge’s instructions, the bishops and the cardinals assigned to the local churches who were responsible for recruiting believers slowed down the registration of believers. This is somewhat of a concern for the taxation of the Dro Empire, and Rogge also hopes that believers who are not determined will not look. What are the real benefits of being a believer in the Holy Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, someone had analyzed the current tax system of the Droic Empire for Rogge. An ordinary civilian family usually needs to pay 22 taxes, and the war tax light tax account counts as many as 67 items. The total tax amount is far more than the usual tax amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this month, the Holy Church suddenly added more than twenty large and small churches and shrines throughout the Dro Empire. This was derived from the order of the Emperor of the Dro, which brought all the palaces that belonged to the Church of Light to the Emperor's Chamber and then transferred them to the Holy Church. For a time, qualified clergy in the Holy Church became scarce. Even an assistant bishop can host a cathedral with a population of 100,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Church is expanding too fast, and it will inevitably produce some noise. Driven by the huge benefits of exempting war taxes. Countless people who want to join the Holy Church are fighting for their lives, trying to open a breakthrough from these bishops who hold power. For a time, the rich donated gold coins, and the poor gave their wives and daughters. In the face of such a raging offensive, some bishops could not resist the temptation to launch. After a short period of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their happy time is only a dozen days. The saints Mora and the oracles who traveled around the country to examine the believers have sincere faith and bright eyes, and they will not be blinded by illusions. Believers who do not have faith will always be singled out, and when there are too many believers in a parish, the bishops and the main clergy who preside over the parish will be recalled by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many lucky bishops who soon discover that they can’t keep any secrets before the pope’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January, Rogge hanged seventeen bishops, four cardinals and fifty clergy in three batches. The corpse that fluttered in the wind on the Oshniiya Square finally made the bishops who were still immersed in the soft light of the gold coins and the tempting body of the woman wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They finally understand, don’t take the faith to joke with the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost overnight. The ethos of the Holy Church is one of the clear. Not only did the local bishops become conscientious in recruiting believers, they did their best, and they also removed the unqualified believers who had been collected before, and the collected gold coins were also refunded. It’s just that the benefits of possessing other women cannot be refunded, and only these believers are unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not interested in the battle. All his energy is spent on expanding the believers. And the recent battle has fallen into a temporary glue. There is really nothing worth paying attention to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting power of the First Empire of the Northern Territory is far from comparable to that of the Dro Empire. Commanding the Asropik empire's forward army, General Zoellick, has served as an adjutant of Pompey for many years, and it is inconspicuous in the Imperial generals. However, on the southern line of the Dro Empire, the striker’s army encountered the Northern Bavarian Legion led by Marshal Rosio. Under the three sides of Rosio's Guards, the Human Faced Spiders, and the Moon's Wolverine Corps, Zoellick's command did not leak, and successively repelled the opponent's attack, eventually forcing Marshal Rosrio to leave the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle was actually seen as a great victory by the Dro Empire. Because in the past, when the two sides were equal, the Dro Empire had never won a battle. This battle. It also made the Emperor Dro truly realize the terribleness of the Asrofic Empire. Take the military system of the Dro Empire. The standing army is nearly half a million, and the reserve force for emergency recruitment in wartime can reach two million. Although in the battle against the Bavarian Principality, he has repeatedly lost. However, the Principality of Bavaria has never dared to fight with the main army of the Dro Empire. Therefore, the Dero empire is still very self-sufficient, and feels that it is almost the same as the Astrafik Empire. If it is not fighting with the Bavarian Principality and the Bright Church, it is really powerless to fight in two lines. The Emperor of Dro will never be against Aslo. The Fick Empire was so accommodating that even the Pope of the Holy Church dared to interfere in the taxation of the Dro Empire! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this war, the Drodi room finally understood that the 300,000-strong army that had been stationed in the hinterland of the empire was fully capable of destroying the entire Dro Empire. And looking for domestic generals, the Dro Empire is also difficult to find a famous player who can rival Alexander and Pompey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People always have two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent and arrogant Emperor of the Dro in the face of the wolf-like Asrovic Empire, even changed the past hegemonic style. Taming like a weak lamb. Although he was extremely dissatisfied with Rogge’s brutal intervention in Dro’s tax administration and the suppression of the empire’s renunciation of the war tax on the sacred church members, he still had to issue a decree. What he can do, at most, is to send people to complain to Roger, the highest commander in the territory of the Astrofi empire in the territory of Dero, and ask him to appeal to Feuerbach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the letter from the messenger, Alexander directly threw the letter from the Emperor of Dro, and then coldly said: "The Great There is a decree, the sacred church has become the state religion of the empire. Rogge as the great goddess in the mortal agent. Status is detached, second only to the emperor in the empire. So how to deal with this matter. Please choose your own! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Alexander directly bombed the messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the reply from Alexander, the Emperor Dro had a new understanding of Rogge’s status in the Asrofic Empire, and never again to the Holy Church. The expansion is said to be irresponsible. After all, the 300,000-empire army was stationed on the two-day distance from O'Shinia. Alexander turned his face and could destroy the Dero empire at any time. At this time, the Emperor Dro could not help but deeply regret that he should not lead the wolf into the room. As a result, he got the embarrassing situation today. And every time I think about the war tax that should have been collected from the sacred church believers. The old emperor felt very painful. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Battle of the Northern Army and the Astrofic striker, the soldiers of the Bavarian Principality were clearly cautious. The two major legions of the Principality of the Principality slowly retreated and gave up a large area of ​​land in the southern part of the Dro Empire. Because of the scruples of the Church of the Holy Knights, which was always invincible, Alexander also allowed the striker's regiment, which was successful in the first round, to contract to stabilize the existing front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two main forces have left a large blank area in the southern part of the Dro Empire with mutual scruples. This area gradually became the main battlefield for the cavalry of both sides to intersperse assault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides of the war are not cautious over the head, but the situation has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Astrafik Empire and the Dro Empire concluded a sacred agreement, the official release of the war and the news came out. Several countries around the Dro Empire and some Principalities closer to the Bavarian Principal have expressed their desire to join the sacred agreement and fight against the Bavarian Principality. For these countries, the Asrofic Empire is terrible, but after all, the Dro Empire is on its way to the south. In comparison, the Bavarian Principality is still an imminent threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these boosts, the two empires are of course fully accepted. It’s just that it takes a long time to integrate the troops of these countries. Moreover, most countries in the South tend to favor the Dro Empire. The longer the time is dragged on, the better it will be for the countries of the Holy Agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Bavarian side, the messenger of the Church of the Light and the Light has already visited many countries that believe in the Most High God, especially the rumors that the Pope’s secret envoy has arrived. The Hungarian Empire is lobbying the Austrian-Hungarian emperor to form an alliance with the Bavarian Principality and send troops to participate in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many people expected it. The prelude to this war has just been opened, and almost all the major powers on the mainland have been swept in. And this is just the beginning. With the progress of the war situation, I am afraid that except for a very small number of remote countries, the rest of the countries will be affected by the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the time when the heavenly miracle descended to the Grand Residence, it was less than ten years now. Every time a miracle comes, it will always trigger a series of large-scale wars on the mainland, and the lucky family who bears miracles will build a huge empire after the war. It is only this time that the miracle caused by the miracle will obviously exceed the miracles of the past. Moreover, the main families of both sides of the war have endured the miracle of heaven, which is the first time in the history of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does the main god who lowered the miracle not the same one? If the heavens are like this plane, this is not another form of infighting. "After closing the general history of the mainland, Rogge suddenly thought of this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man shook his head and knew that his idea was too impractical. To this day, he still knows nothing about the heavens. This conclusion from the conjecture is naturally ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stood up and walked into the big conference room. When passing through the window. He set his footsteps and looked at the smoke rising in the distance. After a while, he walked out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that those burning houses must be the home of the bright church believers. He knows more about the people who are struggling with the fire and the smoke. There are many believers who are no longer the Church of Light, and they are willing to change their faith. However, the opportunity has been lost. There are still many people who are not believers in the Church of the Light from the beginning. They are just those who are innocently affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith is not something that you can give up at will. Since the beginning of the war, many of the most sacred believers have interpreted the act of the Light Church to abandon the Dro Empire as the Deroy Room in the dark. Although the Church of Light has been expelled from the Dro Empire, even though it has become a sacred church, the war can be exempted from the war tax, but they still refuse to change their beliefs, and they also persuaded the people who know them not to abandon the glory of the High God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation Rogge had expected. He is also prepared to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man did not wait for a long time, just waited for the opportunity. There is a poor family who has been oppressed by the war tax. The father has done almost everything to make his son join the Holy Church, but he still can't do it. Desperate fathers show their piety to the Holy Church so that their only son can have a bright future, and even sneak into the home of a believer in the Church of Light, and kill the believer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bloody case is in the eyes of the Dero City Defense Army. Not a big deal. They took the murderer and prepared to act according to the law. After the procedure was over, the murderer was sent to the guillotine. But they did not think that this matter did not know how it was introduced into Rogge. The pope sent a special envoy, forcibly carrying the murderer, and personally gave the father and son the identity of the sacred church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rogge later explained to the believers. This is the only case, and there will never be another time. However, the believers who want to join the sacred church and do not enter the door are like seeing a ray of light in the darkness, and immediately they are passionate, and they have already forgotten Rogge’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the fertile soil of the Dro Empire, Rogge ignited the burning of the fire to the bright church believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just ten days’ effort, I don’t know how many true or false bright church believers fell on the red-eyed sacred church believers under. Religious persecution has evolved into a major turmoil that affects the entire country of the Dro Empire. The generals of the Dro empire knew that such a large-scale turmoil at this moment would inevitably have a very adverse impact on the future situation. Therefore, they tried their best to stabilize the situation, and they faced the Emperor of Dro, demanding to go to Asrofi. The gram empire protested. Protest against the sacred church's mischief in the Dro Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this turbulent period. The army of these generals had also had several small-scale conflicts with Rogge’s sacred church, but the generals were discouraged. Their soldiers and the Holy Church came to the church to support the worshippers. Every time the conflicts of the ice warriors were beaten, even if they were ten dozens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor of Dro was forced by the generals to make several protests to Alexander. The result was not directly brought back by Alexander, but was told that everything was equal. When the Emperor Baha entered the Dro Empire, he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge stood at the door of the conference room for a moment, then reached out and closed the two doors and stepped into the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already a few people waiting for him in the conference room, but these people are different in shape, not at all like to hold an important meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class stood in front of the window, stroking the sword in his hand, looking full of thoughts. Miro put the giant hammer in the corner of the conference room, and he leaned his arms against the hammerhead, and Adelene, sitting on the handle of the hammer, could not whisper. Constantine is sitting in front of the conference table in the end, and it looks like the most important thing to discuss. It’s just that he didn’t know when he gave himself a new cockroach, grabbed his hands and looked ugly. The other one was sitting in Hughes, but he put a small stove on the conference table and was concentrating on boiling water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Rogge’s convening of these powerful men is to solve the problem that the strong have not listened to the command. He decided to talk to these people seriously and openly and honestly. If these people are able to coordinate, how can their combat effectiveness be measured in a way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked around the week and suddenly asked, "What about Androni? Why didn’t she come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned around and saw a cold face of Androni pushing the door. There is also a little girl with a black face in her arms. The strength of the people in the conference room was high, and it was already seen that the little girl had lost her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni gently placed the little girl’s body on the conference table, looked up at Rogge and gritted: "Have you seen it? It’s the good thing you do! Her family is dead in the hands of your believers! And like this, I have seen too much on the way! Is this the purpose of your religious persecution?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at the little girl, her immature face solidified with unspeakable pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know that I clean the bright church believers in order to increase the believers of the Holy Church. As for this little girl, I am sorry, but this is hard to avoid. Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is angry and said: "If you know it is inevitable, why don't you stop religious cleaning! I am not a saint, but you know this big cleansing How many people have died in the middle? How many of these dead are completely innocent?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at Androni and sighed Tones, said: "As long as I can increase the believers of the Holy Church and reduce the believers of the Church of Light, I will do whatever I want, so religious cleaning will never stop. But rest assured, I will control this cleaning to a certain extent. In the scope, don't let it go out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, how many people are you going to kill?" Androni is frosty, Sen Ask coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned and said: "Annie, you don't understand the nature of this war. This is not a war between countries for land and resources. Nor is it a racial war between the South and the North. This is a war between faiths! Any war, death and injury are inevitable. Do you think how many pigs and sheep people have killed in order to get food? Who would think these pigs are poor? No! In the eyes of the gods, the so-called believers and the pigs are essentially the same in nature! So as long as they can win the battle of faith, no matter how many people die, the gods will not care. I also Don't care!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at Rogge for a moment, and looked at the powerful people in the conference room. Whether it is Constantine, Hughes, Miro or Adrienne, they are all calm, and they are not surprised at what Rogge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly laughed and said, "What's wrong with you? Don't you think that what he said is very strange, or actually I am actually Is it a strange person? Constantine, are you not the devout believer of the Most High God? Why do you watch Rogge persecute the believers of the Church of Light without stopping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin changed his face, his mouth moved, but he didn’t say anything at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie!" Rogge snorted, and he endured anger: "The world is not strange, you are not surprised. It is like climbing, When you climb a mountain, you will see different scenery and have a different understanding of the world. Now you have just not yet reached the real peak, and you don’t know enough about the nature of the matter! Don’t mess around, it’s important. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
