			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, flames, ice arrows, sour arrows, lightning, and whirlwinds fell on the heads of these mutant stone ghosts. The fast-magnification low-level magic is the skill that Rogge and Froya are good at. Rogge does not expect these magic to effectively kill these defensive high-grade gargoyles, he only hopes to find their weakness in magic defense. It is a pity that their magic resistance looks as good as the defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and Froya are both great magicians. At this point, the strategy was changed again. Fu Luoya started a number of magical equipment, and dizzy, violent, lethargic, fixed, and so on, threw it in succession. Rogge did not rely on the spell at all, and the spell was even faster than Froah. He released slow, defensive power, reduced magic resistance, curses, and darkness related to the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in addition to immunity, immunity or immunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With each test magic failing, Rogge's face is getting more and more ugly. In terms of defensive characteristics, these gargoyles are simply chasing the dragons. Fortunately, their attack power is average, and there is no special magic skill. However, the numerous quantities and the poison on the teeth and claws are enough to make up for the weakness of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with these defensive and highly venomous gargoyles, it is only suitable for heavy infantry with heavy armor and heavy swords. Rogge began to regret not calling the Tikton Warrior. The Tickton warriors grew up in the mountains and the plains. Their oversized body and good martial arts were not suitable for exploring missions such as the underground palace, so Rogge never thought about bringing them this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog couldn’t help but miss the dragon-throwing gun that was thrown into the mountains by Nicholas, even the Tomahawk’s soul-locked by the hammer of the god of war. It’s also a lot stronger than the Axofik heavy infantry commando in the hands. However, he was not allowed to feel any more, and the gargoyles had screamed and rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All magicians exit the hall! Cast summon magic! Use the scrolls! All the soldiers who use heavy weapons enter the hall!" Rogge calmed down, followed by a series of command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the battle axe and slammed it into a gargoyle in front of him, then blessed himself with countless auxiliary magic, which was a maddening , into the group of gargoyles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A melee! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's left hand stuck a gargoyle's neck, even a few axe, and completely smashed its head, which made it stop struggling. During this time, he has been arrested by the gargoyles on his back. But the fat man wearing a silver dragon armor is naturally harmless. Of course, even if he doesn't wear armor, the enhanced defense will not be worse than these stone ghosts. The only problem is that he is good at magic, and now, in addition to the fat man to add auxiliary magic, magic has no use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with these gargoyles, decomposition is effective, just a wizard wizard has proved this. Unfortunately, the decomposition can only dissociate a gargoyle, but the magic consumed is very large, and the success rate is less than half, which is not practical at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse of the Elf Masters has come and gone, a summoning creature has joined the battle, and the soldiers have begun to flood into the hall. The battle slowly turned into a war of attrition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams filled the hall, and these ordinary warriors fell one after another in front of the gargoyles. They often have to pay dozens of lives to cut down a gargoyle. However, the bravery of the Asrofik fighters undoubtedly showed at this time that a team of soldiers stalked the body of their companions and could not rush into the hall, fighting with the gargoyles who seemed to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gargoyles are highly toxic, even if Rogge is hurt more, they feel some dizziness, which is even more a deadly threat to other fighters. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After cutting five gargoyles, Rogge’s steel tomahawk has been wounded and turned into a warhammer. He roared and picked up the battle axe and squatted on a gargoyle. The gargoyle struggled on the ground and even flew back. Rogge swears awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only powerful fighters can easily deal with these difficult guys. The magician can take them without any means, only by calling the creatures to fight the war a little bit. But at this moment, Rogge looked around, and there was only one wind butterfly in the martial arts. As for himself, it is nothing but brute force, and martial arts is a mess. This time, the fat man relied too much on the magician. He thought that having the brigade wizard was invincible, and he couldn’t help but feel annoyed at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge gloomy face, slammed into Fulua's back, pulled a stone ghost in the air, slammed it on the ground, and then with a tomahawk axe against its throat, shouted, violently, this Only pierced its throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s face was a bit white, but he still smiled and said: “What are you doing to save me? Do you want to seduce me!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Fury: I am honestly outside! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Froya replied, the fat man grabbed her and lifted it high, then forced her to throw it at the door of the hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up a battle axe from the ground, looked at the gargoyle flying in the hall, took a sip, and rushed up. Fat personality, these stone statues Although the ghost is difficult to deal with, it is not impossible to resist. Anyway, nowadays there are many people, these soldiers are the Duke of Doliyak, and they die more than heartache, so he does not want to give up.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death, the sea of ​​consciousness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** and Weina are still squatting, but their minds are not fighting each other at the moment. We are smiling with a smile: "The gargoyles are almost immune to magic, so it's not good to deal with it!" If he thinks he is not in danger of his life, then he is wrong. I can't see that he is quite affectionate, really not like an evil necromancer! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Let’s look at Wella, as if I didn’t hear her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wena's index finger picks up, the fingertips pull out a gold thread in the air, and then smiles meaningfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart suddenly passed An inexplicable panic, his movements were stagnation, and he was almost caught by a gargoyle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the voice of Froya came from the door: "Fatty! If you don't want to retreat, then what to use? I can't support it anymore! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart is anxious, I don’t know why, since the panic that just happened, his mind has never been peaceful, and he tried several times in a row. Purgatory 'has not succeeded. He wanted to use the 'outside bound spell purgatory' to enhance the magic, forcing the leapfrog to move the 'magic sword', and use the summoned powerful magic weapon to solve these gargoyles. 'The sword of the magic' is eight The magic of the order is far from the fat man's ability. The result of Rogge's use of mental power to force the use of the force is to be seriously injured under the magic counterattack.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stare Holding ***, capturing every change in her, slowly said: "This way of driving magic is too much damage to myself, so I stopped him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Wella was disappointed, and she still looked at her without expression.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The hall is still in a melee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly swayed and fell to the sky. She has had a lot of scratches on her body and has always been self-supporting. However, her anti-drug ability is far less than that of Rogge, and finally it is toxic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few sounds, several gargoyles around her are being shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge held the wind butterfly in one hand and took over her wheel saw in one hand. He had a horizontal glimpse of the load, the wheel saw creaked, and immediately The gargoyle opened. The wind saw's wheel saw is a rare boutique weapon, and its power is much bigger than that of ordinary warriors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge rubbed a squid blue blood splashing on his face, screaming: Wrap! Wind butterfly, are you still quite good? Hold on, I will throw you out!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty turned his face, see the wind butterfly holding both hands The fine bright dagger, trained on his chest. She bit her lower lip, her hands trembled, and he was hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has already understood that the wind butterfly must think that this is mortal, so I want to take revenge before death, although she knows that she relies on a slap It is almost impossible to kill Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat brow wrinkles, remove the shackles in the hands of the wind butterfly or give me a good life! Then he threw the wind butterfly out of the hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is calling you, are you going to go?" Weina asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Still silent, the silvery light in the eyes is not a little fluctuating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly retreated to the door of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gargoyles seem to see that these delicious humans want to escape, and one only rushes to the top. Although the fat man has the wind saw's wheel saw in hand, but the martial arts are too bad, so it is quite difficult to cope with it. In the blink of an eye, there are several more wounds on the arm and thigh that are not protected by the silver dragon armor. He was so poisonous that he was black and his body was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure around Rogge suddenly became light, and the four huge snow bears summoned to block the gargoyles. With this opportunity, Rogge quickly retreated to the door. He turned his head and looked at it, looking forward to seeing a pair of green eyes with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the face of the little goblin was pale and softly fell down, apparently overdone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally gritted his teeth and shouted the command to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the forest outside the Shigong, hundreds of soldiers are flying through the forest and rushing to the stone palace. There are more than a dozen people wearing dark green robes in the team. From the attire, they are obviously Druids. For these natural goddess believers who are familiar with the natural forests, the forests are completely unable to slow down their pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain wind suddenly grew a little. There seems to be a shadow in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last soldier in the team ran and ran, his head suddenly rolled down, and the blood spurted out like an arrow! His headless body ran a few meters before he fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several soldiers in front of him who turned back in horror and were sprayed with blood. They screamed and the screams suddenly broke because they had a black short arrow on their throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire team has stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Druids is alert, and slowly walks over to examine the bodies of the dead. The murderer has already been hidden in the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Druids examined the body and said something respectfully to an old Druid. Old Druid's face was gloomy, slowly closing his eyes, standing still, listening to the roar of the forest wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole forest is quiet, only the mountain winds whizzing past the treetops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Druid’s eyes suddenly opened and roared: “Destroy! Evil dark creatures!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With his snoring, there is a myriad of thorns in an old tree not far away! These thorns instantly formed a natural prison, and there was a faint shadow in it that was flashing back and forth, hitting the thorn cage. The thorn cages shine with faint brilliance, and each time the shadow rushes to the edge of the cage, it will be blocked by an invisible wall, and there will be no thorns and branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several young Druids couldn’t help but whispered: "God, it’s a Shadow Knight!" They couldn’t hide in their low voice. tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not panic! The wrath of the natural goddess can destroy all evil beings!" Old Druid was cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of extremely pale green flames suddenly ignited from the ancient trees, and turned into a huge fireball in a blink of an eye, rushing to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thorns of the ancient tree and the crown of the cage are strangely lost in all colors, becoming a lifeless monotonous gray. The Shadow Knight, who was just trying to break through the cage, has completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Druid snorted! "That, turn and walk toward the stone palace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screaming screaming screaming, suddenly woke up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw a dark and damp wall, and heard the screams from time to time. For a moment, she felt that she was already in purgatory. The whole body of the butterfly is soft and weak, and the heart jumps wildly, jumping like a barrier to break through.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you awake? We will go out in a minute, don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly has been on the back of an elf guardian warrior. As the brigade walked out. But her heart is still jumping wildly, jumping more and more anxious, jumping as if to pull her soul out of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's him! He has an accident... must be!" The wind butterfly cried and struggled to get down from the elf warrior's back: "Rogge Where? I want to see him! It must be that he has an accident!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warrior grabbed the wind butterfly, almost glaring at her and going to the rear Resist those gargoyles! Wind butterfly, calm down! What have you gone out to say? Who are you talking about..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is not falling, a dark blue bloody Rogge rushed up from behind the team, to the team The forefront of the rushed. Without him in the back, the killing sound in the rear suddenly increased, and the screams were much more dense.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rog ! What's up with him! Isn't it..." Wind Butterfly yelled at Rogge's back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue rushed forward, his slightly anxious voice Resounding in the long martyrdom: "He may still be alive! There are powerful enemies coming out, don’t rush out, we will all die here! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire team has stepped up and followed Roger outwards.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before entering the stone palace, Rogge left two hundred soldiers to guard the exit. But he just felt that Rafael, who was guarding in the forest, had an accident. In the virgin forest, the shadow knight who is born with invisible ability has any advantage. And knowing that since Rafael can't protect himself now, then these enemies are definitely not able to deal with this ordinary warrior. Once they first blocked the stone palace gate, there were strong enemies before, then there was Warcraft. The consequences are unimaginable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the old Druid has stood in front of the stone palace and silently looked at this magnificent building. Not far behind him, It is the barracks of the left-behind soldiers. All the soldiers in the barracks have become corpses, and hundreds of beasts are smashing inside. Once they smell some angry survivors, they will make up a bite.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is such a magnificent grave, the natural goddess is still very caring  of. You are just staying inside. "Old Druid waved his hand with a sneer, and behind the Druids took out the magic props and began to cast spells.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, countless boulders appeared out of thin air The gate of the stone palace was firmly sealed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing at the end of the ramp that was blocked by the stone, Rogge’s face was horrible.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the enemy must now recharge his batteries outside, waiting for the moment he broke out. At that time, everyone is exhausted and what is it to resist these rivals? These enemies do not know that the fat man still carries a large number of elf engineering units, and he can dig out from anywhere in the Shigong, so the situation is not completely desperate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Of course, the premise of all this is that he can kill the mutant gargoyle behind the team, instead of being killed by them...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waving the wheel in his hand Saw, while walking to the back of the team, shouted: "I want to live with me!" Let's go and pick up those damn gargoyles! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea of ​​Consciousness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked like an ice sculpture, mouth corner The smile is getting stronger and stronger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, he is calling you again, are you not going to help him? I am right, it seems that his situation is not good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** is just silence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory suddenly flew up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but *** standing in the sky, reaching out to grab it, more than ten strong gravitational forces immediately covered the bone dragon that wanted to go over the air. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon screams with sorrow, and every bone is shaken under the strong gravity. A few whispers, its four thin The wing was torn off by the irresistible gravity, and it was blown away by the never-ending gale in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the sudden chill almost frozen the soul of Gregory! It clawed for four strokes, and climbed to the back of a huge stone with lightning, and began to shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea of ​​consciousness, Wella slowly moved closer to the ***, and the smile was more prosperous. She said: "You listen, he is summoning you again! This may be the last summoning! You really are not going to go? When he kills those gargoyles, his men must have died. But, in There are still many people waiting for him outside! ***, you said, will he be completely killed this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continues to slow down Slowly approaching ***, "***, even if he escapes, although this possibility is almost negligible. You said that he will call you again in the future? You have to think about it!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** A pair of silver cymbals quietly looked at Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena has moved closer to *** and is almost within reach. She stared at the ***, asked one word at a time: not, not? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the silver awn in the eyes of *** was slightly dimmed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wena and *** Passing by.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned back slightly, looking at the fascinating side of the ***, gently smiled: "Since you don't go, Then I am going. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smirk of her smug laughter is getting louder and louder, and finally fills the sea of ​​consciousness!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A green brilliance flashed, Rogge cut off the two front paws of a gargoyle in front of him, and the splash of blue blood sprayed him again. What was in his mouth, rubbing his face The blood on the side, while swinging the wheel saw forward, to prevent the gargoyle from playing before the death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is not used to the wheel saw It is a powerful weapon that is difficult to control, and the wind butterfly is too light, and it has been used too hard, and it has almost cut itself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He wiped his face and danced the wheel saw. Anyway, the front and rear left and right were all gargoyles, and they wouldn’t be wrong. But the fat man’s hands suddenly became light, and the wheel saw disappeared!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge this shock is not the same, he looked around, several gargoyles are close at hand, a pair of blood red eyes are staring at themselves. Fat man moves like electricity, suddenly fell to the ground Then one rolled out of the encirclement, and when he stood up, he had more than one battle axe in his hand. But in an instant, the tomahawk in his hand disappeared in front of Rogge!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fat man suddenly appears, when I don’t know when it becomes very quiet. The screams, the screams, the whistle of the gargoyles that have just been intertwined have disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge to see, the gargoyles are standing still in the same place. At this moment, the river of time has solidified.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Rogge The surrounding gargoyles lost their weight, one by one, slowly falling down, and then they seemed to have no bones, and they slammed on the ground. Rog looked at a grotesque gargoyle. I couldn’t speak for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space in front of the fat man suddenly burst into a burst, and the beautiful demon that made him worry about it slowly emerged. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time no see, the lines of the demon lotus are softer and smoother, and there is a lot of flowing light gold on the top. Patterns. If these lines are like life, they seem to be slowly changing the pattern. When they look into the gods, they will suddenly become a bottomless deep pool, and almost suck the human soul into it. Under the grain, there is a very pale cyan shading. Behind the 'demon lotus', dozens of nails are stretched, like a pair of metal wings, but the white wings that Rogge knows are not stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly had an inexplicable thing in his chest and was stuck in his throat. He opened his mouth, but he couldn't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those days and nights that are always concerned about...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stares at '妖莲' On the chest, there is a beautiful black and black piece. The soul brand that he left behind has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, all sorts of tastes poured into Rogge’s heart, and he screamed lowly: “***...” I don’t know what to say anymore. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s body suddenly multiplied several times! He couldn't catch it, and he would have to fall down. In the midst of a crisis, Rogge raised his mental strength, and his hands faltered forward, but he resisted the sudden pressure. However, the moment of gravity has increased several times in an instant, and Rogge is finally invincible, and he plops in front of the ***! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravity is fleeting. As soon as Rogge looked up, there was a chill in front of him, and then there was a green glow in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly stood up, only to see that the wheel saw that had just fallen on his nose was the wind butterfly, and there were several of them hanging on it. wire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Sillowly floated in front of him, her right hand slowly lifted up and reached out to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Demon Lotus’ seems to have no thickness at all, and every line of her right hand is completely outlined. For the first time, Rogge was so focused on the right hand of ***, although he was fully aware of the horrible power contained in this hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly said that this hand that has taken countless lives is so delicate, like a big wind, it will hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this fiber that cannot be described by words, Rogge also saw death, clear death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is a layer of light smoke covering the right hand of ***. That is not actually smoke, but the space is subtly distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gargoyles who are still alive are screaming dying, and then they are surprised one by one, bursting into a group of blue blood fog from front to back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s gaze has been irresistibly attracted to the fingertips of the delicate index finger. He was unbelievable. These gargoyles, who had made him bloody and deadly, almost desperate, were destroyed like this without any resistance, and destroyed under this beautiful hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destruction and beauty, while presenting in the eyes of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The right hand slowly extended to Rogge, and the light smoke was still lingering on his fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge in the mouth. I don't know why, he instinctively wants to go backwards, trying to be as far away as possible from this beautiful and indescribable hand. However, his body is completely uncontrollable by himself, and he is unable to move in place. Rogge suddenly understood why the gargoyles would definitely stand still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The hand finally touched his face, the coldness of that, slowly infiltrated into the soul of Rogge's soul. Fat people can't help but fight with their teeth. He struggled to improve his mental strength and tried to confront the fear of the cold. However, for every increase in his mental strength, the feeling of fear increased accordingly, and he just suppressed the resistance of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at the all-faceless demon mask and slowly said: "***...Do you want to kill me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The right hand gently and gently slid over Rogge's cheeks, then took it back, holding a drop of blue blood on her fingertips. The small mouth of the demon mask suddenly opened and blew toward the blue blood. Blue blood was blown off the fingertips and scattered in the air. But in Roger's eyes, blowing out of this little mouth is not like a blue breath, but a hurricane that is enough to destroy everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue blood beads are not blown away by the wind, but are completely broken down into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze sneaked past Rogge’s face. The fat man finally couldn't support it, his legs were soft and he almost sat on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, *** seems to be a light smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly turned back, at the other end of the gallery, countless soldiers and Froya and the wind butterfly were watching all this silently. They also lost their ability to act at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** snorted, her clear and cold voice contained the powerful power of the soul. Where can ordinary soldiers resist this power? It is Fengdie and Fuluya, both of which are exhausted and have no room for resistance. Then in a twinkling of an eye, everyone fainted to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Cold and authentic: "You continue to explore the stone palace, the outside people I will solve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man nodded and looked at him dullly Slowly turn around, just want to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly turned back slightly, actually... actually slowed down... slowly set off the devil mask! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s brain banged, the whole world collapsed at this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ruins and empty, only the white and dazzling skin and the little lips...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a smile on the side of the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rogge regained consciousness, *** has long since left, and in the long martyrdom, only he stood alone. On the right is a submerged subordinate, and on the left is a deep passage that is completely soaked by the blood of a gargoyle, with a faint blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and slowly reorganized the previous things in his mind, which really understood what was born. However, the fat man always feels inexplicably feeling that he does not really know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time no see, *** seems to have completely changed, becoming powerful without measurement. Rogge suddenly felt that *** has become a existence that makes him difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the gap in power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly, the blush in the dazzling white light appeared in front of his eyes. Rogge’s heart suddenly jumped uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge raised Froya and the wind butterfly, and they called, and they woke up. The warriors are also awake, and it seems that they have not suffered any damage in the previous concussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reorganized the team and counted the number. After many hard battles, the 2,800 warriors who first entered the underground palace now have less than 1,200 people. What makes Rogello feel gratified is that all the wizard wizards and engineering forces have not suffered any damage. What surprised the fat man was that the Druids of more than a hundred prisoners did not have anything to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand and went to the depths of the underground palace. Everyone in the team followed Rogge silently. The blue faint martyrdom is all the blood of the frozen gargoyle, just like a blue ice condensed, very slippery. There will always be soldiers falling to the ground, but no one is talking, and even the person who falls will climb silently, and even if they don’t dare, they will be afraid of awakening the sleeping demons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria and the wind butterfly walk behind Rogge. They should have asked Ruoge for countless questions, but they have subconsciously chosen silence at this moment. I don't know why, they instinctively refused to recall everything that was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This re-exploration was surprisingly smooth, and no monsters were encountered, and the undead that had jumped out from time to time disappeared. Rogge knew that they were not hiding, but disappeared completely. I don't know if it was destroyed, or was it returned to the world of death. However, *** should not look down on these weak undead creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed. It seems that *** is progressing in the world of death. Which king is she defeating? In this way, your past concerns are unnecessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, the power of *** is getting stronger and stronger, and Rogge feels farther and farther away from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again exploring the Stone Palace, Rogge has always been a sleepwalker, almost instinctively commanding exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took to walk in the stone palace. Finally, a wide and tall passage appeared in front of Rogge. At the end of the passage were two tall stone gates. From the orientation point of view, the back of Shimen should be the center of the stone palace and the place where the demon Amoro body is sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the nearly 100-meter channel doesn’t look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you feel?" Froya whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
