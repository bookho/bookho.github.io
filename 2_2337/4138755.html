			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the day, the emergency horn sounded in the city of Luoyun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effort, the army and elf forces of the Principality of Aray have been assembled, and the queues are neatly arranged, waiting for the next order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still only carry the equipment when they enter the city, and they can’t see any looted property. In fact, none of them participated in the looting of civilians in Luoyun City last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are’s team, which was rebuilt by Rogge, emphasized the military discipline. Although the time is too short, the combat effectiveness cannot be improved, but the strictness of the military discipline is completely different. As for the elves, this natural and arrogant creature will never come out of looting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Falling City Palace, Rogge is making a final farewell to Marshal Alams. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main army of the Three Principalities of the Highlands has been completely defeated. Now the remaining forces of the three countries are not even together with 10,000 people, and most of them are privately armed by the nobility. In order to end the battle as soon as possible and divide the spoils, Rogge has already agreed with Marshal Erasmus to attack. According to the prior secrets of the two countries, the country of Goshawk and Vulture is owned by the Principality of Layton, and the country of the Snowy is accepted by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country of the country has a population of 3 million. In addition to the government, there are still more than ten small towns. After the death of the Duke of Annas, the number of troops in the country was less than 2,000. Rogge could use the elf force to sweep the entire country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is now eager to end the war here, so that he can return to the city of the gods to ask the elders of Hughes to find ways to interfere with the momentary movement. As long as the old fox can find a way, Rogge can pay any price. Just lost the fat man of Ajani, I really can't stand the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams and Rogge shoulder to shoulder, talking cordially. Clark stood next to him and looked very excited. He inserted a few words from time to time to show his insights. This time, the battle against the Three Principalities of the Highlands has been fully successful, and Clark’s credit for centering the bridge is not small. Father and uncle have evaluated his ability to a higher level. Compared with his brothers and sisters in his palace, Clark is more outstanding. Even Marshal Alams, who has never been out of shape, has hinted at Clark, let him do it well, and he will not be embarrassed in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams talks with Rogge while observing the Rogge troops that are gathering in the square outside the station. His sharp eyes did not let go of any details, the degree of soldiers' assembly, the military posture when they lined up, whether they had whispers, whether they had looted property and so on. Even the straps of the armor were neat and did not escape the eyes of the marshal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elegant and neat elf army is unable to pick out any embarrassment, and the more than 2,000 handsome and gorgeous elves gather together, it is really pleasing to the eye. Look at Clark's eyes are straight. But Marshal Alams looked at the Snow Bear Knight and the Aley Infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quarter of an hour has been assembled, and the upper limit of the mixed service has been quickly taken. With many years of experience in the leadership, Marshal Elams saw that the soldiers of the Principality of Ale are still undertrained and have limited combat effectiveness. However, under such a terrible and strict military discipline, it will not take long before it will be a terrorist army that is scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seemingly scattered dark side of the formation also caught the attention of Arams. I don't know why, the old Marshal always felt that the light made by the dark side of the moon was always darker than other places. Those elves are obviously different from other elf warriors. In addition to being much more beautiful, they obviously have no other elves' vitality and liveliness. Each one's eyes are calm and ice-like, and there is no emotional fluctuation at all. This kind of eye has been seen by Marshal Elamas, and it is also memorable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the eyes of the ‘butcher’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher is a special name circulated privately in the North team. It is only possible for warriors who have experienced wars and kills to obtain such ‘honor’. The butcher is a nightmare for all the soldiers on the battlefield. They can not hesitate to use the cost of piercing their own arms in exchange for cutting one arm of the enemy. The bottom line of the butcher's injury is that there is no disability, so that they can continue to participate in the next battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the superficial meaning of the term butcher, murder has become their profession, hobbies and art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ayre Principality has been weak for a long time, and the weak army is barely able to see it. But this time re-examined, Marshal Alams is getting more and more unremarkable to Rogge. Reminiscent of Rogge's exclusive right to Ale's public power, there has not been much time, and it has been thoroughly improved in the most critical part of the military discipline, and then thinks that Carlos and his son have died bizarrely. Arams suddenly had a chill in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Master Rogge, are the relatives of Annas still satisfied with you?" Clark asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and satisfied! However, although more than 90 people were killed, there are still 351 people in the Annas family who are alive. I won't let them run anymore! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Terror, irritability, okay..." Arams meditated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Miss Elf... What is her name? Ajiani? If it weren't for her, this victory would not come so easily! Clarke said with emotion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Rogge also sighed. "I have only six guards like her. It's a pity." Falling Cloud City can be attacked sooner or later, and it should be better to die more ordinary fighters. Those people's lives are not worth the money, but these most elite elf guards have one less damage! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one can see the convulsions in Rogge's heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark feels the same! As long as there is money and supplies, and training for the previous year, how much is the army? If it is much more dead, let the civilians work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Marshal Alams snorted that Lark is still young, Master Rogge, let you laugh. Training alone is not a real warrior, and must be experienced on the battlefield. The Asrofik Empire is going to open small wars to the Holy Alliance and neighboring countries every year. One of the purposes is to train the troops. Even if the lives of these soldiers are worthless, they must be used in key places. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the army on the square has already been assembled for a long time. Rogge said to Uncle Arams, and went downstairs.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching a team of fighters in an orderly manner followed Rogge toward the gate, Arams gloomy face, said to Clark: "Maybe we release A real demon. Clark, how many troops can we transfer now? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twenty thousand people, in addition to the necessary troops stationed in Luoyun City, can also mobilize 18,000 people. Uncle, are you planning..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Although he is still immature, it is already terrible. Now he will kill him when he is not prepared, and I am afraid there will be no chance in the future! "Marshal Arams is gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle... Rogge is a great magician, and you can see the elf Ajani. If you give Rogge out, even if he has an elf guard to escape, uncle, even if there are more people to guard, can not stop the iron revenge of the elf! At that time, the Principality of Layton could continue, but our family would be finished. Uncle, this is not a good choice! We still don't want to provoke the elves as well! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the huge golden clouds and the huge gap of the city walls of the city, the Marshal Elams actually trembled. He was silent for a long time. Only then: "The calm and tranquility of the North seems to have ended. We have no chance. Fortunately, we and the demon stood together from the beginning. Clark, you have to be careful to maintain this relationship, and don't let the momentary interest disputes fool your wisdom. When we die, you will not be his opponent. If the Kingdom of Layton can always be a good show for his allies, if it is not, it will be good. "At this time, Arams saw the distant Rogge suddenly turned back and smiled at himself.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sweat instantly soaked the marshal's undercoat!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle and uncle did not notice, I don’t know when, a shadow disappeared in the room It’s gone, the light is brighter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present alien world is like the sea before the storm, and there is endless danger in the calm.<br />< Br /> </ br> </ br> </ br> &nbsp;&nbsp;On a steep mountain, slowly and slowly revealing a faucet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faucet does not move, just like a lifeless Stone. After a long time, the flame in the eyelids slowly lights up, starts to turn left and right, and observes the surrounding environment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still so ethereal, like a dreamy beauty. ***, it seems that it does not belong to this gray world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she is no longer perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** There are many breaks in the gray robes on the body, and the soft, snowy skin inside is faintly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her right cheek, there was a tiny blood mark, still bleeding in the golden blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment in the far-flung sky, there is an almost invisible little black dot circling constantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master!" Gregory spoke up. "I can't think of the dragon in the abyss and fly so fast. It's too mean, too shameless! They can Rest, we have no way to reply! This is simply a rogue! How can there be a king of the king? But you have learned the arrogant idiot dragon, forgive him for not being too far away from other kings!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mouth is so powerful, the bone dragon still involuntarily depressed the sound, seemingly afraid to be heard by the dragon of the abyss hovering far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Speak silently, just calmly looking into the distance. The light flowing on the leaves of the devil is flickering and has lost a lot of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory looked back at the Death Scythe in the hands of the ***, and the voice slowly lowered: "Master...we are not going to escape like this." Ah! They are getting faster and faster, next time, what will happen next time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon knows that the master’s ability is not enough to maintain a parallel space. So I will bring the Death Scythe on my body. With this sickle, the degree of *** is greatly affected, and it becomes almost the same as the bone dragon. However, the death sorcerer cannot be thrown away. Although the degree of the master servant is still much faster than the kings, the pursuit skills of the kings are becoming more and more skilled. There is no death sickle. When confronting the king, the *** will There is no power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now even Gregory can feel that the error range of the kings has become smaller and smaller. Their teleportation points are closer than once. Even once, I was just in the sky above the master and servant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was also the most fascinating one of the master and the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings simply glanced at the ground, except for a bunch of bone dragon wrecks, nothing unusual, and then whizzed away. The huge bones after weathering are everywhere in the outer world, and I don’t know what kind of behemoth was a few years ago. This kind of ground is the most common sight in the outer world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the bones on the ground suddenly moved, and then a twist, showing the appearance of a skull dragon. The flame ignited in the eyelids of the bone dragon, and the *** also drilled out from the body of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before encountering this thrill, the clever Gregory always felt uneasy. So when it has time, it installs crushed lime mud one by one on its own bones. If not, the body that shines with blue and black radiance has long been seen by the kings. For these actions of Gregory, the ignorance of *** is actually acquiescence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has long been tempted to disguise the wreckage of the bone dragon in times of crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after this thrill, *** was completely silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She silently took the bone dragon to hide in Tibet, killing countless kings, and the dragon with the abyss of the big intentions was extremely short, but it was a desperate death. battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon looked at the *** of the demon lotus is getting dim, watching *** first injury, watching *** first time weak Responding to your own injuries...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings are getting closer, but Gregory sees that the degree of *** is getting slower and slower. On several occasions, the main servant almost killed the patrolling undead. If it is not good luck, one or two fish that have slipped through the net will be sent a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a rest for a long time at the top of the cliff, but the bone dragon is clear, and the energy of the *** is not improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory finally broke the silence and said: "Master, although you never say it, but I know, we may not have the next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** * Still silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon has closed up the oily slippery tone, surprisingly serious: "Master! With the kings not far from us, you bring the heavenly parade Let's not let these damn kings always hit their wishful thinking, there must be a few to bury us!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Silver eyes finally fall In the body of the bone dragon, the light in her eyes fluctuated abruptly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not afraid of destruction?" *** finally opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory looked at the dragon in the abyss in the distance, and gnawed his teeth: "Not afraid! What I said in the past is also a noble dragon, at least no more than that. A dragon with a rotten meat? Even if I am ruined again, I have to come once in a vigorous manner, and I must not end everything like this now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind And too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We...there is no next time." *** faintly authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floating demon lotus armor suddenly collapses into a complete armor, floating in front of the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The gaze of the dark black demon lotus armor for a long time, seems to sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Gregory’s astonished eyes, the beautiful demon lotus flew up and landed on its back. The arms of the armor automatically extended and buckled the spine of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The fat-like finger points to the east, where the tomb is ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory! You are not the goal of the kings, go back to the tomb! If... If he comes, give the demon to He."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was shocked: "Master! Are you ready to face the battle? They can have six! Why not lead the heavens Down? That would be much simpler! Let them all be buried for us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time, maybe the last time, *** Black began to fly in the gale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, you will become a king in the future. Then you will understand that maintaining the existence and operation of this world is the true meaning of the existence of the king. If there are so many kings in the world of death in the world of heavenly patrols, it will definitely clean the world once. So I can't do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gregory is also silent, it thinks for a long time, only said: "I understand why the kings value the first law so much. But the master, since this is the case, why did you prepare for the last time you went to fight for the soul? Did the heavenly patroller lead it down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Don't answer this question, her silver eyes are just looking at the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory called a few times, and *** regained his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She brought up the slashing knife and looked at the dragon in the distance, faintly said: "Gregory, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, you go like this, not....not..." Bone Dragon finally got the courage and said the next sentence: "Don't you die?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A wave of hands, Gregory's body flashed, the soul contract has been lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiles lightly, her figure keeps flashing, and in the blink of an eye, she appears in the distance, and only her voice is still echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who said to go to die? Is your former owner so useless? Someone will be buried with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon stayed for a while, suddenly screamed: "Master! You are so despicable! Too shameless! You want to throw me down!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
