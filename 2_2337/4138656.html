			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mans in the early winter season are serene, serene, with a soft warmth. The old trees in the town shook in the cold wind, and occasionally dropped a few pieces of yellow leaves. After a year of hard work, the mountain people began to enter the winter break. Hunters occasionally went into the mountains to catch the game and add some oil to their wives and children. The mountain people are simple and practical, but they become very powerful under the harsh living environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth of the winter sun shines on the crowd gathered in the town square. The old mayor Ian is giving a speech at the emotional table. A simple sound-amplifier magic makes the old-aged mayor pass his voice clearly into everyone's ears. Ian is rare to wear a magician gown. The last time he wore this magician gown was thirty years ago, when he was a bloody adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen! I have been the mayor of Le Mans town for 20 years. Over the years, the calm of our town has never been broken. We are working hard. On the day, use your own hands to build a warm house, love our wife, raise our children. We fight with the floods, fight with drought, and fight with Warcraft. The scars on us are the imprint of these struggles, the man’s Pride! We have not retreated in front of anything that threatens our wives and children, because we are guarding the homeland of the generations, because we are proud people of the mountains!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A burst of applause sounded. Ianton paused and continued: "But now this tranquility is about to break. A few despicable and fierce aristocrats claim to be the masters of this land. This land belongs to us, this land belongs to the son of Dashan. And these nobles, Not only will we take our land, they will also steal the last piece of bread in our hands, the last apple of our children! These nobles,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian I Don, tremble: "Let us pay taxes of five gold coins per year!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman’s exclamation sounded, followed by a man’s angry cry. "Kill these nobles!" "Come them back to the king!" "No one wants to take our land!" A sharp boy sounded: "**The shackles of these nobles!" A burst of laughter sounded, The child's mother blushes, staring at the mischievous son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian and others calm down and continue: "When I first arrived in this town, Bam still didn't climb trees." Tall blacksmith wrapped around With the straps, half lying on the stretcher, I laughed embarrassedly. "But these nobles just injured him when they came here. They also unscrupulously sway the most beautiful girl in the town! Our wife and daughter have been humiliated by indescribable." Several young girls sobbed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only that, let's see what they did to my son, Guta!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient pagoda was helped by two strong young people. The townspeople silently watched his ankle-strapped ankles, tattered clothes, and had begun to rot the face. The most thrilling thing was the mark of the cold power on his face. "How can these nobles turn civilians into coolies at will?!" A young girl cried out and screamed. She was the lover of Guta. "Guta, what have they done to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian raised his hands: "Our survival is no longer guaranteed!! Our wife and daughter are being Defiled edge! Well, the tenth mage will challenge these nobles! Today's business, to the dead side! And you," Ian's voice turned soft: "My children, you have to go to the king to complain, go The church appeals, just as the night will pass, and justice will replace evil! God bless you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere on the square has reached its peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rush of horseshoes sounded, and a hundred and fifty wolf-like "Dragon and Beauty" knights rushed into the square and surrounded the square. Crowd. Although the mountain people are fierce, but surrounded by a fully armed knight, they can not help but chill, and the square in the hustle and bustle calmed down. The dragon and the beautiful knights let go of the two sides, and the aristocratic scums sneaked out on the high head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient pagoda suddenly hysterically yelled: "It is him, the demon!" The original tall man is now like a mouse forced into a desperate mouse, fear is up. At the very end, instead of trying to bite a cat. He shuddered and reached out and pointed at the nobles. The crowd looked in the direction of his fingers and saw a black armor Rogge throwing a battle axe, riding on the horse, complacency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man in the town stood up and shouted: "What’s wrong with the ancient pagoda, are you going to torture him like this?" Can it be said that the nobility can turn people into coolies? There are taxes for each of the five gold coins! Do you still give us a way to live? You must give us a confession today!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge looked at Ian in the middle of the square, and the invisible gaze between the two people almost wiped out the spark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a little, no longer paying attention to Ian, turned to look at the excited young man, calmly asked: "You just said, what is your tax? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five gold coins! This makes us..." The youth was excited again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger screamed and interrupted the youth’s complaint: "Toffler!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toffler immediately flashed out of the townspeople and squatted on the ground. "You tell me to see, I want you to tell Ian how much tax is in this town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toffler shakes even more Only kneeling on the ground, I dare not look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog scorned, a magical missile, three missiles hitting Toffler’s scalp on the ground, posing on the ground around his head A neat equilateral triangle. Ian was deeply worried when he saw Rogge's precise magical control. Seeing Toffler’s move, the bottom of my heart was chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Toffler, the next magical missile's head is not so bad!" Rogge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toffler looked up and his face was gray, and he looked up at Ian and squatted on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the tax you want to collect? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toffler’s teeth fight, and finally whispered: "This year is a silver coin for each household." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One stone stirred up a thousand waves. With a bang, the crowd immediately became a mess. Various questions, envy, accusations, and doubts were intertwined. If you are struck by lightning, your face turns white.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say to the mayor of Ian? Rogge pressed hard. "It's three silver coins!" Your Excellency, Master, Your Majesty, I am wrong. I should not greet the silver coins. I swear no more! Toffler cried aloud. Ian only felt that countless cockroaches blew in his head, his whole body was shaking, his lips were groaning, and he couldn’t even speak. The townspeople whispered and lost their minds. There was some suspicion and disdain in the eyes of Ian. Franco and Lens looked at each other and praised Toffler's acting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ian rushed over and raised his staff to Toffler on the ground: "You little man killed you!" I understand, you are colluding! "At this time a young woman rushed out and shouted at the crowd: "Don't believe these damn aristocrats!" They are demons! This Toffler is with them, he lied to my father! "{ /> /> br /> </ br> </ br> Immediately screaming at the goods: "Holy vindictive, he is a holy knight! "Kate's heart is full of joy, I did not expect that this deserted place is actually someone who knows the goods, the heart is a point, the vindictiveness disappears without a trace. The sacred knight is loyal to the faith, integrity is good, cherishes honor more than life, in addition, they are still The most determined believer of the Most High God. In short, the Holy Knight is basically the same as the incarnation of justice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate’s hand is revealed, someone called: “Listen to the knight What do adults say. The townspeople were quiet at once. Ian and her daughter’s face showed an uneasy look. Although the holy knight was always justified, this person was obviously a group with Rogge, and he could not help but worry.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate’s low voice: "Mr. Ian, you said that you are innocent. But Mr. Rogge claims that you use unfair means to gather wealth. And some people accuse you of harboring snow and silver fox mercenaries in the house. In order to prove your innocence, can I allow me to go to your house? "Ian stared at Rogge and looked at his life for a moment, so that you can search for it, why not! But if you can't find anything, I will never stop." Then he turned to his house. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of Rogge said: "A good life is clear, I don't know who is hooked up with Snow Fox, but who is it?" Ian swayed, right to do Did not hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layers of people crowded the town of the mayor’s house. Several townspeople were elected and went to the building to search with Kate. Ian was behind his face and was behind Kate. After the crowd went to the bedroom on the second floor of Ian, it ended the search for the entire small building and found nothing. Ian sneered again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark door opened, piles of gold coins, brilliant gems, green emeralds, shining magical armor, scattered throughout the room. The simple mountain people have seen such a rich scene, and their eyes are straight. In the impoverished mountain towns, the whole town does not eat or drink for a hundred years, and it does not accumulate this wealth. Ian’s money is not clear. The mountain people think of the taxation of five gold coins and consciously realize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian became cold all at once, and the staff in his hand fell underground. He knows that everything is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s daughter rushed out and held Ian to cry: “Father, tell them, those are not you! Tell them that someone is frame you. The old mayor calmed down and caressed his daughter's head. He said, "Fira, my child, it is no longer important that these treasures are mine. From then on, my father can no longer take care of you. Remember , children, don't avenge me, these people are not what you can deal with. Be an ordinary person, happy to live this life." The girl cried even more. The old town governors have seen these aristocrats one by one, seeing people faceless, all righteous and stunned, can not help but sigh, is old, really the waves after the Yangtze River push forward waves. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old town sighed long and walked out of the small building in the eyes of the town people, and the nobles quietly let a road open. Go out from the dark building. At the moment of the coming, the glaring sun shook Ian in a dazzling manner. The bitter cold wind made him feel that his clothes were thin, and Le Mans town was really early this winter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old mayor’s figure looks so old and lonely, the townspeople think of twenty years of getting along, but they can’t help but feel sad. Fira fell to the ground and looked at the old father’s back with tears, silent Sobbing, the beautiful back swayed. Her gaze turned to the nobles, but the horny aristocrats who were originally erotic were clear-eyed and walked in front of her, ignoring them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ian went to an empty place, turned around and calmly asked: "Which one would give the old man the glory of death in a decent duel?" Still have to let the old man commit suicide by himself. "Several nobles look at each other and silently. There are not a few scums in the field who have reached the tenth level in strength. But no matter which one is right, this kind of orthodox magician is almost stable, of course, the means are not so glorious." Finally, it’s still Rogge’s a step to take me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian squinted at Rogge and laughed. "I was a little embarrassed at the beginning. Although this strategy is simple and crude, it is practical and vicious. When you are young, your mind is so badly affected, the city is deep, and the future is not limited. The old man is planted in your hands today, and it is convincing. It’s just a cycle of heaven, and it’s not good for retribution. No one can get rid of the shackles of space law. Things can’t be done too much in the future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Space Law?” Rogge whispered a few times, as if he had moved something in his heart, but he couldn't grasp the feeling and was a bit irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ian staff had a meal and began to recite the spell. In an instant, the yellow luster flashed on the surrounding ground, and a thin layer of grease filled the floor. Subsequently, a shield against physical damage has been formed. Rogge smiled and seemed to be another magician who treated himself as a warrior. It's no wonder that there are magicians who wear body armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man carefully observed Ian’s third spell, or chose not to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two dark black magical arrays on the ground, two tall warriors wearing half-length armor coming out of the magical array, huge two-handed swords Two small ditches were plowed on the ground. The appearance of the warrior stunned the townspeople and caused panic. The crowds crowded and stepped back. The aristocratic scums under the field also frowned and clenched their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogby had a few simple gestures, whispered softly, a black mist drifting over, and the slashing of the long handle sickle appeared. The knives that were not seen in a few days, the more sharp the knife, the darker the color, the more folding of the blade, the shape of the lightning, the flashing edge of the blade. Rogge swiped his hands quickly, yelling in his mouth, and an add-on in the blink of an eye was applied to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian was shocked, and never thought that Rogge was actually a mage, and that the spell was still so fast. Seeing that two warriors can temporarily wrap each other for a while, Ian hurriedly recited the next spell, with magical symbols in his hands, and the magical energy carried by the fingertips left a shining trajectory in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***This is a long-awaited experience. After being applied, it is even more powerful. You can’t run around the two warriors, and it’s a knife from time to time. Swing out, regardless of the middle and no, a strike. The long-handled trowel has turned into a black gas, waving a whistling sound of the soul, facing the two high-ranking warriors, *** does not fall. Rogge licked this gap and applied magical and addictive techniques to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
