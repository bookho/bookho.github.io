			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the whiteness of the sky in the distance, and there was a satisfactory smile on the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the city of Dresden, 10,000 new troops have been assembled, and this time tomorrow, he will lead the army expedition. In the long and cruel wars of the future, the 80,000 new recruits of the Ayre Principality still do not know how many lucky people will live until the end of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first battle report in front of it has been passed back. The army of the Layton Kingdom has carried out small-scale exploratory battles with the Livi and Latvian coalition forces on the frontal battlefield. The Charlie Department is responsible for a small town on the left side of the defensive front, and across from him is the 15,000 Latvian army. Charlie didn't mean to fight with the other side, but he couldn't keep it. Latvia has insufficient military strength and has no intention of attacking the city. The two sides have been deadlocked for several days. But for Charlie, who is calm and war-torn, there is no good way for Latvian generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rogge’s whistling sound, followed by an unstoppable pain, his thoughts were pulled back from the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t suppress the triumph of his heart and turned to look at the beautiful woman who was struggling to sit up on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria grabbed the bed with both hands and used all his strength to sit up and lean hard on the pillow. Although she refused to scream again, her pale face and cold sweat on her face fully explained the difficulty of this simple movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed softly, and opened the mess that was scattered on her face. A pair of beautiful big eyes filled with hatred, despair and anger, deadly Staring at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog went to the bed and sat down, stroking her white legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's legs are as bright as snow, smooth and white skin is now scattered with a piece of bruise, these are the result of a night of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya turned his arm, and a slap in the face, Rogge smug, not flashing. Her weak and weak wave slid over his face, not so much as a slap in the face, but rather a gentle touch. Such a not-so-violent action caused her to look white and snorted low. For the hand that Rogge is still touching her legs, she knows that push can't push. Not to mention that now, she is intact, and it is by no means a powerful Rogge opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this has already been proven last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said with a smile: "His Royal Highness, this is what you said. It will always be successful if you try a few times. You see, are we not successful?" Maybe I am a little rough, but it is really because your attraction is too strong, I can't control my own sake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ria in Rogge I took a sip on my face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles, if nothing happens to wipe the face under the mouth, we are not children, why should we deal with things like an ordinary person? Since you have played a fire, you have to prepare yourself, or even burned to death, you can't blame others. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoge came to Froya's bedroom last night and said that he would apologize for the rude search of Froya the day before. Froya made And with aggrieved, I accepted Rogge’s apology. As before, Rogge proposed to try again with her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past two When it is lingering to a critical juncture, Froya will always have a very serious adverse reaction. Every time here, Rogge will stop thoughtfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, when Froya was cold, trembling, and biting the pillow, Rogge’s hand suddenly held her waist like a pair of irons, and the other hand ripped off. Her last bondage and cover.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria has long forgotten the physical discomfort, her heart, at that moment, has been completely hurt, Shock and fear filled up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the high magic, Froah is not as strong as the ordinary aristocratic girl. Her tender body Where can I survive Rogge’s unrelenting conquest?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also had the strength to beat, shov, and even bite Rogge, but she was weak. The attack couldn't even break a little Rogge's oil skin. Rogge slammed her slightly and vigorously, and smashed her last resistance. Froya only fell to the bed with powerlessness, letting Rogge enjoy her ice and snow. General.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call the guard? Here is the Grand Duchy of the Principality of Aray, not the royal palace of the Rhine. All people will only obey the orders of Rogge, that is, he ordered to kill himself, and those guards will certainly pierce the cold blade into their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who get along well? But the elves are almost blind to their gods! How could it be to help her? Froya’s heart flashed through the eyes of the butterfly, but she could only sigh. When the wind butterfly is seriously injured, where will it be Rogge’s opponent? Even if Fengdie restores all the martial arts, it will not be the opponent of Rogge, who is a means of planning. He will ask her, but she will be sent to Rogge's claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the only one who has the ability to save himself is Andreone, who is not far from here. But when she thought of her betrayal, Fu Luoya’s heart immediately burst into an unspeakable sadness, mixed with the hatred of Tao Tian. If anyone is more hateful than Rogge at the moment, then only Androni and the lord who took Androni will think of it here, and Froya can’t stop the anger in her heart, if not them, How can you jump into such a bottomless abyss and pay such a painful price? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, she will never ask Androni for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thoughts passed in her heart in a flash, and Froya suddenly appeared, and she was so isolated and helpless at the moment. And Rogge obviously knows this. He didn't even cast a silent enchantment. He was not afraid of her crying for help. Instead, she enjoyed her embarrassment and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A night of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge was weak and satisfied and fell on her, Froya could not lift a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger got up in a cloak, and when he stood still in front of the window, Froya was lying quietly on the bed, waiting for a bit of physical recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm has passed, and she forced herself to put all her remorse out of her mind and begin to reflect and plan. But before she even came up with a viable revenge method, an inexplicable fatigue and mourning had completely occupied her heart. From small to large, the scene has flashed from her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am happy?" Froya suddenly thought...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fulu His Royal Highness..." Rogge sitting on the bed called with the smile of the conqueror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t call me my High School again, I am just a princess who has lost my country. I have already deserved the title of His Highness." Froya was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Rheinland League has only been defeated, and it has not yet perished. At least the news of the demise has not yet come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The failure of the Rhine League is inevitable, and you should be more aware of this than I do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Froya Now, I can ask you again, what is the reason for you to kill me? Don’t say anything more than just a ridiculous reason to try the petrochemical helmet. You are so smart and beautiful, you should know that this reason can’t fool me. On the one hand, Rogge gently stroked the face of Froya and wiped the tears that had not dried up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take your hand! Don't you have enough?" Froya was cold and cold. However, she immediately saw that Rogge was still standing upright, and he was not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria finally flashed a hint of twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This silkworm died, but it was also caught in the eyes of Rogge. He immediately laughed and no longer was what he did. It doesn't matter if you are a princess, and I am no longer a small person who can only endure no matter what happens. In fact, today our position is just right. Presumably you are already here, here is the person who can do whatever he wants without taking consequences. But I am still very strange. Why do you want to kill me again and again? I originally thought that we had formed a temporary alliance, and because of the interests, this alliance should at least be solid at the moment. Even if they use each other, I still have great value. Moreover, my credibility is still decent, and at least the promised things are still being implemented. So, I really don't understand. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly realized, sighed: "Women's love and hate are really only in the first line! But I still don't understand why you choose to kill me first. It stands to reason that you should have killed Androni and After the woman who took her away, should it be my turn to start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya was silent, said: "Annie...I As for the woman, I can never be her opponent. Even if my master came, the result may be the same. And she is gone, I don’t know when I will see her again, just want to kill her. I have no chance to start. This time I see you again, your strength has grown too fast. I have already lost some of you. I am afraid that I will wait any longer, and I may not even be able to kill you, so I will start ahead of time. This is the reason I want to kill you. Are you satisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman... can you describe it to me?" Rogge thought about it. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria said calmly: "She is very beautiful, black straight, silver eyes, wearing a gray robe, always volley. Looks like she and You have a very little relationship. I have tried to save you, but I have not succeeded. She has entered the sanctuary when she is so young. I think that I will not be her opponent in my life, and I will not be able to put Anne’s. The heart is robbed again. In fact, I am completely desperate, I am already crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog snorted, my heart jumped to me That said, it is beyond reach. But didn't you become a great magician when you were very young? Entering the sanctuary is something that is late, how can it be so discouraged? But I have never seen or heard of this woman. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what he thought was: "Aha! It turned out to be O'Reilly! Is it just a sanctuary? It turns out that you want to be right with a god, then it doesn't matter if your teacher is coming, hehe! Haha! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria has taken care of the chaos before the balance has the magic of the present, it is based on equipment and skill, not entirely my own If this is not the case, I will not be so unconfident, and will not kill you. Forget it, don't talk about it, Rogge, I have already said everything you want to know. What are you going to do next? Dispose of me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asks: “If I say that I am not prepared to do anything, what arrangements will you have?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiles and says that I am leaving, will you kill me immediately? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Rogge really hesitated, he looked at the sad, beautiful face of Froya, gently said: "Froya, you know No one wants an enemy who is both a pharmacy master and a great magician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya regained her calmness and asked: "I understood. I want to ask you, have you already known that my physical discomfort is pretending? "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> I always thought that I would act very well. I didn't expect you to be better than me. I really looked down on you, and with just one mistake, I couldn't turn over anymore. Your usual magic is always at the 11th level. In fact, your true strength has not told anyone? How much is your current magic, thirteen, or fourteen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed Tolerance, your classification method should be between thirteen and fourteen. I was able to release more than six levels of magic, but I still couldn't use the seven levels of magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you have to start, can you tell me again, what is the magic you use to crack the petrified light?" That magic is definitely not in the known magic system. How did you learn it? I am very curious, you will not let me die with curiosity? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighs again and is not a magic, but can ignore all the methods of prohibiting the casting of magic, called the alien bound spell purgatory. This method also One thing is to store a lot of magic power, so that the magical power that is usually displayed is maintained at a relatively low level. The person who taught me... is the princess of the devil world, Elysses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria has been silent for a long time, and said: "The thirteenth level of magic, spiritual shock, instant cast, and the ability to cast double spells at the same time... You are so good... Alien cursing Purgatory, no matter how I use magic crystal to observe you, your magic is 11th. If you really don't think you have only 11 levels of magic, I will not do it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
