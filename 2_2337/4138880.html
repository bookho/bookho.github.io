The first few emperors were not in the position for a long time, and the longest one was only in power for five years. They need to compete with the surrounding tribes for land and water. They need to be wary of dwarves and orcs. They need to defend against the wilderness of the wilderness, and even fight the occasional strong darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four great emperors of the early days of the Asrovic Empire were not killed in the deep palace. They all got the fate of a true North Warrior,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh environment has never yielded the North Warriors. After the initial hardships, the empire grew tenaciously and grew stronger. It was at this time that the miracle of the Most High God came to the emperor at that time. Shortly thereafter, the Church of Light, which was not too powerful at that time, sent the most urgently needed wizards, healers, and magical equipment to the Astrophy Empire, and gradually replaced the primitive religions of the tribal era. Become the first church in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, in the eyes of officials in the upper and lower empire, rights were equivalent to responsibility. However, hundreds of years later, with the expansion of the empire's territories and the accumulation of wealth, these simple ethos are increasingly moving away. Grades and ranks are essential for an increasingly bureaucratic system. The extravagant winds of comparison are also a year in the middle of the aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the extent to which the Empire is eroded by material and ease is simply not comparable to the rich South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Running so far, it’s a small aristocrat who has to take two followers. Let’s catch a carriage? Well, if you have a little power, the carriage is definitely I have to put a pretty woman. I am also a prince now, and I still have to rely on my own two legs to hurry!" Rogge thought with some self-deprecating thoughts, while running hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the dull footsteps echoed in the forest and quickly went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is certainly not polite for the Druid who is so bad that he falls into such a situation. What's more, Druid still provoked him: "The devils of the devils, you all wait for Laozi. The city that digs the clouds is just the beginning! I have spent the rest of my life with you! And that damn naturally Goddess, one day, I will pull you down the altar. The red-eyed beauty god...what is her name...no matter how much, she said that she is not far from God and me. Natural goddess, even if you can't do anything about you, Lao Tzu has to make a bad breath on your followers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue cursed the goddess of nature and her Believers. As I climbed over the mountains, I ran all the way to the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He resists the wrath of the natural goddess for a maximum of ten days, during which time he will fly from the emperor to the city of the gods, but not one Easy thing. However, since it relies on its own two legs, Rogge’s requirements for the road are very low. As long as it is not in the abyss of the flame tyrant, the fat man can pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the map of the Empire, Rogge drew a straight line directly between the Imperial City and the City of God. Then start running on this line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of permanent curing acceleration is good, at least there is no carriage that can compare the speed of Rogge, and the horse needs rest and sleep, but the fat man No need to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one in the sanctuary to guard, he simply does not dare to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, an embarrassing thing appeared. All the clothes on Rogge were activated by the wrath of the natural goddess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After then. The fat man had to streak in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has brought him a whole new feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man climbed the mountain to the rising sun, then bathed in the golden sun and jumped into the valley. As night fell, accompanied by the stars and the blue moon, he strode over the grassland, behind him, followed by a large group of hungry devil wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when the fifteenth sun jumped out of the horizon. Rogge boarded the last mountain on the road. In the valley below, the beautiful city of the gods is quietly bathing in the golden morning light. The tall canopy of the three tall elves and old trees can't help but spurt a faint magical mist. The mist of the mist has blocked the cold of the autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing at the top of the mountain, Rogge looked around, but see the mountains, the clouds are long, the front is a half-round red day, hanging behind a blue moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, his chest has been exhausted for many years, and after taking a deep breath, Rogge used all his strength to scream like a real orc! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumbling rumble with all the anger, oppression, gloom, and a wave of fare in the heart of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound, the trees and rocks around Rogge were shattered, and four or five pieces of foreign objects that could not be squirmed and not formed were dropped. In the snoring, these heterogeneous creatures that have not completed the activation process have burst into a few beaches of clear water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the seemingly never-ending snoring, a crisp voice suddenly came from behind Rogge: "It’s so ugly, it’s endless. Didn't you see the beasts on the mountain running out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s snoring stopped, and he turned back and looked around, not far behind The beautiful elf who is smiling lightly is Effie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have known that Rogge Wanli streaks, not only waiting here, but also holding a whole new set of clothes in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said nothing, suddenly rushed to her. Effie screamed: "What are you doing? Hey! Go to the bath first, dirty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Roger is so much? He struggled with Effie on a big tree, and then tore the clothes of her lower body a few times, and then went straight into her body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie screamed and then bite a bit on Rogge's shoulder. Then she showed her arms and wrapped her neck tightly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the rain were in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face of the face, Effie is very puzzled to see Rogge, who is more than ten meters away from lightning, her delicate left hand is in the lower body. A probe, then surprised to ask: "Ah! Just finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's over." Rogge nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie did not say anything more, she picked up the new clothes scattered in the ground and put them in the hands of Rogge, said: "That is to wear clothes to return to the city!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the city of the gods. Rogge asked inexplicably: "Effie, how do you know to wait for me here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eiffel takes out a map. Dao: "Elders of Shusi gave me your route of the road yesterday. He said that you will arrive this morning, so I have been waiting. You are very unpleasant, so loud, can be a few kilometers away. I can't find you when I hear it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog took the map and saw that it was in the big map of the Empire in his room. In part, the northeast corner is the emperor Richelieu. The southwest corner is the city of the gods, and between the two cities, a straight line is drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger Daqi, the specific location of the city of the gods is still a secret in the empire. He has been careful about everything, and between the impressions, the map that marked the location of the city of the gods has been burnt down. How is it now in the hands of Effie? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge set off, Hughes had not left the capital. But the fat man is running naked and streaking down. Instead, Xius waited for a few days in the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising to think about it, the inexplicable book that Hughes left about the relationship between speed, time and space, Rogge simply can not read it. This old fox of Hughes is not faster than him, it is several times faster than him, and it is entirely possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fat and Effie down the mountain can not be fast. The clothes of Effie's lower body were torn by Rogge and the action was great. It will inevitably come out. Fortunately, in the city of the gods, it was surprisingly quiet. There was almost no elf on the street. The two of them were able to return to the temple of God in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Rogge called Effie. It’s so angry and funny: “Look at what you said, it’s like I’m going to see a female land!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn’t it?” Questioning in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the clear eyes of Effie. Rogge’s old face was inevitably red, and he coughed twice. “It’s not that it’s going to be more than one day...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effie said: "I know that your body has changed. Going to bed, all kinds of races that insist on a short time, there will be a lot of times, such as the Philip lion, the cloister, and so on. You are now Sticking to such a short time, there will be more times. I still have a lot of things to do, I can't accompany you, so tell you in advance where you can go to bed with you. But... your physical changes this time. It’s really not good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and said with a smile: "Okay, good! Now you are still willing to go to bed with me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie frowned: "Your question is very strange! You should know that as long as you want, I can do it any time. If it is to ask me how I feel, then It’s just that this is not the case.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s nerves are tough and no Free to children in front of Effie defeated, scared fled upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he gently pushed the door of Froya, there was a colorful faint smoke. The Leprechaun has completely turned his place of residence into a large magic laboratory. There are dozens of various utensils on the test bench, which contain different magical agents in different colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the room, Androni is resting. She placed the same sign in the same position, with two long legs resting on a test bench, and her face was covered with a magic book by Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flora in the room is facing the sky, and is constantly busy. When she heard the door open, she did not lift her head: "Put the food on the table on the side and go out. Don't bother me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still a little early to leave the meal." Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria suddenly screamed and settled in place. I don’t know if the crystal bottle in my hand is falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sky and the stars quietly reached over, caught the crystal bottle, and quietly collected it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria has completely forgotten that there has been such a crystal bottle in the world, she just turned slowly and looked at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin suddenly smiled, although she did not have the slightest decoration, even the hair was a mess. But just a smile, that is, a thousand styles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: "Dead fat. Are you really alive back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Laughing: "If you don't come back alive, isn't it a waste of a chance to take advantage of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's face is red, she immediately bites Lower lip, said to Androni: "Annie! You go out for a while!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! I am here, nowhere." Droni took off the magic book on her face and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little demon slammed against Androni for a moment and finally snorted. To Rogge: "You come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya took Rogge into the room, then slammed and closed the door Behind me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at the closed door and smiled a little, and the smile was bitter. Her right hand, the long, white index finger, buckled the armrest of the chair. It seemed to be timing. When it was buckled to 120, the door in the room opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froah's face was a blush. In the green eyes of the earth, it is full of surplus and water waves, and it is very shocking. She bit her teeth and glared at Rogge, all of a word seems to be squeezed out of her teeth: "Dead fat! Since it is cheap, it doesn't roll! Wait, how long will you stay back this time?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s body trembled a little, but on the surface it was still nothing to say: “If I don’t think I will drag you down, then I will go with you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge smiled: "How can you be dragged? Well, I have to go to the old things of Xius, and come back to see you at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Fu Luoya smiled and said: "I can only promise you a cheaper. If you dare to come hard... I still have some dragon poison here! Do you want to try?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man laughed and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin is busy again, just different from just now, her mouth always has a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the room. The thick magic book is always on the face of Androni. She seems to be unable to look down on the skin and is extremely thick between Froya and Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just. She loosely held the right hand of the starry sky, and her fingertips trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial order is extremely strict. If Rogge is not on the front line within a month, it is immediately a murder. Although the Principality of Aray is not too far away from the ‘tidal’ regiment station assigned to Rogge, how can the army have to go for ten days. The time left for Rogge is very small. Fortunately, the elves are very efficient. In just one day, the three thousand elves have been reorganized and can start immediately. These elves include two thousand archers and one thousand engineering units. It can be said that the city of the gods has already come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the territory of the Principality of the Republic, the Bauhinia Butterfly has already completed the 40,000 army and set off a day ago. From the speed of the whole army alone, we can see her outstanding talent. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Rogge plan, he will lead the elves to join the Principality in the province of the Duke of Dolyak, and then proceed to the southeast. If time is too late, then he can go to the front line alone, first report to the station to say. However, he has already decided that this time he will bring Androni or Hughes to the side. Otherwise, he can't let his prince of the empire streaking to the front line to face the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first returned to the city of the gods, Rogge found that it was almost an empty city, and many of the elves, even the elderly and children, rushed to the mountains to build An underground castle, even Hughes ran to sit in person. The fat man was very curious and rushed over to take a look. As soon as he entered the underground passage, he immediately became shocked by the size of the underground city and the complexity of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to an elf mage who is responsible for the construction of the dungeon, this underground maze was originally occupied by a group of powerful undead, but they are ready to come to the ground for evil. At the time, the elders were repaired in time. So the elves started a long tug of war with the undead who tried to rush to the ground, and gradually gained the upper hand. The undead see the general trend has gone, the elf can break into the labyrinth at any time, finally fleeing and fleeing into the depths of the Central Mountain Range. Later, the elders of Xiusi felt that such a huge underground maze was a pity, and they planned to reinvent it as a possible shelter for the elves in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened deeply afterwards. The city of the gods is indeed beautiful. However, the terrain in which it is located is easy to attack and defend, even if more defense facilities are built. It is impossible to defend the magic of the city, and the city's defense power is impossible to match the underground labyrinth in the middle of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man himself is very much in favor of building such an underground castle. He lacks taste and he always disapproves of all kinds of gorgeous but not practical things. It is just that the beautiful and exquisite city of the gods is the best note of the flashy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned around in the underground labyrinth under the guidance of the wizard wizard. It seems to be the accumulation of the dead spirit here, and there are faint deaths in the passage. Although these residual breaths are light, Rogge himself is a Necromancer and is extremely sensitive to the breath of death. He feels that these breaths are very pure and powerful. It must come from some very powerful undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man nodded secretly, and he finally understood why Hughes suddenly left without saying goodbye. Such a powerful undead, once rushed to the city of the gods, the remaining elves must be lost. It is a pity that these undead untimely hit the head of the old fox, which was rarely seen in the millennium. They can escape into the mountains, and the ending is still good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man hurriedly watched in the labyrinth of the underground, and rushed back to the city of the gods to arrange the equipment of the elves. It is precisely because of this. He passed by the hall at the deepest point of the labyrinth. If the fat man is standing in the temple, he will surely recognize that this is the hall of the Lich Ella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiusi was very much in favor of Rogge's three thousand elves. He believes that the city of the gods is now hiding behind the Principality of Are, and it is not a problem in security. The only thing that needs to be concerned is the orc tribe that wanders in the Central Mountains. The orcs are extremely fertile, and a tribe scores a group of orcs in a few years. Let them migrate to the distance to find food. Otherwise, the orc's tribe will become bigger and bigger, and the green hills will be smashed into bald ridges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to the orcs in the Central Mountains, Rogge suddenly has another idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few days before Rogge returned to the city of the gods, Doolin led his troops back to the Principality. He took out three thousand soldiers and brought back more than 2,700 people. The only difference was that the original rookie became a brave warrior. In a few months, Doolin moved thousands of miles in the mountains, and dozens of orc tribes uprooted with the orcs and various Warcraft battles. However, he found that as the troops gradually deepened in the mountains. There are more and more orc tribes encountered. And whether it is from the organization, individual combat power or equipment, the orc warriors of these tribes are much stronger than the small tribes that they have encountered before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suspected. Deep in the stretch of the Central Mountains, a new orc empire has taken shape. After scouting a tribe with hundreds of elite orc warriors, Doolin used a hundred warriors as a bait to lure the adult orcs of the tribe into the ambush, but gathered them to kill. Du Lin immediately rushed to attack the village of the orc tribe, killing a clean, regardless of men, women and children, and then brought all the food found, quietly withdrew from the Central Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s fruitfulness is quite unexpected. It seems that this young commander of the former Holy Alliance coalition, who was in danger of being killed, did have extraordinary skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair of brothers and sisters of Bauhinia and Doolin are rare talents. It is a pity that both of them are reluctant to return to the fat man. They say that they are not worried. It is estimated that even these two brothers and sisters will not believe it. Therefore, although the fat man has a heavy responsibility for the two, he also instructed Horne that they should not relax their surveillance for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order not to catch fire in the backyard at the time of the expedition, the fat man can be said to have spent a lot of thought. In addition to the soldiers brought back by Doolin, Rogge gave Du Lin two thousand new troops and instructed him to clear the orcs in the Central Mountain Range. In the new letter written by Fatty to Du Lin, he told Du Lin that except for the armor of the weapon, all the supplies were solved on the spot. If it is the permission of the war, it is necessary to plunder the food for the Principality as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many new recruits of the 40,000 expeditionary soldiers led by the Bauhinia Butterfly from the occupied area of ​​the Principality, while the soldiers of Doolin are all from the original Ayre Principality. This is why Du Lin wants to rebel, and the soldiers under his command are not in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days in the city of the gods, Rogge was almost crazy. But even then, he can always find a little bit of time to be intimate with Effie. It was only after each incident that Effie’s unconcealed gaze always allowed Rogge to hate that every tooth was itch. However, the time he was able to completely suppress the wrath of the natural goddess was so long. In a very limited time, the fat man could not show his bravery to Effie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning two days later, a team of elves came out of the city of the gods and prepared to re-enter the battlefield of blood and fire. The elves have the talent to communicate with animals, and are also natural excellent riders, and the North is rich in horses, so Roger simply turns all the elves into cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stood in the end of the team, after a certain distance, he suddenly felt a little, looked back. The fat man's eyesight is excellent, although they are far apart, they still see the beautiful figure of Effie on the city head disappear. Originally, the fat man only felt very personal about the maverick Effie, and it was very easy to get along with her, but there was not much special feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now somehow, the fat man suddenly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, it’s time to take her with her..." The fat man thought silently. He sighed and shook his head again. Effie's strength is not good, Rogge is now difficult to protect himself, how can she take care of her on the battlefield? If you want to survive under the magical flames of a thousand horses, it is impossible to have no strength. It is conceivable that the ‘tide’ army, led by the imperial name of the empire, has not been able to make a difference in the past ten years, and the enemy that Rogge is about to face will not be able to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger led the three thousand elves into the Principality of Aray, and then did not pass through Dresden, but directly along the closer road into the jurisdiction of the Duke of Dolyak The imperial province. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the natural appearance, whether it is the Empire or the South, the price of Elf slaves remains high. Although the elf trade has been declared illegal in the former sacred alliances of the Principal Leighton and the Principality of Aray, and extremely harsh laws have been enacted to punish those who dare to participate in the trafficking of elf slaves, the elf slave trade in other areas of the empire is still legal and active. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
