			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream volume, four destructions, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stone giant magic, no way to find hidden Enemies in the dark. He stood for a moment, suddenly clenched his hands and snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge screams rushed into the darkness of the night, and even torn the black curtains in the air, letting a little starlight shine on the peak of Bimen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His snoring set off a small storm, destroying buildings within a hundred meters of the week! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a snoring, the stone giant’s body screamed with the roar of giant rock, and the giant rock that formed his body began to drift slowly, and the crevice in the rock was transmitted. Earthy yellow light. The stone giant's body grew nearly ten meters high, which stopped the roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge still has a lingering moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has the last means of escape, the horror power of the forest soul is clear to him. Once the soul is locked, it is hard to say whether the life-saving means prepared by the fat man will work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What monster is this?" Rogge, who is hidden in the dark, distinguishes the atmosphere of the stone giant and whispers Adelini. Just waiting for her to answer, Rogge has captured a familiar atmosphere from the stone giant, so he frowned: "No! He is not a Warcraft, but a Druid! In terms of his power, the ten is One of the four Druids. The original goddess behind the orcs is the goddess of nature!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne snorted and said: "All see He cast the soul of the forest, you actually want to understand that he is Druid now? Hey, he found us, why are you not afraid this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The eyes of Stone Giant have changed from the original local amber to a faint red. After the magic blessing, his eyes have been replaced with real eyes. Enough to get rid of all the illusions and invisible effects, naturally found Rogge and Adrienne who stood at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the tens of meters high stone giant, the fear of Roger’s face has long since disappeared. He carelessly looked at the stone giant and smiled and said: "Only the unknown can make me afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are hundreds of werewolves in the square. Guards, they saw the stone giant, shouting the prophet of the earth, rushing to Rogge and Adrienne. The Prophet, who was worshipped by the orcs, had raised his feet first. Ruge and Ade Renee, who are arrogant and rude, step down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gale has already boasted the two men’s robes, but Adrienne is still no one, like a smile to Rogge: "So what about me? I am already Is it still unknown?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled. A flash of figure has appeared in dozens of meters, and it is not allowed to avoid the giant foot of the Prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His laughter came from afar: "Are you? It used to be unknown!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne smiled slightly. Until the foot of the Prophet of the earth almost touched her fluttering hair, her golden enamel lighted up and the figure disappeared from the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great prophet of the earth has stepped on the ground with a huge pit with a few meters deep, and the spattered gravel will rush to the forefront of several werewolves. Hit the ball and fly out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...this is the bare seduce of the red luo!" The gnome hidden in the void is shaking with excitement, it doesn't even know What kind of barking is enough to vent the tremor in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shut me up!" Weina roared. Gregory is indeed a delight. But many times it is simply unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes..." Gregory often accepted it humbly for certain orders from the two masters, but resolutely did not change: "The most beautiful Master Na, you see, that woman is simply challenging your majesty! Your brilliance can let her be such a vulgar? Although she is filled with the blood of the demon emperor, how can you be afraid of this? Even if the devil is coming, it will only be a part of your dragon soul gun! I see it. If you don’t kill her directly, I’m afraid it’s hard to erase the stain that she painted on your brilliance. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the conflict is inevitable, it is necessary to find a way to stop the trouble. This is what Gregory learned from the master of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sat on the dragon soul gun and watched the battle below. When she heard Gregory's provocation, she snorted and said coldly: "If I killed her with a shot, wouldn't it really be a girl?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is busy: "No! No! The master is not a girl, you are... oh no! You are so beautiful and intelligent, how can you relate to the word 悍... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnomes are falling and the sound is getting smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be happy for a while, it has not been known how many times it has suffered these days. Weina almost tested the underground gnome body with all kinds of elemental damage around the clock. And it is constantly being modified according to the size of the damage. It is said to create an unprecedented gnome of the earth. Gregory’s heart was bitter, and the powerful gnome was just a dwarf. Any dragon can come and flatten it. But it knows why Weina does this, and how dare to say more? It is only forbearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked down on the battlefield of the entire beast temple, silenced for a long time, and said coldly: "Gregory, you are going to hold the Lord of the Peak." Road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is as big as a sly, and screams away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raging fire of the Beast Temple and the roar of the sky have already awakened the orc emperor under the peak of Mengmeng. The orc warriors of the brigade squad, whose armor is not perfect, are screaming, and follow the grand peak of the main road, vowing to tear the enemies who dare to invade into pieces. The fierce two-legged dragons also flew in groups from the orc emperors and made a tweet. Rush to the peak of Bimen. In dozens of bipedal dragons, there are also a number of body-specific, apparently mutated over the ground dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the orc warriors were overcrowded on the road, and the long queues could hardly move forward, and the orcs behind them pushed the companions in front of them angrily, from time to time. The orcs were squeezed out of the Panshan Road, which was ten meters wide, and screamed and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foremost orc warriors are nailed to the ground. Do not go any further. There is no reason for it, on a broad platform in front of them. An elegant and majestic sacred dragon is on the plate! These orc warriors are not brave, but they are different from the orcs who have been led by the prophets of the earth to the wisdom of the orcs. They still have the instinct of too many beasts. It is this that makes them in the sacred dragon. The rival Longwei was deterred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the densely populated beasts, the sacred dragon’s heart is very lacking. It desperately urged Longwei, but the front of the orcs in the back of the soldiers constantly pushed, is moving forward step by step. And the eyes of the orcs are gradually becoming blood red, and it is clear that they are going to be in a state of madness. The beast has a large manpower, and they all have excellent weapons. Their full strength and axe are enough to cut the scales of the sacred dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is in a dilemma. It is really unwilling to fight with these orcs, and has the heart to withdraw, but the master has ordered him to stay on the peak passage. Looking at the crowded orc-like orc queue on the upper peak channel, the Gregory of wisdom suddenly flashed a flash of light, and immediately began to pick up the dragon language magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of the dragon. The ground beneath Gregorian shook. The vibrations are getting stronger and stronger, and there are countless cracks on the platform that stretches across the air in the blink of an eye. Gregory saw the magic effect, was greatly encouraged, and took the last syllable with majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roar in the half-bend of Bimeng, and the whole platform collapsed. Countless gravels and dozens of orc warriors fell from the steep peaks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the peak was destroyed. Although there are several other trails on the peak. But it is much narrower than this main road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory floated in the air, watching the orc warriors who could not advance and retreat, could not help but smug. It succeeded in the success of the change of terrain in the magical system of the human language in the dragon language magic, and it was beyond its own expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory of the Magic Guide? Hey, this name is really good, and it will develop in this area in the future." The Holy Dragon is proudly Thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are Gregory?" A gentle voice suddenly sounded in Gregory's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was in a good mood and answered without thinking about it. After that, it only felt something wrong. Looking around, I didn't see who was talking to it. But this sound sounds very familiar. Let it shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is talking to the sacred Gregory?" It was filled with guilty conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a girl you said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne’s faint figure Appearing in front of Gregory, she smiled and reached out and patted her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Libra was so scared that it was cold and completely unmovable. The only hope for it at the moment is that Adrienne did not know what it was just like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne's hands are perfect, soft and delicate. But in the heart of Gregory, even the giant claws of an abyss demon are stroking it, much better than her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is so long...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory doesn’t even know that Adrienne is When it disappeared, it stayed for a moment, and then turned to look at the flying dragons in the sky, suddenly roaring and rushing over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, time has only passed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the Great Hall of the Beast Temple, the Prophet of the Earth roared like a thunder! He traces the singularity of Rogge, and raises his hand to bring a hurricane like a knife, gravel like rain! Whether it is a hurricane or a flying gravel, it has the power of destruction. At the beginning of the square, there were hundreds of quick werewolves who helped to pursue Rogge, but in the blink of an eye, dozens of people were accidentally injured by the Prophet of the Earth. Although these werewolves were brave, they had to retreat to the side at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prophet of the Earth roared, and he waved between the thorns, the jungle entanglement, the sun beam, and the boiling high-order spells of Druid one by one. Throw it out as if it didn't consume magic at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously. The dark curtain of the night sky was shattered by the Prophet of the Earth, and it was once again closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the starlight disappeared, it seemed that the whole world was silent for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne, who has been flying for a long time, suddenly appeared in front of the Prophet of the Earth. Her golden and blue eyes became the brightest stars in the night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the Prophet of the Earth paused and seemed to feel the heavy atmosphere. However, he was immediately provoked by Adrienne's arrogance, screaming, a big wave of a wave, a fiery magical beam shot into the air, no protective magic Adelaini! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of time began to slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light beam in the hands of the Earth Prophet has just illuminated. When I started to flock to Adrienne, the strange whistling sound suddenly sounded under the night sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong purple brilliance is coming. Milo sipped, and the giant hammer burning in the hands of the purple flame slammed on the shoulders of the prophet! In the roar, several giant rocks that formed the shoulders of the Prophet of the Earth suddenly spread over the cracks. Dozens of small stones and gravel floated like gravity, and more gravel was loose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prophet of the Earth has not yet had time to make a painful snoring, and a faint sigh of blackness flies past him! The black gas left a thick smog, which seemed to drift slowly and slowly to the waist of the Prophet. The rock of the Prophet of the Earth was in contact with the black mist. Immediately humming and eroding at an extremely fast rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock is eroded, revealing a viscous magma-like body radiating a yellowish ray; after the body has eroded, there is a hot slurry. Out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sarah Wenger’s figure emerged from the black air, the earth’s prophet’s waist has already had a square of two meters, a dozen meters deep horrible wound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side of the square, Constantine stood on the roof, and there was a strong sacred glow between his hands. The power of the cardinal sacred sect is terrifying. Never let go of the killing magic cast by the Great Magister. Just at the moment of Shenghui’s shot, Constantine saw the situation in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss always turned around, just to see the Adelaide gold and blue two-color 瞳 无 无 无 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 For a time, the entire square has become a world based on gold and blue two colors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne greets the Prophet of the Earth to radiate the sun's rays, not to evade at all! She danced her hands with heavy afterimages, and there were countless gestures in the blink of an eye. Then her right hand opened like a blue, welcoming the sun beam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is gentle and wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a wind made up of purely magical energy that does not require spells, does not require control, and does not require attributes. It is destroyed only because it is powerful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment when thinking is too late to flow. There is endless magical energy that flows from Adrienne's slim body! The emergence of magic seems to be endless. Just like in her curvaceous body, there is a whole sea of ​​magical power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical storm that is enough to destroy everything is instantly formed. Facing the surging sun's beam, it will flow upwards with a completely unstoppable momentum. Wherever the magical storm passes, the existence of all matter is completely destroyed, and even the hot sun beam is dissociated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eyes of the Prophet of the Earth, the counter-current wind eroded the sun beam and swallowed his giant palm, double wrist, arm, and upper arm. , hit his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the snow meets the sun, the giant rock of the earth's prophet has melted silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great rock is full of the body inside; the body is eroded, the hot ** begins to transpire. At the end of the day, the Prophet of the Earth, once a giant, left only a huge ochre spar struggling in the wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely fierce!" Sarah Wenger sighed, thought about it, and shook his head again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelene, who stood in the air, did not hear the heartfelt evaluation of the boss. She looked at the huge spar in front of her, the gold and blue two-tone It is already a blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elysses... Have you seen it? Have you seen my magic? I am finally better than you. But you... why are you waiting? Can't I try again with me?" she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adeline immediately woke up from her meditation, she sighed and spurred the magical storm, and wanted to thoroughly trace the traces of the last prophet of the earth. Chemical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that at this moment, time has come to a halt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly found that no matter how motivated, the magic wind is not willing to advance one point. Adelaide discovered that the whole world has lost all its colors and turned into a black and white world. Thoughts are still going on, but all movements are still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the flow of time has stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cast the time still? Aide Renee has already thought of several contingency plans in her mind, and only waits for the time to resume the movement, and immediately launches the corresponding magic according to the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in the eyes of countless people, Rogge flew over half of the square and waved a punch to crush the Prophet of the Earth. The ochre spar left behind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the spar smashed, the time returned to flow, so everyone heard Roger’s screaming laugh: “This time you are finally me. "First, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne looked down on Rogge’s left hand, where the remains of the magic scroll were still burning. Rogge used a precious timeless reel, just to gamble with her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne suddenly smiled, although the appearance was nothing to do, but this smile made her whole person look dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, since we have already leveled out, then we will use the next time to decide the outcome." She smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, Wella’s face was frosty, and he unwittingly gripped the dragon soul gun in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
