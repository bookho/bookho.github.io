			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo is pleased to add a thousand dollars, but also to congratulate the use of imported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles in the building have finally slept for a few hours. When the sky was so bright, Rens left in a hurry and tried to break the crime. The rest of the people finished washing and put on the hammer of the professional smile. "There was a torture of the new day. No one cares about the theft of last night. It is worthwhile to lose a piece of fire after the fire. After all, no one really sees it. I don’t know that every “not old fairy spring” looks different, and it’s normal to steal the wrong one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ett, this time only cares about modifying himself, seduce Isabella and secretly looking for flowers to ask the hammer of the Willows. It’s no effect that everyone has been persuaded for a few times, and that’s it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people went to the "Knight of the God of War" and saw that the car of Orpheq was stopping at the door. There was some doubt, so early in the morning, how was he? Suddenly come over? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small meeting room on the third floor of the "Knight of the God of War", Orphee and Elysses have been sitting for a while. A beautiful maid who was still sleepy and obedient had just brewed the coffee and put some snacks on the plate. Seeing the three nobles and the Fiss, the fog magic came in and settled, and Orpheco coughed a little... Elysses, you see, are you picking something you like? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, Elyss stood up, coldly said: "You must talk about something that is not a good thing!" Men in the world are the same! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several nobles are very sick and painful. Elysses is all on the boutique, she never pays, even though the loss is the biggest Orpheus, but the golden lion is public and private in this matter: either share the loss according to the capital contribution, or you ask her for money. Anyone who has dealt with Elysses knows that she has no money at all. The concept, looking for her to ask for money, even if she does not turn her face, there is no money to give. If you want to play the ideas of the magic items in her collection, it may be easier to grab a dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp After the departure of Elysses, Orphee’s unexpected face is just a sip of coffee. Three cups of coffee are in the air, the pot is empty, and he’s not upside down. When something came out, it was just sitting right, looking out the window, coughing a few times and saying that recently made a nice ring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It turned out to be for this. It’s just that Orphea is full of strength and young and strong. How do you need this? The crowd immediately began to think about going up, couldn't he say that he was an embroidered pillow? More unbearable thoughts: "It seems that this Elysses really hurts, even the golden lions can't stop her. In time, it is not sucked into a lion..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing everyone's expressions are more and more weird, Orphee Rouge snorted, murderous, and the house was chilling. Everyone was busy picking up the mess in their hearts and was sitting in danger. Orfey Roques opened this mouth, and there was some stuttering in the opening: "This ring is very interesting to the father of the family.... I want to have a look. I don't know if there is any new one?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people never imagined that the Bavarian Grand Duke would be tempted by this "not old fairy spring", and he couldn’t help but be a little hilarious. Fes is busy: "There is a new one, and it will be successful tomorrow. The effect should be much better than the first two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oficok Just like the head. The father has agreed to grant the right to operate the ‘God’s Hammer’ military weapon, and has designated the Lionheart Knights and my Golden Lion Knights to purchase equipment from the Quest of the God of War. Because of the possibility of a war with the Ron Principality, his father was also prepared to fund the treasury of the Principality and repair a road connecting to the city of Seller. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people in the house are all happy, the gold content of these promises is far beyond the area of ​​a 'not old Xianquan happy, Rogge tempted to ask: "Oh Felix, there are other requirements behind this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offiok nodded in the first year, my Golden Lion Knights to expand a hundred, the Lionheart Knights to expand a thousand. These people's equipment are ready to be purchased from the 'God of the God of War', so it is imperative to how to produce these equipment on schedule. Counting the intensive training period for three months, we only have nine months. And at least five sets of captains The equipment needs to be built by Fiss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face immediately became as big as a bucket, and said: "It takes fifteen days to hit a ring that is not old." I can't finish the order for it. How can I have time to create something else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orfey Rouge looked around for a week, and everyone saw some puzzles. He sighed: "Everyone is not an outsider. The Principality is now in a delicate situation and has many difficulties.The major weapons workshops in the Rhine League are now reluctant to provide military equipment to the Principality. Instead, David’s Second Knights, the Knights of the Wolf, plan to expand 3,000 in three months, and the equipment has already been booked.He now accepts directly the orders of his father, the military minister, Marshal Rosio, and my father is also helpless.At present, I am openly expanding the army by using the excuse of going to the Principality of Ron. I don’t think that Louis IX can take me. It’s just that the equipment is a bit problematic, so I can only give it to you.In the next three months, the Knights of the Temple appointed by the church will come to the Principality, and the situation will be much more stable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and said: "The Confederate army is different from the Principality. It has not been in the past few years. Now it is undertrained and the equipment is not refined."Waiting for expansion, training, and preparation for the same, at least one year laterSo we have ample time for expansion.Father’s loyalty in life is never to betray the alliance.But I don’t want to tie my hands, I’m a little strong, I think I’m self-protected.However, if you want to come to the other side, you will not wait. There is a cloud in the art of war. If you encounter a strong enemy, you will cut off its claws and break its wings.As for my claws, oh, it’s up to you, apart from the Golden Lion Knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Orpheek turned over and smiled: "Three months before the arrival of the Knights of the Temple, you have to be careful." The strength strategy is the life-saving foundation, but I may not be able to take care of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people listened, they were silent, but the situation was not allowed, they have been tied to the chariot of the Principality, and then want to get off, Late eveningMoreover, this battle, although the Rhine League now seems to have the upper hand, but the Principality has miraculous protection, but the people's heart is in the direction, behind the powerful support of the church, the Grand Duke is still the three imperial royal orthodox lineage, speak Still winning moreIt’s just that, though, it’s the story of the Bavarian Grand Duke and Orfey Roque. It’s a matter of urgency, how to live in these years’ forces.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habitually sip a coffee, but took a nap, and Orpheco remembered that a pot of coffee had already entered his stomach.He smiled and shook his head, and he was somewhat helpless when his father thought of ‘not old fairy spring’.It seems that the age of the Dagong is already big, and there is no longer a magical strategy for the year.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offik looked at several people one by one and nodded. "You are all very good, and you have a lot of strength."Isn’t Lance? I heard that he seems to be a little worse.As for the Ette, the magical double repair is just a joke! He is now concentrating on martial arts, and magic is not for him.Ok, I said so much.By the way, your Dragon and Beauty Knights can be expanded to 500 people. The Congress will charge you one hundred gold coins per person, and then give you 30,000 gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Orpheek, the cabin fell into an unspeakable silence<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the five scums of the original, Aite, who had a great joy, has already fallen from his own sins, and has stayed at the level of the fifth-level swordsman and the fourth-level master for a long time. UpRens did not grow much. In addition to the increasingly sophisticated internal organs, the real strength has not improved much. Now it is only a thief of about six levels.Only Rogge, Kate, and Franco are hard-working, and they struggle.Kate has the highest level, has been trained to level 10, stepping into the ranks of intermediate knights, and Franco is also up to level 9Although Rogge still has a distance from the Nine-level Master, he has a lot of tricks, equipment and horror, and his mental strength is also refined. The mental impact makes people invincible, plus a ***, it’s true, but he has the strongest combat strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tumultuous downstairs, and the busy day started again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business has slowly returned to normal after the news of the private auction of ‘不老仙泉’ after a month’s secret release of ‘God of the God’sBut a few nobles and lesser people are more busy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Fiss’s safety must be guaranteedNow, day and night, there are always ten ‘Dragon and Beauty’ knights stationed in the small building.As for the small backyard, the organs are heavy, and the underground world of the entire Principality has long been known as the Tomb of the Thieves.Taboo the power of Orphey Roque, the Principality of the Principality of the Principality has long restricted the members from starting with the ‘God of the God of War.’ As for the thieves who come from outside the country, because most of them have limited strength, they go in and die.Really high-level thieves and thieves do not bother to steal these gems and raw materials, and here are some semi-finished equipment, which is not useful for stealing, Fei Si made things, other alchemists are really not easy to copyTherefore, the most valuable, but it is Fiss himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reason a long time ago, a few nobles and evils understoodAt that time, everyone racked their brains and armed Fiss to the teeth.In addition to the standard magic ornaments, the coats of the tailors are specially designed to be filled with a variety of magic scrolls.Just in case, even a lightning bolt was stitched on the panties.Originally, Fei Si was not very eye-catching. These arrangements did not come in handy. Fiss also put one or two reels to fill the number.But nowadays the world is different, everyone is forcing Faith to fill the magic scroll in the dark grid. As for comfort or not, it still manages so much.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military business needs to be established from scratch, and the difficulty is not trivial. The ironmaking workshop in Sellersburg has not yet been completed. It is not a day or two to repair the passageway. It takes at least three months to barely walk the light cargo carriage. However, since there are abundant raw materials, everyone is ready to build the weapons workshop together in Sellesborg. The only thing that needs to be shipped out is the finished sword armor, which is much lighter than iron ore and even steel ingots. At that time, the road was basically repaired, and it was not a problem to ship it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original hundred or more hardships are simply not enough. Rogge has sent Roberts out and bought four hundred strong hardies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food has also become a big problem. The population of the territory of the Sallesburg is sparsely populated, the road is inconvenient, there is not much surplus grain, and there are so many people at once, and it is a big problem for people to eat and chew every day. Rogge rushed to Doyle. As a training course for more than 200 mountain thieves, each person must carry 60 kilograms of various foods to Salleburg. Although it doesn't help much, it solves at least the urgent need. As for the training courses of the thieves, hunting is definitely a big part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of "Dragon and Beauty" is not too much a problem. If the thieves are trained, they should have four hundred people up and down. It will be added slowly in the future. Lens promised to recruit a group of killers, thieves and scouts from the Thieves Guild. Under the gaze of the crowd, he was gambling and vowed that this time he would not have to go wrong. As for the number of those who are still poor, there are so many things in front of them, and there are so many places to care about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a big problem that was evasive soon came to the front, where did the high craftsmen look for? After seeing the Golden Lion Knights and the Knights of the Lions as the standard sword armor, the nobles and evils will come. These equipments are of excellent quality and workmanship, which is not something that ordinary blacksmiths can create at will. In the ‘God of the God of War’, Kim and his dwarf apprentices were competent. How is this good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the master blacksmiths have monopolized the major weapons workshops, and a small number of them also have their own assistants, please do not move, or else the price Too high. The people negotiated to negotiate, only to buy a dwarf slave. But during this period of time, according to the news that Robsky returned from the local slave market, the number of dwarf slaves is small, and a small number is used together. I found it and found nine short craftsmen, just a glass of water. Everyone can't think of other ways at the moment, only hehe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a rush of days, Robsky rushed back and immediately talked to Rogge and others for a night. The next night, Rogge and others swayed to Helen, went straight to the top floor and wrapped a small house. After a while, the door opened, and a thin man with a normal dress came in and sat down on the table. As soon as he waved his hand, the characters behind the bodyguards went to the door and guarded the door tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robersky said: "This is Mr. Cato, the largest slave trader in the northern part of the league. The three of them are my boss, Mr. Kate. Mr. Franco and Mr. Rogge.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several people’s mutual etiquette, the topic quickly turned to the issue of dwarf slaves. Catoton had a rare color in the village around the Alliance. A hundred years ago, the five dwarf kings reached an agreement with the human state to declare the dwarf slave trade illegal. The dwarf slave source has always been a problem, so is it not? You can work around..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger and others look at each other, Kate goes straight into the tunnel: "Adult dwarf craftsman, casting skills are equivalent to human senior blacksmiths, we have a total Need one hundred, each five hundred gold coins, how? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catoden moved, usually such a short craftsman but more than one hundred gold coins, Kate directly doubled the price, how can he not be tempted? He swallowed a sigh of water and sighed a big business. Of course I wanted to do it. In line with the goods you requested, there may not be any inventory in the hands of all slave traders in the Rhine Union. Of course, it is not the nine dwarves you have bought. Not everyone, I am only the manager of this business, I will report it to the boss as soon as possible, the boss should have a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door is pushed open, A bold voice laughed and said: "What good way can I have?" With the voice, a huge body was squeezed in from the door, and Kate and Franco immediately recognized that this person was Jingo, 'Helen' Manager! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kato immediately stood up, and respectfully said: "Boss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo He glanced at him, his smile was not diminished, and the more his eyes were strict: "Oh, you can very much recently, bring the guests to 'Helen'. Come on, first blow off the cowhide for me, if I can't do it, how can I The guest confessed that these VIPs have a very different relationship with me, otherwise, oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jing Ge’s face was the most sincere smile. He squeezed his body into the chair of the widest one. He gasped and said: “The people are not sensible, and they have slowed down a few big bosses. I got the news and came over immediately. Come and come, drink and drink, if my family Steinich knows that I treat a few people like this, I will definitely make my fat meat into oil, hahaha! It’s Mr. Rogge. I met you for the first time. My grandfather mentioned you every day. Now I see it, it’s really young and young.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people are in doubt Ge met, and lowered the voice: "My master will refer to the boss of the 'God of War", especially Mr. Rogge as a confidant, and I will not take a few foreigners. Steinich is rich and enemies, relying on this How can the food business not be profitable? The horse does not eat the night grass and is not fat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three immediately realized that they were deeply convinced, so they mentioned the dwarf again. The problem of slaves comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo is also a bit embarrassed to say that Cato is also true. It is estimated that there will not be too many dwarf slave craftsmen in the last six months. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three thought that he was also taking the opportunity to raise the price, Kate immediately said: "I also know that there are not many short craftsmen. So, let's just say a price, let's see if we can accept it, how? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo stunned and laughed again: "Mr. Kate said that if Stannic knows that I am making money from several people, I have to kill." I can't. The lack of a dwarf craftsman is the truth, but I have to take the opportunity to raise the price. However, according to my latest news, in the Kafka Mountain area in the Principality of Ron, I recently moved into a hilly dwarf tribe, estimated to be around 1,000. You know, although the hill dwarf craftsmanship is not as famous as the alpine dwarves, it is also a very good craftsman. I think it should be able to meet your requirements. It’s just that the dwarf tribe of thousands of people wants to be silent, but it’s a big problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s heart moved and asked: "I don't know where it is?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Rogge must have been informed, hehe. Humans and the dwarf kings have agreed not to arrest the dwarves as slaves. So we must do it secretly, we must not let go of a dwarf! However, this thousand tribes, on the strength of the battle, do not lose to 500 top-ranking knights, if you want to squat, you need more than a thousand top knights. Not afraid of a few laughs, the villain's slave-slave team is only more than 700 people, and most of them are outside, and they can be rushed to return to the use of only about 300 people. Although the villain's skills are good, but it is only equivalent to six hundred knights, and other people can be transferred back in half a year. The gap in the middle of this force is really difficult to replenish. In addition, it is deep in the territory of the Principality of Ron. The surrounding people are densely populated, which is equivalent to the battle of thousands of knights. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco coughs a fruit, we give you the power of these 400 knights, what about?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo has been calculating for a long time before he raises his head: "If this is the case, we can come out after one and a half months, and we can solve this tribe within half a month. When you pick one hundred dwarves first. The rest is mine. Reconnaissance, intelligence, and supply are handed over to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three looked at each other and slowly nodded. In the dwarf tribe, women and children are less than half of the points. The skillful craftsmen of the thousands of tribes have a maximum of 150 people. The rest of the slaves can only be worth the money if they are strong fighters. However, in the slave arrest, these soldiers often have to die in the battle. It is because Jing Ge is so arranged, it is really much cheaper for three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has some doubts and asks: "Jing Ge, you have some losses?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Jingehaha laughed, his eyes piled up in the fat, so the mysterious whispered: "The money is far worse for my family, Master Steinich, than a friend. It doesn't matter." My family’s lord especially looks at Mr. Rogge’s talents, and he wants to give the only daughter to Mr. Rogge!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s mind In the middle of the scene, Steinic’s face and fat body were revealed. He thought of his daughter, and could not help but have a cold, and hurriedly said: I must thank the goodness of Master Stanic. I have a low level of appearance and mediocrity. Miss Stanic’s lady, huh, huh, Jing Ge adults have to resign for me anyway, hehe. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo stared at Rogge for a long time, and looked straight at the little fat man who was restless and regained his gaze. It’s a big deal to get a smile. I don’t know if it’s a few. Willing to cooperate? And how much do you know? As far as I know, your 'Dragon and Beauty' knights are only two hundred knights. Where do the other two hundred knights come from?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
