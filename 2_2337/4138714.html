			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything comes from the beginning and goes back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, the coming will always come!" Rogge gritted his teeth and opened the dark green breastplate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of hills that flashed the demon glow halo out of bondage and stood proudly. If they say that they are not perfect enough, it is not too big, but the soft curve, no one can be any more critical. There are two blushes on the hills, and they grow up quietly in the breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s hand trembled and shook, reaching out to the two blushes. He is afraid that this is a dream, a dream that is too real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is always broken before the hope is reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is a dream, then let me never touch it, never wake up! Rogge secretly prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his trembling fingertips still touched a little blush! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a Mars throwing into a cylinder, Rogge burns all over! He slammed up and kissed her every inch of crystal-clear skin. For a long time, he only slightly suppressed the flames of the body, climbed up, and took a few deep breaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that such a big meal has been used in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly faded her trousers, and he kissed each inch of skin. In this way, she always kissed her toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge held back the vertigo in his head, tearing off her blue pants. Now she has no secrets, and the whole body is completely presented in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a thrilling beauty, he has not found any words to describe, this beauty even slightly removed his evil thoughts. There are only two short poems left in his mind at the moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smile is a city, and then laughs at the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently stroked her face from her toes, and every inch of skin made him crazy! He hesitated, suddenly laughing, just thinking: "It's all precarious, but what are you doing? Is it that the little character has been working for a long time, even the color is also small?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was slightly recovered from his waist, and then forced into it, deeply into her softness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a slight lip, her brows are wrinkled, and it is painful in the coma. But Rogge is not enough, so the eclipse has made him forget everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, this frenzy night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Rogge finally got tired of the extreme, lying weakly next to Andre. He breathed a sigh of relief, only feeling that countless grievances in his chest seemed to have disappeared, that is, the sourness of the whole body was also full of joy. A woman is really a universal medicine for dispelling sorrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned over and smugly looked at his spoils, especially the blush on her legs, which made him happy. He once again stroked her whole body and kissed her little mouth. Rogge suddenly stopped, and he saw the depth of her face deep. I just took care of her body but could not notice it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre’s vindictiveness is due to the fact that Green Dragon’s poison did not quickly kill her, but the poison was little by little. Expand your territory. Maybe one day, maybe a few days, she will die under poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can these beautiful people take a bite and leave? Naturally, we must consider some long-term solutions. Between the thoughts, Rogge had already thought about all kinds of tricks. Even if he failed, Andrei had no grudge after he was seriously injured. He was just devastated by Rogge. His hands and feet must be weak and weak. What is Rogge afraid of her? So the first thing at the moment is to quickly solve her poison, but don't let such a beautiful woman, just follow Trillen Hugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you detoxify, there are naturally two ways of magic and medicine. Magical Masters, especially pure priests, have the best detoxification effect, but the drugs are strange, but in general, holy water is a good antidote. As for Rogge, the necromancer, it will only be poisoned and will not detoxify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly remembered that the tears of angels in his stomach were not the most powerful holy water? Anyway, I didn’t have that thing, just leave a memory for Elysses. Now with her black crystal, the tears of angels can come in handy. He spit out the white jade, opened the lid, and looked at the tears of the angel in the shape of a soft white light. This thing is undoubtedly a big tonic for ordinary people, but for those who are negatively energized by him and Elysses, it is extremely poisonous. What if this thing is useless? Rogge didn't want to think so much anymore. He slapped Andre's little mouth and dripped the tears of the angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears of angels entered her mouth, and they turned into a small group of flames, which quickly ignited her whole body. Under the burning of the Holy Flame, the blue toxin is rapidly dimming until it disappears. A touch of blood returned to her cheek, and after a while, her look was much more peaceful. Her skin is almost transparent, and through it it can be seen that a piece of golden halo flows underneath. She has a small mouth and a small flame from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled, Andre’s blue soul energy is now surrounded by a pale golden flame, and is gradually strengthening, but her While the soul is strong, the blue is slowly getting lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog thought for a moment and carefully helped her wear her clothes back. Her body was so thrilling that Rogge couldn't help but kissed it from head to toe. Unfortunately, he was too tired and could no longer fight. In retrospect, she is the first beautiful woman in Rogge's life? Although the means are not glorious, but after all, it is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are other important things at the moment. He sighed the sore waist and came to the body of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closes his eyes and slowly moves his mental power. A small whirlwind suddenly appeared in his body, and a piece of cloud gas slowly condensed, and was brought up by the cyclone, forming a small group of small black clouds, rotating around Rogge. His right hand slowly grew longer, and a small electric fire began to appear at the fingertips. It seems to echo with it, and the surrounding black clouds are beginning to have flashing lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short while, the dark clouds have become a big cloud, and Rogge is completely wrapped in it. A variety of electric fires have been vented from the clouds from time to time, and the screams of depression are faintly echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound! The cloud suddenly exploded, and it was cleaned up by countless electric fires. Rogge was covered in black air, and a right hand was burning with a silver flame. The flame was getting brighter and brighter. Later, it was impossible to look directly. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted again, jumped up, his right hand in the air** a beautiful silver flame tail, actually pierced the green dragon with a hard scale A, pierced into its neck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The owner's master is really amazing! Even piercing the dragon scales with bare hands! It's too much!" In the shadow of another corner of the cave, Gregory In the extreme strength of Rogge's amazing power, he can't wait to go to the foot of Rogge right now, kneeling on his lap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a demise for a dead dragon. His ability is not to fight. "***It’s cold and cold, and it doesn’t take it for granted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge on the dragon’s body is constantly shaking, as if suffering a great pain. Green dragon body On the other, many already condensed wounds burst open, and a trace of blue blood spurted out to form a group of green fog. The blue blood fog rolled and slowly concentrated together, getting thicker and thicker, and the color was deeper and deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly swayed and opened his eyes. At this time, Rogge was sweating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue blood fog dissipated, and only a thumb-sized blue-black blood crystal floated in front of Rogge. His face was happy, but he did not expect a small piece of blood crystal to be extracted. He did not expect it. This will succeed. After all, the difference between Green Dragon and his strength is really too great. To condense and purify such a huge amount of life energy is really too much of his ability. Originally, this spirit is used to extract the essence of life and refine blood. The crystal method is more useful for the creatures whose strength is not as good as his, and the energy that is condensed It's just a tiny fraction of all energy. But this kind of big supplement is better than nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that makes Rogge puzzle is that he sucks blood After that, his body's various functions are slowly improving, but he does not help his magic and mental strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little green dragon blood from the front In the crystal, Rogge clearly felt the surging energy of life. Although these energies are nothing more than the essence of the whole green dragon, Rogge is very content.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! Roggeton felt like a countless flame storm magic blasted in the body at the same time, he suddenly spurted out of blood, blue black quickly filled his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes are black and he’s going down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master's master!" Gregory screamed, and he rushed over, but suddenly fell to the ground, and was slammed on the ground. Lived in the tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's fine, at least he can't die. Although the dragon's blood is poisonous, he can't save his life. This way of absorbing blood crystals is not good, but the harm is A lot. Let him eat some bitterness, I will go back!" *** is still a cold voice without feelings. Gregory listened to his ear but felt a little unspeakable taste, but since the master ordered it, it did not dare to violate it. Otherwise, what if the owner quietly came here without taking it out? It also followed suit and returned to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave slowly darkened, and the dragon blood splashing on the walls began to glow with a faint blue glow. Everything has become strange and inexplicable. During the flashing fire, countless shadows seem to have life and dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre opened his eyes slightly and saw a world of flickering. She was shocked, squinting her eyes and observing the movement around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not in the Dragon language magic, and then it is sprayed by the dragon, it should be poisoned. Is this the underworld?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a second spring when the whole body suddenly slipped out two meters from the side, but stood upright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she slammed and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no pain in her place on the body, the body is very painful from the waist, especially the pain between the legs, the legs are almost a little effort nor. There was a huge pain in the leg, and she almost got hurt and she shed tears. However, the place where the pain came from made her even more afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre forced the upper body and screamed again. The button on her coat was only buckled on the grass, and the toss was opened several times. A large white chest muscle and a small and straight one are already exposed. Looking at the chest with a scratch, a piece of bruise and countless snare marks, she only felt as if a basin of ice water was slowly pouring from her head, the chill was straight through the bone marrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the ground in front of her, a tear sneaked out of her once clear water, but she did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world began to distort and rotate, and it seems that countless devils are screaming in her ears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short while, she woke up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was like a frost, holding back the pain of her body, slowly stood up and began to look at the entire cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dragon like a hill in the middle of the cave, but it is motionless and seems to be dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a close-up of a male corpse in front of the dragon. It seems that the body shape is familiar. Under the faint blue light, she can also see that his whole body is black and black. It should also be poisoned by the green dragon. It seems that he is with the green dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of flashing blue lights in the corner caught her attention, it was a long sword that beat the blue light, her blue sky sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen steps, she almost moved. Picking up the blue sky, feeling the cold and empty energy from the sword into the body, her mood was settled. She closed her eyes and slowly absorbed the energy on the sword, but today it seems to be how it is. It seems that this sword is far away from her own distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei opened his eyes, as the star's eyes began to flash a faint blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, no matter who insults her, she has a way to marry him under the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trace of starry temperament slowly emerged from all over her body, although still very weak, but far more pure than before, every temperament seems to be It contains a lot of power. This surprised her. It seems that she has cultivated more than ten years of starry spirit and mixed with other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled a little, but now the body is still sore, the lower body still comes from time to time to make her shy and resentful pain, but she has accumulated enough to move a sword Fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre's maroon show is scattered, the cold eyes are full of hate and cold, the blue starry starry sky slanting to the ground, red-like Two feet, silently and swiftly swam in the hall, searching for the one who insulted her innocence. She has a way to rectify this person and will never kill him. There is a lot of ways to slash for ten days. Although she is clean, she must do it by herself, and she will never fake others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she searched the entire hall three times, and there was no second person except the fat man who couldn’t afford it. She has already recognized this person as the Rogge she is tracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long search, Andre stood in front of Rogge. She accidentally showed his chest ups and downs, but he still hasn't died yet! It’s just a black face, obviously the poisoning is deep, it seems that life is long. Although my brother David has been trying to find ways to keep Rogge's life, but with the poison of the green dragon's dragon, she can't do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, she has been disheartened by the affairs of Froya, and she has suddenly encountered a disaster, she has already been so desperate, what mission is great, what? The ambition of the hero who crushed the world under the pressure of the man has already blown away with the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that you’re like a poison in your body, how come you suddenly? This thought flashed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Rogge carefully, and it became more and more suspicious that his nakedness was very suspicious, and that the body seemed familiar. If it weren't for him, there would be no more people in the hole. If there is another person, then this person is not interested in the treasure of the Green Dragon, and there is no reason to leave his own starry sky. This sword has all the features of the artifact, that is, thrown on the ground, its blue flames and little stars everywhere, reminding others that it is not a product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre gnawed his teeth and smothered his shirt, revealing a white, round shoulder. She had a neat row of scallops on her left shoulder. She lifted Roger's head, slapped his mouth and put his shoulders together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tooth print is completely fit, no more than one point, a lot less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was furious, throwing Rogge’s pig's head and standing up, with blue sky and blue flames in her hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow behind her, space began to appear slightly distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A milky white flame ignited in her palms and swiftly spread over the starry sky sword, adding a white line of fire at the center of the blue flame. The blue flame retreats slightly, but it is more condensed, and the starburst does not dissipate, but flies around the blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacred? When did I have a sacred attribute?" Andre snorted. The duality of the vindictiveness is a good thing that can not be met. The power is not just superimposed. The sacred spirit is very common in the church, and its power is not particularly strong. However, it has many useful functions, and it has always been called defensive. To restore the first, with a powerful and insane starry temperament, it is a pair of heavenly creations. However, when the dual attributes are tempered, it is very difficult. Very few people can control the conflict between the two attributes, and it is not necessary to specialize in a kind of vindictiveness. There is a lot of vindictiveness in the sanctuary, so few people are willing to take such a big risk to cultivate double vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperament attribute is often related to the human body. The same kind of cultivation method, the temperament of the cultivation is often different, especially the slogan of the slogan. Just like Kate and his son, the cultivation method is the same, but the old man has become a cold and vindictive, but his son has miraculously become a sacred vindictive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around and saw that Rogge was throwing an open white jade scorpion, and there was still a sacred breath in it. She picked up the jade, sniffed it, and gently slammed it out of her tongue, screaming: "The tears of angels?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre turned to look at Rogge, the mood was complicated, and the blue flame on the long sword was inflated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears of angels are the purest holy water, and those who refine this holy water must have at least the Holy Power that rivals the Great Magister, or reach the Paladin level. The above sacred vindictiveness. In addition, refining people will lose a lot of energy, at least one level will be reduced, and it will not recover for a long time. Among the bright churches of the Hidden Dragon and Crouching Tigers, there are only a few people who enter the sanctuary. Therefore, there have never been three drops in the legend of the tears of angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears of angels have been transmitted to the gods. It seems that as long as there is a drop, mortals can enter the sanctuary. Whether it is to practice magic, or to practice vindictiveness, whoever gets the tears of angels, isn’t it immediately taken down? At least Andrea asked himself would never use it to save someone who is not very relevant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it must be the tears of angels. Otherwise, you can't explain the powerful sacredness that suddenly appears on your body. If it is a few months ago, she will be renewed ambition, even if Orphee is already a paladin, she will have to fight with him again. However, after the war in Lille Castle Square, she had already had this heart. Not to mention the great power of the Pope's unmatched, unavoidable big prophecy to destroy the earth, the strength of both Augustus and Orphey is far beyond her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she and Froya first arrived in Lille, if Orphey took out real strength, she was afraid that even the golden lion could not get a shot. . It was the change of the Star Sword Pross, and I am afraid it will not escape the fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge’s black face, she sighed. Although he insulted himself, he also gave the tears of angels to himself, but he himself was poisoned by the dragon's breath, and there was no cure. Now, you don't have to do it yourself, and it will not be long before he will be poisoned. How much is your own hatred? It’s just that she really can’t understand, why is the despicable fat man who has always been greedy for money, why did he give the angel’s tears the priceless thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence in the hall, only the flames on the stars of the blue sky are silently beating, reflecting the cold and charming face of Andre’s face flickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! The blue sky fell on the ground, Andrei fell to the ground, his hands covered his face and sobbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria! I am sorry for you...this way...how can I see you? You must be too dirty for me..." Andre cried The more heartbroken. If it is said that it is difficult to see each other again in the same day, now is a goodbye. She does not know how to face her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no movement at her side. Rogge suddenly snorted, and a black spurt in his mouth and nose, a stench of scent. Andrei was very clean and screamed and jumped a few meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man screamed and sat up, although still full of black hair, but it is alive and kicking, like a poisoned person who will die? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trillion Hugh! You are not killed by Lao Tzu, where am I?" The fat man who just woke up was still a little faint. Heavy. But the blue sky staring at the throat immediately made him wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is the fascinating face, the white teeth like the shell is biting the lower lip, a pair of bright eyes like the morning star like a smile Holding him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is Rogge? How can she be deceived by her embarrassed expression, even though Andrei changed to the female body, more and more showing the beauty of the city, it seems that even Froya will be compared to her. Andre's thick eyebrows, stars, straight noses and tough lines are all very British. Everything is perfect, but when they get together, it makes people feel too beautiful at first sight. Unbeatable charm, three-pointed charm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge doesn't know why he has this impression. But the more beautiful, the more dangerous, Rogge constantly reminds himself. From the fascination of Andre, he has already felt a strong murder. He was shocked and knew that she must have known the good things she did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grand Rogge, can you tell me what you did just now?" Andrei changed the hardness of the past and the voice suddenly became Extremely feminine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stared at Andre’s eyes and couldn’t help. It is a success or failure. In this case, it is half-hearted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei bit his lower lip, his hand could not shake, and the tip of the sword trembled. Rogge has no fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides that... that thing! What have you done! Say it, or I will kill you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s face is dull and faint: “When I came in, I saw you being knocked down by the green dragon. I’ve been fighting it. I didn’t expect it to be quite powerful. After it knocked down the green dragon, I checked your injury and it is now... I am a man, and some things are born naturally. Well, I have finished, let's do it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre stared at Rogge and said slowly: "Nothing else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a trick in her hand, and the white jade on the ground flew into her hand. She put the jade in front of Rogge and said coldly: "Is this something yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tears of angels? This natural...something doesn't know Whose, it has nothing to do with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not afraid that I killed you?" Andre’s beautiful eyes smashed, and the stars on the tip of the sword The flame lit up and gently licked Rogge's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course afraid! Roghaha laughed. "Don't you come to chase me?" Do you want to hear my mercy before death? I want to think about it too! It’s ok to kill. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge holds his hand on his chest and closes his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre's face The weather is uncertain, and the blue sky is also trembling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very strange that she remembered that Froya had stood in front of herself like this. She closed her eyes to death. She did not understand why she would associate Fu Liya, who was as beautiful as Lilian, with the fat and despicable fat man in front of her. But when she thought of Fu Luoya, she was sad in her heart.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre squats and sits on the ground, covering his face and crying. She can't remember how many years have not been so helpless as she is now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rog opened his eyes and sighed quietly, and the silver in his eyes faded. The biggest pass finally passed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he does not close his eyes, I am afraid that Andrei will now be the silver light in his eyes when he is working hard. If Andrea is really murderous, his mental impact is just a move. This initial level of shock It’s not very powerful, but it’s no problem to interfere with her instantly. At that time, Rogge turned his face again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is naturally dangerous, but Andre The appearance, body, and ability of the world are rare. For these peerless people, what is the risk?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre is crying more sad, Rogge silent She patted her back, but saw her body stiff, and then there was a clear sputum at the back of her neck. She slammed Rogue’s hand like a lightning bolt.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half, Andrea cried, and looked up, saw Rogge standing in front of him, suddenly his face was flushed, angry: shame!..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge, this is almost completely complete. He laughed and laughed. He also reached out and made a move. His robes flew to his own hands. He draped the robes and tied the belt. He looked down at himself, and the chest on the outside was actually two bodybuilding muscles. He snorted and took a deep breath, so the chest muscles disappeared, the belly slowly swelled, and he turned back to the chubby fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre’s eyes widened and he looked at the incredible changes in his eyes and couldn’t speak. This is not an illusion, she also does not feel the slightest vindictive fluctuations. If you can really change the body shape, it seems that only some Warcraft can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock is very soon. She stood up, and the stars fell back to the sheath. For a moment, she suddenly felt so stunned, did not know what to do, and did not know where to go. Although the world is big, there is no place where she can go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she looked up at Rogge, but saw Rogge staring at herself. She looked down and saw that her coat was still open and the spring was shining. Her face was red, and she turned around and tied the button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
