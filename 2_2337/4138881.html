			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Three Thousand Elf Warriors played the banner of Rogge, three thousand elves are equivalent to three thousand gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temptation of great interests is enough to make people crazy, so that they can't see the sharpness of the swords in the hands of the elves. As for Rogge's banner, in all fairness, there are more objects in the empire that are spurned, and there is really no shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the elves walking on the empire's land are like a blood flower floating in the sea. The sweet taste attracts a group of greedy and bloodthirsty sharks. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than two days, there were nearly a hundred teams of unconcerned guys who slammed the team. Among them are adventurers, bounty hunters, passers-by, and even servants of the brigade. Of course, they dare not expect to be able to capture the whole team's elves, but they can still get a few sentinels when the black wind is high. For these people, this kind of harvest can be regarded as a windfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this situation, the governor of the province, Dolly Duke, naturally would not sit idly by, and he immediately said that he would send troops to escort along the way. However, the imperial bureaucracy system was inefficient, and when Dolly’s troops were transferred, Rogge had already crossed his line. On the other hand, the fighting power of the Doliya troops is far less than the elf warrior of Rogge. When is it, who protects who? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after the boss’s warning, Sarah Wenger, Roger was a little more wary of this seemingly mediocre Duke of Doliya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Rogge is not the only magician who has just led the elves to step out of the Central Mountains. His current power is to look at the entire Astrophy empire, and it is also a small group of people who can say a few words about the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that year, he had to bear with many things in order to keep most of the elves at hand. But now, he is no longer an unnamed fat man who can be bullied by anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these people behind him, Rogge has already made a decision. Only blood can polish the eyes blinded by greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the province, the hunters behind the elves were still watching, but on the third night, finally the hunters couldn’t help but start. . Only this time, they are really wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On personal strength, small group combat coordination, well-equipped, and even night battle standards, hunters must be stronger than ordinary elf warriors. The hordes of hunters are ready to take the wolf tactics to follow the elves, ready to pounce on and bite. However, they did not know that these elves were still hiding characters like Androni and Hughes, and Rogge himself was not only climbing back and conspiring to climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third night, the sky is yin. Br < 、 、 、 、 、 、 、 、 The head wolves started their first large-scale hunting operation on this moonless night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold night wind slowly diffuses more and more bloody suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early morning, the elves did not happen as if they had ever happened. There is only one elf of nearly a hundred people. Every few tens of meters, a sharpened wooden stake is placed on both sides of the road, and then an adventurer captured by the elf is put on the stake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf goes farther and farther, and one pile after another stands on both sides of the road. Many of the adventurers who were born and worn on the stakes had not yet died, and their limbs occasionally twitched weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of blood-stained stakes make the path that the elves have stepped into a blood-stained road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the hunters behind the elves were extremely shocked, it was discovered that the companions hidden in the lush jungle had lost a lot. But how can a kind, elegant and holy elf become so bloodthirsty? At least, when more than a hundred elf warriors nailed the undead adventurers to the stakes, they were skillful and calm, and they could not see the slightest pity. At this time, only a few adventurers were willing to read through the memories. They finally remembered that they had seen these horrible cold blood in the Principality of Are. The elf has also heard of the name of this elf army, the dark side of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stifling and screams sounded from the forest around the elf camp. Those who are still plagued by greed and fail to be alert from the bloody blood of the day, so that the hunters who are behind the elves have quietly changed from hunters to prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the elves started as usual, but there were hundreds of bloody wooden stakes on both sides of the avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one of the stakes, there is a young man who looks very strong. His vitality was very tenacious, and although the sharpened stake penetrated the abdomen, he struggled in vain and tried to get his body off the stake. Obviously, every move will give him extreme pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bow in the forest, and a sharp arrow pierced the back of the young man, ending his pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the arrow has just flown out of the forest, and the elf shooter of the dark side of the month has taken off the magic longbow with lightning and a lightning bolt back. Shoot in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint sound of falling into the ground in the forest, and a scream of screaming, which sounded like a young woman. Just don't know who she is, who is a lover, a sister, or a life-and-death partner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this necessary?" Androni asked in disapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!" Rogge walked leisurely through the forest and replied: "I have given enough warnings, but they still dare to follow Behind us. Anne, the light of the gold coins is too dazzling, only enough blood can make them awake, there is no kindness and affection in this place. I just want everyone to see, just dare to fight The people of my mind, regardless of men, women, and children, must be killed by all means! Only in this way can they think more about it when they are gambling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Androni sighed and said: "Don't you always want the elf to enter the human state? Now, will this practice only increase the hatred between the elves and humans?"<br />< 『 br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "These adventurers like the ghosts and ghosts have no power and no power in the empire, and they kill." Political structure, whether the elf can be integrated into human society, the key is only a few real powers in the empire As long as my position in the empire does not fall, at least I can keep follow these elves "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Andrew Luoni did not say anything, but secretly sigh. Clever as Androni, naturally understand the meaning of Rogge did not say. The fat man wants to have a symbiotic relationship with the elf. The spirit and beauty of the elves, the ability to create all kinds of fine equipment, and even the artistic accomplishments constitute a very important pillar for Rogge to build his own power. When Rogge’s power is consolidated, he can provide enough protection for the elves. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the fat man does not fall, killing some greedy adventurers is not a big deal at all. If one day the fat man falls down, then it is difficult for him to protect himself. Can he still manage whether the elf can be integrated into the human state? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still a famous saying, even after I die, even if it’s a flood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth night is a quiet night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the capital of the province, Clermonton, Rogge finally merged with the army led by the Bauhinia butterfly. According to the plan, the army should get enough supplies in Clemence and then march to the southeast border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Clemence, Rogge once again met the Duke of Dolyak. For Rogge, who is currently hot in the empire, Dolly's hospitality is extremely luxurious, but it is a pity that Rogge is currently in a special situation and can only be grateful for many wonderful feast programs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army’s supply was going very smoothly, and Rogge’s expected martyrdom did not appear. On the contrary, Dolly took the initiative to mobilize all the necessary military supplies for Rogge. Of course, some delays are indispensable, but that is because the provincial bureaucrats are inefficient, and the Duke of Doliya deliberately stalks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Rogge was able to work with Dolly so happy, and I don’t know if it was the blushing road left by Rogge in the past few days. reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Clemson, and after a night of intense marching, Rogge finally arrived at his own residence before the deadline, Sheld City . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Rogge is facing is this long and endless red earth wasteland! And two countries located 100 kilometers away from the other side of the wilderness. The terrain that Pompey needs to overcome is much more complicated, with mountains, hills, jungles and swamps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barren property, complex terrain, and vast space make the southeastern border of the empire a natural land of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of Rogge’s army was already in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling wind swept up the red earth that covered the sky, and the sun drooping in the air became dim. Slowly, the city of Schild, which exudes murderousness, emerged from the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentinel of the city of Sead has discovered this slow-moving army. After a short time, a small team of knights ran out of the gate and greeted the army of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger! I am the Meridian of the Chaoshan Legion Intelligence Major, you can call me Mei. From now on, I will be your adjutant. The current commander of the city, the commander of the Fourth Corps of the Chaoshan Army, General Wallace, sent me to meet you. All the senior officers have already waited at the headquarters. Please come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked closely at Meredith who came to meet. She is very tall, almost equal to Androni, and looks pretty young, but her face is as cold as frost, and her voice is sweet, but it is very cold and very uncomfortable. Perhaps because of the intelligence officer, she did not wear armor, just wearing a tailored military uniform, showing the murderous ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Imperial Courtesy, General Wallace, the head of the Fourth Corps, should lead all the senior generals out of the city to meet Rogge, but they only sent a major level. The young female officer led ten soldiers to come and greet! Although Mei is very beautiful, the ten soldiers are tall and handsome ceremonial soldiers rather than ordinary knights, but it is clear that the ‘tidal’ regiment is to give Rogge’s new chief a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the proud guys who want to command the Chaoshan Legion are not easy, especially the fat ones who bear the name of betrayal and erotic people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the Bauhinia butterfly standing behind Roger saw Meredes, there was no abnormality on the surface, but the heartbeat was slightly accelerated. How sensitive is the fat man? He immediately sensed the slightness of the heartbeat of the Bauhinia butterfly. In the heart of Rogge’s heart, he knew that this young female officer was certainly not as simple as a junior adjutant, but on the surface, he was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in the calming effort, the gap between Rogge and Bauhinia butterflies immediately appeared. The fat body is all over the body, and the temperature, blood flow and heartbeat are as usual, and there is no change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately ordered the army to camp on the spot, and then he only took a hundred guards, along with Meredith to the city of Sild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semi-military city of Sidde is located on the edge of the red earth wilderness and is the largest city within a few hundred miles. It is the strongest defensive fortress and the center of hoarding all kinds of war preparations. Around the city of Sild, several small military forts were built to serve as wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the moment he stepped into the city of Sirde, Rogge had a little understanding of the empire named Frederick who had never met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the imperial language, the meaning of Sirde is the shield of steel. The city's defense is extremely strong and can be described as true. The walls of the Sead Wall are thick and thick, almost all of them are made of megaliths. The architectural planning in the city is different from that of ordinary cities. It can be clearly seen that the planning of the block and the construction of important intersections have been specially designed for the street fighting. If a sufficient number of magicians are deployed, then the city will be a nightmare for any siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city was originally built by the Delaware Empire. The original purpose was to defend the nomadic tribes, orcs, and various fierce battles established on the northwestern border. After continuous reinforcement and expansion, it has gradually become the present. Later, with the rapid expansion of the Astrofic Empire's territory, the city of Side became a rock to resist the army of the Empire. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years ago, Frederick led the tide to attack the Delaware Empire, and the city of Sirde, known as the stone barrier, went down in battle, and the city’s 30,000 guards The troops were all shackled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the last brilliant victory for Frederick on the Southeast Front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
