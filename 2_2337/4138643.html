			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first eye after the snow. The entire city of Rhineland is covered in silver. The sun's rays of ice through the treetops reflect the colorful colors, and all the dirty and ugly in the city seems to have been cleaned up. The winter in Rhineland came a little earlier this year, and the nobility and the rich are just as happy. It’s time for Mrs. Gui and the ladies to show off the new winter dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southwestern part of Sauron is a slum in the city. It is a forgotten corner. People from all kinds of lower occupations are concentrated here. It is also a criminal. heaven. Winter is not a good thing for people here, dilapidated houses need to be repaired, and winter clothing fuel needs to be prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the Sauron area, Rogge is standing in front of an old two-story building, looking at his new nest with satisfaction. The location of the small building is excellent, of course, this is only for a few people, such as Rogge. Not far from the small building is a small cemetery, surrounded by tall tall oak trees. Even on a sunny day, it seems a bit gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his door in a pleasant mood. The small building seems to have been idle for some days, and not many furniture is covered with dust and cobwebs. Half of the blinds are not very easy to use, and a wooden staircase leads to the second floor. There are three rooms on the second floor, one big and two small, big, Rogge is going to use it as a study for himself. As for the two small ones, one for the storage room and one for the laboratory. God knows what Rogge can experiment with, at least for now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its unique location, this small building only spent 50 gold coins of Rogge, just a week ago, this is still a year of living expenses and tuition for Rogge. . But now there is gold coins in Rogge's pocket. The staff that was grabbed from the mercenary magistrate a week ago is of good quality. The above-mentioned sapphire grade is good, and it is not helpful for the mage who loves the water system. Because Rogge's record is brilliant, one person has settled the other two warriors and a magician. Rens and others have no doubt that the staff should be owned by Rogge. After Roger spent a few days summing up the battle of the day, he thought that this thing had little meaning for himself, and he sold the magic wand with gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog has never taken so much money, the Viscounts of the Old Rivers have a year of various tax revenues, but naturally there will not be much surplus for the son. . What's more, the aristocrats are also aristocrats. The necessary social arrangements are still to be told. The heavy economic pressure makes the old Rivers temper increasingly fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the interior was laid out, it was a week later, and the new furniture cost Rogge 20 gold coins. Now Rogge is satisfied with lying on the bed in his study room (in his taste, he doesn't feel that there is a bed in the study room), and there are gold coins around him. God knows how much a son of a fallen nobleman has a gold coin. . After countless times, Rogge finally got tired and slept, and slept on the next day. "Ah!" Rogge, who had stretched out a huge stretch, jumped up from the bed and fell to the ground with several gold coins. This sound is really sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep to sleep naturally, count the money to hand cramps. This is the happy life of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next month, Rogge will return to his nest from time to time, and add a lot of traps and institutions. Rens and others have been to Rogge's new nest. Several people have also made a lot of ideas. Naturally, they are mostly spoofs. However, there are occasional unexpected ideas. Of course, the power of these rookies is limited, but there are some merits in sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this period, Rogge learned a new spell, flame fingers. * A small flame ejected from your finger to kill the enemy, but this second-level spell is also very limited in its natural power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the current mental strength can also be used as a horse, Rogge has begun to practice hard with a bloody experience. But in addition to the bitten fat that was thrown out, there has been no success since January. Rogge finally understood that the fat man was not a bite to eat, the blood faded, and they began to look for Etter and they began to fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog almost forgot that he still has a flaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to do something good, you must first sharpen it. This point is that Rogge still understands. The scars left by the "Old Oak" World War I also made it clear that Ett and others used the pain of skin to understand this truth. Several people invariably purchase high-quality equipment, and naturally include something that is not so keen and aristocratic. Rogge bought a delicate elf arm, one can hold three arrows at a time, with a simple spell attached to increase the magic penetration. "This is much easier to use than the dish." Rogge said shamelessly to Et, Etter shared the same feeling and suggested that the anesthetic should be added to the arrow and immediately adopted by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
