			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early summer, the once cold and desolate Northland is now full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the best season in the North. The pale blue sky is quiet and high, and a few faint clouds float in disappointment. If you look at it, it is faintly visible that several raptors are hovering in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide avenues are lined with dense forests, and the towering old trees have been removed from the winter coats of the ink, and replaced with a new green dress. There will always be a large flying bird in the forest. The birds of the Northland are large and colorful, which is quite different from the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road is already in the empire, leading to the province of the Duke of Duliak, and then heading north, extending to the capital of Richelieu. From the vast jungle of such a vast road, the cost of human and financial resources will never be a small amount. From this path alone, you can see the ambition of the Astrafik Empire against the Holy Alliance. It was only Feuerbach that first fell into the mud of the dwarf empire, and lost a lot of the most elite warriors in the abyss world. Afterwards, he attacked the dark forest and encountered many disobedience, so his eyes never had a chance to bet. Come to the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, the wide road surface has long been stepped on by the horse's iron hoof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hoof sounds awakened the forest in the warm sunshine. At the end of the road, there were more than a hundred horses riding on the dark blue armor. These knights guarded more than a dozen carriages in the middle of the team and were rushing along the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage in the middle of the team is very eye-catching. Every detail on the carriage is exquisite and exquisite, and the strange beasts of the four-carriage are also eye-catching. There are two knights on both sides of the carriage. From the figure of the figure, it is obviously four female knights. The magical long bow of their back and the gorgeous, complex and delicate style of the armor all show the qualities of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is not flat. At this level, the rest of the team was violently bumping, and only the carriage guarded by the elves was as smooth as a canoe floating on a tranquil lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage is large and comfortable, although it is five people, it is still not crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the carriages are sitting on dozens of magicians of the Ice and Snow Masters. This journey is a bit too hard for these weak wizards. When camping in the evening, these magicians must have been exhausted by the bumps of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Pompei’s Poseidon Corps has been left far behind, and the Duke of Dolyak led his army to the newly occupied territory. You can't go to the Imperial Capital with Pompey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Sweatshirt with wide robes, easily rest on the seat back. On his left hand is Fu Luoya, the right side is sitting on the wind butterfly, it is a scene that envy the world man. Opposite Rogge, sitting on the dough dough, and the angry Pompey and the great magician Rockefeller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria and the wind butterfly are generally beautiful, just an elf eccentric, a quiet and elegant. Their color may be able to attract the attention of most men, but the three people in the carriage are not among them. Pompey looked at the scenery flying over the window, but Rogge knew that his sharp eyes had already taken all the details in the carriage. Rockefeller couldn't help but look at Froja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin replied in the past unceremoniously, a pair of green eyes staring at Rockefeller's gray eyes, not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller suddenly smiled and said: "This lady should be a disciple of Master Yero, His Royal Highness Princess Flora of the former Rhine League?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin was shocked and arrogant, and he said: How do you know? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller laughed: "The big magisters are scattered throughout the big 6, but the distance between them is much closer than it seems on the surface." It is no secret that Master Jero receives you as a disciple. It is not a secret that the artifact is lost in his hands. I just sensed the existence of Paradise Lost in you, so it is not difficult to guess that you are Princess Furoya. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin eyes turn around, Rockefeller master and teacher relationship is very good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Froya’s face was reddish. Of course she knew the teacher’s hobby. Jero’s visit to the temple of the silver sacred church was not a good thing. Just don't know if there is a lot of magic equipment on her body, will there be a harvest of Yello. But she immediately remembered that Jero had already died, and that his country had become a term in the history books, and he could not help but look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller also remembered this and could not help but apologize. At this time, Pompey regained his gaze from the window and smiled. "I have been in the army for more than 20 years. Today is the most relaxing and comfortable road." Once again, this carriage of Rogge is really a good thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "If Pompeii likes it, take it. Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei shook his head and said: "We are still military, but it is better to stay away from these comfortable things. Not to mention the value of this carriage of Rogge is amazing. I can't afford such a valuable gift. I still have time, let me briefly talk about the situation of the empire, and Rogge is also prepared. The situation in the empire is very complicated. The Emperor is very good at martial arts. In the past years, the empire has opened up a large territory. It is in the court, the emperor is also the same brave. At present, the emperor has a total of fifty princes and forty-six princesses. Rogge is a wise man, of course, understand this political situation of the imperial What it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge clicked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The executive power of the empire is basically in the hands of the prime minister, Straw. In addition, more than a dozen Grand Dukes who guard the border are also holding power. Of course, it won't take long for you and Layton's Kerry Prince to become important figures in the empire's political arena. In terms of military power, power has always been concentrated in the hands of the great emperor. In the military, he led the 'Ice River' legion. Alexander, who led the 'tidal' legion, and I am a person who can say something. As for religion, Rogge should be aware that the silver sacred church and the city of the clouds are currently fighting. In this regard, please Rockefeller The master said something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller said: "The roger is not an outsider, I am blunt. The history of the silver sacred religion is longer than the empire. Under the guidance of the goddess of ice and snow, we have gone through a hundred years of struggle to expel the power of the Church of Light from the Asrofic Empire. But now our situation is very bad, and the city of the Clouds has fully gained the upper hand. Druid is also Rogge The enemy of man, because I candidly ask the adults of Rogge to help and fight against the city of the clouds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "If there is no sacred religion With the help of Master Pompeii, I will not be able to achieve today's status. However, what do you think is the main reason why the silver sacred religion is currently at a disadvantage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller is calm and honest: "There have been few talents in silver in recent decades. Now our magicians are far from the city of clouds and clouds, and my blizzard magic is not. It is suitable for a showdown between magicians, that is to say, if it is a magical battle, I am afraid that I am not the opponent of the sky wrath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei continued: "The Imperial Prime Minister Both Straw and Frederick of the 'Tidal' regiment fell to the side of the city of Yunxiao. They wanted to put the thirteen emperors on the throne of the Crown Prince, and we have always supported the great emperor. Now the situation of the empire is getting more and more I’m nervous. In recent months, we’ve been with the city of clouds After several battles in private, each has death and injury. But although we are at a disadvantage, we can still maintain the balance of the situation. If Rogge is willing to help us, the situation will be completely different. The strong will be the decisive force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sinks and asks Rockefeller: "Master, I want to ask the silver saints for other gods." What is your attitude?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller said: "My faith belongs to the goddess of ice. But my magic revealed to me the existence of other gods. We are not a unified religion, not arrogant and stupid to deny the existence of other gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately said: "This is good." The two adults must have heard of the wisdom of the Holy Alliance. This church has a good relationship with me. If they spread the doctrine and show the public in the empire in the future, do not know if they can get the support of two adults and the silver saints? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller nodded: "Since it is related to Rogge, there is no problem." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed: "In the future, in the empire, you have to bring more than two adults!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge laughed and said: "Pang Pei’s adult has won the prize. It is not a year or two that if I want to gain trust in this empire. If there is no Master Pompeii and Master Rockefeller, then my life will be difficult in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is something that Rogge does not have to worry about." Rockefeller said: "Our Astrafik Empire has always paid attention to its promises, and it has merits and rewards. Penalties, and special emphasis on military power, are not the same as those insidious and shameless southerners. You have made great contributions to the empire, and the things that the Great promises to give you will be fully fulfilled."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slap in the middle of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria sat quietly, listening to the men’s conversations, trying to dress up as a lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly looks out of the window and turns a deaf ear to the words in the carriage. She is truly elegant and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey suddenly shot a thigh and almost forgot to remind Rogge adults. At present, there are 22 unmarried princesses in the empire, and eleven in the age of fourteen. If I remember correctly, then these princesses are beautiful and docile, and there are... so outstanding. In the case of your wedding of the princess, the city of Yunxiao will surely leave many difficulties. But in any case, you have to come back to a princess and get the prince's prince. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference between Rogge's slight glimpses?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are very big "Pang Peidao," the most important point is that the prince of the king of the country can have a private army of only 150,000, and can be levied outside. The Grand Duke can not have more than 50,000 private soldiers, Doria. The 100,000-strong army of the Duke is the privilege of the great emperor. If there is no prince's lord, your current 100,000 army may be disbanded at once. In addition, the empire is very loose on the prince's inheritance and criminal forgiveness. In short, You can't get this prince. You don't dare to move your mind in the Ming Dynasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei added: "In the empire The woman has no status, and there are many emperors, and there is no special favor. The status and wealth of the princesses and their mothers are often determined by the quality of the princess's marriage. This is very beneficial to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; Rogge is silent, he does not believe that the Empire will fully trust himself. In the Asrofik Empire, which advocates the use of force, elite warriors and numerous powerful people are power, that is, status, which is the guarantee of security. In any case, Pompey’s reminder is indeed very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Froya’s smile is full of profit, but there is a silver pin in the seam, and he gives Rogge a few times in the dark. The goblin knows that Rogge is thick and thick, not to mention nails. It is a slightly blunt knife that doesn't necessarily break his skin. However, Rogge's skin is tough and can't resist the sharp tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that Pompey and Rockefeller value themselves, mainly because they have many high-powered people. For example, the wind butterfly and Fu Luoya in the compartment can be called masters of martial arts and magic. However, they do not know the existence of the two sacred strongs of the Death Class and the ***, and they do not know the figure of Sius who has no sorrow. These ace fat people are not going to be revealed. The people in the carriage are the temporary interests and mutual use. If one day the city of the city falls, it is difficult to ensure that Pompey and Rockefeller will not target Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he and Pompey will, the Death Class and Hughes left the team and changed to secretly follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a Poseidon Knight came to the carriage and handed a small silver cylinder to Rockefeller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller took a small piece of paper from the cylinder and looked at it carefully. The more he looks, the more nervous and excited his look is. He then handed over the secret letter to Pompey, and Pompey looked at it with mixed feelings. Subsequently, the secret letter arrived in the hands of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret letter is simple and concise, the content is mainly an adventurer group inadvertently in the vicinity of the Holy Alliance, a place in the Amorro Temple, according to They said that they sealed the body of the demon Amoro and a powerful frost. This adventurer team was unable to explore the temple, so they were ready to sell the high price of information to the silver saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a normal business. But the problem is that the Druids also know the news and are willing to pay a higher price. Apparently Druid is very aware of the importance of the frosty sacred to the silver sacred, so he never wants it to fall into Rockefeller's hands. The leader of the silver sacred church in the local church is very capable. He sees that the adventurers want to repent, and immediately use force to arrest them all. However, the power of the local city of Yunxiao took the upper hand, so the person in charge did not dare to send these adventurers to the Great Shrine of the Silver Religion, but chose to use torture to try to ask the Temple of Amoro. Location. It’s just that these adventurers are very smart and know that Druid will come to save them at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amorro Temple... Frosty... Is there any secret in this?" Rogge read the secret letter and asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller sighed: "The legendary frost is attached to the goddess of the goddess of ice and snow. This is undoubtedly powerful, but this is not the silver saints who value it. The reason for this is that it will be of great help to the magical exhibition of the Holy Spirit by the study of the goddess of the goddess of ice and snow. It is true that the goddess of ice and snow has not shown miracles for decades. It is the fundamental silver religion of the decline of the silver saints that defeated the glorious era of the bright church. The saints once owned three great magisters. I really miss it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;It is only the beginning of this battle, the casualties will be the sum of the conflicts between the two sides, and it is likely to become the beginning of a comprehensive war between the Sun and the Cloud City. For the silver saints who are at a disadvantage, this determination is very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Rockefeller, what do you think?" Pompey said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller did not hesitate: "This is a frosty, I am determined to win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei nodded and said: "In Montreal... It’s not too far away from us. The city of Yunxiao should not expect us to leave the Haishen Corps and rush to the Imperial Capital so quickly. Well, we will use this to give Druid a lesson! If we don’t support a small number of people, we should be able to get to Montreal in one day. I don’t remember the city around Montreal. Members of the Presbyterian group exist..." He looked at Rockefeller inquiringly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller nodded: "There are no Druid elders around Montreal. As long as we support only 30 people, I have a way to send people quietly. Go to the cathedral in Montreal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei nodded and looked at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said, "Do you want me to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and Rockefeller Master You can't come out directly, and the harmony on the surface of the city of Yunxiao is still needed. You don't want to show your identity. Just now Master Rockefeller said that in order to fight Druid, I can't go too far. Can send a few of the most elite people in the past. My 20 'warm whales' warriors are temporarily under the command of Rogge adults. Master, can your magician send a few?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller Road: "There are four magicians in the Ice and Snow Masters level 13 and above, all of whom can be dispatched."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's faint smile is enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei said again: "Master Rogge, your elf guards are too obvious, or don't take them." I have a few years of magic scrolls in my hand, you bring them, just in case. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this battle is to fight..." Rogge said: "I am afraid that the death and injury are too small." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei smiled and said: "Admiral Rogge can handle Montreal affairs at his discretion, and everyone there will act according to your orders." In fact, as long as things are done clean, no matter how big the conflict is, we can push them all afterwards. Another point is to know that the Emperor is the most decisive person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people quickly agreed on the details of the action and the response, then Pompey and Rockefeller left Rogge's carriage and replaced it with three women, one man and four magicians. Twenty murderous 'anti-whales' guards each took four horses and listened to Rogge's orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, in the thunderous hooves, Rogge and the carriage and twenty knights galloped away, and disappeared at the end of the boulevard in a blink of an eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four high-level magicians of the Ice and Snow Masters have suffered in the journey just now, and now they are on the carriage of Rogge, just like a paradise.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man leaned comfortably on the back of the chair and carefully calculated the action. For him, it was possible to fight Druid with Pompey and Rockefeller. It’s a good thing. Of course, the city of Yunxiao can’t count on the death class, and the old fox is not expected to move. But since the elder Druid does not appear, that is to say, Rogge will not encounter Druids above the fifteenth level, what is he afraid of?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The three female magicians of the Ice and Mercenary Corps are some older, but under the magic effect, they still look very young. They looked at Fu Luoya and Feng Die's eyes full of embarrassment, and when they saw Rogge, they were faintly disdainful. The middle-aged male magician was very nervous and looked helpless, occasionally looking at Fu Luoya and Feng Die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunrise Sunset, followed by the night before dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an unremarkable three-story house in Montreal, a pair of sharp eyes are staring at a group of buildings in the darkness. There is the church of the silver sacred church. From the scale and gorgeous style of the architectural complex, the glory of the silver saints can still be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Dawn Eagle’ Matteo is already famous in the world of Druid. He is tall and has a brown leather dress that shows fortitude and determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Matteo is already a 13th-level Druid, he still feels a little nervous now. In a few moments, when the first rays of dawn dawn on Montreal, there will be two hundred soldiers and a dozen Druids who led him under the leadership of the Church of the Silver Religion, and will be imprisoned in it. The adventurer was rescued. If it is not a sudden event, such a major action should at least be commanded by the elders, and no one will turn to Matteo’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the members of the silver sacred churches in several nearby cities are concentrated, the strength is far from Matteo’s opponent, so this is a winning action. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo couldn’t help but thank the natural goddess for his favor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky has gradually brightened, and Matteo once again recalled the portraits and related descriptions of several adventurers, followed by three sharp A long eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of birds singing one after another, resounding in the air in Monterey. A sturdy figure jumped out of hiding and rushed to the church of the silver sacred church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When...when...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell of the Church of the Silver Religion rang. Matteo smiled a little, he knew that this was a signal of warning, but this time, he did not come to attack, but to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, the figure behind the iron gate of the church courtyard flashed. Matteo mourned a spell, his hands waved outwards, the green light flashed, and a large thorn flew over the sky, not only smashing several guards behind the iron gate. The huge impact even caused the entire iron gate to fall down slowly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar, two heavy iron gates slammed into the yard and flew in the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo stepped into the courtyard of the Silver Religious Church with a steady and determined pace. Behind him, followed dozens of fighters and several Druids. Although he is confident that the strength of these people is enough to sweep the church into the ground, their goal is only to attract the enemy's main force, the real attack lies in the side of the package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this is a winning battle, Matteo does not want to have too much casualties. This will affect the elders' evaluation of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main building of the church dozens of meters away suddenly became illuminating, and the door opened, and dozens of people poured out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of expressionless, murderous warriors in the crowd, seeing Matteo sinking in his heart. Although the strength of the silver sacred religion is much stronger than expected, it is clear that its pretending to be a light enemy has successfully attracted the attention of the other party. Matteo still has the confidence to win. In the face of a strong enemy, the proud heart of 'Dawn Eagle' began to pulsate strongly!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha!" suddenly appeared in the crowd opposite The arrogant laughter, then a fat man with a gorgeous dress and a crazy attitude squeezed out of the warrior group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man pointed to Matteo and arrogantly said: "You are not yet open Druid, actually dare to provoke the silver saint! Laozi I have already expected that you are going to attack, and you have already laid out the nets. If you are smart, then surrender quickly, and Lao Tzu can guarantee you a good place in the silver sacred religion!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo snorted and slowly pulled out the scimitar from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Matteo refused to surrender, the fat man was obviously very angry. He reached out and pointed to Matteo and shouted: "Where are you, cut these bastards to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man commanded the other person to rush forward, but he stepped back, and also handed a tall warrior in front of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo looked at it all in the eyes, just sneer, and the scimitar began to flash a faint brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Matteo’s more obsessive about this fat man, he wants to slap him directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is as Matteo expected, although hard, everything is still under his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat fighters of the dozens of warriors are obviously elite in the elite, the sword is simple and practical, although at a disadvantage, but not afraid. They formed a tight defensive front and kept the fat man behind. No matter how Matteo moves, it can only force these fighters to retreat, but he can't kill these tacit warriors, and they can't break their seemingly crumbling defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Matteo still has strong confidence, a slight discordant voice on the battlefield began to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man who fled to the steps of the church saw that he was safe and temporarily worried, and he was cocky and angry, and the Druids were angry and burned. Since the warriors couldn't reach the fat man, the Druids began to use magic for long-range attacks. It’s just that a female magician guarding the fat man is very powerful. She alone took the three Druid’s magical attacks, and there was still room for counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield in the courtyard is deadlocked, the Druid’s warriors have been in casualties for six consecutive years, although they are approaching the church, but the progress is slow, and the command Fat people seem to escape to safer places at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo counted the time and knew that the time to decide the battle had arrived. "See how long you can be arrogant!" He looked at the fat man, and he secretly sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not quite right!" The fat man suddenly frowned and shouted: "There are not just the things that are not open, Druid is not a bright thing. Let's get rid of them from the back door! Come and let me know what to order! Open the back door! See if there are any sneaky guys outside!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mateo's heart suddenly sinks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the twenty soldiers, under the leadership of two Druids, have quietly covered the back door of the church courtyard. The front of the killing sound came from far away, and the back door was quite quiet. It seems that the silver sacred people were attracted to the battle of the vestibule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, two heavy doors slowly opened in front of these Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Druid, but after hearing the fierce killing sound and thinking about the strength of the party and the silver sacred, he still waved, Resolutely led the team into the backyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an ambush in the backyard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who lie on the roof and the window are as expected by Matteo, but the number is limited, but twenty, of which even a few will not know What kind of martial arts magical waiter and the like. What Matteo did not expect was that each of these ambushers had a three-unit military steel with a flash of Sensen blue light in their hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of power is quite small, but it is very close-range and can shoot through the armor of the reloaded knight. They are not easy to build, they are very expensive, and it takes a lot of time to reload the arrow. Therefore, only a handful of the most elite Guards in the Imperial Corps will be equipped. As usual, a small local city like Montreal does not necessarily find such a strong one. But now there are as many as twenty in the church of the silver sacred church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pumping, not waiting for Druid to order retreat, sixty arrows have been whizzing, passing through these warriors, and finally A sleek blood line, deeply in the ground or in the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams in the backyard have become a scream. In the twinkling of an eye, more than 20 sneak attackers have been stalking the ground, and only two of the slowest fighters have been lucky. Escaped his life. They couldn’t do anything, and immediately turned and escaped from the backyard. The ambushes did not catch up, and several of the soldiers began to reload hardships for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Matteo's plan, the back door is still a slam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the screams, the fat man was very proud. He took out a drawing from his arms and opened it. He suddenly screamed again: "The wall in the southeast corner warehouse is the shortest! Come, let me know if there is anyone, give me the first to throw two A magic again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo’s heart is cold again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Rogge’s order, the window on the top floor of the church suddenly opened, revealing four ice and snow magicians. From the magical light that entangled them, it can be seen that the four magicians are not low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roof of the warehouse is tilted into the courtyard. With the spell of the ice and snow magician, the roof is covered with a layer of blue ice. Then, there were countless two feet of sharp ice blades on the walls of the warehouse and on the ground in front of the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the warehouse that is the weak link of the defense has become a death trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trap has just been laid, and one after another Druid warriors jumped from the wall to the roof of the warehouse. But they couldn't stand on the ice that had accidentally appeared, they fell and fell to the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at countless ice blades that are constantly approaching, these fighters can’t suppress the fear of death and start screaming! The soldiers outside the wall heard the screams of the comrades in the courtyard, and the rescue was eager, and they immediately leaped and rushed into the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the blood soaked the walls of the warehouse and the ground in front, and the soldiers who passed through the blade of the ice could only helplessly struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the 'Dawn Eagle' is so painful that he can hardly bear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his suffering is not over yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly looked up and frowned. "In the early morning, how can there always be an owl on our head? Come here! Give me that silly bird." Shoot it down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo finally couldn’t help but yelled: "Ridel, flee!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat warrior’s female warrior with a gorgeous armor took off the longbow behind her, the brilliance in the courtyard, a magical arrow that could not be distinguished by the naked eye. Got up to the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was blasted with a feather, a small blood flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man took his eyes back from the sky and watched Matteo smiled smugly, smiling in the sunshine and smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo’s heart is in chaos, and he can only try to maintain the minimum calm. He knows the significance of this action and still does not want to give up. For the sake of the present, only by trying to hold on to the fat man, it is possible to force the holy teaching of silver to be exemplary. Look at the fat man's clothing and luxury, ‘Dawn Eagle’ only hopes that the status of the fat man is important enough, don’t let yourself down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo waved, and the men slowly retreated to the door, the soldiers on both sides were entangled in a fight, so the defense of the fat side slowly The ground was drawn away from the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four Druids shouted and suddenly jumped to the church! While still in the air, the two female Druids turned into two black panthers, and they rushed to the female warrior who had just shot and killed the flying eagle. A male Druid, despite being struck by lightning, still rushed to the female magician who guarded the fat. The last tall and robust Druid is rushing to the horrified fat man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Druid is a good person and looks very likely to have the deformation skills of the bear system. He smoothly grabbed the fat man's neck and turned his head to the warriors in the fierce battle: "Give me a hand! Otherwise I will kill... Luyi's snoring ends with a scream.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly kicked his calf! Druid clearly heard a click, he knew his leg bones had broken. Not waiting for him to react, The fat man is flying again with a punch. The power of this punch is far beyond the imagination of Druid, and even the power of turning it into a violent bear is far less!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the three Druids next to him, the unfamiliar fat man looked very energetic, and he happened to knock down the Druid of the bear system. A black panther gave up the female warrior in front of him, and quickly changed back to the human form, turning around and rushing to the fat man. Druid's fingertips stretched out sharp claws and rushed to the fat man who had just pulled out a huge magic scroll. The scrolls in the hands of the fat man are centered on the fire copper, engraved with complicated patterns and countless magic symbols, and the power is huge. But the fat man didn't have time to start the scroll anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panicked fat man suddenly threw the magic scroll to the Druid girl, and this move is obviously beyond everyone’s expectations. The heavy magic scroll was lying on the girl's forehead. The Druid girl swayed and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister!" Matteo yelled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Matteo’s gaze swept a tiny badge at the handle of a warrior. The sharp gaze of the 'Dawn Eagle' immediately saw the appearance of the badge, and a thought flashed through his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Anti-Whales’! Pompey's private guard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mateo is now, even though the soldiers who have been in the next wave of whales are not injured, but the Druids who have the upper hand are injured and injured. heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the 'Dawn Eagle' is completely cold! This is clearly a trap! Now that things are no longer possible, Matteo no longer wants to go to the comrades who have encircled the fat man, and the order of retreat is so painful. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour of fighting, the Montreal City Chief Executive rushed to the church of the Silver Church with more than a dozen followers. The well-informed chief executive saw the bodies all over the place and couldn't help but look pale. Although he was bored and vomited, he still could hold on. But when his body lying on the ground was on the Druid side, he finally showed a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger standing on the side took everything in his eyes. He walked up and whispered in the ear of the chief executive: "It’s not the sacred people who are killed, but the Druid. You must be disappointed. Actually, there are a few talents under your command. It’s a pity that it’s all killed...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Executive was shocked and just wanted to say something, he felt that his waist was cold...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The tide whales' warriors have quietly surrounded the Chief Executive's entourage, and now they have swarmed up and killed these unsuspecting followers in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "Throw these bodies into the church! This place is no longer useful, just burn it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man immediately let the silver sacred escort a few adventurers to the sacred headquarters. And he himself took the ice and snow magician and the 'warm whales' guards to complete the final finishing work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s gathering place is in an elegant manor on the outskirts of Montreal. When the ‘Dawn Eagle’ had just returned to the manor, he ordered the remaining 30 or so men to burn all the confidential documents, and packed the baggage within five minutes, and the fire was evacuated to the forest in the northeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet manor has just been noisy, and the nightmare laughter echoes over the manor: "You guys, killing from the back door! With you, the wall in the northeast corner is short, so you can kill it from there! Remember to be careful of the trap! Will you fly magic? Well, then you will monitor their movements in the sky, be careful not to let people shoot. As for the adults, I will personally seduce the enemy at the main entrance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Eagle of the Dawn' sighed and sighed at the manor. The screams turned a deaf ear and calmly went to the manor gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is standing alone at the gate, watching the ‘Dawn Eagle’ walking slowly, laughing happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pride is blinding my eyes, so I will lose so fast and so easily. This is the goddess of freedom who gives me punishment." Matteo sighed You can't see your skills. Are you a magician or a warrior? Or are you the gods owner of the Frost Goddess? Can I know the name of someone who can defeat the Eagle of the Dawn? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "I am a magician, but the name will not tell you, lest you Druid still hide something to rely on the name." The secret spell of the curse. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
