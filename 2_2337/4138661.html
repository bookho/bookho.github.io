			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dangdang" a loud noise, followed by a "squeaky" scream, Rogge and the rocking chair a back, heavily planted on the ground. Even if Rogge was thick and thick, the head first touched the ground and made him feel dizzy for a while. He struggled to get up from the ground, and it took him a while to drive away the stars and birds flying around his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The realm of dreams is still vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took to kill, Rogge was exhausted, and the golden light in the skull was dimmed a lot, but the zombies were still inexhaustible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a new energy group on the black peak of dozens of miles began to form. In Rogge's mind-sensing world, the energy of the group is deep and black, and it is so powerful that it is constantly strong. As the mass of energy eventually formed a huge red and red energy group, a powerful spirit wave swayed in all directions like a raging wave. The soul energy of a slightly weaker zombie is like a candle in a typhoon. There is no room for struggling, and it is extinguished in an instant. For a time, on the plains where thousands of zombies were piled up, only the remaining *** and a dozen zombie lords were still standing. When the spirit of the two sides came into contact, Rogge was struck by lightning. Endless hatred, destruction, and killing came from the spiritual shock. At that moment, Rogge could hardly restrain himself from being crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, the soul energy has been locked in, and swept to the side with amazingness. Rogge complained, *** This madman can never rush to find his own way, although he can't see what creature it is, but in terms of the strength of this group of soul energy, it is not ** *And Rogge has dealt with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The sickle hovered for a week, and a blood-red arc spurred out on all sides, pushing a few zombie lords around him. *** glared at the direction of the energy rushing, silently roaring, a small golden spiritual power ball with a thin beautiful flame tail flew past. Seeing that he was about to hit the huge soul energy, Rogge was ready to cheer, and the energy of the group rolled over, and a dark red lightning came out, and the little golden light ball was smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** and Rogge stayed for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run! You are an idiot bone shelf! No brains!" Rogge slowed down and couldn’t help but roar through the spirit stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A jump into the sky, but it is directed at the energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God!" Rogge screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ***Bone wing of the air is gently deployed, this time there is a layer of bone-to-bone that is indistinguishable and almost completely transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** A soft and clever circling, has lost a direction, and the surplus has flown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man did not have such good luck, he was smashed out in the air, rolling and falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zombie lords on the ground gathered together, leaning back to the sky, all the saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge screamed, desperately trying to hang out in the sky, but the result was a close contact with the head and the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge muttered and climbed, cursing the damn ***. However, he did not dare to summon the theory of *** to understand the truth. After two different worlds, Rogge had already understood that this was more than just a dream. After seeing the heroic battle, the fat man knows that he is not an opponent of the ***. What's more, this death is so hot that I can throw myself away from the sky. Isn't this the opposite? Is there still my own master in my heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighed, and there was nothing to dissatisfy and he had to swallow. In the future, there are still many places to fight and rely on ***, this time offended it, don’t give yourself a knife behind it. The relationship between the Master and the pet is also a depressing one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirited and unconventional Rogge looked at the window late in the evening, got up and went out to find the number of Fiss and Franco to discuss the hammer of the god of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the cold night, the snow fluttered in the sky. The holiday hotel is *** bright and steaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t gather together, everyone is very interested. After everyone talked about the wind and snow, the beauty of the gold coins, they began to seriously study the exhibition plan of the "God of the God of War". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge first said: "Brothers, our new God of War hammer is about to open. I have to make a look this time. Let the nobles think of the 'Knight of the God of War', and immediately think of the status! It is the symbol of wealth! It is cool! It is the screams of the smugglers and the envy of the civilians! But then again, the name is too The dwarf shop, Mom, who wanted to break the name at the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides who else you?!" Etter did not give Rogge stayed face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat old face is red, support, and open the topic: "Of course, we must do something good! There must be no little bit of work cuts." When we throw in a gold coin, we will take back two gold coins! I mean, the War of the Gods can't do the best weapon armor, but definitely make the most exquisite and beautiful things!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you, the more gold you use, the better! "Franco's vicious irony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was furious, staring at Franco, eager to try. Franco didn't take it, snorted, picked up A delicate little silver fork. The fat man turned his eyes and sat down again. In a small space, fighting with the Franco with a short soldier is undoubtedly a dead end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Faith's mouth is stuffed with lobster meat, with a vague saying: "Don't make trouble again, it is a serious matter to find me a few assistants. I can't do anything, can I do it alone? Let me say that I am good at getting a magical array, but this armor weapon is not beautiful, and it doesn't fit the taste of those characters. I don't know! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lens also said: "It's not a small thing to do something beautiful." From the point of selling things, the few things that are beautifully and beautifully created can have at least a half-profit, and they are always sold first. Others who do more generally, in fact, the quality is not worse than these boutiques, but the money is earned less. Since its inception, it has not been the acquisition of the adventurer's spoils. Our boutiques have earned more than 20,000 gold coins, but those ordinary ones have earned four thousand gold coins. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate said: "The profit of ordinary equipment is thin, but the victory is huge, and it cannot be let go." I think we should open a new store to do this kind of business. If you can squeeze into the fat land of the army, it is also a source of money. At least we can let Lord Winnington of Fort Worth specialize in purchasing our things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rug said: "Let's do it, I think we need to find more artisans. Kim is responsible for guiding and training. I will make some ordinary weapons." Armor. This way we can digest some of our best fine iron ore. The original mine was sold like this, and I always felt that it was a loss. Just find a place in this workshop city and let it go. As for the hammer of the god of war, we have to find a few real masters to design the style, it is best to find a few who know the highest level of social etiquette, they know what will be popular among the nobility. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete succeeded: "Right, when I was in the church, a little girl doing volunteers there seemed to say that her grandfather was a A great master of sculpture. What is the name? What is the illusion of fog? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco's eyes lit up, his voice trembled: "Is it a master of fog?" Is he in Lille? I heard that he had sinned a great aristocrat in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in his early years. In order to avoid the disaster, he vowed not to make art, and the nobles had let him go. I didn’t know where I was afterwards. I didn't expect him to hide here. I still have one of his works at home! The style of the fog illusion works like a cloud, and it is hard to grasp the inner beauty, so it has a foggy title. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and relished for a moment before he sighed: "That is the art that really shocks the soul!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened, came to the spirit, and asked: "Is this fog illusion really so bad?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco looked at Rogge with dissatisfaction: "He is a master who can truly be with time." Just heard that the temper is eccentric, the temper is stubborn, and the extreme hatred of the nobility. To say that this person is designing items for the nobility, I think it is a dream. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! To deal with this old stubbornness, is our approach still less?" Rogge smiled, "He is a block of Xuangang, and he wants him." Open flowers! What about Ian, isn't it the whole trick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lens! I can tell you, don't hit the little girl's idea. This month, my leg is losing her!" Etter was dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lens smiles, this must be reserved for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected frowning, Rogge said: "The city is no better than other places, we can't do too much now." Otherwise, Orpheek may not be able to protect us. Moreover, why he is so careless about us is still unclear, and it is better to be careful. If you want to do something, you can't turn over the boat for these little things. What's more, this kind of thing can be done on the ground, but it is not glorious. Let the people look at it and watch out for it. It is not convenient for us to do anything in the future. Or if Ian is as clean and thorough as it is, or simply let it go. There are many ways to deal with this old thing. It doesn't have to be beaten and killed to make some people's lives. It is imperative to first find out the information of this old guy and see what hobbies he has? We are good at it. It’s not good, just plant him a glimpse, let him reasonably confess, can only be from us. There is no way, and then hit his granddaughter's idea. All in all, let him be used for us. And it is best to let him do his best. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people are now deliberating. After many tempering, the scums have calmed down a lot, and the edge is fading. The poison that was conceived is carefully and spicy. There is no leakage in the drip. Compared with two years ago, it is no longer a good idea to compare it with each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several maids pass by the door, but Feeling the wind and the wind, I couldn’t help but fight a few chills.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon sun was lazy on the streets of Lille, let this be The city that sleeps in the cold winter slowly wakes up. The sun is the most equal, whether you are a noble or a civilian, you will bathe in the sunshine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Isabella enjoys walking happily in the streets of the slums, as if it were a beating note. Low shacks, rugged dirt roads, a sloppy effluent, scent of fluttering around, and All sorts of strange mothers screaming at children, quarreling in the neighborhood, and the sound of cockerels and dogs are not affecting her mood. I grew up in this place since I was a child, so she loves everything here and loves all the people here. God said that she wants to love the people in this world, so she wholeheartedly follows the teachings of God. She does three and a half days in the church every week. Volunteer is her happiest time. Although there is no income, bathing in the glory of God can help other suffering people, the best reward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Girls like the sun, as long as she is happy in sunny weather. The 17-year-old Isabella is tall and tall, one meter and seventy, looks more mature than the actual age, just that one blows The small face that is broken will occasionally reveal a childish expression, revealing the real age of the owner. Isabella is very white, white is almost transparent, but the lively girl always adds a touch of halo to this transparent white. Red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s five senses are exquisite, a pair of big eyes are always looking at the restless look, plus a smile that always hangs on her lips, she Always like the people around you. Church The priests were very good to her, and a young pastor even secretly taught her a little light spell, and Isabella is now able to reinforce the initial level of minor wound healing.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl has reason to be happy, Mr. Etter, who has been getting along well this month, gave himself a job today, taking care of the room and the courtyard, and having a whole gold coin a month. Grandpa no longer needs to eat black bread every day. We can have bacon every day. If you save a little, Grandpa can drink a small glass of wine every day. This kind of life, neighbors are envious of death. If you have been doing this for two years, you may be able to build a wooden house. Grandfather is old and has a lot of rheumatism. With a new house, you can suffer a lot of crimes in winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Mr. Etter is really a good person. He is not tall and strong, he is taller than himself. Many men are not as tall as they are, but they are very casual, but they are very clean. The face is very rough, but the more handsome they look, the more handsome they are. . Thinking of this, the girl’s heartbeat is a little faster, and her face is a little bit burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl walked with Hu Lihu, and her mind was full of Etter’s shadow. "How can Mr. Etter seem to be young, how can there be so many adventures? This month, his experience has not been repeated. The stupid iron bear next to the street is entangled in the sky. He would only talk about the horses he took care of, or else the trivial matter of Mr. Gibumer’s family. However, Mr. Etter’s leg was so scary that he had been in the church for four months. I have never seen such a terrible injury. I can see the bone through the wound when I saw it, but Mr. Etter never called it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
