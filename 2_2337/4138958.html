			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如如梦章二二下下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Shrine’s Great Temple is not solemn The atmosphere, on the contrary, is very noisy and crowded, and looks more like a messy market. The Great Temple is large in scale, and the Ice and Snow Mage, the Ice Temple Warrior, and the clergymen keep moving around. From time to time, there will be a variety of aliens or monsters being dragged by the samurai to disappear behind a fan door. When a sea dragon with a length of several tens of meters was also dragged into the lobby of the temple, it caused a lot of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge solemnly walks through the crowds, all the way through the lobby and heading towards the back of the temple. At the back of the temple, Rogge passed through three areas in turn. In the first area, there are tens of thousands of various kinds of teachings, and hundreds of preparative mages are reading the textbooks here. These sects are all the sects, the sects of the sacred churches scattered in the West Bank of the Longines, or the sects, legends, or local genres of the people. Anyone who sees the gods and foreign objects mentioned in it will be copied by the preparatory mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened another door and entered the second area. There are dozens of shelves, and slate and carvings are scattered around the ground. Here is where the religious, alien tribe totems, statues, and holy objects are placed. Because the Holy Church has to write a teaching code, it has collected a large number of erudite scholars and heraldic totem scholars. Here they just came in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the third area, Rogge not only had to open a heavy Qinggang gate, but also passed two magic traps in succession. Stepped into this area. It is much more defensive than the defense of the first two areas. There are several ice temple warriors guarding each entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is quieter and cleaner than the first two areas, it is like a small and sophisticated library. More than a dozen carefully selected masters are sorting magic books, scrolls, and some unidentified magic items or raw materials, and placing them on the four-story bookshelf. In the middle of the area, there are more than ten large desks placed in a circle. Each table is sitting behind a figure dressed as a mage, and is concentrating on the magic book or scroll placed in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wizards have different shapes and have the Ice and Snow Master of the Holy Church. There are wizard wizards, and even two of them are wrapped in black robes. From time to time, the mysterious mage emerged from the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the unknown magic and magic items are located. Of course, these studies are also plundered from those small religions and alien tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this busy scene, Rogge nodded with satisfaction. He did not bother the wizards in these crazy work, quietly past the wall through the area, and came to an old wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog gently pushed the wooden door and the door was not locked. After entering, he closed the wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the back of the door. Just one step, Rogge immediately fell into a space with no direction, no sound, no light, no physical existence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge seems to know the direction, calmly move forward, after a few steps, suddenly suddenly, the original has entered the last area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man just kicked a few canine-shaped creatures that sniffed at his feet and sniffed around him, and snorted in his head. . The scene in front of me suddenly blurred. Roger's brows were slightly wrinkled, and the light in his eyes was bright, and several mental powers were bundled like needles, and the spirits fluctuated along the way to counterattack the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly sounded a very unpleasant snoring in his ear, and then the twisted world in his eyes returned to its original state. A guy with a sulky face, a small body, and a disproportionately large head took a few steps back and fell to the ground. The huge orange eyes are filled with bloodshot eyes, and a trace of blue blood lines flow out of the corners of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gob, I have already told you that this plane is not so mixed." A lazy, magnetic voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked up and saw Miro standing not far away. Miro sneered at him, then turned and whispered to Froya, looking no longer looking at Rogge. At this moment, Froya stood in front of a great magical experiment platform, and was facing a large number of spar with colorful brilliance in front of her. Miro patiently explained to her for a long time, then stretched out and painted in the air. The purple fire on his fingertips ignited in the air for a long time, and in a blink of an eye he drew a prototype of a magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria. Someone has been waiting for you for a long time." Miro smiled and reminded her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria glimpsed, looking back at Milo’s gaze. It was only after seeing that the smile standing on the spot and on the face was somewhat unnatural. She smiled softly, lifted the skirt and ran to the front of Rogge, kissed him gently on his lips, and then asked in a very low voice: "Oh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the tourmaline that is like a deep pool, Rogge’s anger suddenly vanished. The fat man took care of Fu Luoya’s waist and smiled and said: “There is always someone else who yells at me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the smile of Miró’s mouth disappeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria earned from Rogge’s arms and said: “In any case, you have no heart and lungs, and you are uncomfortable. I am over there. There is something else!" After that, she ran back to the lab table and began to adjust the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro and Rogge looked at each other and looked at the intersection, like a faint storm raging. There was a sneer in Miro's mouth, and Rogge smiled with a kindness and warmth, but he looked at Miro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge no longer pays attention to Miro, but moves slowly and looks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange, gloomy and broad temple, and a faint purple light group floating slowly in the air illuminates the entire hall. The ground, walls and ceilings are slowly squirming, and in some places you can see a pulsed blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s foothold seems to be in the body of a great monster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is more than ten meters high on the four walls densely embedded with three rows of transparent eggs of different sizes. These transparent giant eggs are filled with light green or light blue liquid, which is immersed in many strange creatures. There are also some giant eggs that are hollow, but the liquid inside is tumbling violently. The creatures in the giant eggs are some monsters that have never been seen before, some are the aliens living on the west bank of the Longines, and some are the various Warcraft in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly rose into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When viewed from the top down, the hall is even more grotesque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a resounding of World of Warcraft or a scream of strangers in the hall. Under the backdrop of the blue and purple light, the whole hall looks like a ghost. However, it is strange. In this place, the Terran, the Dwarf and the Lich are busy together, and the Elves are in parallel with the Devil. Numerous races with unbreakable feuds work together. The desperate fight that must have occurred in the past was replaced by indifferent mutual vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandeur of the hall is beyond imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the back of the main hall, the captured sea dragon was fixed in the center of the magical position, surrounded by dozens of busy elf wizards and demons. The small, low-spirited Gob, who had attacked Rogge with a spirit, shouted loudly and commanded everyone to fix the dragon's limbs to the four corners of the magic array. Rogge already knows that Gobbe belongs to a very rare race in the Mozu. Their physique is weak, the magic resistance is low, and the use of magic is also confusing. However, this race is very good at the use of mental power, and the talent in mental control and spiritual attack is more than the devil in the underground abyss. A race that is extremely dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s the reason for the outstanding mentality. This race is also good at detecting and prophesying. Almost every demon lord’s side is from this race. Prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailong growled desperately, trying to break away the thick chains tied to the limbs, but all its struggles are in vain, only to see the magic in the magic The growing blood-sucking thorns climbed onto it, piercing a thorn into its scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly thought that if the original arrogant Amorro saw this scene, I don’t know what it would be like. After seeing many powerful people who are absolutely powerless to resist. This superior Mozu looks very satisfied with the current situation and stays in the city of the gods with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glanced at the busy hall and flew to a platform on the wall and stepped into a magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Rogge stepped out of another transmission magical array and crossed the corridor. Came to a fine hall. It is very different from the sinister and strange atmosphere outside. The rooms are elegant and bright, and the walls and marble columns are decorated with exquisite carvings. In the middle of the hall, several elves have been set up, but the center of the circle is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog smiled. The thief who steals the power of the natural goddess will not think that he still has a little natural goddess in his body! Who is the fat man, and who will not leave a more backward path for himself? With the cultivation of the Elf Array. It won't take long for this goddess of nature to turn out dozens of divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine power is two-way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every natural goddess of power will become the bridge between Rogge and the goddess of nature. Just after seeing the goddess of the natural goddess. If you don't have the perfect grasp, the fat man will never intend to harass the great natural goddess again. No one knows the goddess of nature and the power of God. In case she was angry and sent another avatar, there was no second Casinaras to be a shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the goddess of nature is being pinched, why is she so angry that she is so angry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the fat man couldn’t help but smile, and there was no sacred and solemn demeanor in front of outsiders. He smiled reluctantly for a moment, and then walked through the elves and walked to the room at the other end of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the natural goddess is left alone in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Rogetto, although there is no protection at both ends of this transmission magic array, but it is absolutely safe. This temporary temple of the Holy Church is by no means a place where ordinary people can come and go. Even if it is a sanctuary, if you invade the four areas outside, you can't even escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this hall is where Miro does not dare to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the hall. There is a slightly smaller room with a white jade pool in the middle of the room. Effie stood by the pool and couldn't hold up the sacred atmosphere. Along with her crisp spell, the pool presents a clear mountain view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked into the room, seeing Mora and Hughes standing by the pool, looking at the mountain view in the pool, while the underground gnome also climbed the pool side. Point to the mountain view in the pool. Rogge knew they were waiting for him, so he greeted him. Go to the pool. However, he only took two steps. In the corner of his eye, he suddenly saw a dragon flame gun in the corner of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s face is bright, and I immediately look around, but after reading it, how can there be a figure in the room? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fat man, seeing Xius, Mora, and even Effie, who stopped cursing, are staring at him, apparently holding back. He thought about it. Turned around and looked at every corner of the room, still nothing. In fact, he can't see that Weiner is also normal. The angels who can shuttle through the space can only be immersed in the space storm, which can be regarded as a flawless stealth effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge always felt that there was something wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly ran to the pool and looked into the pool. On the magical mountain view in the water, it really reflected the faint figure of Wella. It turned out that she converges on the whole body and follows Rogge. Always standing in the corner of his eyes can not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing how she moved and after the method of detecting Rogge, Mora frowned, and Effie thought thoughtfully. Rogge learned this hidden atmosphere from Xius, but the way Weiner hides is obviously one step further: she has physical but no shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge finally understands, Wella smiles lightly. Road: "It's not too stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said, she suddenly smiled and stared at Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes immediately coughed, completely disregarding the style of the elders, flashing behind the Moura, let Wella's insights useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina couldn’t help the old fox for a moment, but had to scream and reach out to the Dragon Soul Gun, and then went across the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the space she left, Rogello was slightly out of sight for a moment, and this suddenly remembered something. Cried: "Why is Mora able to borrow her power? As a pope, I can't use her magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
