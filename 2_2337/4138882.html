It’s just that the empire has been fighting on several fronts for several decades, and it has been extremely devastating in the abyss and the dark forests. Therefore, it has not been able to give enough support to Frederick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going all the way, without Rogge’s expectation, from the eyes of the ‘tidal’ army soldiers seen along the road, he saw not only contempt but also hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Frederick, who led the Chaoshan Legion for decades, was ordered to commit suicide by the Great. The fat man is not the culprit, but at least one of the masterminds. He is now being transferred to lead the ‘tidal’ regiment. It’s not a good idea to jump out of an assassin on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge personally designated the Bauhinia butterfly to follow his own way into the city. Until Rogge sat in the conference hall of the Legion headquarters, the main generals of the three regiments had arrived at the end of the ‘tidal’ regiment, and there were six abnormalities in the body of the Bauhinia butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how full and noble the reason is, the Bauhinia Butterfly betrayed the city of Yunxiao. This time her performance is abnormal, the biggest possibility is to meet the same colleagues in the cold moon camp, so that the ups and downs. Rogge remembered these six suspicious generals in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the original intention of Rogge to bring the Bauhinia butterfly around is to use her eyes to distinguish the generals of Druidan in the 'tidal' army. . Bauhinia butterfly only promised to work for Rogge wholeheartedly, she is no possibility to sell the companion land of the cold moon camp. But she never thought of it. The subtle fluctuations in the mind actually sold her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Wallace’s commander Wallace did not cause the change of the Bauhinia butterfly, which made Rogge a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Yunxiao has been in business for many years, and Frederick is a faithful believer in the goddess of nature. The ‘trend’ army is bound to be filled with a large number of people. Rogge is not worried about those powerful Druids or warriors. His most concern is that, like the Bauhinia butterfly, the personal strength is not outstanding from the group of people in the cold moon camp. So with the eyes of the Bauhinia butterfly. Luo Ge is very determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace is a very crude middle-aged man, and many years of battle left a few scars on his face. He even said that the simplest courtesy of a few words was blunt. There is absolutely no sleekness that people in the officialdom should have. Perhaps this can also be explained by the fact that he really hates Rogge too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles, smiles and bluntly reveals some cringe. The Chaoshan Legion will look in the eyes, naturally more disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting down in the most central position, the fat man took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his spiritual world, there is a deep darkness on all sides. slowly. A little green light illuminates like a firefly in the night. It seems to have heard the invisible call, and the green light is lit up. The green light spot was lit up at first, and then a few points were bright. At the end, there were dozens of dazzling green lights shining at the same moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man blinked suddenly, and the whole body has been soaked in cold sweat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Rogge, are you not feeling well?" Wallace asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! The journey is really longer. Ah, I have to go see how my Elf Guard is placed. What specific things, you Let's discuss it slowly!" Not waiting for Wallace to answer, Rogge stood up and hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, it was a series of complicated and complicated handovers, and how to place the tens of thousands of troops brought by Rogge. As for the receipt of defense zone information, coordination of command and even position adjustment. These are all things going on in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These specific matters, Rogge hand, all thrown to the Bauhinia butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, at least nominally, Rogge is the highest general in charge of the entire Red Clay Wasteland front, and ranks alongside Pompey. The power of the fat man is actually very large, and even the senior generals including Wallace can be appointed and dismissed. Therefore, Rogge did not care for those tidal generals who intended to overhead him and despised him hate. At least now the fat man has the support of the great emperor, there are too many insidious means to clean them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was the number of natural goddess believers in the city of Sidde...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidle City was busy for three days, and the army’s handover was only slightly over. But I am busy with others. The fat man is very busy. The only thing he does all day long is to wander around the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield of the entire Southeastern Front has been glued for ten years. All residents of the city of Side have long regarded war as part of their daily lives. Where there are warriors, there will be countless pubs and dancers, and Sidde is no exception. Different from other semi-military fortresses, the city is located in the main thoroughfare of traffic, and it is also an important gathering place for desperate people who try to cross the battlefield for smuggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Schild has the prosperous and extravagant power of the Southeastern front. From this point of view, the headquarters of the Chaoshan Legion, the current city of Spiegel where Pompey is located is much more boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every late night, Rogge will visit a pub. Not many people in the city have recognized the new highest official, that is, no one knows who he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Rogge entered a small pub. The spirits from this pub are very famous in the city of Side. The tavern owner is a nearly one-year-old one-eyed dragon. It is said that when he was young, he was also a good murderer, so few drunks dared to make trouble on his site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pub’s two-day genius is not the one-eyed dragon boss, but a handsome, almost enchanting swordsman. This swordsman is very weird. In the past two days, I entered the store late at night. I didn’t say a word, just a bottle of wine. The pub's spirits are full of stamina, and the swordsman's drink doesn't look too big, so it won't take long for him to fall to the table. Get drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white-skinned women’s slender hands, the charming face, always provoke men to think about it. Often in this pub, there are many people who like to be male, if not for the evils of the one-eyed dragon boss, they have already embraced such a delicious meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This swordsman is indeed weird. He seems to have been drunk. But every time I only lie on the table for half an hour, I suddenly sit up. Then go ahead if nothing happens. The night before, there was another killer who couldn’t help but sneak out and watched the pub boss shake his head. However, according to the rules of the Sidde City, as long as the pub door is out, everything that happens is not related to him, so the one-eyed dragon has not stopped it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second night of the night, the swordsman appeared in the pub again, but the killer did not come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Shiran into the tavern. The swordsman was lying on a table in the corner, drunk and unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and shook his head, trying to go to the swordsman, a sulky warrior in the pub suddenly stood up, sinisterly: "This little guy, I have to fix it! Kirbytian, if you dare to do more, you have to think about the consequences of our wind wolf!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tavern owner Sighed, said: "Carus. The rules of the city of Sidde, you don't know, as long as he leaves my door, or when I close the door, everything that happens is irrelevant to me. No one. Willing to offend the wind wolf, but if you break the rules, then General Wallace will not easily let people who dare to challenge his authority..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carus It seems to be arrogant. But apparently not willing to openly confront Wallace in the city of Sidde. So he snorted and sat down slowly. There are four or five companions around him, and they all look at the drunken swordsman. One of the middle-aged people dressed as a magician quietly took out a white bone wand from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a gentle voice came from the side: "Although your magical career is not destined to be brilliant, there is always better than nothing. For your life considerations So, the cheap cursed wand is still taken back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carus and others were shocked. When they looked up, they saw that the speaker was a fat man with a smile. Carus stood up and walked slowly. He moved his hand and the machete at his waist was in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Friends, we are in the air. Not you can afford it..." Carus's body has already faintly radiant. It seems that he has a lot of combat experience. I have already gathered all the power up, and I don’t despise it because my opponent’s appearance is not amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carus snorted, his eyes fixed on Rogge, and the machete began to creak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man raised his hands and began to recite the curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician holding the white bone wand suddenly cried: "This is the spell of the flame arrow!..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is not falling, Carus has been a scimitar, quickly stepped forward, to cut him into two before the fat wizard's spell is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrus is not the title of the wind wolf, marching like the wind, after flying like electricity! Even he flies backwards much faster than forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment he rushed to the fat man, the damn fat man’s mouth continued to spell, but a huge fist had already brought a strong wind, like a thunder The lightning flashed on the face of Carus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This boxing contains a strong force that is not human, and Carus has clearly heard the crack in his face. He only felt that his mind was very embarrassing and the whole body became light and fluttering. Among them, Carus only understood one thing. The fat man who just chanted was indeed a spell of flame arrows, but he did not transfer the magic at all, just chanting a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the very beginning, the insidious fat man is ready to give him such a punch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carus hates it, but he doesn’t know where he is going to fall, it’s the top of the drunken swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bright blue brilliance flashing in the pub! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carus suddenly lit up a dozen blue lights, and then he did not even scream, the body suddenly burst into the air in a dozen Blocks, scattered in all corners of the pub! Fortunately, every wound on the corpse is sealed by a thin layer of blue crystals, or it must be a bloody fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub is silent for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunken swordsman is still on the table, but his left hand is raised high, pointing to the sky! The slender index fingertips, the blue vindictive radiance of the inch, the temperament still lingering out a little beautiful stardust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the starry spirit!" There is no shortage of knowledgeable people in the pub, and someone immediately called it out! And those who have used the idea of ​​a swordsman in the dark have all been like earthy at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man shook his head and walked to the swordsman and reached for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a scream, the swordsman’s left hand brought a blurry afterimage and went to the fat chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man seems to have a very bright silvery light flashing in front of him, but the eyes of everyone in the pub are blocked by the fat body, and no one has seen it. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only saw the fat man holding the swordsman’s hand in one hand, holding his waist in one hand and lifting him from the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman seemed to be a little surprised, opened his eyes and drunk, saw the fat man in front of him, closed his eyes, and his body was soft, so he leaned on The fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman suddenly retched a few times, and then intermittently said: "Dead fat...you...you rob me, woman...and you are not finished!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled bitterly, and even said: "Good! It must be over, it must be over! If it is finished, it is not a man! Let's go, let me go first." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman muttered twice, letting the fat man walk outside the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly turned back to the tavern owner: "You also saw that this is entirely Carus, and we can't do anything wrong."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corbian looked at Carus’s colleague who was stunned but did not dare to go forward, sighed, just nodded, no more. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub’s door is open and the cold wind is still sending the intermittent conversation to the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
