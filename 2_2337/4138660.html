			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dream Abyss" World War I, the third Knights "Dragon and Beauty" independent brigade fame. The day's war situation was sent to a number of big man's desks by secretly summarizing the reports into multiple versions. The reporters have different expressions, and they have teeth and teeth. They can’t help but can’t help but feel disgusted. The parties did not know anything about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties involved are surprisingly tacit. The Bavarian Principality is rigorous and its military discipline is strict. The private fight is a separate confinement in January, whipping twenty. The fight of this scale, and it is carried out in the casino, spread out, and the few who take the lead are afraid to lose their heads. The loss of that Passis in front of the eyes is fixed, and only the future will be revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Kate’s explanation, Rogge and other talents let go. Otherwise, everyone will succumb to such a big disaster, fearing that the military sergeant has not eaten for two days, and then they have to fall into the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, everyone was spending their time in fear, but they were not idle. I was busy planning to buy a house to live in, but I was planning to live here in the city. One hundred "Dragon and Beauty" knights and the fifty mountain people were stunned by Franco in the military camp. It is said that the goal is to "survive in the street battle." This is to prepare for the future search for the second Knights. There is a good thing to not go out, bad things pass thousands of miles. At this time, in the military camp of the Third Knights, other squadrons, including the regular knights of the First Cavaliers, looked differently to the "Dragon and Beauty" knights. The gaze included admiration, envy, disdain, embarrassment, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe since childhood, Rogge has a soft spot for having a small nest. The fat man misses the first small building of Falburg himself. Even if it is a heavy institution, even if it is messy, it is his first home. There is also that wonderful night, the incomparable madness after the escape, the straight legs and the powerful legs, the exhaustion after a thousand miles, is so deep. Suddenly, Rogge missed Qi Wei very much, it was a kind of inexplicable emotion. Qi Wei is very hot, handsome, beautiful, martial arts, and young. Even in the current age of this level, people still respect the powerful strong. Although she is only a civilian, she is much stronger than her descendants of the nobility. Rogge knows that if there is no accident, it is impossible for him to get such a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe that's why the day is so memorable. Rogge thought of himself. For himself, or for a man, Qi Wei’s Wu Yong is actually useless. What I want is nothing but her body and face. Although she is beautiful, it is far from the fabulous color of Elysses. It is not a minority among the civilian women. But these are added together, and there are not many women who can compare with Qiwei. Just like the weapon armor of the God of War, it is indeed a boutique in terms of practicality, but it is also not a superb god. After all the decorations and the gimmicks were added, they immediately became uncommon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is a sense of conquest! Rogge knew that Qi Wei was definitely dismissive of himself and was high on it. "But what about it? Isn't it for Lao Tzu to show you enough, touched it all over and done it?" The fat man thought badly. It should be the contrast between this status and the actual situation, so that I am so cool, not to do Qi Wei, but to do a woman who was originally unable to obtain her status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a famous woman is the dream of every man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is conquest!" Rogge is somewhat content. But another voice in my heart is saying, "This is also called conquest? You just got her body with despicable means. Have you destroyed her will? Or have you got her heart?" The fat man was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This year, there are so many rumors! I only want you, don't want your heart!" The fat man thought indignantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing a famous woman is not the end, but also to find ways to let others know. This has become a symbol of status. Excellent women have been from my grandfather, and I have nothing to do with my grandfather. As for where is extraordinary, hahahaha, kid you think about it! As for how to let others know, there is also a lot of learning here. I can't say my woman every time. To make a twist, it's best to let them spend their brains. With what kind of people say, it is also learning. Birds of a feather flock together. To show off this with a coolie, it must not be an idiot, or be ill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man wants to come and think, Qi Wei is really too disgraceful to say it. Even if the aristocrats are deceiving, they must have a minimum demeanor. They can be singled out and can’t pick up the group, but they must be righteous. For the seduce women, the nobles are even more particular about what they want. It’s a trap and an anesthetic. It’s really nothing to say except for those scums and friends. This made Rogge quite depressed by the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the strong, they are not free. The status of the magician has been very respected, but the Wizards Guild still has to carry out a hierarchy. And the distinction between clothing and accessories at all levels is obvious. Magic is not equal to combat power. This Rogge already knows. Since this rookie mage knows that there is no reason that the teachers are not clear, this level of appraisal, there are not too many differences. However, the mages who go to the grade identification every year are still like the river. The appraisal fee is not cheap, only this income, the Wizards Guild is rich and can be enemies. Of course, as an outstanding representative of smart people, the services provided by the Wizards Guild are not ordinary. The styles of the magic robes of this high-level magician are all carefully designed by the real masters. The style is simple and elegant, it belongs to the classic design that will not be outdated, and there are master tailors tailored to the volume, which is not the ratio of the big 6 goods in the clothing assistant. It is that every high-level magician (generally a magician who is more than 12th grade) stands out, and he looks elegant and refined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of Rogge’s eyes suddenly brightened, yes, it’s a man’s inability to have a status, and there must be four words in the position of the hammer of God. It is a symbol of status. It is impossible to sell low-priced things in the future. The real big customers are not willing to use the same things as civilians. As for the wealthy businessmen, they should not be left out, as long as You can add a few yuan to the price, some of the original products that are only sold to the nobility, as long as you don't make jealousy, you can also take it home. This Fiss, the magical instrument, especially the armor, is indeed a generation of masters, that is, the taste is worse. Just relying on him alone, can you make a few things in a month? Now the trophy of the adventurer acquired by the Quake Hammer has already piled up like a mountain, and it has to become a gold coin. It seems that it is time to hire a few master craftsmen. It’s time. This master of art must have one. Is it still necessary to find a master of etiquette? It seems that it should be discussed with Franco.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Roger walks on the snow The small courtyard of my own house. This house is not big. The second floor has a courtyard of about 500 square meters. There are seven rooms in the small building, four in the upper floor, and three in the lower floor and the living room. Compared with the building in Falkburg, Rogge is also limited in size, but the location is much better. This Binshe Avenue is the junction of the rich and civilian areas, that is, how much can be noble The border of the community.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille City is expensive, far from the semi-border area of ​​the illegal town. This industry has spent a lot of Rogge 2000 Gold coins, really let the fat meat hurt for a long time. But value for money, the original owner of the small building is also a fallen aristocrat, spent all his life in art and history, also very good at garden repair. This small courtyard was rectified Elegant and quiet, great ingenuity. An old tree can shade more than half of the yard in summer, and the tree hanging in winter may also be a scene of the courtyard. A winding curved road connecting the stone and the door connects the courtyard door and the door. Gathered a flower stand, the dried vine plants still Wandering around the flower stand, waiting quietly for the spring season. The lawn in the winter yard has dried up, and two carriages of black carriage lights are placed on the top. At night, the light yellow glow makes the night return. People feel extra warmth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned around in the small courtyard, very satisfied. Into the room, Want Want burned the fireplace, moved After a rocking chair with a history of 50 years, I lazily squatted by the fire and took a look at "The Nature of Undead Magic".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The book was written by a great necromancer 50 years ago. As a model of heresy, the necromancer was unfortunately annihilated for the sacred church, and all his property naturally became the church. This book was sent by Orpheco to Rogge, who almost scared the fat man. It is very normal for the magician to call the undead, but reading this is completely different. Right next to the most dazzling temple of the glory of God, there is also the darkest place - the Inquisition. In addition to a few days of festivals throughout the year, the flames on the stakes of the Inquisition have never stopped. Therefore, every time Rogge reads this book, he does not choose where no one is. There is no servant cook in the small building now, just reading the book quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called undead magic, to put it bluntly, is actually the magic of dealing with the soul. From this point of view, it is quite close to the magic of the light department. Undead creatures all rely on a variety of negative energy support to be active, and their intelligence and instinct comes from the soul of the mage simulation or the soul of the living person directly placed. A variety of bizarre undead creatures are the result of a combination of different bones and various souls. The soul of the simulation is the stability. After thousands of years of tempering, the spell of the undead spell has been quite perfect. When the mage wants to summon a sergeant, he will come out with a sergeant. The result of using the soul of the living is very uncertain, and in many cases it is completely defeated, and more often it will summon various inexplicable creatures. For example, taking the soul of an evil warrior as a guide, it is very likely to summon a knifewalker or a general. But once a better undead creature is formed, Necromancers have a chance to learn how to simulate this state of mind. In the case of success, a new death call is created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sees God. The author of the book actually painted a picture of a corpse. Rogge looked at it, but the black mist floated out of the book, and an earth-shattering giant cockroach came with an indescribable stench, and a monster was crawling out of the fog, but it was a three meter. The tall, green and yellow corpse beast stares at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a sip of cold gas, facing the sudden corpse, his own axe, armor, all kinds of equipment did not bring, how is this? Playing? It’s important to keep alive, and the fat man has no time to think about why he suddenly encountered such a thing when reading a book, but he has firmly remembered the four-character commentary of the corpse beast. Rogge turned around and was ready to escape. A familiar suction lifted him up through the dark fog and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the familiar gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Roger’s futile brushing and threatening intimidation, he was indifferent to inhaling Rogge. Rogge’s mental power was once again like the water in a broken basin, and it’s leaking out. "Suck and suck, anyway, the Master and the pet are two sides, and the honor and disgrace are related." Rogge thought with a smile. In the past two years, Luo Geqian has practiced hard, and his mental strength and magic have made many progress. Especially since the last dream, the mental strength has not improved much. After this *** is sucked, there is still a small half of the mental strength left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the same pot of ink drenched from the head, another black color spread from the head of the ***. In the sound of a "kal", the body's bones stretched and it was more than three inches tall. The sickle that never leaves the hand squirms and grows like a living thing. From time to time, white carrion-like substances are turned out from the inside, and then it becomes black and hard, forming a new layer of sickle. A burst of joy passed from the *** to Rogge's mind. Rogge only has a bitter smile. Which of the books can be written with undead creatures will also have joys and sorrows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is a dream, let me wake up soon!" the fat man groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black mist emerged from the body, and some zombies around him slowly stood up. At this time, Rogge noticed that there were more than a dozen zombies on the ground next to the ***, one of which was still a zombie warrior, and each wound on the body was deeply visible. A group of death energy came out of the ***, and the existing zombies were blown up and the carrion flew around. The pale flames of the underworld ignited from the feet of the ***, and quickly expanded into a 10-meter-long fire ring. The zombies in the fire circle were burned out quickly, leaving only a few bits of light shining. up in the air. These substances slowly gather together to form a piece of nail size. Rogge's mental power gently stretched over and touched the substance. The little thing immediately twitched, and it continued to expand. Finally, it became a very thin film. It floated over and covered it, slowly dissolved into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The death sickle also stopped growing, the sickle at this time, thicker, half longer, full of more than four meters long, shape ferocious. There was always a dark red electric fire from the tip of the knife to the handle, shot out, and a small pit of light smoke on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A scream, of course, is silent. However, Rogge listened to his spiritual strength. This whistle sounded like a yellow scorpion, and it was as sweet as a breeze. It’s just that this mental power oscillation is really big. It’s like a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The sickle pointed to the sky, staring at a black mountain looming in the distant gray. Rogge once again sensed the ancient existence. As the mental power increases, the fatter person feels the unfathomable strength of existence. However, the *** has already rushed in the foot, and the back of the bones is full, just like the wind, and jumps up, it is just a little more than a dozen feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the twinkling of an eye, it has reached the place where the last time Yu Yu came. The zombies were drilled from the soil in 66. This time it was the three zombie warriors. At the moment of the war, Rogge concentrated on concentrating his mental strength and aligning the energy cores of the three zombie warriors with three mental impacts. The three groups of energy suddenly lit up, like the candle in the wind, is on the verge of extinction. ***The huge sickle with a purple electric fire, draws a perfect arc, directly squatting the two zombie warriors in front, the third zombie warrior is weaker, and the energy core is directly destroyed by Rogge. Falling on the ground does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black air is filled with a heart-rending whistling dance, and all kinds of zombie limbs are scattered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, the endless zombies are coming out of the soil, crowded, rubbed, slowly pressed up, as if they were a zombie ocean ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
