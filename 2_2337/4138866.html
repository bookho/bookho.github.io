			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the five chapters flying over the mountains<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章五飞越山<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern autumn, the southern climate is still very hot. After the fall of the South, if it is sultry, it will often be more difficult than the summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is hot in the air, lazily smashing through the streets of Lille. A large tree planted for hundreds of years swayed yellowish foliage in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, there will be a leaf falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Lille, the most magnificent building today is the St. Paul Cathedral, which has just been completed. This church represents the supreme achievement of the southern architectural art, the most striking of which is the towering church spire. Hundreds of angels with different expressions crouched, worshipped, and stood on top of the golden spires, among them, standing on the gods overlooking the beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the highest point of the church is the Pope’s prayer room, which is where he listens to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, standing in front of the long window, the pope is standing thin and dry, like a candle in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has begun to slant westward, a little red sun over the pope's skinny body, casting a long shadow on the scarlet carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the prayer room was opened, and the heavy armor of Augustus came in. He walked to the Pope, and the time spent and the space spanned by each step were exactly the same, measured by any scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same sunset, Augustus' projection was much shorter than the Pope's shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an invisible wind that has passed through the long window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A leaf in the wind hovered and finally hit the long window. Bounced back, and was carried by the wind, flying away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is unable to blow through the long window, but the pope behind the window, the robes are fluttering in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind is up..." The Pope seemed to mutter. Occasionally, he will cough twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the Pope slowly said: “Augustus. What did you see?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel replied: "A fallen leaf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The blood angel carefully considered the words and said: "I saw the wind want to tear the leaves. But in the end, it can only be sent to the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Nodded, coughed for a while, then gasped: "You are right. In fact, if there is no wind, the leaves will naturally fall to the ground, and finally the dust will return to the dust, the soil is soil. But the wind is unwilling to stop. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus did not answer. He is waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the pope sighed heavily and said: "The wind is big, it seems that winter is coming. Hey, I am old, one winter. "There are all the problems in the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus is careful: "Charlie is dead. Maybe, we should regenerate for the coming winter." On the last fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope slowly said: "Even God can't master all the tributaries of fate. We are just mortals. How can we master the world? Everything changes? Augustus, arrogance is sin, we must learn to admit defeat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel bowed his head and said with respect: "I wrote down But the north..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope said: "North... let's put it first! The time is almost up, we should go to meet the servant of the Lord God." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the pope and the blood angel entered, the space door disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the space door, it is a very strange space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge hall, a palace that is beyond human imagination! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the hall are up to 100 meters high and the square is several kilometers. There is no roof on the temple. From the bottom, I see only a void, no sun, no moon, no endless stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the hall. Still a void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope and the Blood Angel appear in the center of the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope is walking in the void. Walk slowly forward. Under his feet, there seems to be a layer of invisible ground. Supported the body that has been through the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of pale blue crystal tables in the center of the main hall. They are lined up in a ring, enclosing a stone altar in the center. There is a person lying on each crystal table. These people look very young and have a perfect body. It’s just that they all fall into the deepest sleep, they don’t move, they just sleep on the crystal table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time we have prepared sixty bodies, should it be enough?" Augustus asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope smiled slightly and said: "This time it is coming, but the servants around the Lord God, sixty bodies may not be enough. You are still in the heavens If you don't look up to their light, then you should also hear their names. I heard that this time MGM and Macbeth are coming..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus has raised his eyebrows and said with surprise: "They are not the angels in front of the seat of Fleet Mill, the god of order and justice? Why are they coming? Is it..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel involuntarily lowered the voice and said: "Is it for O'Reilly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Coughing up violently, it took half a day to calm down. He continually said: "The brilliance of the heavens is too strong for my old man, oh! This time I will come, I heard that there is another angel called Achilles..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Achilles!" Hearing this name, even Augustus lost his calm. "Is he? Why did he come to this world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Achilles...." The Pope read it low and then asked faintly Dao: "Does anything special about him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustus said: "He...he is at the same time with O'Reilly in Tiratt After the birth of the great man, the Tiratemis adults have been concentrating on perfecting O'Reilly, and since the moment of birth, Achilles has descended to other planes to spread to the glory of the High God."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pause, Augustus’s voice was slightly trembling, and said: "At the time of my reincarnation, Achilles... already nearly 100 The planes are attributed to the highest honors..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s long eyebrows moved for a moment, and then faintly said: "Time is up, ready to meet Three adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky at the top of the hall suddenly lights up an electric light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, another long lightning struck the entire void, and then numerous tiny electric lights bloom in the sky, like an empty fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void of infinity. It seems that a gate has quietly opened. Perhaps because of the distance, look up from the hall. Only one faint light spot can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, suddenly the sacred song of the sky indicates that it is not an illusion, and there is indeed a door that has been opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the voice of the gates of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two light spots fly out of the gates of heaven, and appear in the center of the hall in an instant. It can be seen at the moment that this is two faint angel images. They have four wings, no entity at all, only a shadow. Despite this, they still have a sacred atmosphere and a majestic look down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trepidation stems from the huge difference in the ranks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the reincarnation, the shudders of Augustus’ souls to the high-level angels of heaven have weakened a lot. But the fear and obedience to the superior has been imprinted in his soul. In this world, although the blood angel has successfully broken through the limits of power, he has a powerful combat power. His combat power is likely to be stronger than the two high-ranking angels who are about to come, but this imprint imprinted on the core of the soul cannot be removed as the power grows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seemingly calm blood angel, but shivering slightly. Only the pope. Standing there trembled, not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the feelings of Augustus, the old man who is going to be a wood is still nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that he is standing there, but as long as Augustus closes his eyes, he will feel that there is a blank in front of him, and there is no creature at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A screaming scream interrupted Augustus’s thoughts. He smiled a little bit. Look around. I saw a young woman who had jumped out of the crystal stage. Her hands clenched her throat and slammed forward, always making a heartbreaking scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a thin bloodline in her facial features, which looks very horrible, but she seems to be ignorant, just trying to grab her throat with her hand. It won't stop until the skin is rotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last scream is particularly fierce, this young woman. This woman who is covered in blood. It has already burst into a bloody fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blood mist, the illusion of the four-winged angels slowly emerged. He is still just a phantom. The young woman’s blood mist is completely out of him. The two pairs of slowly fluttering light wings are elegant and elegant. Each feather consisting of pale gold shimmer is as soft as a wave of water, swaying in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four wings of the angel are slightly fanned, and the strong sacred breath immediately simmers the blood around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and flew into the body of a young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first time MGM Grand came to the sixth time, Macbeth came to the ninth time..." Augustus was silent in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent is finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After failing for 16 times, MGM finally succeeded in the body of a man in the seventeenth time. This body looks tall, handsome, strong, and almost perfect. MGM extended his index finger and ignited a sacred flame on his fingertips. He immediately wrote the rules of heaven in the air, and the beautiful and mysterious words were condensed in the air for a long time, and there was a majestic and low voice, which could not reflect the content of the laws of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, a heavenly rule has been written. It seems that MGM is very happy with her new body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Macbeth also finished. This is the twenty-fifth body he tried. From the outside, this is a man with a little bit of murder. As a routine after the fall, he also has to try a little bit of the power that the new body can accommodate and exert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth, one finger, one finger, clear, and a loud light beam instantly penetrated the endless void of the hall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the faces of the gods in the light column! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus nodded secretly. The lowest-order adventurous angel has only one chance to try to come. If it is not successful, they are fortunate enough to return to heaven, return to the most primitive state, and wait for the recovery of power. Those who are unfortunate will return to nothingness with the destruction of the coming body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while MGM and Macbeth have gone down dozens of times without incident, it seems that if they are unsuccessful, they can continue to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pity that these bodies..." Augustus sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
