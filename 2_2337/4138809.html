			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of the North is vigorous and rugged. Even with Richreu, known for its historical and artistic atmosphere, the architectural style is still dominated by tall and majestic. However, the city of the gods, which is not known to the world, has the exquisiteness and beauty that is incompatible with the whole of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this summer season, the elves have no need to spend energy to regulate the temperature of the city of the gods, so the elves use the extra energy to add a lot of war facilities. After all, the current tranquility of the city of the gods is only the appearance, who knows how much undercurrent will there be under the calm sea? It’s just that the elves love the beauty of nature again, and they decorate these war facilities as works of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of the gods in the faint morning light is like a beautiful woman standing on the edge of the blue lake and the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this morning, the invisible wind is not the admirer of this beauty, but the death god who is ready to spread death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the solemn and singular Nicholas has come to the city of the gods, his feet are like a step of the wind, gradually getting higher, even so Step by step, step by step, the city of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure shook slightly in a strange way, just avoiding the eyes of all the elves. In fact, the spectators of the elves mostly subconsciously avoided the trajectory of his advancement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the city, Nicholas did not stop. The higher he went, the more he went to the center of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this time of the spy, Nicholas has been convinced that the elves in this city must be associated with the death of Kris Felena. Now the mysterious Hughes is no longer in the Elf City, and this good opportunity can no longer be lost once it is lost. So he is no longer ready to explore the real role of the elf in this matter, just want to start the massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it is related to the death of Kris Felena, he will be destroyed one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas suddenly slammed into the middle of the city of the gods in the air, and his fingertips also had a slight tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the square under the three old trees, a huge silver dragon is quietly lying there. She floated freely, and the faucet stretched out in the direction of the small lake. It seemed to be looking at the blue lake, and it seemed to enjoy the cool summer wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crisis...Ferrena..." Nicholas groaned involuntarily, his body was faltering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas almost exhausted the power of his life to stop himself from rushing over. He stared at him and saw more than a dozen elves busy around the huge body of Yinlong, who seemed to be cleaning up her body and scales. These elves work in a meticulous and serious manner, and the scales are carefully cleaned up, without any urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas quietly stands in the air, letting time pass, rising sun and sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena still quietly swaying, motionless, seems to fall into a deep sleep. In fact, she can't move either. She is just a statue, a huge, lifelike, and I don’t know how much the elf artist spent so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the afterglow of the setting sun was dimmed, these serious elves completed the cleanup work and returned happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the statue of Yinlong, there will always be some young elves gathered, they are looking at the beautiful giant silver dragon, listening to the years over and over again. The long elves tell stories and legends about the silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is drooping, and the beautiful city of the gods is gradually quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas slowly falls in front of Chris Ferrena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue of Yinlong is a masterpiece of the gods. Her gaze seemed to move slowly with Nicholas, and her eyes seemed to be sad, confidant, and happy. Nicholas suddenly stunned, almost thinking that Cris Ferrena was resurrected in front of herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long can you live with many powerful enemies? Nicholas didn't know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes, trembled and reached out, trying to touch the statue of Kris Felena, but in the end...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in the end, Nicholas still failed Courage. He would rather believe that he would rather believe that Cris Ferrena is sleeping in the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this sleep has no end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver ray rises into the sky, accompanied by Nicholas’s terrifying shout! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the elves and old trees are shuddering in the whistling sound, and the calm lake has also set off a huge wave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, all the sleeping elves are awakened, they don’t know why, they are in the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few drops of water falling in the sky, and the water drops gradually bloom with brilliant brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves suddenly had a illusion of the line, and they saw that in the shadow of the seven-color brilliance, Kris Felena had a life. She seems to look up at the direction of silver light, reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two figures appeared in one window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He finally left..." The voice of the Death Class was much older than before. After Ai Luoote stepped into the blue water, he was suddenly old. Same as a teenager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes..." Hughes looked at the place where the silver light disappeared, and his face had no smug expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the statue? Is it going to cost a lot of magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of silence, Hughes slowly said: "Keep it so good. If everything is over, if he can survive, there will be a place to be trusted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are blazing flames everywhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an ordinary flame, but a magical power that is great enough to bind all souls! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flames, countless souls are crying, screaming, and struggling. They desperately fled back and forth in the flames, but in any case they could not escape the shackles of the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flames are gradually extinguished, these desperate souls are gradually dragged into the ground by the flames. Their pain does not diminish as the flames go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blazing flame, standing is a stunning girl. Her gorgeous long skirt was ruptured in many places, and the exposed skin had scratches and blocks of bruising. Although she is still young, she is completely a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul in the flame is not struggling, the smile of her mouth is more and more obvious, more and more charming. In the end, she laughed happily, and the green eyes reflected the blazing flame and countless suffering souls! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was a whirlwind...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya woke up, her head still hurts It’s amazing. It was hard to see that Roger was in front of him, and he still could not shake himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat, you always figured it out! Going all day and night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Nodded: "Fortunately, everything went well. Frosty 匕 also found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where? Let me see!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "You can't see it now. It's in the body of Amorro, this is the most important part of the seal. Can you take it out now? Moro will be able to resume his activities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stood up and saw a team of soldiers under the command of the elf engineering staff to dig the passage . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they doing?" The goblin is still a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat man, don't you just put it alone? You said, how many things have you hidden in the end? Didn't tell me?" The little demon slammed the meat on the waist of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Receiving?" Rogge laughed and said: "I didn't accept it. We just negotiated the conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half of the surviving soldiers are digging in the tunnel and half are cleaning up the exit. Half a day has passed, the passage has not been dug up, and the exit has been cleaned up first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned in the middle of the corpse in the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these bodies have begun to rot, they still can see the terrible bites and scratches on them. The scent of the wind made the wind butterfly boring, but she still insisted on following Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the enemies?" She opened her mouth and smothered her body and completely interrupted her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge bent down, regardless of the dirty smell, torn open a corpse of clothes, looking at the rotten wound. He stood up for a long time, and naturally it was inevitably exuding a thick scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and walked outside the military camp, saying: "The wounded are not ordinary beasts, only Druid can summon And the beast that controls so many variations. It seems that the one who is preparing to ambush us outside the stone palace must be Druid. As for him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge Frowning, slowly said: "He is already dead. This time is not an ordinary Druid, at least one of them is an elder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind butterfly His face was pale and he gnawed his teeth: "So... what about Druid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They may be dead, maybe ran." Rogge suddenly flashed in his head. After *** the right hand wrapped around the light smoke, said: "It should all die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is silent, just follow Rogge Behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the corpse is everywhere, the goblin is determined not to enter. She looked at Rogge on the way, and immediately covered her nose and shouted: "Leave me away! Wash it again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog With a faint smile, while walking to Fu Luoya, the body could not keep a black flame, and finally the flame of the devil burned his clothes cleanly, and the nasty odor disappeared naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin was reddish on his face, throwing a robes to Rogge who had only one silver dragon arm left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes slowly swept through the ruined stone palace, the surrounding forest, and his face became more and more gloomy. He is not sure whether Druid is still hidden in the forest. It’s just that since the outside person said that she came to deal with it, then there should be no more enemies around the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s attacks on these times are very hot and effective. If it’s not a long time without news, then this stone palace will be the third. The grave of more than a thousand people. Even if Rogge is likely to escape, others will not be spared, and the frost will fall into the hands of Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, those captives are asking to leave, you see?" The officer's request pulled Rogge's thoughts back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked over and saw that the more than a dozen of the restless Druids were gathering together and looking at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't let them go!" The cold voice of Wind Butterfly gave Rogge a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and saw the eyes of the wind butterfly staring at the Druid warrior with hate, her hand holding the wheel saw tightly, not Live and tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge grabbed the wind butterfly that was about to rush out and frowned. "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill these Druids!" Wind butterfly gnashed his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: "They are only the lowest-ranking warriors, and it’s useless to kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge turned and yelled at the Druids who were waiting for the fate to pronounce: "I promised to let you free, and I will fulfill my promise! Go back and tell the Druids of the Cloud City." We don't want to be enemies with them, don't force me again! If they are willing to go their own way, don't let you die again. Next time, I am not so polite! Let me roll now!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly stopped crying, she stared at the back of the Druid warrior, coldly said to Rogge: "Are you really ready to reconcile with these Druids? If In this way, can you please lift our contract, I go to the city of Yunxiao!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles...maybe? I just want the Druids to discuss the discussion, so that we can delay the time. At the moment, we are too passive. What's more, what is the meaning of killing these little soldiers, how can you kill several elders in order to let Druid know the pain! Wind butterfly, you follow me with one heart and one mind, one day, I will take you to the city of the clouds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly gently bites the lower lip and slowly nods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the day, the passage in the stone palace was wide enough and wide, and the body of the Amorro was finally removed from the stone palace. But the dense forest around it was a bigger obstacle. Rogge commanded the soldiers. Xun opened the road in the forest, and sent a fire to the Grand Duke of Doriak, asking him to increase his troops and monitor the changes in all the Druids in the province.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge also sent a team of elves to inform the Eye of Wisdom, and let them send the eyes of Amorro to Dresden as soon as possible, where he will meet with the eyes of the eyes of wisdom.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the huge body of Amorro and sneered at it inconspicuously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea of ​​Consciousness .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the battle was exceptionally long, and the tenacity of the *** even made Weiner feel unbearable.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of God has entered Very dangerous state, the two had to stop. The attitude after the battle was different, this time they all looked very embarrassed, the dim light in the eyes, the original gold and black as the mirror is also messy. People looked at each other for a while and began to organize their own appearances in unison.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Awkwardly wrinkled, staring at the busy Wella, She instinctively felt that Wella was planning something. But although she had control of the origin of God, her understanding of the origin of God was too little and too little, so she could not know the idea of ​​Wella. It is also impossible to explore the power and skills of Wella. Only in the battle with Wella can *** observe and comprehend Wella's unfathomable combat skills.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Their battles stop, the power of God's origin begins to recover bit by bit. Another invisible battle begins. Every time the source of God restores a little energy, *** and Wella will compete at the same time. Fortunately, in the battle for the origin of God's energy, *** does not fall, even In order to have control, we must have a slight advantage. Even so, in the face of Wei Na’s endless and ever-changing combat skills, *** can only barely support it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The preoccupation of the energy of the source of God, Wella is constantly busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea of ​​consciousness, a big battle has just subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is surprisingly long, and Wella is also amazed by the *** this time, she has gradually felt that *** is more and more difficult to cope. Until the origin of God was in a state of collapse, the two had to stop and face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the intensity of the battle is going to be more than ever, and they all seem awkward, whether it is gold or black, no longer as smooth as the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second woman looked at each other and untiedly arranged her appearance. In the sea of ​​consciousness, their image is the projection of consciousness. The reason why there is a wolf, is because the origin of God is no longer stable after the fierce battle. But they can still restore the elegance and beauty of the grooming by adjusting the energy by themselves. Since Wella ridiculed the appearance of *** after a battle, like the colorful world, beauty has become another battlefield for them to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pause in their battle, and the energy of God’s origin began to recover. An invisible battle around these new energies exploded again. In terms of competing for energy, it is only on this, and *** is not at a disadvantage. Even because of the control of God's source, she still has a slight advantage. However, in the face of Verna's endless and unpredictable fighting art, *** is able to support it every time. But Wella can't subdue ***, with her fighting instinct from the light angels, and can't explain why *** has such an indestructible will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The eyes slowly closed, and began to fight for the energy of God's origin wholeheartedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why must you be so serious?" Weina chuckled and said: "So want the source of God's energy... then I will divide you a little better!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***After the eyes opened slightly, and swiftly glanced at Wella, they closed again. Regardless of how Wella is provocative, *** completely ignores it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena can not be as serious as ***, she absorbs the origin of God, while provocatively ***, still non-stop Busy and busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands are gracefully changing in the air with countless complex gestures, and a golden cloud of light between hands is changing. Every time Weina weaves a gesture, hundreds of tiny golden symbols will burst out of the clouds of light and slowly fly to the endless void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the golden light cloud, Wella is like a god of creation, spreading a cluster of stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** faintly feels that Wella seems to have been planning something, but she can only tell from the golden symbol of Wella that she is reading God. The memory in the source, the rest can not be seen. Since that day, when Weina went to save Rogge and expel Druid, she became mysterious. If you intentionally or unintentionally reveal a little smug to know that it is what Wei Na really has, it is still making a mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t understand, *** simply don’t think about it. This dreamy and beautiful little man has an indescribable attachment. She just can't absorb the energy of God's origin, and remember the fighting skills that Weina used. *** I firmly believe that as long as Weina is completely defeated in the battle of the sea of ​​consciousness, then everything she planned will lose its meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cala is a medium-sized city in Layton and the city with the most eye-seekers of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really late at night, and the excited Kara city slowly returns to calm. Today, the holy woman Mora of the Eye of Wisdom once again came to the city of Kara, who was taken care of by God, and personally blessed nearly ten believers and prayed to the goddess on their behalf. Every believer in the Eye of Wisdom knows that being able to participate in the religious ceremony hosted by the Virgin Mora is definitely an indescribable and profound experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is faith? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believers may not be able to explain, but they can say with certainty that having faith is a kind of happiness, and having faith is unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kara City, the Temple of Wisdom has a large scale, although it is still not possible with the big religions such as the Silver Religion and the Cloud City. Compared with the temple, it is the most magnificent building in Kara, whether it is from the magnificent momentum, the huge architectural complex or the breadth of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prayer room at the back of the temple, the saint of Mora, who is in white robe, is kneeling alone in front of the altar, silently burning on the altar. The magic flame that does not go out is praying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, her abilities have grown significantly, but the ceremonies of the size of today are still exhausting all her power. Despite her exhaustion, she still insists on a daily prayer. For Mora, the belief in the goddess O'Reilly is now her everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the entire prayer room was quietly shrouded in a mysterious golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for Mora, the dazzling mysterious light almost gilded everything in the prayer room. An indescribable majestic atmosphere quietly descended in the prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's gold fluttered slowly, and she stood up involuntarily, staring at the magical flame that had completely turned into gold on the altar. Mora only felt that a heart almost stopped beating. In the face of this golden light, she feels so humble, so small, so insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to stand so close to the golden flame is already a supreme glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora is reluctant to suppress the urge to almost faint, slowly stumble, stretch out his arms to the golden flame, and seek the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora stared at the words in the flame and engraved it in the deepest part of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slight footstep sounded at the side of the Mora, and she suddenly knew that the sudden footsteps came from hundreds of meters and had not yet stepped. Enter the gate of the temple. And Mora knows that the owner of the footsteps is Elder Calmon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the goddess rewarding my faith and giving me new abilities?" Mora thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elders of Calmon stepped into the prayer room, the golden light of the room was exhausted, but the power of the supernatural beings overlooking the dust and souls was still there, and deep The deep earthquake took the soul of Calmon! He was soft on his knees and couldn't help but kneel down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Mora... Goddess, have you just arrived?" Calmon’s voice was shaking, and he experienced the coming of the goddess several times, almost every time. The ability to lose action and even speech under the pressure of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora still stares at the beating magical flame, and it takes a long time to slowly say: "Yes. The goddess of the goddess is stronger than ever."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the gods of O'Reilly in the prayer room have slowly dispersed, and Carmon has acted as usual. He carefully said: "Ms. Mora, Rogge just sent A secret letter came. He has found the body of Amorro, asking you to send the eye of Amorro to Dresden, where he will meet with our people."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's body trembled lightly, but Carmon, who looked down, didn't notice it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Mora, though... although Roger is particularly favored by the goddess, he also donated a large sum of money to the church, but he is not wisdom after all. Believers in the eye. Moreover, the eye of the Amoro is the god that we used to create the eye of wisdom. Just such a letter, is it really sent to him? You see..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora seems to sigh with a sigh of relief, faintly said: "I will personally send the eyes of the Amorro to Dresden."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," said Elder Carmon, strangely: "If you are gone, who will preside over the two exhibitions for the next week?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment of work, Mora has restored the sacred nobleness of the weekdays and calmly said: "Cancel it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..." Carmon wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Mora: "Elder Karlon, you have to arrange my trip, I have to go out at night."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon had to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's money went out, she suddenly stopped when she passed by Elder Calmon, gently said: "Be able to give everything to the goddess, is a believer The highest glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmon looked at the back of Mora, and he was puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the distant place, there are also believers who are praying to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same temple, the same place to serve God, but the grandeur of this mysterious hall has become more than any temple on the 6th, even the Great Shrine of the Bright Church Not too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magical flame of illumination in this hall, but the soft silver light that does not know where it shines shines through everything in the temple. All the furnishings in the temple are extremely tall, and the three gates are each 20 meters high. However, in this huge hall of 50 meters in length and nearly 400 meters in length and width, all the huge facilities are not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the huge altar, a devout figure. The sun rises at sunset, the moon and the moon faint, and it has no idea how long it has been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure seems to be very weak, always shaking, seems to fall at any time, but it is still insisting, insisting on waiting for God to give Its icon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the side of the temple was quietly opened. A tall figure slowly entered the temple. Everything in this temple is communicated in spirit, so no matter how many believers are present, the temple is always quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the sly figure answered, and its voice contained a weakness that could not be concealed: "I know. But I can't believe it, and I can't accept the fate revealed in the gods. I don't want to, I need an answer!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have strength and wisdom, but our strength and wisdom are still not enough to free us from the shackles of the river of destiny. God is omnipotent, its gaze The more we can understand the scope. The fate will not change. Give up, my child! So you can keep God's care!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will never give up!" The figure of Yan firmly replied: "If God can't change his fate, then I will change it myself! Even if every tributary of the river of fate points to the same end, I would rather be bruised and rushed by the river. To the end! It’s better than smashing and drifting!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft silver light in the hall suddenly brightened and dazzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver light is getting brighter and brighter, and then the whole hall is starting to shake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My child, due to your call, God is coming again. But... if you give up now, maybe you still have time!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will never give up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple suddenly shook, and the huge altar collapsed! Suddenly, the silver mans that are blind to the blind suddenly came out with a silent, but directly shaken soul roar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then everything was quiet, the silver faded, and the huge temple fell into total darkness like never before. After a while, the four amber lights slowly light up, which is the light emitted by their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God is angry, it revokes our asylum. My child, you know what it means!" The voice of the elders became harsh, But it also contains infinite pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;匍匐 The figure stood up and firmly said: "I know. I will pay for my sin. From now on, I give up my faith and Be prepared to withstand the wrath of the gods. Please find a new prophet for God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes to the gate of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My child! The gods have revealed what kind of path you are going now! The end of the road is pain, indulgence and destruction! Endless flames will burn your soul forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." It firmly walked out of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took for a long sigh in the temple: "Is this the pain of the prophet..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is very happy now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not without troubles and pains. In fact, his troubles and pains may be more than most people, and he is more than most creatures. many. It’s just that he is very positive about the way he treats suffering. The fat can be passed on to others, and the fat man does not hesitate. If you really can't pass it, then start to solve it. If you can't solve it temporarily, then try to improve your strength and wait for it to be resolved in the future. In the heart of the fat man, power, wealth and personal strength are all part of the power. Absolute power can solve most of the troubles, this is the fat creed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly appeared, he has gradually become somewhat the same as ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who can’t solve the problem with powerful power...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to hell!" The fat man thought happily. All in all, depression because of pain is a too extravagant thing, he would rather struggle, vent, and never refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is very happy every time he successfully completes one thing. Sometimes, he even wants to be grateful, but he can't find the object of gratitude. So the fat man with a thick face immediately attributes everything to his wise god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, looking at the eyes of the faint halo of the Amorro, Rogge is more enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge Amorro eye is half a meter long, with a pale blue color, among which is a blood-red eyelid, and the middle of the eyelid is a deep black, narrow and long Beast-like pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult Rogge, if you touch the eye of Amoro for too long, it will damage your body." Mora was soft and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughs and laughs, the power of the Amorro will not hurt me now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora further asked: "I heard that you have found the body of Amorro, but I did not feel the breath of it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "You certainly can't feel it." I have already shipped it to the city of the gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So how do you plan to deal with the eye of Amorro? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated. He suddenly remembered O'Reilly, and his heart whispered a few times. One mouth is the truth: "I want to take this." Things also get back to the city of the gods, and then, resurrect the Amorro. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But," Mora said: "To deal with the Amorro... you must be careful!" It may be remorseful. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "Mora, you have changed a lot!" Amorro is the earliest god you served, and now you actually evaluate it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora gently smiled. At this moment, Rogge suddenly had some illusions that the whole room suddenly lit up, and the light was so soft, Mora's sweet voice has also become erratic, as it has come from outside the sky: "I only believe in the goddess O'Reilly. Amorro is just a false god, and its true identity is the Mozu. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came to Rogge. The white robe fluttered with the swaying steps, and there was always a fascinating curve. It’s rare to talk about the figure and the appearance. Perhaps it is the long time of serving the goddess O'Reilly. She has become a mixture of holiness and sorrow. Every step of Mora seems to be aroused for a while. Invisible embarrassment, unconsciously infiltrated Rogge's heart defense. Rogge remembered the night when he first met Mora, remembering her bloody body.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood behind Rogge and put him in the chair, and said: "I have more changes! You must be too busy and too tired, so you have never noticed these little things. I have a way to ease your fatigue. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, not to mention Rogge, her pair of hands have covered Rogge's forehead, and the fingers are gently passing from his forehead, cheeks, neck, Then, he sneaked into Rogge's neckline and gently pressed his chest muscles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtle ice and cold energy could not escape from her fingertips into Rogge The skin of Rogge is very unexpected about Mora’s sudden intimacy, but since it comes from the great beauty of Mora, the fat man will only welcome this intimacy. The cold energy of the Mob’s fingertips is very comfortable and will He couldn't help but stir up the heat and let him relax completely. Rogge's spirit has become a little slow, and he doesn't want to think too much, just want to enjoy this moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completely relaxed, his body leaned back and leaned on Mora. Mora smiled lightly and did not avoid it. Under her thin robe, Rogge could feel the softness. Boneless body and soft skin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly held the pair The slender hand that walked in his robes, pulling hard, Mora exclaimed, and involuntarily leaned down and fell on the shoulders of Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge was hot, he took Mora's little face and kissed her lips. Mora struggled, but where is her opponent of Rogge's brute force? So she escaped without a door and was kissed. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man reached out and simply took Mora’s entire body over and put it on his lap, and one hand went to her robes. Go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's body collapsed instantly and then relaxed. She opened her mouth slightly and let Rogge explore the fragrance inside, then bite it in there. The unscrupulous tongue. The fat man couldn't help but whisper, although Mora did not bite his tongue, but the pain was still very painful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunity, Mora suddenly pushed Rogge away and escaped from his claws.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at the panicked, unrelenting Mora The body was more blazing fire him could not help but frowned: "You seduce me! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, it seems that something suddenly exploded in Rogge's brain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and stared at Mora’s bare legs and said slowly: “This game is very interesting, I like it! You flee, I see you can Where to escape! You can also call, but no one will help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora whispered, took the leg back, tried hard The broken long robes were used to cover the exposed long legs, but a pair of white calves and bare feet could not be covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is in the eyes of Rogge, but it is actually more tempting. He began to approach Mora step by step, and Mora was like a helpless weak woman, pale blue eyes staring at Rogge with fear, and could not move backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those pale blue eyes, some are actually only provocative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s thinking has been slow. As far as the instinct of the fat man is concerned, in the face of the provocation of the weak, there has always been only one solution, that is, suppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Mora has retired and is desperately shrinking to the corner, but her pale blue eyes are still provocative. Rogge slowly crouched in front of Mola, who was almost to be shrunk. In her almost desperate exclamation, she reached out and caught her with a soft, hydrated foot...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake in the sea of ​​consciousness has a burst of ripples, and the rapid expansion of the lake has turned into a huge wave. The entire Golden Lake seems to be boiling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The silver plaque slowly opened and asked: "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Wella did not answer, but asked: "Do you want to know what is coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The right fist is lifted, the delicate little hand has already Covered with a layer of silver light: "Werner, no matter what you are doing, stop immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina smiled and said: "The origin of God has not recovered yet. Now, do you want to do it? Well, if you want to know this, then I won’t marry you. Should you care about the coordinates?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;*** snoring, eyes closed slightly, spin and open, cold and authentic: "What did you do to Mora?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Wella didn't pay attention to the problem of ***, just said: "No matter what I did, now you want to stop it is too late. Now there is still time, I will first explain to you what is coming. For the heavens Said that the effect of the coming Reincarnation is much more powerful, but it is also much more dangerous. Before the advent, the angel must first choose a body that can withstand the powerful energy generated by the coming, and this body will be able to shed the power that the angel should have in the future. Once the body is chosen, the angel will restore itself to the most primitive state of energy in the heavens, then enter the new body and expel the original soul of the new body. For those lower angels, because the power is lost too fast, they can maintain The time of the source state is very short. The process of expelling or destroying the soul of the new body is also very difficult, and it also consumes a lot of energy, especially when the soul of the new body is tenacious. Therefore, the early attempts to come down are low. Most of the angels died in the process of advancing because of the exhaustion of power, and those who succeeded very much could not completely expel the soul of the original Lord. The new body became a cage for them...."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfinished Weina, *** has already hit the punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner’s smile suddenly disappeared, and her voice was full of cold ice: “***, you have no chance!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands are moving in the air of time and space, and one after another powerful indescribable spells are coming to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's icy voice echoed over the mad roaring Golden Lake: "Time and space, out of order, time and space, and souls!" "In the last sentence, she pointed to the volley!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly, I have already moved, and my body has become a virtual shadow that is close to transparency. She clearly knows that the space in the sea of ​​consciousness has produced unimaginable changes, and her soul is in a mysterious, uncontrollable state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Just calmly said: "Yes? I see how long you can support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't take long, just for a while."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***It’s cold and cold: “I am waiting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena’s image is beating blurry, Obviously, in order to cast the series of horrible spells, she almost exhausted her strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn’t take it easy, just stroking the face of her face, softly said: "Let’s continue to say come. Because of the fall All kinds of restrictions and dangers, the new arrival angels are very weak. Later, in order to thoroughly explore the limitations and dangers in the coming, the Lord God appointed me to be created, and I came to that world. The advent is dangerous, but relying on the battle instinct of the light angels. Huge strength, I can easily deal with all this. At that time, my new body was perfect, but the will is very strong. Just before I completely destroyed the soul, I met Rodriguez."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina laughs or not... Hey! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have much time. ***Hold her coldly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is not afraid of mysterious smile, what are you worried about? Do you think that I am temporarily banned? You, but in fact, can't you take it? But after a while, you will have feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's robes have been torn by Rogge Tattered, revealing a large piece of white and dazzling skin. But the fat man deliberately does not completely tear off Mora's robes, so that the nakedness of the flicker will more stimulate his nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora screamed sharply, screaming and screaming under the body of Rogge, blocking his hands without evil, and not fighting Rogge Mouth, sometimes begging for mercy, sometimes threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Rogge, these are temptations, naked temptations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora is like a big fish that doesn’t slip, so he must fight the whole spirit to prevent her from escaping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game has been running for a long time. Rogge suddenly held down Mora's swaying waist and slowly pressed it up! Mora struggled and shunned frantically, but the room for activity was too small to stop his tough invasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She changed her face, followed by a frowning, painful screaming, ten nails deeply inserted into Rogge's skin... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea of ​​Consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake that is boiling is suddenly smooth as a mirror...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge water column And start to drown *** completely! Wella pulled back and escaped the water column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pain that is hard to resist hits the soul of the ***, but there is an indescribable feeling in the pain. It feels like a spring rain, but it can't resist, quietly eroding every corner of her soul. *** I only feel that power is inexplicably lost, and all this is out of her understanding. *** Finally, there was some panic, and there was a strange feeling in the depths of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A clear drink, there are countless thin bands of light around the body. These light belts are flickering under the impact of her unstoppable, and there will always be a light rain that bursts into the sky. In a blink of an eye, the right hand of *** has broken through the bondage of the optical network! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waves have retreated, and the lake has returned to calm. However, Wella appeared above the ***, she reached out and pressed, the light net returned to stability, and the body of the *** was slowly pressed into the golden lake. Outside the optical network, the right hand of *** wants to grab the hand of Wella, but the distance of this number seems to be never reachable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake is calm, but under the surface of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of strange feelings can not help the soul of the *** as the road can not help. The pain contained in the undercurrent has been alleviated a lot, but the sourness, pain, and itching, accompanied by resolute dedication, doubts and remorse, and vague satisfaction, almost made her unable to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original...this is the case!" *** thought slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge wave suddenly vacated without warning! *** couldn't help but tremble, her resistance was weakened a bit, and the imprisoned light net stabilized and once again sneaked into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge waves will also overwhelm Wella. But when the waves receded, I saw that Wei Na was covered with a faint mask of light, blocking the lake from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, after another, the huge waves surged rhythmically, seemingly the tide of never ending. In the waves and undercurrents of the interaction, *** endured hard, and Wella, protected by the mask, was safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blackness of the lake has already drifted away. Her small mouth is slightly open, the silver awns in her eyes fluctuate wildly, and her body is staggeringly hot. From time to time there will be a large group of golden mist sprayed out of the lake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s mouth floated with a triumphant smile or gave up resistance! Being able to experience the experience of coming in advance, this is a precious opportunity that has never been seen before! If we can find the right body, we can completely get rid of the bondage of this abandoned land and return to the world again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and said: "Although you want to let me sleep forever, but we are born after all, as long as you obey me, I It won't destroy you. Moreover, I will also lead you to the light angel battle instinct, then you can use my ability. For example, the Guardian of Light Angels I use now. This is close to the perfect defense! When you have finished this ‘falling’, you will have feelings and your will will no longer be indestructible. At that time, I want to erase your existence, it will not be a difficult thing. You can't fight me, ***, give up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Mora is sweating, but her eyes are still staring straight at Rogge's eyes. In that gaze, in addition to provocation, it is still provocative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger snorted, and with the special ability of this World of Warcraft, he still didn’t believe that he couldn’t clean up this kind of Mora, who hated his teeth. He started to The spirit is condensed in the lower body, and the murder weapon of Rama is slowly getting bigger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's face suddenly changes, can't help but grab the Rogge, shocked : "How... how could this be! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory laughs before I know how to regret it? Late!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden lake Crazyly surging, Wella smiled smugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underwater, the struggle of *** is getting weaker, the fingers of the right hand are still trying to stretch forward, but there is no possibility of touching the hand of Wei Na. The silver awns in her eyes began to diverge, and the small mouth was slightly open, as if to say something to Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina leaned forward slightly and smiled. "Are you willing to hand over the origin of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Small mouth suddenly, a light black small ball flies out like lightning, hitting Weina's guardian mask! This black ball of light is as vital as it is, and the faint ink color instantly dyes the entire guardian mask. Not waiting for Wella to react, the entire guardian mask suddenly disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Erosion! How could you use this..." Weina exclaimed, and a huge wave drowned the words behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wave of power is extraordinarily huge, and Wella’s body is slightly sinking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also...go down!" ***In the eyes of the silver mans, the right hand lightning-fastened Wella’s throat and dragged her into Among the lakes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora, who is still unruly, has lost all his anger and is pleading. And Rogge was arrogant, completely ignoring Mora's pleading, but simply conquered and slandered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Rogge suddenly suddenly stunned. In his eyes, the beautiful figure of Mora became blurred, and it seemed that there were triple images overlapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and the illusion disappeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The natural charm is so powerful that it can make me hallucinating." The fat man thought, and the strength increased a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
