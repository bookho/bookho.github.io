			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany's top-level platform, the well-trained soldiers are attacking below, bows, javelins, and stone throwing tides again and again successfully The legion blocked the middle platform. When the team replaced, the archers took up the empty arrow pot and stepped back, giving way to the pitcher carrying a large bundle of javelins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the soldiers on the edge of the platform rioted, and the archers outside the two backs leaned back and screamed out of the platform. An ugly giant hand stretched out from where they disappeared, with a green bristled hand on his back, and a blood-stained beaded away, and the corpse appeared in front of the soldiers. The corpse has agility that is completely contrary to the huge bloated body. It is slightly confined, and the next moment it appears in the crowd, blocking the passage of the warriors returning to Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An archer returns to God, raises his shaking hand and shoots a slanting arrow, the corpse completely ignores this weak arrow, letting It stabbed into his body. Compared to its size, the archer's arrow is too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this terrible green horror monster, it is difficult for warriors to treat it as a new species, rather than a pile of human corpses. When the brave warrior still in the passage squats against the corpse, he jumps up and slams the sword into its body! This sword went down like a piece of rotten meat, only a small green juice splashed out, giving off a large stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak attacker squirted a splash of juice, and he stunned, looking at the green rot that could not be dropped in front of him, and then Everything fell into the darkness, and his two eyes fell out of his eyelids and fell with the thick flesh on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior still doesn’t know that the meat on his face has all rotted with extreme horror, revealing the white bones beneath the flesh and blood. And the dark green has spread down the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, the warrior’s armor, together with a soft mud-like carrion, was left alone, leaving only a good cockroach standing in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smelly warriors mostly smelled green and crumbling, and the nearest ones have fallen to the ground. His face turned blue-black, his limbs kept twitching, and he couldn't live without seeing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of fighters on the other side of the platform looked at the little human head on the huge body of the corpse, and sometimes they were afraid. But before they even took the courage to charge, the corpse licked a mouth, suddenly squirting a thick green mist, the fog condensed without scattering, in the dim light, almost could not see what was born in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a scream, it seems to never stop screaming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses climbed one by one to the head of Tiffany. A killing journey began in the dense soldiers. The head of a corpse suddenly screamed and screamed, and the swaying sound was like a magical spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the scream is over, it turns out to be a spell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of Tiffany fighters around the corpse suddenly screamed. The body is like a broken clay, and the flesh and blood fall down in pieces. In a blink of an eye, it becomes an activity with a shield and a sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Delaware officer who was commanding the attacking corpse not far away had a lot of experience in identifying magic. Seeing the magic of the corpse, he couldn't help but take a breath! This is flesh and blood! The talent of the corpse is actually flesh and blood! Although it seems that each corpse can only perform a flesh and blood evacuation, but in this war-intensive city, only one flesh and blood is enough to make the corpse more dozens of 骷髅 guards. These battles are generally combative, but under their escorts, the corpses can calmly squirt the poisonous mist, and the lethality is by no means a simple addition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the wall, dozens of fighters were replaced with long guns. In the shouts, I rushed to a corpse from both sides and turned it into a hedgehog! The head of the corpse couldn’t stop screaming in the sky, and the body struggled to wriggle, but dozens of brave warriors worked together. How did it earn? In the twinkling of an eye, there are a few long shots that even come out from the other side of the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dying corpse suddenly had a horrible madness, and then the body swiftly swelled, slamming, blasting a tens of meters The green fog of the garden keeps the surrounding soldiers in the fog, and the dark green body fluids and fragments can't stop splashing out of the fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Tiffany's head burst into a large green mist from time to time, and the brave warriors were able to escape the corpse's self-destructive attack while destroying a dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the city, Tiffany’s killings are in trouble. A killing often falls, and the heavy infantry on all sides will throw a chain. Even if the chain of criss-crossings is cut off, most of them will be wrapped around them, which greatly restrains the action of killing. At this time, holding the heavy hammer, the tidal heavy infantry who is not afraid of death will be swarmed up and smashed, and the children of Wenna will be smashed into a pile of scrap iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially, the Tikton warrior holding the two-handed hammer also joined the battlefield, and only a dozen hammers could completely destroy a killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, it’s all here!" In the attic of a building in Tiffany, a low humming sound was heard. Also with a trembling from fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building is facing a square. Although the square is not large, but the location is important, the passage extends in all directions, and is not far from the gate of the Imperial Army. Therefore, it has become a place for mobilizing the reserve forces in wartime and reorganizing the troops with too many casualties. At this moment, the square was full of wounded soldiers, and the final reserve troops were also assembled, ready to strengthen the city defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a person hiding in the attic, who is secretly observing the crowded square from the gap of the blinds. It is a step forward to sneak back into the city of Tiffany. Boski. His face was pale and his body was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen the light column that runs through the heavens and the earth, and that is the signal that Rogge made him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottle of things that matter can make me completely immune to the undead magic effect! Yes, immune! Then I still... what are you afraid of? However, they... won’t lie to me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robersky's teeth fought and groaned out of his arms and found a gray vial. His hand was shaking too much, and he tried several times. I couldn't open the cock for the second time, but almost dropped the vial to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly became angry and whispered: "Robowski is a Viscount, Viscount! If you still have no interest, it is better to die! He rushed up, unplugged the cork, drank the magic potion in the vial, and then gasped. Just as he had just experienced a big battle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a spiral-shaped gray crystal from his arms, and flickered through the window, watching this gray crystal with a very strange atmosphere. There was a faint gray mist in the crystal. The fierceness of the fierce back and forth conflicts, seems to want to break through the shackles of the crystal. Robsky can even feel the crystal is shaking slightly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to feel him Looking at the gaze, the fog in the crystal suddenly stopped, and then turned into a face of a wicked woman! She opened a big mouth full of teeth, and the sly gesture bites to Robsky! Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky was scared to sit down on the ground, the crystal also fell and fell! Fortunately, the gray crystal fell on a thick pad, not dropped Broken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was scared to almost fainted this time! After drinking the magic potion, Bossky’s face turned gray, and this scared, the last bit of blood on his face disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky finally felt this piece The horror of the gray crystal is far more than anything else. He really does not want to be close to it, even if he is not willing for a second!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky Suddenly grabbed the gray crystal, opened the blinds, and used the greatest strength to throw the gray crystals to the army on the square!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who! "Although the square is extremely chaotic, an officer is still screaming, and the sword will split the gray crystal on the top of the head in two parts! In this case, people can feel that someone is throwing a sneak attack, not a leisurely generation. The quality of the Delaware soldiers, Even the generals of the Asrofic Empire have always been very admired.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog that was trapped in the gray crystal finally got the freedom. A looming dead banshee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul slut is suddenly alive and full of anger, she is extremely angry. She tried her best to open her mouth and make a non-human The screaming screaming! In front of this sharp and unimaginable nickname, all the souls are like a piece of crystal and fragile glass, which bursts!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first slogan was called, almost all the fighters had fallen within a hundred meters of the banshee. Only a few strong enough, or lucky enough, soldiers could stand still. The deceased banshee stared at the still-lived warrior in the square, apparently not satisfied with her own victory. She quickly drifted to the other end of the square, and there was another extremely screaming scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square is completely chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dead slut who is completely incarnate in death, Robsky’s legs are completely soft. Although the scream of the banshee will still be introduced into his ear, but the soul of Robsky is still in front of the scream, obviously the magic potion he just drank is not a fake. But this does not alleviate his fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky insisted on going downstairs and saw that the homeowner’s family had fallen in the scream of the banshee. He was really scared too much. He only felt that he was weak, and even moving one step was difficult to climb the sky. Therefore, he simply fell into the pile of dead bodies and dressed up as dead bodies. In this chaotic time, maybe killing is more life-saving than running away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that Robersky prayed was that the basement of the Winnie’s house was deep enough to allow her and her family to escape the chaos of the city. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banshee’s howling has disappeared. I don’t know if she has gone far, or she has exhausted her strength and disappeared completely. However, Robsky did not mean to climb up, nor dare to look outside. At this moment, the only thing he has the courage to do is to continue to lie on the ground and pretend to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outside of the noisy square, this time is already dead...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already very In the chaotic Tiffany city, a black shadow suddenly flew, and the rich death atmosphere around him was almost as good. There was a burly warrior in his left hand and a sharp blade on his right arm. A Delaware magician who has not yet died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black shadow is the bone emperor, and he is carrying the black warrior emperor who is in the sky and the sea is full of anger and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden and loud spell in the sky, and the resounding curse sounded like a song, like a sigh, almost without magical talent. People can also feel the power contained in it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the air came a fierce dragon, an adult red dragon suddenly flew from the sky, and suddenly the earth's bones fell to the ground. Then the burning flame rushed to the Bone Emperor and the Black Warrior Emperor, and drowned the two people in a blink of an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Dragon Call! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magic that exists in the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany is on a long street. Rogge’s figure sneaked out. He looked at the mighty red dragon, just a cold smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly heard an exclamation. Rogge turned and fixed his eyes on the horrified girl in front of her eyes. The girl is still pretty, looks fifteen or six years old, and is pitiful. Rogge thought about it and finally decided not to waste his precious magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand has been applied to the girl’s neck and then gently twisted. The fragile neck bone of the girl broke into several pieces, and she also killed her unfinished mantra in her throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes lost her mind and fell to the ground. Her left hand was exposed from the long sleeves. It was not the delicate hand that the girl should have, but a machine made of metal and unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man can't help but feel a little pity. When the girl is not very old, she already has the magic power of about six or seven, and she also learned the magic of silently reporting information, which is much stronger than she was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a very loud, high-pitched soprano aria between the heavens and the earth, followed by countless thick bass chords! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is a huge opera being staged! The sky is the top, the earth is the stage, and the audience is the 900,000 creatures outside the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darker than the darkness suddenly appeared a narrow slit like a sword mark. The long-lost sunshine plunged down the gap, and if the huge golden curtain hangs from the sky to the earth. The narrow opening in the air gradually expands into an elliptical shape, and the sunlight is intensely burning white, which cannot be overlooked by the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the floating city was completely presented in front of all beings, the cracks of the Scorpio began to close, and the magnificent and sacred temple turned into the only light object in Tiffany's sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City of Floating...This is the city of floating...God, it really has such a thing!" Wenna squatted, almost already Can't stand up! But his eyes bulged, staring at the crystal screen, for fear of seeing the details of a little floating city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly sprinkled with a arrogant and majestic dragon, a silver dragon suddenly smashed through the night, and instantly plunged into the red dragon, a sip The bite of the dragon is on the back of the red dragon! The red dragon screamed in pain and turned back, and the two dragons immediately doubling their buckets together. They sometimes fly into the sky, sometimes falling to the ground, and Tiffany's neat streets are pieced into pieces that fall victim to two dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge slamming sounds of dust rising into the air, leaving only a rubble and debris left in the air, and the souls floating in the air began to be hundreds of increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon is still struggling, but still struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the night's gap just wants to close, and a sacred dragon is drilled on the cloud! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy dragon silently slides down, only two dragon language magic, one is to enhance the attack power of the silver dragon, one is the curse of the red dragon, It makes the situation between the two dragons in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory enjoys the feeling of controlling the battle between the laughter and the laughter. It decides to continue to work hard in assisting the dragon magic in the future. This is so wonderful that it can control everything and take into account the majesty and graceful posture of the sacred dragon. A sacred dragon and the inferior dragons go to the fight? Think about losing face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that it is safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the emergence of the floating city and the two dragons, the morale of the imperial warriors was greatly enhanced, cheering and praising the sounds of the beautiful gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner is just a fanatic staring at the miraculous city of floating, completely forgetting the world around him. The face of the sky wrath is extremely ugly. He stares at the class that floats down in the sky, Androni and Hughes. He only feels that his heart is sinking a little bit, and half of the forest light has almost failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Sillowly emerges in the air, unlike other Sanctuary strongmen, she has no light, only a pair of silver cymbals flashing under the night sky . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said in her right hand that under the silver dragon’s mad attack, the red dragon that had only the power of parry screamed, and was suddenly pulled into the air by a very strong gravitation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The silver enamel shines, the hands are imaginary, and dozens of criss-crossing gravitational moments smash the bones of the red dragon body! The red dragon that should be summoned is too late to scream, and it turns into a mess of magical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the wrath of the sky has completed the light of the forest, and the ground suddenly lights up. Then a beautiful forest suddenly appeared in front of people. The bright and warm sunshine shines through the forest to the clear spring water in the forest. In the spring water, a beautiful girl slowly floated up. She opened her eyes, and the eyes of the same color as the sun looked at the Emperor of the Bone and the Black Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unparalleled magical beauty is a gift to the soul, but it is a disaster for the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone emperor who just got out of the red dragon dragon flame is still holding the black warrior emperor, and he can't get rid of the light of the forest that has locked him. His left hand stretched out and a dark black light shield formed in his hand. Bone Emperor wants to use his own millennium death to block the light of Sen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange whistling sound in the sky! Xiusi appeared in front of the Bone Emperor in an incredible degree. He stood up straight and frankly took the burning gaze of the forest girl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the intense magical light shining in the same color as the sun, Xiusi’s face is rosy and fluttering. He didn't consume anything. It’s so refreshed by the light of the forest, and the state is so good that it’s too good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the body of the sky wrath has begun to burst into ice. The Death Class and Androni rushed like electricity, but the weapons in their hands eventually stabbed a faint illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of the gods took the Emperor of the Black Warrior from the hands of the Bone Emperor and smiled. "You can kill the enemy. I will take care of him..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not failed yet! It’s a hell! How many so many powerful guys have run my Tiffany? Six, ah no, five sacred domains, the elf is a little worse than the sanctuary. God, what is that! That is a woman... a woman who has slashed an adult red dragon with an empty hand must have read it wrong! She is gone! a ha ha ha! God... Which god should I pray to? ... my last baby! "Wenner's face was gray-faced, gibberish, and he hurriedly pulled a switch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany's steel gate fell again and will swarm The Imperial heavy infantry was blocked out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Empire’s heavy infantry suddenly separated from the two sides as a tide, leaving the way for a tall man who came slowly. They don't know who this man is, and why he is here, but all the soldiers are subconsciously unwilling to approach him, half because of awe and half because of admiration.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s body is full of golden light, the light is neither strong nor glaring, soft and soft, and not arrogant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; However, everyone’s eyes will subconsciously avoid this light, which is the humility and awe from the depths of the soul.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s face is clear and strong, it is Macbeth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, he has already arrived at Tiffany Under the city, put his hand on the steel gate. A dark red spread quickly, and the entire steel gate was reddened in a flash. The steel gate was like a large piece of hot-fired cheese, which softened and dripped, leaving behind the ground. A pool of corrugated solid liquid at the same time as the steel floor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal screen in front of Wen’s eyes suddenly appeared dozens of horizontal stripes, chaotic after a while Darkened. No matter how he enters the magic, he can't get a response.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your babies are all finished, or surrender!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner suddenly turned and looked at the class and Androni who walked in through the gate. So close, two sanctuaries! The corner of the eye was **, and one hand slid back into the sleeve.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the khaki flash of light flashed, and Wen’s shoulder felt a bit stinging. All his movements became very slow, and he watched Androni's pair of hands flicking and dancing, and removed all the gadgets hidden in him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Wenna tried to block her hands before lifting it to her chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an inconspicuous house, the wrath of the sky Stepping out in the raging ice wind. His face was very gray, and the summoned red dragon was strangled by ***, which was a heavy blow to him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After the successful sneak attack, the sky wrath thought that he could eat the two sanctuaries steadily, and he could spare some effort to drive away the remaining big magical guides with Wenna. But he did not think anyway. The other party actually has five sacred domains. And there are two dragons! And the last dragon appeared, how to see how it looks like a sacred dragon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the wrath of the sky never doubts his power, he still does not have the confidence to fight magic with a legendary sacred dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the horror The ***, even the wave between them destroyed the adult red dragon he summoned!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean?<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky for the first time feels that it is not a shame to escape.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Druid is good at hiding, himself After escaping, I will forgive those few sanctuaries for a time and a half. The sky wrath has already built the portal in this house in advance, just step on it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal is located in the hall of the house, and the wrath of the sky sees the constantly fluctuating halo in the portal, and the heart settles a lot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He just had to step, a dark gray wave of silence came from behind, and in the blink of an eye he wiped out most of his protective magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you have let go of the ninth-order magic. The eighth-order is finished, we can shake it up fairly..." The fat man smiled. The protective magic that had already been prepared was finished, and his body began to show silver light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old things, do you still want to leave alive today?" Although it was rude to say it, Rogge’s smile and tone were very gentle and gentle. It seems to be facing a glamorous woman who is going to seduce her to go to bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Rogge’s figure appeared in the sky with no warning at all, and he slammed into his heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky snorted, and the side of the body let the attack be as quick as the agility of the warrior, followed by a backhand. The powerful lightning of the road immediately lingered on Rogge! Rogge's silver light was darkened, but his mouth was already hung with a trace of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendid magical light instantly drowned everything in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is no longer a magical battle in the understanding of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is Rogge or the wrath of the sky, he is swaying in the close, completely regardless of the distance from the hand. Lightning, ice cones, flames, dark waves, magic, demon, and countless dazzling magic are all coming out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very small space, the two are moving fast, and the wind is flowing! The incredible level of magic manipulation and combat spelling on both sides caused countless mid-level magic to sneak into the opponent like a squally shower. In a short period of time, the two have already attacked dozens of magics, and none of them failed! If a warrior sees this battle, he will certainly feel bitter in the mouth. Fighting with such a mage, the distance is dead, there is still no hope in melee! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this stormy magic showdown, there is no place for a spell, no more than the seventh-order magic, so the nineth-order is finished. And the wrath of the sky with the eighth-order magic actually did not eat much. Slowly, Rogge began to suffer from the wind, although he used the sneak attack to eliminate most of the protective magic of the sky wrath, but the ice robes in the big Druids of the North itself are extremely powerful magic protection props! However, Rogge is infinite, the left hand of Casina Russ and the completely deformed sharp right claws make the sky anger and scruples, do not dare to force too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a curse that was not in harmony with the scene at this time sounded in the room. The sound is actually from the back of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky wrath slipped past Rogge, through the silver light armor, a clear green faucet appeared on the back of Rogge, The curse sound is coming from the dragon mouth! Only the dragon's eyes are closed, and it can even be seen that its eyes are forcibly stitched! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Alien Curse Purgatory? You even learn the things of the Mozu?" The wrath of the sky shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to be able to slaughter you this old thing, I am willing to learn the skills of the abyss demon!" Rogge smiled and reached for a wave, a magical flame The arrow into the sky anger face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burst of cursing sounds, various curses and attacking magics rush into the sky with anger! The wrath of the sky could not stop the magical flames of various colors, and the movements slowed down. But he is not afraid. No skill can provide extra magic out of thin air. The more aggressive Rogge's offensive is at this moment, the faster the magic will be consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still too young. I don't know how to cherish my magic like a most awkward miser. The wrath of the sky sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled coldly, and it was not enough to tear off the black robe that was already ruined. What about another one? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another singer’s voice, mixed with the curse behind Rogge, and they meet each other. The sky’s anger is blue, just stare The silver dragon that appeared on the chest of Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon is elegant and beautiful, and the majesty is soft, but her eyes are also stitched.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound of the double spell in front of Rogge is still echoing in the air, the wrath of the sky must fly. Suddenly go straight to Rogge!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of glare lights up in the room, and the magical hurricane silently twists all the furniture in the hall into dust.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
