The luxury of the palace is always worthy of the status of the country. Otherwise, even if King Romon is willing to endure a hard life, the ministers and aristocrats will inevitably stop the king's frugality on the grounds that they will be looked down upon by neighboring countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Layton Palace covers a wide area, so that there is an artificial hill in the palace. At the moment, the southern country is already in the spring, and the north of the Central Mountains is still a desolate scene. Only the hill in the Layton Palace is green, and the trees on the hills are some of the most common species in the South. They grow happily, and the leaves are green and green, and it is not the dark green of the conifers of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass in the forest, although there is no trace of artificial trimming, but it looks like a thick green carpet, the grass is dotted with unknown stars. Wildflowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all the beauty is born for a beautiful elf girl who is sitting on the grass lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell sat thoughtfully on the grass with a hint of mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of her, there is a mirror of the ancient style, which reflects the beautiful face of the elf girl as if it were a light smoke. But in the eyes of Ikerel, it is not her appearance, but a mysterious and beautiful elf text. I have seen these lines of words for many times, and all the details of the actions have been repeatedly considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed softly and passed the mirror. The elf text in the mirror slowly disappeared and became an ordinary silver plaque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iklele closed his eyes and enjoyed the zephyr and the faint aroma of the wind. In this rare moment of tranquility, she will throw all the conspiracy out of her heart and temporarily return to the carefree elf girl in the green sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just half a month ago, this hill was still as absurd as the rest of the North. At that time, several people who claimed to be intelligent eye-seekers sought to see the king of Lomon, saying that they were inspired by God. The purity and kindness of the elf Ikerel touched the heart of the goddess O'Reilly and became a new god. Awkward people. They came here to build a world of paradise for the elves Ikerel and King Romon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King Romon will be suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard that the Eye of Wisdom has recently been exhibited very fast in the country, and the goddess they believe in has just shown God in the Dresden Palace in Aray trace. But in any case, this small church that believes in the nameless god is not in the north, there are dozens. As for the miracle is true or false, then only God knows. But this time the great aristocrat who recommended these people was a good friend of King Romon for many years. Under his great recommendation, King Romon would let them try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the wisdom of these magicians are really different, they selected a place of 10 meters, used a whole day and a lot of Magic crystal, only a complicated magic array. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, in the stunned King of Lomon and the ministers of the spectator, this magical array worked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature within the magical array is slowly rising and becomes warm as spring. Grasses and trees begin to grow wildly with the naked eye, and their growth patterns are completely changing with the minds of several magicians in the Eye of Wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the grass grows to two inches, it no longer grows. And more than ten small trees were stretched high, and on the second day, their crowns were covered with shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small piece of paradise that is like spring in the four seasons is formed in two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iklele is ecstatic, dancing on the green grass, and the moment of the wind has poured out countless onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the joy of Ikerel, King Romon is old and bright, he immediately told the magician of the Eye of Wisdom: "Good! Very good It’s true that it’s a church that believes in the true God. It’s really impossible for people to transform this whole mountain. If there is any difficulty, even if it’s open, I will do it well. Later, my Layton Kingdom will fully support the eyes of wisdom. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Romon was displeased and sighed: "There is no money for the rich people of the Layton Kingdom. How much time and time will it take to change the whole hill?" Come and listen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician has been indulging for a long time, and said: "Your Majesty, as long as there is enough magical material, it will take only three days to arrange the magic array. And Under the guidance of the goddess, the effect of this magical array is permanent. But the cost of magical materials is estimated to be around 700,000 gold coins..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king of Mongolia is even more unhappy. If it is not the special status of the magician, he has already turned his face. He sneaked a bit of money and we are still worthy of the Leiden Kingdom! You can do it now, if you want to buy something, how much it will cost, as long as it can be arranged exactly the same as the piece of music in front of you! As long as I can satisfy my Ikerel, I will donate 100,000 gold coins to the Eye of Wisdom afterwards! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister of the Layton Kingdom changed his face, and he finally got the courage to whisper in the ears of King Romon: "His Majesty, this is the Kingdom's Treasury Five." One of the properties, you have to think twice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king replied bluntly: "If you can exchange gold coins for such a piece of paradise, That is also worth it. Behind me, my sons and grandchildren can also enjoy nothing! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikreel gently pulled Laromon's sleeves, and some slyly said: "Your Majesty, it seems...like money is spent too much Some more. We still don't want to renovate the whole mountain. Your Ikerel can have such a big place and it is already very happy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king laughed at the baby, this money is a big deal in other countries of the Holy Alliance, but our Kingdom of Leighton is rich and strong, this money has not yet Put it in my eyes! Just wait for it, here is it, it should be similar to your previous home? Baby, you complained to me about a cold winter. Now you will be satisfied. Hahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, the hill in the palace has really become an oasis in the snowfield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell sitting on the grass sighed and took back his thoughts. Her heart appeared in her heart. She faintly felt that this land was more or less a little compensation that God gave her to her, although this was not the main goal of his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building the huge cost of this magical array, after many complicated links, most of them will flow into Rogge’s pocket. After all, the most important and most expensive of the magical array of rare magic crystals, only in the city of the gods. These rare magic crystals have always been priceless, and there are few people, and there are fewer people to use. It is possible to open a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sold a number of magic crystals at a very high price to several major chambers of the Kingdom of Layton. Of course, these chambers of commerce are willing to enter this magic crystal. Because the magicians of the Eye of Wisdom will buy at a higher price. As for the difference between the tens of thousands of gold coins, Rogge knows that this is the price that must be paid. Behind these chambers of commerce are the nobles of the Leiden Kingdom. Two of the real bosses behind them are Marshal Emams who is in charge of military power. After paying these costs, no one will come back and trace whether the money is worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell has no concept of money at all, but she also knows that this is a big sum of money. It’s just that God wants adults to do so much money, she doesn’t know it, and she doesn’t care about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts were pulled back by a rush of footsteps, which seemed anxious and panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikleel turned to look at it, a handsome, handsome young man was sneaking up and coming here. Seeing Ikerel, he showed ecstasy and flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell stood up and just yelled: "Sensi adults..." was held tightly in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Ikerel’s small face, Sensi was excited and incoherent: “This is not a dream... Ikerel! Great! ...you are really here, tell me that everything is true!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young Viscount Viscount is not a general aristocrat. He is the nephew of the king of the Kingdom of Livi and the ambassador of the Kingdom of Levi in ​​the Kingdom of Layton. Since seeing Ikerel at the court dance at the Layton Kingdom, he feels that he has fallen in love with this elf. As a ambassador of the Kingdom of Livi, he can often enter the Layton Palace. He always seizes every opportunity, quietly approaches Ikerel, understands everything about her, and tries to impress her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at a dance a week ago, Sensi caught a short chance to dance with Ikerel and quietly confided his love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell listened, her face was still elegant and polite, cold, only faint, very light and extremely light: "Every afternoon, I They will be alone in 'Le Tu' for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ecstatic Sensi can't believe his ears, this is a very obvious hint! It is possible to maintain the quiet dance of this song, and has exhausted the training of Sensi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the powerful Powers of Sensi, crossing the Layton Palace is just a small problem. Now, he is finally able to have a short time with Ikerel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long time with Ikel, Sensi still couldn’t believe it was true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikreel smiled slightly and said softly: "You have stupid little mouth that has been blocked by Sensi.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kiss is frenetic and short-lived.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell gasps in a hurry and kisses her wildly on her Sensi said: "I like you to be more rude..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light sentence completely ignited the blood of Sensi's body. He grabbed the elf The cloak, with a strong slam, slammed Ikerel's blouse completely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell blushes on the face, snoring, I took a deep breath and my eyes closed slightly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senxi bowed his head and was about to enjoy the delicacies of this paradise when he was in his arms Ikerel made a clear, screaming voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Sensi was poured into a basin of ice water in the coldest winter, completely froze!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a loud voice in the palace, and I am approaching here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensi stares at Ikel, Watching her tears rolling down her cheeks at the moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he was just when he was alone with Ikerel, he still couldn’t believe it. It’s all true.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell sighed and said in a fine mosquito-sounding voice: “I’m sorry...”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bold! King Ramon rushed in a hurry and snarled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensi reacted and realized that the big thing was not good, King Romon to Ikelay Er's love was already famous in the Holy League. He hurriedly let go of Ikerel, thumped and hurried, and said: "Your Majesty! This is not my business! is her! She seduce me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the moment Ikerel fell to the ground and was crying. She was so pitiful that everyone’s heart hurts. Seeing that her clothes are ruptured, the crystal clear skin is blue and purple, and who would believe that she would seduce the Viscounts of Sensi?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a living mouth! The old king was mad, and he suddenly took a long sword from a follower and went to Sensi.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell jumped up , exclaimed: "Your Majesty! No! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, only she can call King Romon. The old king turned his face and asked, "Baby, why don't you let me kill him?" ? Is he really saying? ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senxi was shocked and happy, looking at Ikerel in a complicated mood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Claire slammed: "His Majesty, he is the nephew of the king of the Kingdom of Livi! I don't want to trouble you because of my reasons... Today's business, just forget it..." Later, she couldn't stop sobbing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The old king snarled suddenly: "The end of insulting my love is death! Today is King Levi here, and I am still killing! I have not been afraid of this life!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, King Romon has penetrated the chest of Viscount Sensi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king snorted and still looked at Sensi’s body with hatred, and snarled at the close-knit: "The arrogant pigs of the Kingdom of Livi, I dared to bully my head! The last time I merged with the highland Principality, I haven’t settled with them. Go to me to summon the minister! Declare war on the Kingdom of Livi!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After two days of sleepless rushing, the special envoy of the Kingdom of Layton finally rushed to the Principality of Aray. King Lomon meets with the Ayre Principal to send troops to conquer the kingdom of Rivi. The reason, of course, will not be that the nephew of King Levi insulted Ikerel, only to retaliate against the kingdom of the country to annex the three kingdoms of the highlands. Interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the news of the war was passed to Iggol by Ikerel on the same day, he still pretended not to know anything, listened carefully to the messenger. I will finish talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After accompanying the messenger and yelling at the Kingdom of Livi, Rogge agreed to form an alliance with the Kingdom of Leighton. However, he immediately revealed the difficulty, saying that this time the Leiden Kingdom declared war was too sudden, without any warning in advance. The army of the Ayre Principality is mostly a recruit who has been trained for two months. He has not yet prepared for the battlefield. At present, only 5,000 troops can be transferred to assist the Layton Kingdom in defending some unimportant strategic objectives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of the Ayre Principality has not yet been practiced, which is almost an open secret. The messenger also expressed his understanding that anyway, as long as he reached an alliance agreement with the Alai Principality, his mission was completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Layton has long been in the position of the first power of the Holy Alliance. Most of the people in the country are arrogant and arrogant. This messenger is no exception. Not to mention the new army that has not been trained by the Ayre Principality. It is the elite of thousands of long-term battlefields. In their eyes, the combat power is far less than the 100,000-hundred warriors of the Leiden Kingdom. In the mind of the messenger, the troops of the Ayre Principality could have been used to defend the secondary target behind the defensive, so that the elite units of the Leiden Kingdom could be put into the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending away the messenger who is eager to go back to life, Rogge is very happy, and Ikerel’s arrangement is really worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in troubled times, he was arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Rogge has already arranged a lot of tricks, even if Viscount Sensi is not fooled. In a short period of time, Ikerel also gave the six kings of the Kingdom of Livi and the Kingdom of Latvia the hint of the royal family, suggesting that Viscount Sensi was only the first person to find a way to see Ikel. Only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger of the Kingdom of Layton just left, and the waiter came to inform the Mora Lord of the Eye of Wisdom to ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger immediately opened his eyes and smiled. Of course he knew what Mora had done, so he told me to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, Rogge felt that the power of Mora had risen again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore a black robe, but the style was a far cry from the mysterious black robe that used to cover her face. This black robe is obviously designed by the master tailor, and it fits perfectly with the slim and slender figure of Mora, which is solemn and elegant. The neckline of the black robe was quite low, revealing a mysterious symbol on the chest of Mora that kept flowing with golden light. Her gold is rolled up and the beautiful neck is fully displayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying Carmen elders and the other two magician clothing also changed. It can be seen that their necessities have been carefully repaired, and they will no longer look like a mess. The three men were each dressed in a robes of the clergy, but the robes of the elders of Carmon were decorated with intricate and beautiful magical symbols, and the attire on the other two were much simpler. From the light, it is possible to tell that the status of Elder Calmon has passed the other two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora, sitting down in the living room, smiled lightly and said: "You are so magical, you will know me this time. The purpose of the visit is to thank you. The eye of wisdom has been completed for the king of Leighton king Romon, and the money has been completely collected. According to your promise to the goddess Olympus, we left 200,000 gold coins, today I will bring you the rest of the 100,000 gold coins. Just, the distinguished Rogge, you promise to complete the donation in this way, it seems a little tricky! You are not afraid of the great Ao Lei Will Heller punish you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon and the other two magical eyes of the magician immediately bowed their heads and did not dare to look at her. When Mola is in a good mood or when she is laughing, she often unconsciously moves her natural charm. They have been following Mora for a long time and know this. Although they have nothing in the charm, Mora can remove the charm, but the gaffe is inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is completely unmoved and sits securely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora laughed: "Master Rogge, you are devout to the goddess O'Reilly. It's better to say... Of course, I won't go into it. After the goddess came, why did the taxation you started talking about become a donation of 200,000 gold coins to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's face is red, coughing Two sounds, and began to care about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora again said: "Master Rogge, the last time I talked with you once, it is a lot of gains. After the eye of wisdom changes according to your suggestion, Now the exhibitors have gone a lot better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smiled and said: "Miss Mola, as I said last time, in our world, The true God is not just one. So to spread the glory of the goddess O'Reilly to a wider place, we must seize more believers. We need to know what they need, what they think, what is the right medicine, The effect will be good. Simply put, what they want, we will give them something, of course, the realization is in the future, not the present. Since the last time Mongo Rykh, I have talked with you several times. After that, I don’t have a clear religious doctrine, and it’s not consistent with the mysterious bloody impression that the original eye of wisdom originally gave. You see, the eye of the eye of wisdom has changed so much that it gives people the feeling. It’s much more comfortable. This will allow more believers to join. Most people's hearts, like noble, elegant or better than bloody dark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next magician of the eye of wisdom is still the first time When I saw Rogge, after listening to this high theory, I couldn’t help but whisper: Isn’t it a lie? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "As long as the glory of the goddess can be spread, what makes the little means a big deal?" It seems that your faith is not enough to be pious! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was stunned by this big hat, and he couldn’t speak at the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fat in the bright church and the Bavarian Principality, has been rolling in the intrigues and tricks. It is only a trivial matter to say anything sacred and noble.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said again: "Miss Mola, now you should agree to change the mark of the Eye of Wisdom? A bloody eye should be the idea of ​​the demon eye tyrant, which is not conducive to the church's further exhibition! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora nodded and should be changed. Does Rogge have any suggestions for the new mark?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge said: "The new mark can't be too complicated. The complicated mark is too expensive, and the poor believers are likely to be unable to afford it. It is not conducive to the promotion of the church. With clear doctrine, it's good to make this mark look like no one can understand it. I have several elf masters here, and I am very good at designing things that no one can understand."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician couldn’t help but interrupt: "How can this be? If the goddess lowers the gods and clarifies the doctrine, do we have to redesign a new mark?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora laughed at the foresight of Ge Daren, you should study hard. Since no one can understand the meaning of the new mark, it means that we can explain it in the future, and we don’t need to design a new one. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at the magician and saw him in his early twenties, still very young, but the magic is not weak, it is estimated that there are eight levels. Rogge has a lot of meaning to him: "I see you have a magical talent, and in a few years, it is inevitable to become a great magician. But in how to show the eyes of wisdom and enhance the belief in the goddess, you still have more effort! You are now in the third-class priesthood, and the rank is not low. But if you want to go closer to the goddess, you will share some sorrow for the Mora, and you have to work harder. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young magician stunned, and then looked resolute, it seems that he was determined in his heart, ready to work hard.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing O'Reilly, Rogge made a big move on the structure of the Eye of Wisdom by referring to the structure of the Church of Light, and revised a book about the ranks of the church. The identity of the Mora Holy Lady is clarified in the teachings, and its status is above all clergy. Other clerics were divided into nine orders. The first order was only one of Calmon, who always followed Mora. The rest of the clergy were divided into three or six according to their respective abilities and backgrounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger privately said to Mora: "It is impossible to rely on the belief of the goddess. This thing cannot be eaten as a meal, not as a dress. Now There are more and more believers in the Eye of Wisdom, and it is inevitable that some people with two hearts and minds will join in. But if the church wants to grow stronger, the number of believers is the most important, so how much we can collect. Now the clerics are set up so much. In addition to giving the capable people the treatment they deserve, it also gives all people an upward hope. The promotion of the next level depends on their ability and contribution to the church. These people’s beliefs are not strong enough, and they can use the power of the world to let them contribute to the eyes of wisdom.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Mora once said: “Roger is the wisdom The eye has contributed so much, and the faith of the goddess is so religious. If you formally join the eye of wisdom, what level should you say to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗Ge smiled and replied: "Do not give me any order, give me to you. . The line "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Murrah goddess smiled to agree, I have no problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roghaha smiles, and there is no more of this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the clergy As soon as the order system came out, it immediately led to a chicken and dog jump in the eyes of wisdom. Mora did not think that it would be so difficult to balance all aspects. But with the identity of the saint, her decision is the final decision. After a long toss, I finally gave the rank of the clergy to the initial position.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is a new one, the church is really fresh, the clerics of the clergy It was a lot bigger before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people talked for a while, and Mora got up and said goodbye. On the way to send her out of the house, Rogge lowered his voice. Tao: "The war between Miss Mora, the Kingdom of Leighton and the Kingdom of Livi, and the Kingdom of Latvia is about to begin. This is a good opportunity to show the church believers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora nodded slightly and hearted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sent away Mora, Rogge returned The study, told the next person to hang a huge map of the Holy Alliance, and sent someone to call Charlie to discuss the war.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Layton, Levi and Latvia It is the three great powers of the Holy Alliance. The Kingdom of Leighton has 100,000 soldiers, and the total strength of the two countries of Livi and Latvia is 120,000. Now the kingdom of Layton is counting the 80,000 troops of the Principality of Aray. Later, on the surface, it was an advantage, but Rogge’s so-called 80,000-strong army had 60,000 talents from the army for two months. These people were sent to the battlefield, and they were sent to die.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Romon’s anger is red, although it has disrupted the pace of preparations for Levi and Latvia, but Layton himself is not prepared for the war. So this scene does not seem to be So good to play.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Rogge’s vision has already seen farther. The civil war in this small part of the Holy League is a victory or a defeat, not too much in his heart. These few wins or defeats, Livi and Latvia are hard to escape, Rogge arranged for them. Destiny. Of course, if you win, it will be more conducive to Rogge’s plan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the war, let the opponent lose, this is Rogge. The goal pursued.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation, Charlie walked into the study.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie, Ray There has been news from the kingdom of the kingdom that they have declared war on the Kingdom of Levi.
