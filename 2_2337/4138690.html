			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest is dark, damp, and cold. Tall trees cover the sun, and shrubs and vines fill the gaps between the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is still early winter, all kinds of variant poisonous Warcraft have already begun to appear. The creatures here are extremely powerful and bloodthirsty, or they are several times larger than normal, or they are bright and grotesque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team just entered the forest less than five kilometers, and met dozens of strange two-headed wolves. These gray and white wolves are half as big as the average wolf, and one can even use simple little magic. When they were attacked, they were the golden lion knights who marched in the middle of the ranks and guarded the wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly attacked, but it is a stage for the Golden Lion Knight to show great strength. They all flickered. The sword is simple and hot, and a devil can be solved in a few times. The three golden lions and knights are self-contained, and they have two teams, one with one, and the other with a smooth and smooth start. Seeing everyone is secretly broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, these powerful variants of the demon wolf will forever become the fertilizer of the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulus can't help but feel good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time even the aristocratic youths such as Rogge have to admit that his pride is very reasonable. The individual strength of the Golden Lion Knight may not be too strong, but when the three or five get together, it is a terrible force. When fifty gold lion knights formed a battle, Roger’s more than three hundred dragons and the beautiful knights had only escaped. Think about the past few times, and the aristocratic youths are somewhat chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this team of seven hundred people is a good person, this trip to the quiet forest is still very hard. The easiest thing to fear is Froya. She doesn't know where to summon a five-meter-old ancient mammoth. She still has a small tent on it and rests comfortably inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days and two nights passed, and the team finally struggled to wear a quiet forest. As Furo's mammoth stepped down a big tree on the outer edge of the forest, a barren land appeared in front of everyone, and in the distance was the undulating dwarf hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is hidden at the edge of the forest, waiting for the return of the scout. After a short time, Jing Ge two close followers came back. Their faces look ugly, and the first sentence is: "This tribe is an alpine dwarf tribe! There are also hill giants living with them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwarf There are more than a dozen big families, and there are countless small ones. But no matter how divided, the alpine dwarves are firmly in the top three of the dwarves. This is not because they have a large population, but because of the strength of their fighters. As for the giants of the hills, they have been distant relatives of the dwarves since ancient times. However, one height often exceeds four meters, while the other is only one meter or more. How to get along with the pro and bring it to the home has always been a big problem that plagues the magic scholars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another saying that the giants of the hills have the blood of ancient giants. Although they do not have the strength of the ancient giants to match the gods of the dragons, but their strength can still be directly proportional to the block. The wooden sticks or stone sticks in the hands of adult giants tend to weigh hundreds of pounds. Under one round, they are enough to take a horse to fly a heavy armor! It is one of the most common hill giants who can easily deal with more than a dozen human knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill giants often live in groups with dwarves. When a dwarf tribe is strong enough, there are often several giants living with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of the giants of the hills indicates that Jing Ge’s intelligence has been seriously wrong. This dwarf tribe is more than twice as powerful as it was originally intended! Although the hunting side has a more Fuerya, the grasp of them is much smaller. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, everyone is a resourceful, savage and slick person who has never thought that it would be a chore to plan a few poisons. Even the people of justice, such as Paulus, are not willing to let their men face the hills giant directly, but rather take some intrigues. The justice of the golden lion is also reserved, otherwise it will not participate in the hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunting team sneaked into the camp in the quiet forest. Under the deliberation of the people, they all felt that they should first understand the strength of this dwarf tribe. The bottle of "The Curse of Fallen God" in Rogge's hand also takes time to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many unsuccessful reconnaissance, Fraya finally promised to help. For her, this is really an interesting hunt, but it can't be abandoned halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of two maids, the witch did not take long to lay a huge magical array. She then took out a small red blood bottle and waited for the lengthy spell to pour three drops of dark red viscous liquid. As soon as the three mysterious potions fell into the magical array, they burst into a large stream of bloody thick fog, and the thick screams and roars of the sharp calendars were continually revealed, and the thick bells were faintly revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them suddenly have some illusions, as if the abyss of the horrible Devil has opened the door in this thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a shadowy, vague, translucent little monster screamed out of the fog, it was ugly and the mouth was disproportionate. Big, inside the teeth. It is extremely fierce and screaming, and it seems that people are going to bite onlookers at any time. Then a large number of monsters came out, they screamed, tore each other, vying for the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these little monsters are not strong, when they jumped out of the thick fog hundreds of piles, the scene was terrible. . Some of the timid people in the hunting team are white and have already retreated involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the flight of Froya, Rogge smashed the curse of the fallen god, and opened the bottle cap and sprinkled it on the monster pile. The little monsters were desperately squeezing upwards, and in a blink of an eye they landed a monster pile. The little monster with a little potion was so excited that he screamed and jumped from the top of the monster to form a haze and got into the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, thousands of little monsters have received the potion and disappeared into the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything calms down, everyone’s ears still seem to scream around the monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the waiting time, Fu Luoya returned to her little tent on the back of the mammoth to drink tea and looked at her back. In the step, most people have no fascinating look in their eyes, but instead use fear and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, a little monster screamed out of the ground and jumped into the magic array. After a while, it is another. Then more and more monsters rushed to the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time a small monster is rushed into, the scene on the magical array is blurred, slowly showing a small new scene. The hunting warriors are far from the magical array, silently watching these changes in their understanding of the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, all the little monsters are back. A two-meter transparent sphere formed over the magical array, and the dome was a narrow dwarf hill. Streams, forests, dwarf underground tunnels, underground cities, groundwater veins, and even a few veins are clearly and clearly displayed. From the scale calculation, the scope of the sphere display has penetrated into the depths of the dwarf hills hundreds of meters deep! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of reconnaissance is something that Jing Ge’s replies can’t dream of. Even more frightening is that under this spell, if the little witch wants to poison someone, it is easy! Rogge, who has always hated Furoya’s teeth, is secretly re-measuring his weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Froya walked out of the tent, and the various leaders of the hunting team gathered at the magical array, watching the dwarf hills in the light ball in awe. terrain. From time to time, Fu Luoya adjusts the angle and scope of the light ball. A large, mysterious, dwarf underground kingdom filled with incredible things is barely exposed in countless greedy eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of this dwarf tribe is much larger than expected. Although there is no visible creature in the light ball, depending on the size of the dungeon, There are at least 5,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon is built in a huge area of ​​one square kilometer. The land is more than 50 meters high, and the tallest building in the Dwarf Underground City has reached more than 20 meters. The ground is semi-natural and semi-manually excavated, so that everyone can not help but admire these dwarves, can actually build such a magnificent underground city in a rock mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwarf tribe has created an underground city that looks like a miracle to mankind, what will be in the dwarf kingdom to the west of the Big Six? What about the scenery? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tunnel around the dungeon is as dense as a spider web. There are several passages that stretch westward, extending beyond the sphere of light, leading to the mysterious sunset. Mountains. What caught the attention of everyone was a mysterious huge tunnel. Judging by proportion, the diameter of this tunnel is more than ten meters, and the twists and turns lead to the depths of the underground. Fu Luoya adjusted the magic ball several times in a row, and could not see where the tunnel was going, and how long it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with such a large dwarf tribe, this man's hand in front of you should not say that you are full of sorrow, that is, winning is really difficult. But the victory is not without it. The brains of the capture team are all sophisticated and ingenious. The insidious and sinister nature is that the straight dwarves ride on the unicorns. Moreover, everyone has the ace of "The Curse of Fallen God." In addition, Fu Luoya's strong masses still can't touch the margins, and Rogge has always hidden some strength. God knows how many people in the room are hiding something! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least Jinggo’s fat man will never be a weak look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this moment the hunters know each other and the prey, but they still know nothing about the upcoming disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon sun has always been a favorite of the dwarves. Although the dwarf spends most of his life in the ground, no alpine dwarf will let go of the sun on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storm and hammers comfortably arrange themselves on a pile of rocks. The dark brown leather of the two dwarf warriors is very close to the color of the surrounding rocks, not very close to them, and the two dwarves are not present at all. The storm is sixty years older than the hammer, and the strength is naturally higher. The storm is a good hand for the Tomahawk. It is already an intermediate fighter, and the strength is already close to the senior soldiers. The storm's apprentice, the hammer, is still less than 50 years old. It is only a preliminary warrior. The weapon used to be used is the warhammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of strength, the storm has steadily entered the top two of the tribal warriors. The original work of the whistle was done by the early stage fighters, but more and more people in the tribe have become sick in the past two days. Fortunately, the condition is not heavy, most of them are just physical weakness, and they can barely mine. For the strong alpine dwarves, if you don’t get up, you won’t be sick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is a little worrying is that the wizards in the family are still unclear about the disease and there is no good way to treat it. Even three of the dozen or so wizards have also contracted this strange disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-hundred-year-old great wizard of the tribe is so sad that these days, the devil is about to return to the world, and the light will be tortured. It is also said that the devil's claws have extended to the tribe, asking the dwarf king to migrate the entire tribe. However, this request was categorically rejected by the Dwarf King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our king is still wise! I have never seen so many veins gathered together for more than 100 years! There is no place for underground There is warmth and dryness here. The taste of the ale made with the water here is different! Those who are greedy and jealous are at least a few hundred miles away, and their weak bodies can pass through the silent forest and the poisonous marsh. "The storm kept thinking about it, and couldn't help but sneak a few mouthfuls of wine." Warhammer has been lying on a big rock and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, in such a place, how can anyone come? Even large creatures are not owed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! A loud noise rang in the ears of the storm, and the whole world shook. The storm fell from the stone pile, and the helmet flew far away, with a dent on it. The storm only understood the loud noise just now. It turned out to be a heavy blow on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roared and climbed up, raised the tomahawk in his hand, looking around for the sneak attacker. thump! The hammer and the rope were also thrown off the stone pile. He fell down on the ground, and the personnel did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice came from behind the storm. "The dwarf is really strong, so he didn't get rid of such a heavy weight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm was shocked, and he quickly turned back and saw a gun-and-gun handle shining with milky white Expanded in front of your own eyes. The storm was black, and this time I finally lost consciousness. Before he was in a coma, he thought confusedly: "Why? Why are there holy knights attacking us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate carries a dwarf and throws it behind him. Dragon and beauty knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers quickly found the dwarf's tunnel exit. Kate looked at the deep hole and looked at Rogge behind him. "You said, what is the 'curse of the fallen gods' really useful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge faintly replied: "There is definitely something to use. You should also know where the thing came from."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dwarf was strong Ah, it’s not like eating medicine. If the dwarves are so strong, we can’t do it this time!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the quiet forest, there is a large camp. The poisonous insects and Warcraft that originally lived here must have given up the site. A little more fascinating World of Warcraft has realized the dangerous atmosphere of the camp, but there are still many unfortunate eggs that have not been able to escape, and become the excellent test material of Fu Luoya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream of screams rang in the camp. The dozens of dwarves caught in these two days are being tortured. In addition to the Golden Lion Knight, almost everyone in the camp is a good prisoner. From time to time, some fresh information will be tortured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central account of the camp is painted with a small but extremely complex magical array. A two-meter water polo floats on the magical array. The water polo shows the terrain of the dwarf underground kingdom. From time to time, there will be warriors coming in to report the latest tortured information. Then there will be more cursors in the water polo that represent various meanings. Slowly, the distribution of military power and important strategic locations in the dwarf dungeons are all marked on the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, everyone is very appreciative of the dwarf style of arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves have an unparalleled worship of their king of tribes. In their opinion, the Dwarf King 'Rage of the Flames' is enough to compete with any strong person in the world. He can at least deal with the 50 most powerful Dwarf Centennial Warriors! As for the hunting team, these jumping clowns, in the words of the dwarfs, are just a group of mice squatting under the dwarf king warhammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the warriors gave a lesson to these unopened dwarves, and they screamed. However, although the dwarves do not say anything, the contempt in the eyes is increasing. The warriors also have some helplessness about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the description of the dwarves, Rogge and others inferred that the Dwarf King had at least fifteen levels of strength. His 30 elite dwarfs of the 100-year-old warrior should be around ten, which is related to the strength of the Golden Lion Knights, and even slightly stronger. As for the one hundred superior soldiers, two hundred intermediate fighters and five hundred junior fighters, it is also very headache. There are more than 6,000 people in the entire dwarf tribe, and there are more than a thousand adult miners with some fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these dwarves, there are thousands of those who can be called qualified craftsmen. A thousand craftsmen! At least a minimum of 100,000 gold coins! Such a large dwarf tribe has survived for a long time, and the accumulated wealth and treasures are worth far more than 100,000 gold coins. If the tribe can have three or five very good magical equipment, the value will be more than 100,000 gold coins. Of course, although dwarf women and children are not as valuable as craftsmen, they are definitely not a loser. The dwarfs can grow into excellent craftsmen and warriors, and dwarf women tend to be more powerful than the human race men because of their racial superiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind of Rogge, there is still an idea lurking, why can't a dwarf woman train as a craftsman? The fat man thinks that it will be longer. The dwarf is not as arrogant as the elf, but the stubbornness is more than that. It is as difficult for them to shave their beards if they want them to work for themselves. But the dwarves with families are different. For a family's livelihood, the dwarf slaves will have to work hard for themselves. Therefore, the dwarf woman child Rogge is ready to eat, and it costs a lot more money. As for a few more mouths, it is a trivial matter. The profit of a top-grade weapon is enough to feed ten dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These have not calculated the value of the dwarf underground veins. That is the most amazing wealth, because there is a small gold mine in the hill below the hills. Although Froya's magical light ball is not clear, I believe everyone has seen it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although the dwarf tribe is surprisingly powerful, these benefits are enough to make people crazy. The thirty-year mining rights for a single vein are estimated to be at least two million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will retreat in front of piles of gold coins. Benjamin rushed to the Shadow Killer and the Dark Warrior, who had been secretly trained by the Clark Chamber of Commerce. Although these people are not many, only about 60 people, but each strength is enough compared with the Golden Lion Knight. These people are the top secret of the Clark Chamber of Commerce! It seems that in order to win the dwarf tribe in front of him, even the old fox Benjamin will be desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of great interests, this strange combination is more solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King "Rage of the Flame" is irritated and uneasily turned in the luxurious hall. He has never encountered so many trivial things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
