			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s room began to overflow with a burst of magical fluctuations. He stood in the middle of the room, and the flames of his body were flickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icelot, the ice-like, still sat quietly in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting the warning from the bone dragon, Rogge, driven by fear, began to take time to meditate and exercise mental skills. The idea of ​​*** is completely unpredictable. The next test does not know when it will come, and the consequences of the failure test, do not have to think that it must be terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just doesn’t know why *** is in a bad mood. This *** is now more and more like a master, although the bone dragon still calls Rogge the owner of the ‘master.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is now able to cultivate magic with confidence, because Ai Luo Luo finally smiled, although this has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed to 'satisfy the animal desires' on Froya, but Rogge’s mood is still rare and relaxing, and with a touch of unbearable The fiery temper, his heart, which was originally occupied by the conspiracy, began to move, quietly playing the idea of ​​several elves guarding the warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked back to the temple of God in a brisk manner, he saw the little goblin whispering something in the ear of Ai Luo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes the fat man surprised and happy is that this one day has not even talked to him about the ice puppet, and finally has a smile on his lips. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class completely underestimated the fatness of the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately puts the credit that Ai Luoluote has already laughed on his head. The class did not say that this little ice puppet must be because of him. Laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was relieved. As for how to make this little ice puppet laugh at tomorrow, it is tomorrow's troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was stunned by the little goblins today, he quietly called a gentle and fascinating elf guardian warrior, wanted to start, but no matter what he came to What, what, this little ice puppet will follow him. Under the gaze of the eyes with the ice wind, Roger's all-in-one desires disappeared without a trace, and he could only let the elf guardian warrior who snickered and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t always let Ai Luoluo always visit it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the flames disappeared, Rogge immediately remembered the test of ***. He scared a cold sweat and quickly went back to the house to repair it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Luo Luo is still behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple of God has been completely rebuilt, and the exquisite grandeur is second only to the Great Temple of the Elves. Now the whole temple makes the temple full of six stories, and more than ten spires are intricate, fully explaining the meaning of complexity and gorgeousness. God made a large lawn in front of the temple, and then a small lake that was as smooth as a mirror. The beauty of the scenery is the crown of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window of the top of the temple of God made it clear and dark, and the beautiful figure of Ai Luoluo was always fixed on the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the elves like this ice-like girl. The two guards of the gods made the elf warrior of the temple look at her silhouette with ecstasy, and suddenly felt inexplicably in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black and white shadow, like a ghost, flies in the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow light car touched the temple in front of the temple, watching the new window of the gods and the top of the window flashing magical light, the shadow can not help but A bit. After a little recognizing it, it finally slid into a five-story window that was still lit by light, like a light smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of this black shadow is so fast and light, all the elf guards are completely ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light breeze passed, and there was already one more person in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria didn’t raise his head: "If you want to steal something, the value is upstairs. If you want revenge, your enemy must be upstairs." If there is something to look for, just wait for a while, I don't care about you now, I don't see that I am busy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, this pot of tea is finally good. A hint of fragrance began to diffuse in the room. The little goblin sneaked slowly and relished for a long time. Then he smiled and looked up with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazed, I can’t believe it when I come to you! How come you become like this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is Androni, she has a long, messy chestnut, and her blue clothes are a bit dirty, and she has broken a lot." The mouth, if it’s not very decent cuts and a few expensive ornaments, this tattered dress looks like it’s better than a civilian in Dresden.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She lost a lot of weight, and there is a black smudge on her face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clean and honest Androni turned into this way, simply let Froya felt incredible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled tired and tired, let me wash first, then say hello?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria silently led Androni to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblins are eager to enjoy, and they are pure and clean, and there is a chance to be fake and private. Through God's rebuilding of the temple, she not only took a whole floor, but also completely remodeled her bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole bathroom is very large and full of natural atmosphere. Unknown vines are entwined on the ground and on the wall, with a hint of aroma. The green vines do not see a few leaves, but there are small flowers dotted around them. Walking barefoot on these vines, I feel that the soles of the feet are slightly sour and very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a flower tree in the corner of the bathroom, and the half-tree branches are slantingly stretched to cover most of the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the tree is an irregular bath like a natural pond. The bath has a radius of six or seven meters, more than one meter deep, made of natural stone, and the corners of the stone have been polished with magic by Fraya. Sitting in this bath, you can look out into the distant lake and the starry sky through the wide windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya reached out and pressed it on the wall, and a clear spring with a smoky water sprinkled from the flower tree, and it took a long time to fill the bath. The bath is cleverly constructed, and the water in the pool does not know where it vented. Although the spring is still being injected, the water in the bath is always full and overflowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled and said: "You will always make yourself very comfortable. The magician is really convenient!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her crystal ten fingers are like orchids blooming, after a dazzling array of complicated movements, the clothes on the whole body are quietly falling on the ground. No matter what the circumstances, Androni's hands will always be in perfect condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaps gently, the perfect body draws a dazzling smooth trajectory in the air, and plunges into the big bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a small dragonfly on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lasting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the splash of water, Androni slammed out of the water, low The lowland squats: "** ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of maroon long sticks on her face, the clear spring is falling from the tip, like Zhang Qihe The eyes are blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s flamboyant face is simply irresistible if it is mixed with a touch of beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya silently watched as she cleaned her own Androni, watching her carry the sun in the water, when it was hidden The perfect body, there is already a confused fog in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaned against the wall with some weakness, and the whole body was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie..." Froya finally couldn't help but screamed: "What happened to you? How could it be so thin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are hidden feelings and concerns in her words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni has nothing to say: "Nothing, the practice of practicing the sword is a little bit worse. It is all harmed by the dead fat man."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She touched her cheek and said to herself: "It’s much thinner." She looked down at her chest again, and the two groups of crystal nephrite were not very Big, but still abundance, perfect. Androni took a long breath and whispered: "Fortunately, okay..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly smiled and brushed The ground stood up from the pool, and then the whole person could not rise in the pool water, and finally only landed on the pool with the toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blue light of the starry sky, Androni is like an angel that will only appear in dreams. But her beauty is mixed with dangerous and deadly temptations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Fu Luoya, a pair of beautiful big eyes are smiling. At this moment, there is only one kind of feeling in Froah's heart...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria, am I still pretty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria nodded involuntarily . Looking at Androni under the blue halo, her heart suddenly jumped, making her breathless, and the silky smoothness on her fingertips...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled proudly and hooked Froya to the index finger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria All eyes are struggling and sad. She bites her lower lip. "Annie, I am so hard to have such a calm mood. It is impossible to turn back anyway. Why bother to provoke me?" Let me live alone and quietly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya shook his head, almost already pleading : Please let me go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is so much nonsense, give me down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In the laughter, Androni reached out and grabbed it, and Froya exclaimed, and the body flew involuntarily and landed in Androni's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the body of his body, the soft, star-shaped Fu Luoya, Androni smiled smugly, and then to the little fairy lavender The lips kissed down...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A splash, the splashes of water splashed, the two lingering beautiful ladies fell into the water...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of the outer world is always haze, the gale that whispers past always with the ice cold that can freeze the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of a mountain, a small team of unlucky Dark Knights was being slaughtered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is still scattered in the body of the ***, her hands are always caged in the chest sleeves, no intention to use the death sickle, nor even Will use her invincible right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The figure seems to be slowly passing through the Dark Knights, in fact very fast. At least Gregory is always unable to catch up with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which Dark Knight, as long as it enters the 10 meters round of the body, its skull will suddenly burst and smash, and a glimmer of dark light The fire of the soul then floated out under the helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool!" Bone Dragon can't find the right flattering, can only think in the heart.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory's two pairs of blue-black thin wings trembled and flashed in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now fighting The way has become much smarter. Whether it is the Dark Knight or any other undead creature, the degree is much slower than it. The huge advantage of the bone dragon utilization will be forced to less than one meter away from the Dark Knight in an instant. At a long distance, before the Dark Knight reacts, a small bit of dragon's breath will be sprayed on their helmets, forming a layer of blue crystals on them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the battle with Nicholas, the *** that has recovered is no longer worthy of death. The bone dragon completely couldn't see through how she slaughtered these dark knights, and the adoration was almost faint. But now it has no time to flatter, *** from time to time there will be a fire of souls floating out, bone dragon rushed to absorb, and then ran back to see which dark knight is not pleasing to the eye, then go find it unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the exhaustion, the bone dragon is happy. *** Has long since absorbed the souls of undead creatures. These dark knights are now tonics of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the extreme blind worship of ***, coupled with the progress of his own strength, Gregory has begun to imitate her fighting style. The bone dragon still has some self-knowledge, knowing that it is impossible to learn the current fighting style. The bone dragon is turned around a dark knight for dozens of laps, cursing the ancestors of the seventeenth and eighty generations before his death, and it is impossible for the dark knight to break a bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Gregory retreats to the next level, and now pays attention to the right to destroy the land with the right power, although every fight will always spend more A lot of strength. As for the degree of paranoia, Gregory is not much worse than *** and Rogge. No matter what kind of enemy you encounter, Bone Dragon adheres to its principle of enemies. Even if you often suffer a big loss, it will not die. Anyway, even if it is broken, it will be recovered by ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the bone dragon inhaled the soul of the last Dark Knight, the surrounding area was quiet, and the soul essence of dozens of Dark Knights became part of the bone dragon energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the bone dragon to sigh twice, *** will go to the far side. In the twinkling of an eye, her dreamlike figure appeared in the far side. The bone dragon even screamed for two sounds, and hurriedly chased it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside world is quiet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when, *** and Bone Dragon appeared on the peak of a lonely peak. *** Still volleyed on the edge of the cliff, the bone dragon floated behind her as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon took two strokes first, then carefully tested: "Master, he has been working very hard recently, how are you going to accept his strength?" What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** snorted and said coldly: “Work hard? Hey!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Smart bone dragon immediately changed his mouth: "Yes! He still has the mood to do those boring things<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is searching desperately in memory It recently learned a decent new word: "I remembered it! He also hooked up three! This is clearly not to put the command of the great omnipotent master in your eyes!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***No sound.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon is very wronged: "But the master's master is far away If you pass me, he will be the same as the magic of the emperor's "extra bound curse purgatory", you are not satisfied. And I am just a stupid bone dragon, using the second-rate starry air to breathe, and the power of breath is not complete, why not? This is a trivial matter for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** faintly authentic: "Gregory, your most recent courage is coming The bigger it is. You are just a stupid bone dragon, a stupid dragon, and occasionally a leaking mouth, it is also possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overwhelmed bone dragon fell from the air and fell heavily on the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! Great master! Wisdom master! I The loyalty to you is the same for thousands of years!" The bone dragon did not dare to fly again. It kept scratching the ground with four claws, screaming desperately: "Master! I will not dare again next time, look at I have been with you for so long, I don’t want to stare again! Master, I finally know that you are omnipotent and omniscient!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Silence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon finally stopped barking and flattering. It quietly fell to the ground and waited for it. The ruling of the ***. Bone Dragon faintly felt that this betrayal is not a trivial matter for ***. It is extremely guilty, subconsciously using the trembling claws to dig the soil.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first night when Rogge returned to the city of the gods was destined to be an uneasy night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is the darkest moment before dawn, and only the windows of the five and six floors of the temple are still illuminated by the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original five-story window reveals only a faint radiant glow. Suddenly, a dazzling strong blue light emerges, and then as many crystals burst. Crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth floor uploaded Froya’s cry, followed by her shy and angry cry: “Anne! You are going to die! What time is it trying to improve your vindictiveness?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intense blue light is once again lit up, this time the half wall of the fifth floor of the temple is collapsed. Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarmed elf guards recognized the familiar blue light, and the explosion came from the goblin that the elders of Lenius did not dare to provoke. Living, so they turned smartly and chose to turn a blind eye to everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria's painstakingly arranged bathroom was like a hurricane, vines and flower trees were gone, and even the stones that were built into the bath were thinned in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless shining stars that are slowly falling in the room. Their shimmering light casts a singular sensation on the tempting body of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took a look at the messy bathroom and the completely collapsed façade, a glimpse of Froya’s waist, and two people have appeared in the blink of an eye. Froya's bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni frowned, the five fingers of his right hand twisted and groaned, whispering to himself: "It’s a hell, how can you still not!" Br /> /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her starry and vindictive use of increasingly sophisticated, powerful and more horrible, although only a line from the sanctuary, but a little bit of the gap, sometimes is the end of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya, who was still struggling, suddenly quieted down. She stared at Androni: "Annie! You made it clear to me, this What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni came back to God, a guilty conscience, dare not look at Fu Luoya, he wants to mix . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya screamed. The sorghum's sound waves not only oscillated Androni's eardrum, but also spread out far and awakened countless elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clever elves chose to plug their ears, and they didn’t hear anything. Only Xiusi, who was flying back to his residence, showed a happy color. He smugly touched the small paper bag in his arms. The dark goblin is now in a state of turmoil. Should there be no new tea on the tea tree tomorrow? At this time, picking tea, although the taste will be a little worse, but it is better than nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of some hysterical Fu Luoya, Androni can no longer be confused, but whispered the cause and effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s eyes burned two raging fires, and she pushed her to death, letting Androni fall on the big bed. Androni is not able to hide from Froya's push, but she has a flaw in her heart, hoping to calm down the anger of the little goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to the power of the sacred domain, you can freely ** me? Luo Ya has completely ignored the image, she just wants to put the most vicious words He was on Androni.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni wandered up from the bed, his toes slightly, and came to Froya. I want to wipe away the tears that she sheds unconsciously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't touch me!" Froya opened her hand and angered "I was willing to get me started, I am willing; you are always feeling, I never care; you have her in my heart, I will leave it from now on, I am now confessed! But you have not let me go, In order to see the ghosts of the sanctuary will come back ** me, what do you think of me, how sad I am, do you know! If you look at me, you are willing to be willing!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria doesn't mean this..." Androni was at a loss, trying to explain in vain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to hear! You get out of me!" Froya screamed desperately, but her face was already in tears, quietly Leaked her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni whispered: "I'm sorry...well, let me go. But Froya, can you give me a dress..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! A long skirt fell on Androni’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni just hurriedly put on the long skirt, and was launched by Froya, and the door was slammed down. Then there are the crisp sounds of countless vases, wine glasses, teapots and the like on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked stunned and quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the things that can be dropped in the room were broken, Froya felt a burst of emptiness, shook, almost sat down Ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly fell to the bed and burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unusually large table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of the table is simple, the delicate carvings on the edges and at the feet of the table represent the highest artistic achievements of the Sala people. On the table, there are scattered rare magic crystals on one side, and the other side is packed with neat gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the long table, the fat man sat still, like a smile, his ears erected, and he was listening to the storm downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sky with the blue sky is inserted in this long table Less than a foot away from the face of the fat man, the starry air spurs his face with a slight pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s gaze gradually moved up, from the blade to the hilt, to the perfect hand of the sword, and then along the arm all the way, to the already Slightly thin and savvy shoulders, to the slender neck of the snow, and then moved up, finally saw the fascinating face of Androni's fierce, and sticking to the forehead, a few drops of water The chestnut is long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s gaze in Androni’s efforts to show a fierce pair of squats, another way down, to the blushing lips, snowy and slender The neck, a slightly bone-shaped clavicle, continues down, then stops there and does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked down and saw that she wore Furya’s long skirt, although she was taller than Froah’s head, but The chest can be far less plump than Fulua, so this long skirt does not fit at least in this part. And the neckline of the long skirt was low, and she leaned over and placed the sword on the long table in front of Rogge. So from the perspective of Rogge, the two groups of rich and soft nephrite and extremely tempting blush are almost invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Androni’s stunning color, it’s no wonder that the fat man will look straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s face was red, and a sense of frustration rushed into her heart. Just now, Froya had a big trouble, and it was impossible to know Rogge’s sensitive feeling. The guilty Androni wanted to suppress Rogge with a fierce arrogance, so that he would not dare to say a nonsense, and would not ask a question that should not be asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously, Roger did not care about her naked threat, only her bare body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath, pretended not to see Rogge’s fascinated eyes, and changed to sitting on the long table, and the blue sky was deep. A few inches, then snorted heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge still looked at her up and down with an unscrupulous gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya has a woman in every maxi dress, and she is on the side of Androni, who will never be known for her men’s wear on weekdays. Give it a thorough display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the unfinished water drops make the long skirt tightly attached to Androni, not only highlighting all her curves, translucent long The skirt also makes her skin like ice cream looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was trembled, but she was calm and self-satisfied. If nothing happened: "You haven't seen it before, can you use this look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and a smile, there are not many beautiful people like you in the world. How can it be enough to see it again? Moreover, this is the first time I saw you put on a women's dress... Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about women's clothing?" Somehow, Androni actually has some tension. She would like to know Rogge's evaluation of her women's wear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s too *** a woman!" The fat man’s eyes were lighted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was ashamed and angry, but a heavy stone in his heart was quietly put down. She immediately remembered the business, and leaned forward again. The long, slender index finger of her right hand gently picked up Rogge's chin and chuckled and said: "Little Rogge, there is something to be cheaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sanctuary?" Rogge laughed from the heart. "I don't mean you, Annie, you are beautiful, but to seduce the man's effort, it is too far away from the Princess's Highness. How can it be so straightforward!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;Andnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni fainted on her face, shy and anger, and her right hand slightly moved, and it was turned from smashing Rogge's chin to buckle his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your style, I like it!" Despite the difficulty in breathing, Rogge still has a smile that can't be hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less nonsense!" Androni finally murdered, she approached Rogge's face and bit his teeth: "I tell you, for the sanctuary, I am going out of everything! You can't do it, don't do it to someone else!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My motto has always been that it is cheaper than cheaper others. Me! How can I not do it? What's more..." Rogge smiled in amazement. "Don't blame me for not advising you in advance. It is useless to go to someone else. It is just a loss."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s five fingers in the right hand slowly loosened one by one, and she suddenly wanted to pinch the fat man who was at risk. He clearly occupies a big bargain, but he also has to put on a helpless expression that is reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie," the fat man who just got free from her five fingers still bravely provoked, "Although I like your straightforward character, but in front of others, you still Convergence is good, so as not to make people laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked around and said: "Besides you and me, there are others here... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly took a sip of coldness and saw Ai Luo Luo who was sitting quietly in the corner of the house. Somehow, Androni didn't feel her presence at all, just thought it was a bit cold in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the quiet gaze of the little ice puppet, Androni was extremely embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, it’s too messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni calmed down and decided to attack. She came to Ai Luoluite and reached for her chin. She chuckled and said: "Small ice man, temporarily use your fat man, don't worry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Ai Luoluo stood up and slipped back a small step, just passing Androni’s finger, and then coldly said: “Do not borrow.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dronie was a little surprised. She once again reached out to pick the minibus of the little ice. This time, the fingertips have been brought with a faint blue glow, and they are picked up by lightning from Ai's chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Luoluote slid back like a slid on the ice, while a small mouth, squirting a chill, condensed into a small face in front Ice shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s fingertips jerked on the ice shield, but they never wear it. But this can't help her. Androni fiber pointed suddenly sinking, lightning bolted on the lower edge of the ice shield, the ice shield suddenly hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then this snowy slender finger rested on Aylot’s chin and scornfully lifted her little face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took back his fingers and borrowed it with smug smiles. Since you want to see it, let you have a look, Xiao Bingren. "She looked at Roger's long table of gold coins, frowned and frowned. Do you want to change the place, so as not to ruin your gold coins, your dead money fans are still not heartbroken. Also, help me find two sets of fitted clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and pointed at the bedroom, watching Androni go in. He then called a tall elf guardian warrior and ordered two sentences. The guardian warrior had a reddish face and hurried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether Rogge and Androni are willing or not, Azerot still follows the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the careful elf care, Rogge's spacious bedroom is very clean. The fat man quickly puts fragile and expensive art and priceless magical materials into another room, which makes him feel relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni silently watched Rogge finish all preparations, then took a deep breath and his face became pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closed her eyes and there was a trembling in her voice, biting her teeth: "Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge gave a faint brilliance. With Furoya's foresight, and the painful lessons of that night, he used his mental strength to protect his body early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Luo Luote also burst into a milky white chill in his body, condensed into dozens of small ice shields, and hid himself properly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge came behind Androni, tapping on her shoulders, and she sat obediently on the edge of the bed. In the face of such a big meal, Rogge does not want to be too anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will roll up for Androni, revealing the slender neck of the snow. Then his finger gently clicked on her back neck and slowly slid down the spine. Rogge's fingers fell, and Androni's skin quickly ignited a small cockroach, and the beautiful flaming red began to spread throughout her body. Under the creamy skin, her muscles are completely tightened, harder and harder, and she will suddenly and violently bounce off Rogge's fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other hand stroking Androni’s arm at the same time, all the way down, holding a grip in her hand, then falling Her lap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Froja's slippery softness, Androni's every inch of skin is crystal clear with an amazing stretch. The feeling of uploading the fingertips at this moment almost suffocated Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her extremely tempting body, on the other hand, she must be wary of starbursts that may explode whenever and wherever possible, under extreme tension and stimuli. Although it was only a short period of time, Rogge had begun to see sweat on his forehead and his hands were a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is also suffocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Roger’s hand slowly moved up her thigh, Androni finally couldn’t help it, and a scream accompanied the starry air . Fortunately, Rogge had long been prepared, and she tried to restrain herself. It was just that the fat man was only bounced off a few meters away. When the vindictiveness disappeared, Androni was almost collapsed, and fell on the bed weakly. He whispered: "No! I can't stand it, or... or next time."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge climbed up, did not continue to be difficult for Androni, just sat next to her, quietly admiring her stunning position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni fell on the bed, suddenly his shoulders shook and whispered out. She choked: How did it become like this! What have I done for the damn Sanctuary power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently ignored her Long, Shen Shen said: "Your strength is definitely enough... Otherwise, you go to the South, let your teacher Mr. Prossis give you guidance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took up the sorrow and looked up at Rogge and shook her head. Although she was very strong and quietly wiped away the tears, but beautiful The big eyes still look a little red and swollen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed: "The teacher said that only the path of the sanctuary that you explored will have potential for exhibition. . Miss Ben does not want to enter the sanctuary even if it is over. What's more..." She glanced at Rogge and hated the earth: "I have to take care of you, this fat man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni didn't care about him, just stunned. She suddenly asked: "You know it anyway, you said, I have treated Furoya just too much, isn't it too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled People who laugh more and more achievements will be very paranoid in one aspect. Think about it, how many strong people have the power of the Sanctuary in the world? If you are so young, you will reach this point. If it is not out of paranoia about power, even if you are talented, it is impossible. And each of us will have one of the most important goals for a while, and everything else is not important in order to achieve this goal. Even if you have to pay some price for it, as long as you don't feel regretful in the future, then you can. We have only been in our life for only a few decades, and we don’t have to look ahead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But" Rogge smirked and said: "You did a bad thing this time, but you didn't get any benefit at all. It can only be said to be too stupid." . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was ashamed and angry, sat up, raised his hand and wanted to give him a slap in the face. The hand waved into the air, she hesitated, It was put down again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to have the power of the Sanctuary, it is useless to rush, let it be." Rogge advised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was silent for a moment before he whispered: "I will think about it again, I can't come back to you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked out of the bedroom and saw that the Elf Guardian had placed a whole set of clothes on the outside, even in the underwear. It is no wonder that the guardian warrior would blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned around and waited for Androni to change his clothes before turning back.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly said thank you to the fat man with a fine mosquito sound, and then waited for him to react, and went out through the window and hurriedly fled.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and thought about it: "Thank me for what?" How do you thank me? What do you want to thank me? Hey, haha!" The more he wanted to get worse, the more he wanted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Androni didn’t notice that Ai Luo Luo, who has always been inseparable from Rogge I didn’t follow it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in front of Ai Luo Lu, a faint figure, like a slowly floating from the water, is gradually Become clear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** appears as a ghost in front of Ayellot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Her right hand was looming, like a phantom without physicality, and it was directly inserted into Ai Luoote's chest. In a blink of an eye, *** took a fist-sized ice crystal from her chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be another world in ice crystals, where the hurricane whistling, the lead clouds are rewinding, the wind and snow are all over the sky, just like the world presented by Ai Luoluo. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The eyebrows are slightly wrinkled, and the silver eyes are staring at the ice crystals. After a while, they said: "It's not that hard. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The left hand was raised and a little golden light began to condense on the fingertips.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There was a mourning sigh of the bone dragon in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Ai Luoluote, the world of ice wind faded and replaced with a sea Azure blue. She seems to have regained her anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Luoluo gently pulled the hand of the ***, shook his head firmly, only said: "No. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Looking at the calm and determined ice puppet, asked faintly: "I can do things that I can't do." Are you sure you want to give up? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Luo Luo slowly but firmly nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***No What to say, just put the ice crystal back into the body of Ai Luoluote.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her figure gradually blurred, and disappeared in a blink of an eye.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge, who was taking the little song, returned to the bedroom, and he suddenly caught a smile in the corner of Ai Luoluote’s mouth, and it was shocked and immediately rushed to the window. , observe the sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
