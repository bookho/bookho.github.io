			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of pain in the heart pulled Qi Wei back from the coma to reality, she squinted and tried to touch the wound, but her hands were still moving. Another big pain came, this time she was completely awake. The fat face in a nightmare slowly clears in front of the eyes, the face is so close, and even the pores on the nose can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei was so scared that he screamed instinctively, and he instinctively wanted to jump and get away, but his hands could not move behind him, he lost balance and fell heavily on the table. . There was another huge pain in the buttocks, but this time she almost fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beauty, don't be so scared. The night is still growing." The fat face that is close at hand reveals a sly expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei was a little calmer and observed his situation. The room was large, and a dozen candles on the chandelier hanging from the ceiling lit the room brightly. The furniture in the room is still brand new. It can be seen at a glance that it is made of inferior wood, but it also makes the golden wall look brilliant. The owner's taste can be imagined. However, Qi Wei is more worried about herself. She quickly put her hands firmly behind her back and lying on a large experimental table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s hand holds a small pliers, holding a blood-stained arrow, carefully looking in front of his eyes, throwing it aside and reaching out I provoked Qi Wei’s chin. "Haha, it’s really good. Now why not be fierce? Call me? Is it true that you have to be rude to you? Are you beautiful? It’s a place, it seems to be a genius archer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warrior snorted and bite into the handcuffs of Rogge. Roger quickly closed his hand and grabbed her head and pulled it up hard. Qi Wei’s face showed a painful look, and the entire upper body was pulled up and the curve of the chest was revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s hand touched it, and Qi Wei felt as if a cold snake was crawling on his body, but he was caught and his struggle was limited. Tears finally couldn’t stop flowing from the closed eyes. Qi Wei is still taller than Luo Ge, and the skirt and breastplate have been taken off by Rogge in the coma. The bare hips are huge and full, and the waist is suddenly thrilled and thin, and the legs are long and straight. Bodybuilding. Let Rogge see the fire rising, holding the buttocks of the female warrior. He was so hard, the fingers were deeply immersed in the slippery buttocks, followed by the waist, and they entered the softness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candlelight in the small building sways in the hoarse curse of the female warrior, the inferior experimental table "Oh yeah" squats, can not bear the burden of two people . The devil dances in the fire, and the grievances are hysterical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge trembled, the tide-like pleasure intertwined with the joy of revenge, and every piece of fat he trembled. The darkest darkness in the bottom of my heart is boiling, constantly impacting each of his nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring of the early spring is still cold, when the wind blows, the unopened spring flowers have also withered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smugly sings a little song and looks at the snow-white lamb that he has captured. The soreness in his body seems to sing. Not long ago, this lamb was still the real lion. Rogge put on his clothes and decided to go to Ette and take a look at his prey. The only thing that made him unhappy was Qi Wei’s eyes. Thoroughly cold, no sorrow, no anger, no empty, just cold looking at the fat man. Rogge felt like a frog stared at by a snake. He didn't like it. He added a rope to Qi Wei, and naturally touched a few more. Qi Wei has no reaction, just like being touched by his own body, or watching the fat man quietly like a snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s hastily left, almost to escape the murderous gaze. The best way is of course to kill people, but Rogge still has no courage. It’s a pity to say that such a beautiful woman has killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete several people rushed to the small building. In the small building, just like a storm, things have been messed up. A few people called the bad, rushed to the second floor to see, the large experimental table is empty, and the rope used for binding is broken into several segments. Kate picked up the broken piece of the rope and looked back. He said, "This is hard to be broken. God! It can be broken by such a thick rope. Is she really caught by you?" Rogge remembered the female warrior. The vindictive flash of the body, a cold sweat on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete is the oldest, has a rich experience, and calmed down first. "Don't be afraid of everyone, the other party still doesn't know who we are. But Rogge, you can't stay in this small building." Everyone slowly calmed down. As soon as the panic passed, Rens brains became alive and afraid that they would come to set fire to the building. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
