			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak of the Lich Elgara is now standing alone on the land of the outer world. The forests of undead creatures have disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of heavenly patrols around the mountain with lightning thrown by the thunder, and the black edges of the burnt knots are like the giant mouth of the monster. It looks like Such a shocking. A pile of strange and huge skeletons and the remains of undead creatures scattered on the surrounding ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lifelessness within a hundred miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving undead creatures have already deeply hid in the ground and shivered in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purple meteor appeared on the top of the mountain, and a beautiful curve was drawn in the air. It has already crossed a long distance in the blink of an eye and fell to the ground. Up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteor suddenly turned a corner, almost flying across the ground, and the strong winds brought a few boulders to fly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteor turned out to be a transparent light ball with a lavender ray, and the center is a purple fat man, who is dragging forward and rushing forward Flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pile of white bones on the ground suddenly moved, and the bone dragon Gregory jumped up from the white bones and yelled at the purple meteor: " Master! Master! I am here, don't throw me down!!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tries to flap the wings and even chasing the purple meteors Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteor is like electricity, and disappears on the horizon in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon stopped and stepped down and lowered his head. The wings are also slouched and gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to suddenly know what it feels like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gale came from the horizon, and after the purple light flashed, the huge purple flow had stopped in front of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has always felt that the whole world is bright! It jumped up and screamed excitedly: "Master! You didn't leave me! You are so great! Master, how have you become so powerful? Are you cheating something! You It’s too sinister, too mean...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is crying and laughing, and mentioning the bone dragon in one hand, I shut up! I can't support it for a long time, and the old guy will definitely see the truth! The farther you run, the better! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly there was a wave of spiritual fluctuations: "Gregory, my other legions?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! They were either destroyed in battle or killed by the guy who flew down in the sky. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only one of you left? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! the host! Speaking of it, it’s really a wonderful trick to pretend to be dead! I still learned from the owner of the master! He is too sinister! Too..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! Rogge is furious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple meteor disappears in the clouds of the outer world in a blink of an eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the temple of the summit, the Lich Errga is violently thundering! It has been fooled by himself, and is now discussing with other kings how to deal with the behavior of publicly challenging the first law.<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> Gera, this time they fooled your wisdom. "A violent spiritual fluctuation reached the temple of Elgar, with a little ridicule in the words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergra replied coldly: "Yes This is my fault! I did not think that this soul will be so powerful. This soul is terrible. It not only retains consciousness, but also knows to disguise itself as a group of unconscious spiritual energy. It seems that the jump of space does not affect its existence at all. Even more frightening is that it also masters ‘erosion’! The Dark Dragon Altar is used to extract energy, not to seal the soul. Its defense is external and not internal, and it will make the soul awkward and get out of trouble. Now the Dark Dragon Altar has been completely absorbed by it! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it erosion?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Erosion finally appears in the world of death!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spiritual fluctuations in the air suddenly increased. It can be seen that the kings are very excited, even with a hint of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another spiritual turmoil has crossed the vast space, this spirit fluctuates from an even more ancient existence: "The soul is not strong. Special abilities are not a substitute." Absolute strength. In the face of the eight kings, 'erosion' is not terrible. By contrast, I think the youngest king is our truly worthy opponent."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergra is very respectful to the owner of this spiritual fluctuation, but when he thinks of ***, he can’t help but anger: "*** is really crazy! She does not hesitate The patrols who attracted the heavens will also come to snatch the soul that belongs to me! The fire of respectful wisdom, she completely ignores the existence of the first law, we should unite to seal her completely, the respected dragon of the abyss is sleeping The Bone Emperor is still changing. Otherwise, the power of the six kings is enough to suppress her strength and not let the heavenly patrol know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The fire of wisdom is silent for a while, and again: "The king of the world of death is very difficult The power of the five kings could not completely prevent her from escaping. Once she escaped, and then led the patrol, it will be the end of the entire world of death. Moreover, since the soul has mastered the power of erosion, and the world of death There should be a deep connection. In this case, the respected Elgar, it seems that the soul is very important to the ***, the young king's personality is extremely persistent, let it get the soul. But your dark The altar of the dragon was destroyed, and I suggested that she should use the 'Lemon Lotus Armor' as compensation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other kings discussed it and agreed. Elgra also has some heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The demon lotus armor' has almost immune protection against most physical attacks, without affecting any magical cast, which relies on powerful magic. For the Lich, it is indeed a treasure that is hard to find. Dressed in the erotic lotus armor, Elgar, the strength in the king may jump to one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a *** who has the ability to 'swallow', recreating a demon lotus armor may not take hundreds of years, compared to her The first law is a publicly challenged act, and the wisdom fire proposal can be said to be very generous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings did not hide their spiritual fluctuations. They knew that the same kings would be able to hear their suggestions and respond. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a cave halfway up the mountain, Rogge and *** are listening to the arguments of the kings. At this moment, Rogge looked very weak, and there was only a faint purple color on his body. In front of him, there are four dark five-headed dragon statues shining with soft luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This proposal is good! 'Demon Lotus' is good, but it is a lot worse than the four dark five-headed dragons. So, four The Dark Dragon is one by one. There are two dark five-headed dragons, you can make a better armor." After listening to the advice of the kings, Rogge immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***After a moment of silence, suddenly a spiritual wave was heard, and this wave of hurdles reached the kings: "I refuse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why!" Elgara screamed in anger: "You challenged the first rule and ruined my dark dragon altar! Now I only want you one Armor as compensation, you have to refuse! ***, you are too arrogant! Do not think that with the strength of the king you can do what you want in the world of death! When the seven kings gather, you absolutely can not call Heavenly patrols! You are for an armor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly cut off the spiritual connection with the kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked strangely at *** what did not agree with them? Judging from the power of the lich, these seven guys are not good at all! The lich thought the altar was ruined, but I didn't expect it to be made by four dark dragons. With these dark dragons, it's easy to make a helmet like a demon! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon also looked at the two very strangely. It suddenly said that the owner has been using the spirit to fluctuate in communication, and did not say anything at all. Recently, the owner is Talking often!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is even more strange. He reaches out and touches the monster of the devil. Is this armor part of your body? Too much, how did this happen? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon couldn’t help it anymore. It suddenly asked: "Master, the devil is not..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The hand suddenly disappeared, the death knife did not hold it, and fell down, just on the big head of the bone dragon. Today’s death sickle is extremely heavy, even the big half of the bone dragon I broke into the ground! I also smashed the words behind the bone dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon is very clever, and after pulling out his head with difficulty, he immediately angered: "These kings are too bullying! They even made such rude demands! The devil has given them, how do you still live! This is simply equivalent to giving me four paws and a tail to them! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** immediately nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge instinctively felt a little weird, He stared at the left and right, but he couldn't see why the 'demon lotus' was not a pair of armor. However, he didn't know much about the world, and he was more and more confused. Finally, the fat man's gaze fell on the pair of white wings, seeming to think of something.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** 浑 , , , , , , , 浑 浑 浑 浑 浑 浑 浑 浑The same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the brush, her wings have been closed, the leaves of the demon lotus are also closed, the wings are tightly covered, a feather is Don't show it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s mind is moving, floating up, wanting to go around the *** to see. Suddenly, his eyes are black, then It was a whirlwind, and it was taken by the slashing knife to the volley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene, the bone dragon does not dare to look at it, and does not want to see it, it Turned around, but secretly sewed from his bones* *着.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge managed to find the balance and smiled a bit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* ** I have always been unpredictable. The fat man has always been afraid of his pet. Where can he dare to use it? He doesn’t know why he is angry, he wants to know and dare not ask.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's do it," Rogge got another idea. "We can talk to the old guys again. I will give them a powerful soul in the future, and this is the case. If they don't agree, we will bring the patroller now and ruin the world. I will summon you to my world for a while, wait for the limelight to pass, let's come back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also a king." The king has the dignity and the law of the king. ***Wang Wan has resolutely rejected this proposal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you escape?" *** asked again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I was dead, I was lost when I was awake, and I was trapped in the Dark Dragon Altar." This altar relies on the dragon flames produced by the four dark dragon statues to refine the soul into pure energy. The bastard used by the old bastard of Elgra thinks that I am just an unconscious soul. After throwing me in the altar, I have been Did not manage me. Damn, Laozi is also a genius to kill, even if ... even if it is really dead, Laozi soul will be dead! The old bastard hasn't been able to make Laozi a few days, but it is very happy. The more difficult the soul is, the more energy it produces. The more pure the grid, the more it stretches its body. His body now seems to be condensed with a lavender transparent gel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is ‘erosion’?” asked ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a very strange ability, it's no big deal, it should be from Rodriguez's memory!" Speaking of the old Necromancer, Rogge The purple light of the whole body suddenly dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, he said: "When the altar draws my strength, I suddenly feel that the spirit can extend this suction to the dark dragon statue, understand After its properties, it can temporarily control it, and even transform its ontology and power into pure magic that can be used by me. However, the control is easier and the conversion is much more difficult. I am here and this time. A few dragons fight, this controls them. If you are not here, I have to stay in the altar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Still silent, thinking about something. After a while, she suddenly said: "Teach me the erosion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stunned, some embarrassed: "Let you know that this ability is not Difficult, but it seems that this is the unique ability of the Necromancer. You have eaten two angels. There are many saints in power, and you can't use it." But to say that Rogge is still in the palm of his hand. A light black ball was handed over to ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Inhaled the ball of light into the eyebrow immediately, the eyes of the devil's mask closed and began to understand the secret of 'erosion'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stared at the devil's mask of the left and left, but he just used erosion to control the four dark dragons and almost exhausted his mental power. It is now impossible to penetrate the protective field of ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the most intense battle, *** will appear. At that time, Rogge was innocently concerned about the demon lotus armor. It was beautiful and ugly. This is the first time he has quietly observed *** at close range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the devil's mask, the ***'s demon lotus armor is actually a very beautiful and gorgeous body armor. The smooth lines, the ethereal sensation, and the decorative patterns all have a beauty that is completely outside the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the devil is very good at sketching out the perfect body of ***...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge stared at the curve of ***, looking left and right, and his heart became more and more confused. He suddenly turned his head and looked at the eye bone dragon. Gregory panicked and turned his head immediately, a rogue frame of ‘I don’t know anything’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is crying and laughing, knowing that from the timid bone dragon, there is absolutely nothing to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the eyes of the devil mask opened again, and the pupils of the blood red eyes suddenly flashed a silver light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown why, Rogge’s heart jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Learn to erode?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why should you learn to erode? I have not said this ability." Not for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is even more strange:" Defense? I have come from the memory of the old guys of Elgara. None of the monarchs in the world of death have mastered the erosion? Who are you defending? Also, your strength is so strong, and you are so fast. Even if the kings will erode, it is impossible to control and transform your power. Is it defensive? Is it defensive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just defend you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was shocked and laughed. But there is no reason to talk about it. Even though the fat man has now mastered the erosion, it is far from being an opponent of the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the eyes of the fat man suddenly saw that the bone dragon was nodding hard, a copy should look like this. The more strange he is, is it really necessary to defend against erosion? In order to compete for her own soul, she did not hesitate to move the war between the kings! Although Rogge did not see the huge army of the ***, but inferred from the number of the army of Elgar, the same squad of the king, the number of the legion must not be too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now the ***, but only the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly remembered that in the past every time he was in distress, at the last minute, he always relied on *** to clean up for him. One of the potential reasons is that there is a strong ***. In the heart of Rogge, ***, is still the unruly pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, *** has his own body and has his own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that she still has her own feelings...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Rogge suddenly thought, Will she hurt too? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge didn't dare to think about it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the return is faint, cold and cold . But Rogge felt that there seemed to be a volcano below the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you going to deal with those kings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can't help me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if the seven kings join forces, I feel that they have the ability to set up a strong enough barrier to trap you, and will not let the heavenly patrols feel Since you are not willing to give them the devil, or I should return the dark dragon to Elgra, maybe they will accept this proposal." Rogge said with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I refused." *** replied categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed, and he understood that *** would never compromise in front of these tough kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty does not understand, although the demon lotus armor is already an artifact, but for the sake of one thing, it is the enemy of the seven kings of the death world, it is worth ? Rogge already knew that the saying that ‘demon lotus’ was part of her body was not true at all. Although the fat man didn't know when she learned to lie, but the fat man was a big lie, and he heard that *** didn't tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man carefully thought about some of the magic knowledge scanned from the memory of Elgra, and involuntarily played a cold war! The magic of the Lich Elgar has gone far beyond Froya, and has entered the sanctuary as early as a thousand years ago. If so, the king of the world of death should have the strength of a person with a holy name in the world. If you don't care about the Heavenly Patrol, the Lich Ella is alone, and *** may not be its rival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not going to go back? Your elves are in trouble!" *** interrupted Rogge's thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, at the time of their own ‘death’, what trouble did the elves encounter? I have clearly arranged everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man really remembers that the battle of the seven kings of the city of gods is more affecting his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog’s hand waved, and the four dark dragon statues flew up. He put the four statues in the hands of the ***. With these four dark dragon statues, whether they are made into armor or turned into weapons, they are equivalent to a powerful artifact. Although it is still not enough to ensure that she defeats any of the kings, at least the grasp of escape has increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Significantly, she knows that Rogge’s nature is by no means a generous person, she knows that after mastering the 'erosion', these four How big is the role of the Dark Dragon statue on Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog thought about it, still not at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He condensed a drop of bright silver water on his fingertips. The little water droplets are scattered with an indescribable breath and are part of Rogge's soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger printed the drop of water on the chest that was still in the chest, and then a silver drop appeared on the 'Lemon Lotus Armor' badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes..." The powerful *** suddenly had some stuttering.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog smiled slightly This mark, if the kings find you, I will know and know how to come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice suddenly became softer, "***, you used to be my pet. I don't know when you have your own consciousness, and you don't know when you got rid of the contract. But now, I treat you as a friend. In fact, when you are still in the dwarf kingdom, you have completely independent wisdom. I just learned from the memory of Elgar, even the king can be destroyed, not to mention the power of your time. Far from reaching the king's point? At that time, in fact, you are probably not going to be born again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The first time, in the soul It's a blank, I don't know how to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
