			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midday sun has gradually slanted, but the heat has not diminished. Fortunately, in the mountains and lush forests, it is far less hot than the plains, and it is much cooler than the big city like Lille. Even at noon, any shade of the trees can make you sleep for a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stretched out and woke up. He leaned over the branches of the towering old trees and leisurely looked at the blue sky above his head through the heavy leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little black crystal lay quietly on his chest, occasionally flashing seven colors of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge unconsciously chewed the blades of grass in his mouth, thinking about the magic system of the devil. This magical energy, mainly devastating and dark, is not in harmony with his own magic of death, but it is not completely impossible to coexist. He has gradually figured out how to turn his magic into a dark magic, just too slow. Even if he casts a negative energy impact beam, the minimum level of magic takes a lot of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the doll spell, it made him dizzy at first glance. A seemingly simple magic, in fact, combines extremely deep space magic, spiritual magic, cursing magic knowledge, and requires extremely high magic and magic manipulation. Looking at it, it seems that the difficulty is no less than any eighth-order magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a bit and put it aside for a while. Just look at the magic of Elysses on the same day, and Froya has almost no power to fight back, so I should know the horror of this magic. However, this doll magic seems to have some places that make him difficult to understand. For example, the triple spell alone makes him puzzling. Can he still have three mouths while not cursing? This may not be a problem in the devil, but he only has one mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little faint magical energy in the body that suddenly jumped a few times. Rogge smiled a little, and he knew that the chase behind him was not too far away. Although this magical fluctuation is weak, it is very clever and it is estimated that it can be transmitted to a very long distance. But this type of tracking magic can only determine the general position of his own, he still has a great chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This faint magical fluctuation can only be achieved with a specific receiving item. If Roger's mental power is huge and unremarkable, he is extremely sensitive to the induction of magical energy, and it is really impossible to be traced to the magic mark. He found a total of two magical markers. The strange thing is that there is still no movement at all, and it is more hidden and difficult to find. It seems that it has been going on for quite a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will do it? Rogge didn't want to think about it anymore, anyway, this person will track it sooner or later. At the moment, I will deal with the hunt after the **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few days, he has already touched the terrain of this belt. Now it is gradually expanding the scope of the search, looking for a suitable ambush location, but also to see if this has nothing to do with Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know the specific identity of these chasers, it is estimated that the Tenth Meeting is the holy knights of the church, and there should be many law enforcers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers have just entered the mountain, they have already caught up to a lot of distance, it seems that the heart is very enthusiastic. Rogers groaned and smiled viciously: Anyway, there is only one person in Laozi. I don't believe that you are a group of people who are faster than Laozi. How come with two magicians? Even if the law enforcer is a warrior who specializes in dealing with the magician, the end to the upper magician alone is probably not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, if I have nothing, I will take you to run hundreds of miles and toss it for half a month!" He took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sky, he took back the eyes of the wizard who was hanging high in the sky, jumped out of the tree, and quickly walked deep into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days and three nights of rushing in the mountains, the church's pursuers are not far from Rogge. On a small hill, Karajan and Chrisma stood on the horse and looked at the terrain ahead. The entourage disbanded the formation and began to rest and prepare food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carayan carefully took out a highly polished gold disc and began to infuse the Holy Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the disc slowly glows, and after a ripple, a small spot appears in the north. Carayan carefully counted the scales on the disc. After a long while, he looked up and said: "We are only a hundred and twenty kilometers away from the pig. We have been close to at least two hundred kilometers in these three days. Road. It seems that in three days, he will be caught up by us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many twists and turns, Kara Yang’s arrogance has also converged a lot. He calculated it carefully in his mind. If we split into two teams, a small team will track it quickly, and the brigade will follow the shortcuts in the back. What do you think of this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chrisma thought for a moment and nodded: "This is also good." You are familiar with the ‘Tianjing Roulette’ application, and you will be led by five knights and five law enforcement officers. I will lead the team. You also bring three of the five jungle parade who are good at tracking. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang smiled and smiled, I want to let this pig know the history! I really admire him, nailed the magic circle, hands and feet They are all worn by the iron chain and can still run away. They are not slow to run! I don’t think we should catch it, just kill it with a head and go back.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Chrisma shook his head. "Cara Yang, the last time you nailed his hands and feet, it was almost always seen by the adults of Augustus. This time, no matter how you can not violate the will of the adults. After all, catching Rogge is only one of our tasks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang lowered his voice and said: "I see, the adult may not recover to the original level after this injury. You know, the wing What does it mean to be destroyed? We will have a lot of opportunities in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma also whispered: "There are several angels coming this time." Ten, it is difficult to ensure that other people will not compete with us. We are better not to act rashly, first to see the situation and then say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang nodded: "Advent The people who came down were scattered throughout the Big Six. How many of them would come directly to the Church of Light as we did? Even if we could survive the integration of the body, not everyone could cope with the sudden changes in the body in the future. After we have mastered the church, are we afraid that we can't clean these people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma feels right, there is Dess sitting in the church, if there is any chance, he will not let go. However, he suddenly had a cold war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cara Yang also felt, turned his head and said softly: "The Pope..." The voice was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crisma sighs that the Emperor is neither an advent nor an angel of reincarnation. If...he is really just an ordinary human in this space, how can it be, how can it be so powerful! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang couldn't answer it, recalling the great power of the mountain shaken between his hands and feet on the day, and a sense of powerlessness rose from his heart. It was Orpheq's stunned and unrelenting power. It was him, and it would be a big problem for the Pope to stand up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment, Chrisma said again: "Do you remember the angel who came to this world in the first time?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang nodded and said that Wella? She seems to be somewhat different from ours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma sighed and said that in order to try this new way, she was a specially created angel whose strengths were strengthened. You know the ending of her later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information in the moment of Kara Yang’s silent moments does not contain any information about the origins of the Necromancer. The angels who have been reborn are also recorded. The movement of the power world has been under surveillance for hundreds of years. Is it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one explanation." Chrisma said: " He was originally a creature of this world. He cultivated it a little bit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never even thought about this space, someone could beat it. Na. You know that when she was still in the heavens, it was not easy for us, these nine-order angels, to look directly at her light, to hurt the world!" Kara Yang was disheartened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma looks at the endless mountains, faintly said: "Which world we were conquering was easy to pass? But isn’t the last victory not a heaven? Even if we fail, the Supreme Lord will look at it here. At that time, who can fight against the omnipotent Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carla Yang sighed: "At that time, I don't know who the Lord's spokesperson in this world would choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not." Kara Yang smiled confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a distant mountain, Andrei stood in the middle of an old tree, with a positive eye and a chestnut-colored fluttering in the gale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He distinguishes all kinds of information from the wind, playing with a lilac crystal ball in his hand. This crystal ball can track the magic mark in Rogge's body, but he doesn't plan to use it yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using this item needs to resonate with the magic mark in Rogge's body, and God knows that the fat man who is full of tricks will not notice anything. Anyway, there are groups of church people in front of him to hunt him, why do you need to follow the fat pigs, as long as the people hanging from the church can be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s best for them to lose both sides, and then shoot yourself again so that both things can be put into their pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly chuckled, how he is now more and more sinister, just like the fat pig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deeply breathes the smell of the forest in the wind, only feels the spirit. Think of this hunt as a holiday, and let the troubles, ugliness, and dirtyness of the world go away! He cheered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei took the crystal ball into his arms and jumped from the peak. In the air, he was like a giant bird, and he drew a beautiful arc in the air and fell into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fat head stalked out from the grass on the edge of the cliff, observing the sacred knights who marched through the valley in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s mental power has been wrapped around the body to prevent any magical fluctuations from being exposed. This set of skills that were painstakingly practiced in the past to prevent the holy water from sinking, I did not expect the magical effect of hiding. Now the two magical marks in his body are quietly lying there, and they are not able to resonate with anything under the isolation of mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The five law enforcers, five holy knights are good to deal with. Who are those three? The costume is very strange, carrying a longbow... and Long sword! Is it a thief? Not an elephant, it must be a jungle parade! It seems to be a little troublesome." Rogge carefully assessed the strength of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly seemed to be aware of it and turned to look at the direction of the team's holy knight. Far away, a few birds suddenly started to stun in the forest. After a few laps, they turned and flew east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at it for a while, painted a small magical array on the ground and began to mourn the rather lengthy spell. After the spell, his hand waved on the magical array, and countless fine sands danced in the magical array, and finally formed a small sand column, which shook steadily. Rogge carefully counted the number of sand columns and finally stopped at the one hundred and twelve. He laughed at himself and thought: "I was quite worthwhile. I actually sent more than 100 people to chase me. I have to hunt down this low-level magician. Ten people are enough. Why do the church send this? Many people come? Is the Pope really so magical, know that my old man has always hidden strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a while, his emotions were always low . Since the death of Elysses, he seems surprisingly not very sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just not happy again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and messed up the magical array on the ground. During this time, studying the magic of the empires of Elysses is still a bit of a gain. At least, I have been able to combine the detection of life magic and the long-range detection magic through the magic array. It can be as far away as it is now. Can know the number of soldiers in the distance. Only now the magic is too bad, and various life reactions can not be distinguished. That is to say, at this distance, a bear and a person can't be separated in the magic array. And this magic consumes a lot of magic, with his current magic, can only be cast twice, almost even more abnormal than decomposition. This is just a simple magic formed by a small part of it. If it is a complete doll magic, how much magic power it should be! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chrisma looked helplessly at the middle-aged Master who was lying on the ground and could not climb for a long time. These weak guys began to complain on the second day of the mountain, and on the fifth day they looked green, and it was clear that they had reached the critical point that their physical strength could support. This bright Master was riding on the horse, and his eyes were dull. He finally slammed into a large branch that was swaying out. He planted the horse and fell his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the truth is that it’s very difficult for the sacred knights and law enforcers who are used to the wind to adapt to the Master of Light. In just two days, Kara Yang, who had not been dragged by the Master of Light, had already opened the distance for nearly 50 kilometers. According to the news he sent back, Roger, the Necromancer, was not slow, and he fled in the distance of more than 80 kilometers. It’s just that there may be more interference in the mountains, and now only occasionally can he trace his traces from the wheel of the heavens every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma stands at the top of an old tree and observes the surrounding environment. His men have found a mouthful of springs and are busy setting up camps. The bright wizards have fallen to the bottom of the tree like a dead pig, and there is no effort to release the magical enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze blew through, and the green foliage of the forest shook, like the ripples on the lake. Chrisma had a cold war, and he suddenly felt that under the seemingly detailed water surface, it seemed that there were countless pairs of eyes, and they looked at them indiscriminately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just ten kilometers away from him, in a rich canopy, there is a pair of eyes watching Chrisma. The leaves were so realistic that a squirrel climbed from above and swayed from above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre is a little funny looking at the little guy who just climbed over his lap. The little guy even looked at a green fruit, biting it, but after a long while, he couldn’t pull it down, and he was so anxious that his tail was really shaken. Andre smiled and reached out. The two crystal clear fingers were gently clipped and the fruit was taken down. The little squirrel caught the fruit and disappeared quickly. Andre’s vindictive infusion was slightly infused, and the leaves on the cloak stretched, and a small piece of fruit grew in a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genie cloak is really a good thing! It not only allows you to be unrestricted in the forest, but also has a great hidden effect. In the dark forest, this cloak accompanied him through three years of hard times. Andre was very emotional. He suddenly felt different, so he wrapped his cloak. There was a wave of light and shadow in the canopy, and Andrea had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge brown bear passes under the tree. It stopped and looked around in confusion, but did not see anything, so he screamed softly. A huge silver wolf was drilled out of the bush. It squinted and sniffed in the air, but did not smell anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wolf and a bear stood side by side, whispering, seemingly talking. After a while, the giant wolf boarded a huge stone. The man stood up and sniffed in the wind for a long time. Then he jumped off the stone and snorted, carrying the brown bear to the direction of Chrisma and his party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre opened the leaves in front of him and looked at the direction of a wolf and a bear. If you think thoughtfully: "It turned out to be Druid! Is it here? It’s getting more and more interesting to have entered their territory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! ...Elysses! ! Rogge yelled and rolled over from the branch and fell to the ground. He climbed up and shook his starry head, and he woke up. He gasped with a big mouth.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to an open space in the forest. At this time, it was already the moonlight, and the sky was full of stars. Rog looked up and looked like a bloody color in the moon. He seemed to look again. When I arrived at the moonlight, I couldn’t tell the pain in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blew, it seems that every name has her name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slammed on the ground, leaning forward to the sky, a long sigh!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A large piece of the bird flies up and flies. Countless beasts and Warcraft raise their heads and their necks are straight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The *** on the dead branch suddenly turned to look into the sky. Gregory, who was sleeping under the tree, woke up and looked up in the same direction.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry in the forest Soon, I woke up the sacred knights who were sleeping. Kara Yang’s cloak was out of sight, and she was very eager to see. A large group of black-pressed lodges in the distant forest were circling around a place, and the wild beasts were faint. The covenant came over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jungle parade estimated the distance and changed his face. He whispered to Kara Yang: "His voice is actually here. The distance can be passed over! Adults, should we be careful? Is he really just a level 10 magician? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
