			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crime and Punishment Chapter 13 does not return to the road<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield that has just fought There are still traces of magic and grudge. On a piece of red rock, there was still a little dry blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white, almost transparent hand sticks out, and the thin fingers gently pick up the blood beads and look at them in front of them. The twilight of the blood drops and the brilliant red eyes complement each other and gradually merge into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect mouth is slightly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the finger slowly spread the blood on the lips, and the pale lips added a touch of sad and melancholy beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After painting the makeup of the battle, the hand was raised again, and a light red tulle was brought up to cover the beautiful figure of the bald black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint red gradually blends into the surrounding sand, and the beautiful figure has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the Wanli lead cloud, there is a black night on one side and a red sea of ​​clouds on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena stepped out of the void and stood on top of the clouds. On the opposite side of her, the wind and the moon also emerged from the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" The spirit of the wind is fluctuating, and does not live above the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Macbeth is also here." Wella replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the wind and moon slowly open, and the headless angels are like floating from the water, now on the silver eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... killed him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's figure suddenly became clear, and she looked up to the sky, seemingly low and snorted. A pair of golden cross stars lit up from her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena's entire body began to shine, and a hint of golden light emerged from her skin. In a blink of an eye, a new round of bright sun appears above the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly bowed her head, took the golden light out of the body little by little, and then stared at the windy month, the spiritual fluctuations also became like the wind and the moon: "Because... ...Achilles has come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Fengyue’s right hand grabs it, and the death sickle that is much bigger than her delicate body has been In the palm of your hand. She had a shallow smile on her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thin red yarn in the void, floating in the wind. Going to Wei Na. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina did not return, and the dragon soul gun in the hand drew a circle in the air. The dragon soul gun can't hold the silver flame on the tip of the gun, and it condenses into a silver circle in the air, a pure and innocent circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina's tail finger gently tapped on the handle of the dragon soul gun, the gun tip trembled, and the center of the silver ring was clicked. Suddenly like boiling water in the center of the circle, there are countless silver blisters. These blisters floated freely in the sky, and some even ran through the fluttering red yarn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver blisters and red yarns are like not being in the same space at all, and they can traverse each other as if they were just a shadow. But the red yarn no longer floats to Wella, and the blisters no longer spread to the four sides. They are entangled, just like the lover who is not willing to separate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly moved, her speed is beyond description. In the far-off battle, Gregory can only see the golden light strips criss-crossing above the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-speed dancing dragon soul gun has also turned into a silver lightning, chasing the faint red when the front is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Achilles, come out! Let me see if your look has changed." Wella's proud spirits echoed in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles refers to the blue. Weaving the sky with rain in front of the body, the dragon spirits guns are blocked like a gust of wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O'Reilly..." Achilles's soft voice contains too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly took the gun back and watched the Achilles, which was not in her, but the demon was still there, faintly said: "A Kars, you still can't abandon the singular aesthetics that are doomed to failure. Every place is more beautiful than me, but why can you only faintly exist under my glory? You refuse to admit it, I am perfect "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles's eyebrows are slightly picky, softly: "But your perfection has come to an end, O'Reilly. You Has been divided into two, not to mention. With your weak body now. How is it compared with me? My singular aesthetics and your incomplete perfection who wins and loses, always have to try to know. Isn't it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, Fengyue is sitting on a huge death sickle, a pair of white bare feet swaying in the air. She is condescending, a pair of silver plaques from the bald head of Achilles, to the eyebrows, to the bright red eyes, to the bloody red lips, all the way down, to see the pair of equally profitable Every place has never been let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles's toes are covered with a lively, brilliant red glow. Fengyue's silver eyes stared at the two groups of bright red, and the eyebrows were slightly stunned, as if thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina no longer said anything, she slowly raised the dragon soul gun and pointed to Achilles. Look at her hard-working look, like a few peaks hanging on the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Soul Gun The silver gun is wrapped around a silver band of light. Look carefully, these bands are made up of countless tiny figures. And the symbolic composition, each light band, represents a different kind of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles raised his hands and woven a piece of bright red clouds on his head, covering his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon soul warrior pierced the red cloud with an indescribable power, and countless space gaps shattered the entire red cloud in an instant. Achilles has disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s chest suddenly reveals three bright red lights, and she seems to look down at her chest with some stunned eyes, then the whole person’s image Can not stop twisting, and finally turned into pieces of broken light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that her sight is just a phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two light angels who were born at the same time began the battle of desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their main battlefields are in this plane, but life and death, but also in countless other planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twins that swayed in the air suddenly stopped. Fengyue jumped down from the slashing knife. Reaching out and grabbing, the huge blade of death is already in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles's image suddenly appeared in front of the windy moon, he said softly: "The siege is meaningless to me, you should not waste your effort... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the words are not finished, he turns into a bright red, and escapes the dragon soul gun that suddenly pierces from the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a faint blur in the eyes of Fengyue, she sticks out her tongue. Gently lick the entire blade of the Death Scythe. The golden blood dripping from the tip of the tongue, like life, infiltrated into the wide blade. The dark black front edge is plated with a pale gold pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Fengyue suddenly disappeared, and it was changed back to the icy cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any meaning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly lifted the sword of death, with strength The gathering, the huge blade of the Death Scythe suddenly brightened the dazzling golden light! It rotated two turns in the hands of the wind, then suddenly fell, and flatly shot on an invisible enchantment in front of the windy moon, which stirred up a deep blue ripple. It seems that this large space has been broken by the blow of Fengyue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the air, there was a vague ambiguity, and it was enough to make the young people who heard it bloody and dreamy back thousands of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wella wrapped in the burning golden flame stepped out of the void, the dragon soul gun is like walking through the water. Silently stinging to Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles's scent of redness turned from dark to thick, and it seems that he has to walk to other planes to avoid Weina's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the space barrier that was previously considered to be nothing by Achilles suddenly became hard! Like a crash on a transparent crystal wall, he slammed and slammed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this opportunity, the dragon soul gun in the hands of Weina suddenly accelerated. Worn into the waist of Achilles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small red thick cloud blasts off the waist of Achilles, and the face of the fabulous monster finally shows a surprise, bowing Look at the horrible wound on your waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking through the broken mouth on the black robe, you can only see a red that is too thick to be opened. This life-like red madness flows, and instantly repairs all the wounds of Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles can't help but be surprised that the bright red eyes finally fall on Fengyue: "You can strengthen the structure of the space, it is incredible! You But it is a avatar of O'Reilly. Why can I have this power? As far as I know, the perfect Olympus in the heavens has never had this ability..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon suddenly appeared behind Achilles, and the death sickle instantly turned into a black gas wrapped around the golden thread, and it passed by Achilles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she was cold and cold: "You are really annoying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles eyes The ground is red and dark. Then quickly recover. He turned to the windy month. Shallow smile: "This knife is very painful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe behind him suddenly broke a big hole, revealing the way on the white back muscles A huge wound of half a meter long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon are slowly dancing. The Scythe of Death has turned into a black light, and it whirls on her finger at an unimaginable high speed, and bursts like a screaming cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This knife is for you to remember, I am not her avatar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far into the sky There was a burst of dragons in the middle, and Gregory and Silverronston received the call of the wind and flew from the distant sky to help out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the imprisonment of the Fengyue space, Achilles has temporarily lost the ability to freely enter and exit different planes, so the king can also join the battle. In this space, no matter which standard is used, the fighting power of Yinlong can not be completely ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory while sliding in the sky, unable to shake the dragon language magic. These sources of dragon language magic do not have to say more, all from the genius of Nicholas. After studying day and night, Gregory finally mastered several primary dragon language magic. Of course, it is very knowledgeable to pick which one to study first. Gregory will naturally think carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sacred dragon's low and melodious dragon, the silver body of the stoning illuminates a layer of white sacred radiance, the dragon blessing effect It is not at all comparable to human low-level magic blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next. There was a faint red glow on the body. If a silver dragon with a strong fighting power is further blessed with a dragon anger that increases its attack power, what will happen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Gregory has his own considerations. Ston is loyal and brave, and extremely loyal to his vows, the best servant at first glance. What's more, his combat power is better than that of Gregory. He is not seven or eight times stronger, so four or five times is always there. In addition, Ston is only abiding by his own principles. In addition, it is somewhat violent, but he is definitely not stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has felt that his status has been threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything must be prepared for the rain. From the moment the two masters signed the soul contract with the king. Gregory began to think seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacred dragon has been relying on the awkwardness since the birth of the demon dragon; in the bone dragon career, in front of the big and the dead in life and death, Geli Gao Li has already made the ass to become a god. Nowadays it has become a sacred dragon, and this housekeeping skill has not been thrown at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Gregory added the two auxiliary magics to Ston, the strength of the Stan was greatly increased. But the huge silver dragon that shines with the brilliance of magic is also very conspicuous. Compared with theston, the sacred dragon is simply bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Achilles’s enemies, it’s too conspicuous that it’s not a good thing to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is not very good at its own strength, but the two masters who follow are strong, so its vision is naturally not a common dragon. comparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Gregory at a glance has seen that Achilles is an enemy that is absolutely inaccessible. As for the brave and loyal Ston... let it go first! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ston is very grateful to the sacred dragon for his blessing of magic, he uttered a resounding dragon, rushing to the distant battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory once again looked at the battlefield in the distance. There are only countless gorgeous colors that can't be generated, then faint, and replaced by new colors. It is even impossible to distinguish between the two masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brightly colored battlefield suddenly bursts with a dazzling golden glow. For a time, the sea of ​​clouds has completely turned into a golden ocean! Then an invisible wave quickly spread from the center of the light. The waves contain deadly power and where they pass. The sky and the sea were immediately destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is a thunder again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Gregory reacted, the shaking waves gently passed his body...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory's side suddenly bursts out a few blood flowers, more than ten pieces of dragon scales fly out of the body! Gregory held back the pain, knowing that with its power, it can only advance to here, and can no longer approach the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s heart struggles repeatedly and finally made a choice between the interests. He sang a spell quickly, and the sacred guardian brilliance that could greatly enhance the protection began to shine on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon language magic was originally prepared for Gregorian, of course, even if he did not need it. This kind of dragon language magic that can save life is never possible to appear on the body of Ston. But Gregory could not even get close to the battlefield. The only thing that can make a contribution to the two masters is to give theston some auxiliary magic. Although it is very hopeful that the battle will die. Or at least a serious injury or something, but the victory of the two masters is overwhelming, in order for them to win, Gregory can almost give up everything! Including its little selfishness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no two masters, they are struggling to survive on this sturdy plane... Gregory does not dare to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After joining, the battle immediately had subtle changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it’s as strong as Achilles, it doesn’t look like it’s going to get the hot silver dragon flame on it, and the claws and bites of the king can His body caused damage. In the normal battle, Achilles can break into the other side in the moment before the attack, and then flash back. His seemingly soft and fragile body is actually very powerful, that is, no flash does not avoid being bitten by Ston, and the damage that Silver Dragon can do to him is very limited. But now, he has to face the attack of Fengyue and Wella at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of a small weight is enough to change the balance of a huge balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles sighed in a faint sigh, and the smile on the corner of his eyebrows disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden loss of background color on the battlefield, only black and white. Only Achilles, Fengyue and Wella still retain their own colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three pairs of wings stretch at the same time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena's wings are sandwiched between white feathers Huge golden feathers, the windy moon is a pair of pure white wings, while Achilles is a pair of golden light wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment when there is no such thing as a slight action, Achilles raised his left hand, wiped a little blood from his lips, and then slammed his fingers... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
