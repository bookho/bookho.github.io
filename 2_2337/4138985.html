So Rogge walked through the ten halls and once again looked at ten different statues of purgatory angels. Even with the eyesight and insight of the fat man at the moment, I can’t see exactly what secrets are in these statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the results of the test show that these are just ordinary statues, all without abnormal power, although the material of the statue is still unknown. But after witnessing the refining process of Elysses and Orfirock, Rogge did not believe this result anyway. This only shows that his ability is not enough to see through the secrets contained in these statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten temples, ten statues, ten different beautiful stories. All the way, Rogge has seen ten epic battles, and he has been condensed for a moment in a thousand years, which makes him a little breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the heart of Rogge, there is a bright color in the unbearable heavy and sorrow. That is the little girl who is holding a slashing knife and floating in the air, silently following him. She lowered her head slightly, and a small hand clutched Rogge's clothes tightly, saying that she would not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked slowly into the outermost hall, a glimpse. In the center of the main hall, there is a handsome man, and the eyes with the trillions of stars are watching him faintly. Behind him, there were six blue wings that were undone, and the wings flapped. From the midst of it, there will be countless hours when the stars are dark, and in the pale blue haze of rising, slowly rise. The maroon-colored beautiful short hair is also fluttering in this dreamy starry fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger looked at the stars that destroyed hundreds of high-ranking mages, and looked at the six sky-blue wings silently, finally incomparable I smiled bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreoli made a slight smile and crossed the entire hall in one step, standing in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Andreoli. My Lord is the great god Dismason." His voice is clear and soft, it sounds very sweet. . Let Rogge be a little surprised. He is saying, rather than communicating with spiritual fluctuations like some powerful existential love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge." The fat man finally said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge does not believe that this day on the battlefield staring at him, so that he has no way to escape the six-winged angel will not know his situation, so It’s just a very simple return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be attracted by Andre Olly’s magical wings, the little girl suddenly floated out of the back of Rogge, the little hand to the blue wing of the day Grabbed it. Her movements are swift and lightning, and the white hands are wrapped around the silk and silver. It is totally different from her tender look. The little girl’s grasp of this is enough to allow the Sanctuary to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was busy with a copy and took her back to her arms. Her grasp is naturally empty. However, the wind and moon still seems to be unsuccessful. The death slasher changed from the right hand to the left hand, and then went to the wing of Andreoli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled bitterly, only to take down her death sickle, backhand put the wind and moon behind. The sickle was returned to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a rude behavior as Feng Yue, Andreioli did not care at all, just smiled and said: "It doesn't matter, it seems that this action has become her. Habits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Rogge couldn’t smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the tearing of the angel wings has become the instinct of the windy month, then after many cruel battles, how did she finally form such an instinct? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreoli is walking closer to Rogge. Gently held the fat hand. Andreoli’s hands are soft and crystal clear, and they are as cold as ice. At the same time, he leaned forward and leaned down at Rogge's ear to say something, and the fat man's mouth immediately twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge brows slightly. In the moment, there was a strange feeling spread throughout his body, as if Andreoli, who had turned into an invisible star, passed through his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog slowly raised his right hand. There is still a feeling of ice in Andre Olina on the hand. Only at this moment, Rogge's palm has a blue gem that emits a faint glow. Through the crystal clear surface of the gemstone. You can see that many stars are slowly spinning inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man thought for a while, then raised his hand. The gemstones were swallowed and led the wind to push the black crystal stone door of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus is still waiting outside the gate. Seeing a little girl behind Rogge, he was surprised to say that he did not, just said: "Your Majesty has prepared a place for you, and you have to take a rest tonight. From tomorrow, you can spread to the high gods. And work hard. Come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silently, as Augustus goes all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold moonlight gently falls on Rogge through the high floor to ceiling window. The fat man put on a black pajamas, lying on the bed, looking at the beautiful night outside the window, thinking. He didn't need to sleep anymore, but now Xiaofengyue is sleeping well, so the fat man can only stay in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl fell on the fat body, like a silky satin black hair, a pair of small hands tightly clutching the fat pajamas, sleeping peaceful and warm. At this time, she finally let go of the death sickle that would never leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took his eyes off the window and landed on the wind. He gently provoked a glimpse of the black hair of the windy moon, watching it slip off the tip of the finger if it was silent. Rogge has some doubts, and there is a terrible force in the tender body of Fengyue. Perhaps because of the loss of the godhead and consciousness, she obviously does not use these forces. But even so, Fengyue should not need to sleep. Why is it so sleepy now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing her sleep so quietly, Rogge’s heart slowly rushed into the line of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this moment of peace and joy, Rogge finally felt the meaning of existence from the heavy depression. In front of him, in the endless darkness, suddenly jumped out of a line of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light rises to the top, and the darkness sinks to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rogge is still walking in the dark world, when he looks up. Already able to see the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold moonlight, the time in the room seems to solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle breeze gently slammed the face of Rogge. They are weak though. But it contains a sharp murderous murderous, if a root of the needle, slammed the Rogge nerve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly sat up, only to find that the room was full of morning light. He couldn't help but be amazed that he fell asleep last night and would sleep so late! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a whirlwind of wind in the room. Will leave a slight scratch. These winds are all from the blade of the god of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has already risen, she is standing in the air, unable to dance the death sickle, and when she dances to the fastest, she will force the sword to the front. Throw. As soon as he left the small hand of Fengyue, the spin of the Death Scythe will suddenly condense and then begin to become blurred. Some of the blades have even disappeared completely. However, the Death Scythe quickly became clear again and fell down. At this time, the wind and moon reached out and grabbed it, and the volley caught the Death Scythe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked for a while and finally realized that she wanted to place the Death Scythe in parallel space. So he stood up and caught the slashing knife that fell again. Gentle to Xiaofengyue: "You are in the wrong order. You must first stabilize the space before you can put the sickle in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Rogge waved The death sickle disappeared. Fengyue Xiu eyebrows wrinkled, thinking for a long time, suddenly reached out, the volley caught the Death Scythe, and then threw it back and threw it back into the void, which revealed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly noticed. Xiaofengyue seems to have changed somewhat compared to last night. But he seems to look at it, always can't find out where she has changed. He looked back and forth again and again, and Xiaofengyue stood so quietly, letting the fat man keep watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly understands where the changes in the wind are. Fengyue was originally beautiful and has no domain. Now she is a little less tender than the first time, but more beautiful and mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night, she grew up a little! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly had a new understanding of the wonders of the world and could not help but shake his head and sigh. It’s just that the fat man has some faint concerns. Once an independent consciousness is formed in the body of the wind, will there be any conflict with the consciousness in the statue of the infernal angel? But no matter what, it is always good to be able to grow up quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked to the door and walked and said: "Go, windy month, let's go and discuss something."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon are flying, and it is a tight grip on the Rogge sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two tall and handsome young warriors standing outside the door. Seeing Rogge coming out of the room, he gave him a slight gift. Rogge looked at the two warriors up and down, and instantly smelled the taste of heaven from them. However, it seems that they are not strong and should be the lowest-order reincarnation angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to see the pope." Rogge faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the Pope’s weak voice sounded in the magnificent hall of prayer: "Rogge, do you think about the future road?" Rog smiled and said, "Is there only one way? What else do you think? But you can't let me go harvesting this way." The soul that exists to spread to the glory of the High God? Some of the necessary things, you should always give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope raised his head, full The face of the years has a rare smile: "Let's talk about it, what do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People, money, things, Right! It can't be less!" Rogge simply said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope smiled and said: "Well, how much you want to use. As for the things, the Church of Light has accumulated hundreds of years of savings, and several artifacts. I can still get it. People can do it well, there are still some talents in the church, and I will hand over the church to you. Finally, it is power, how much power do you want? You must know. The greater the right, The greater your responsibility is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Rogge to answer, the Pope actually put the scepter in his hand in the hands of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope slowly swallowed: "Take it! From now on, as long as you don't violate the beliefs of the highest gods, then your decision is equivalent to my decision." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time Rogge listens, the color of surprise on his face is a strong point. He was only a big opening for the lion. I did not expect that the Pope would not only agree to it, but also give him far more than he could think of! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free use of money and access to artifacts. But what does it mean to command the entire church? What does it mean to take charge of the Pope's scepter? To a certain extent, at this moment, the power of the fat man is almost the same as that of the real pope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man immediately recovered, took over the Pope’s scepter, calmly said: "Don’t let the wind and the moon suffer, I will soon come back with the strong soul. Where is the church, I want to see it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue. You have to be patient." The Pope took a picture from his arms. Exquisite paper, handed to Rogge, slowly said: "Although I have given you the right, but the people listed above, you can not hurt. And I remind you again, the right is a double-edged sword It is very likely to hurt yourself. You need to remember, from now on. Every decision you make will affect her destiny. Go, Augustus will take you to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog glanced at the list in his hand, sneered a bit, then squeezed hard, and the rising flame in his palm instantly turned the list into ashes, then coldly said: "I will handle everything well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majesty and grandeur of the church is far beyond Rogge's imagination. This is a group of large buildings with ivory-white tones. With its absolute size covering half of the mountain, the church is even bigger than a medium-sized city in the Terran nation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall of the Holy Land is tens of meters high, and a row of white stone pillars that require several people to hold together are engraved with the miracles of the gods. When Augustus, Rogge and Fengyue fell to the main entrance of the main hall, several trainee churches ran over and humbly bowed to Augustus. They are still very young, and one of the girls even sneaked a sneak peek at Rogge and the windy moon behind him. The bright big eyes were full of curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of work, several figures flew out of the main hall of the sanctuary and landed in front of Augustus. Half humbly. Augustus pointed to Rogge. To an old man who is headed: "The Order of the Emperor of the Church, from today. The Lord Rogge is the Lord of the Church. All the affairs of the Church must be directed by the adults of Rogge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was shocked, looked at the fat man and said to Augustus: "Rogge? He, he is not the pope of the Holy Church, the most notorious pagan, from the abyss Did you climb out of the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is expressionless, cold and succinct: "Rogge has converted to the Supreme God. This order is made by the Pope. I personally gave it and gave it to the scepter of Rogge, and you have no doubts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Augustus is an adult." Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is faintly pointing to Rogge: "There is a portal to the eleven large temples in the church, you can go to you I want to go to the place. I won't go in, you can do it yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words, the blood angel wings show, slowly take off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reached out with lightning, grasping the hand of the wind and the angels of the blood angels, and always watched the figure of the blood angel disappear at the end of the world. Turning around and looking at the managers of the church, he smiled and said: "Get up! Please rest assured that from now on, the church will walk out in my hands a completely different path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Rogge first entered the hall of the church. As he passed by the priests, he pulled the wind to his front and let her stretch out to the small hand of the first old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is magnificent and magnificent, with a row of decorative armor on each side, and the walls are covered with all kinds of weapons and magic equipment. At the end of the main hall is an altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ignored the sacred eyes of the sacred churches or the apprentices in the hall, clinging to the Pope’s sacred scepter and walking directly to the altar. The fat man looked at the symbol of the heavenly gods floating above the altar, and saw that the symbol represents neither the supreme god. Nor was it dissimasen, so he waved a chair and placed it on the altar. He sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment there are dozens of sacred churches in the hall, all of them stunned and looked at Rogge unbelievably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog snorted and pointed to the three young churches with the sacred scepter, saying, "You. You, and you. Go to all." The churches are called here! Let them know the new owners of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty sees several church managers who follow There is a young female mage. She looks like she is in her twenties. She looks very elegant and beautiful. So she uses her scepter to point her finger and asks: "What is your name?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female mage’s face is stunned, and although she is extremely unwilling, she can only barely say: “My name is Roy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded. Road: "Very good. Roy, see you look good, you will be with me in the future! Now you say, how many people are in the church? Detailed!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is pale, but when she thinks about the strict hierarchy of the church and the church, she still has to say: "There are 9,100 children in the first training camp in the church. There are 2,400 people in the sacred church, and there are 300 sacred warriors and battle mage. There are 70 people in the sect of the military..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge waved impatiently and said: "These guys who don't need to talk about it, you can talk about how many sanctuaries there are in the church, how many big magic guides are at that level!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s eyes turned to the old man, and he did not answer. The eyes gradually became more and more fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xinda’s two white eyebrows almost got together, but in the end they could only helplessly: "Roger adults, according to the standards of the Terran, there are currently Five sacred fields and three battle mage who can cast eight levels of magic. Most of them are instructors of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge swept through the hall . At this time, the sacred church received notice and poured into the hall. When they saw Rogge sitting high on the altar, the horror, confusion and even fear were clearly written in the face. on. Most of these formal members of the church have participated in the decisive battle of the day, and they still have a lingering fear of Rogge’s unpredictable and ruthless slaughter. Even if there were a few who did not go to the war, they all recognized Rogge, the number one enemy of the bright church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, he turned into a change. Is this the Lord of the Church? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is so amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sacred halls suddenly felt. Even if the Lord God of Heaven and the Devil of the Abyss embraced like a brother, they would not feel how surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes fell back to Xinda. Cold smile, said: "Master Xinda, according to you, there should be eight great powerhouses in the church, but how can I only see you in the hall? Where are the other strong people?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The strong are not cultivated in a short period of time. They are now suffering in their respective regions." Xinda Dao. He looked at the fat man sitting on the altar, his eyebrows trembled a few times, and finally couldn't help but say: "Roger, you are now a god to the gods! The altar is not where you should sit, and The sanctuary has always been a sacred place, and you should not let the girl with the demon power behind him tarnish her! Although the holy scepter is in your hands, what you do not match the sacred title of the Lord of the Church! Will go to the Pope to verify this matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed twice, looked back and looked at the little windy moon floating behind him, patted She grabbed the white hand of her clothes and smiled and said: "Feng Yue, look, some people say that you are a demon! Obedient, stay here and don't move..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Listening to Rogge's gentle tone, Xinda suddenly felt a sense of uneasiness. But before he was prepared, Rogge had already appeared in front of him, and the holy scepter with a large ruby ​​in his eyes flashed in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xinda only felt that his eyes were black, his ears slammed and he fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blood smashed on Rogge's face, making his smile look extremely embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the hall gathered hundreds of churches, and saw Rogge's sudden killer, they couldn't help but slammed and rushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge holds the blood-stained sacred scepter, looks around for a week, and sighs coldly: "Don't forget, I am the Lord of the Church! Give it to me." Stand in the same place! Who dares to step forward. Laozi kills nothing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred ceremonies are extremely strict, not only strictly stricter than the military laws of the major empires Even stricter than the regulations of the Holy Knights. As the owner of the church, Rogge has the power to kill the ordinary church members. At this moment in the Church of Light, his authority is actually second only to the head of the Holy Knights, the blood angel Augustus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a drink by Rogge, all the churches immediately remembered the consequences of the violation of the Lord of the Church. Involuntarily stopped. Unlike other institutions in the Church of Light, the Church is not tolerant. Only obey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xinda screamed at this moment, struggling to get up from the ground, but Rogge’s scepter once again screamed and fell, another bloody splash The fat man is full of smiling faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stretched his left foot on the ground, and Xinda immediately screamed in pain, but his scream was immediately interrupted by the scepter . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Laozi is converted to the supreme god, but also the devout believer of the main god Desmasen. But what other gods in the heavens are shutting me?! Even those low The gods of the order can't control me, let alone your little low-ranking angels?! Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you? A little angel who doesn't know whether he is an eighth-order or a ninth-order little angel. Even the things that are not long enough for his wings are also paired with the place where I sit." The person I brought is a demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of flames at the foot of Rogge, and the light wing of Xinda was destroyed by his life! Then the sacred scepter swayed again, with a bang. The Sindar vertebrae have been broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two churches that seem to have a deep relationship with Xinda, press 捺Can't live, rushed up. One rushed to Rogge, and the other took out a dagger and rushed to the wind. Look at him like a child who wants to hold this beautiful girl with a smoky smog as a hostage to force Rogge to submit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小风月 quietly watching the rushing sacred hall, a pair of white and tender little hands seem to flash a faint black gas, then the eyes slowly hang down, It seems to be asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred hall suddenly screamed, and a slanting blood line appeared in the center of the body. Then the upper body and the lower body slowly separated. Another church that rushed to Rogge fell down. Suddenly, a thin blood wave was sprayed behind it, if it was a flying red silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is silence in the hall of the sanctuary. Hundreds of sacred churches are pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the holy scepter and walked slowly to the altar. The scepter has been stained with blood at this moment, still drips, and draws a blood trail behind Roger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man walked up to the altar, calmly sat down, Xiaofengyue floated a little closer, quietly grabbing his clothes. The fat man glanced at the audience and took all the expressions of the church to the bottom of his eyes. He suddenly smiled. In this deadly hall, the sudden laughter of the fat man is like a thunder, and many of the churches are scared to take a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man will smack the blood of the sacred scepter in front of him, gently smile, softly said: "Who is still the home of my church now? Do you have any objections?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man listened for a moment and didn't hear any opposition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he laughed again and again, said: "So everyone recognizes my identity? This is fine. I will talk about the future." Rules, very simple, I am the rule, my decision is the final decision! I know that there are more than a dozen of you who are coming or reincarnation. You must see that this demon is not pleasing to the eye. In fact, I also see that you are not pleasing to the eye. In the future, all you have to do is to please me. If you make me feel good, I will fight. If it makes me feel bad, it is not as simple as tearing my wings. Are you saying yes? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano screamed and his face turned pale. However, she was obviously overcrowded and barely smiled: "Yes, Rogge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved her and said: "Come here, You take me to the temple to see. Also, tell the respected strong people and let them come to see me. Going out with me and playing a few more is more useful than what is hard work!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the piano obediently walked to the side, Rogge put the holy scepter in his hand in her hand. When you go to the temple first. The piano looked at this scepter with a sticky blood, his face became paler and paler, and there was a surge in his throat, almost vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church is very vast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge spent a long time in the past, only to see the most important places in the church. Qin Yilu explained to him the purpose of the facilities in the temple, and intentionally or unconsciously talked about the tradition and morality that the church has always followed. But the fat man is just walking forward, not to be okay. I don't know if I heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano only feels that time is too slow to say, she is increasingly feeling that the body is becoming weak. Cold sweat has soaked in heavy clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not afraid of Rogge, but a little girl floating behind Rogge. The little girl named Fengyue was always looking at her. Under the silver gaze, the piano only felt the heart beat faster and faster, and the throat began to dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most terrible thing is that her back is constantly itching, it seems that a pair of wings will be split! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hurriedly inspecting the church, the mystery is already hanging high in the moon. Rogge did not intend to rest. He asked the piano to bring all the main characters in the church to the battle hall and began to arrange the first action since taking over the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of Rogge’s bloody and horrible domination, this time the people who were called were arriving on time, and the seven strong ones were quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the battle hall has a magical map of 10 meters, covering almost every corner of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sees more than ten of the most central figures in the church have arrived. Then he reached out and pointed to the magic map. The place pointed to the northern part of the dark forest, said: "There is a very strong existence hidden here, called the flame tyrant Tang Ke Bakala. This guy has recently been hit hard, hiding Sleeping deep underground. In my opinion, his current strength is not even half of the peak period. This kind of big cheap is not at this time. Then when will it wait? I will give you three days to get here. The magic array was built, and we set off three days later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an old man in charge of the military in the church frowned: "Roger, this place However, it is located in the territory of the Asrofic Empire. We can only send one magical unicorn. How do we get back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come back? Rogge smiled coldly and said: "Of course it is to kill it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Rogge let the churches study their own action plans, Waving up, took her to the hall of the sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main hall of the space is composed of more than ten small halls, among which there are ten portals with portals. Although these portals are convenient, they also pose great risks. At the moment of transmission. The sender is required to stay in the space storm for a very short time. How powerful is the power of space storms. Even if it is a strong sanctuary, I dare not say that I can afford it. Therefore, members of the church are not a last resort. The portal will never be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge and Xiaofeng Yue did not hesitate to step into the portal, the piano smiled bitterly, closed his eyes and succumbed to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time she was lucky and walked out of the other end of the portal without any harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to leave for a while, you are waiting here." After the command, Rogge walked out of the hall with a small wind, and skyrocketed. Just disappeared into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano chased the hall, but Rogge’s figure had long since disappeared, and he had to catch up. She looked around and recognized that it was a great shrine near the border of the Dro Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the cloud, Rogge flew to Oshniiya at full speed, and he was very upset. Rogge couldn't tell where the irritating feeling came from. It seemed that something happened to him in the direction of Oshniah, or what was there that was calling him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory of the Dro Empire is full of scars left by the war. The army of the Shenghui League has approached O'Siyah, and in the north of the Drodi, there are frequent harassment of the squadrons after the interspersed with the front line, and often the burned villages and towns can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, Rogge has turned into silver. He has clearly felt that what he is looking for is not far from the north of Ossia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly wore out the clouds, if a meteorite fell to the ground. Underneath him, there is a village that has not been extinguished, and it seems to have just been burned. Surprisingly, however, there is a small area in this ruin filled with vitality, and even on the scorched earth that is still faintly smoked, many green shoots have emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly falls on this strange land filled with vitality. In front of him, there was a farmhouse that had been completely burned. There was a little girl sitting in it, staring at him with a pair of clear, watery eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either her breath, or the blue eyes with green eyes, I told Rogge unmistakably, this is his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this little girl who has not yet reached the 100th day has become a little girl of about three years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
