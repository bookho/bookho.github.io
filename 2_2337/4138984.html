			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, please consider it again!" Kate crouched on the ground and touched the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Grand Duke was silent, pacing back and forth, and the slamming boots slammed into the wide study. The five fingers of his left hand, white and long, could not beat the hilt of the long sword at the waist. It seemed that the bottom of his heart was quite upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Dagong clenched his sword at the waist and his footsteps stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This matter is never feasible, you don't have to mention it again." Dagong is faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate hesitated for a moment and finally resolutely said: "Your Majesty, our army marching north, sweeping the Asrofik Empire is only a matter of time, but... annexed After the Slovak Empire, what should we do? In my opinion, the reputation of the Holy Knights now far exceeds our Legion. And the Pope and Augustus are the prestige of the adults, they have already surpassed the national border! Your Majesty, after you unify the mainland, I am afraid that the kingship at that time... will be completely suppressed by the teachings..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!" Dagong snorted Interrupted Kate’s words. With a bang, Dagong’s sword was already on Kate’s neck, and the sharp Jianfeng had left a bloodline on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate is like a statue, still moving, still insisting: "Your Majesty, even now, if the Pope ascends, except for my subordinates The Lions Legion, I am afraid that more than half of the soldiers of other legions will turn the blade at you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough!" Dagong once again cut off Kate's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly put the sword into the sheath and patted Kate’s shoulder and said, “Get up, I know the real thoughts in your heart. But Rogge is the name of the pope. The person you want, all the decisions about him, are not what you can do, but I can't do anything about it. Although you don't know the true background of the church, you should see it clearly on the day of the battle. Give up those unrealistic thoughts, and don't even do stupid things! Otherwise, you will find that all your efforts are in vain, and will only bring you the fate of destruction. As for what you just said If you don't mention it again in the future," "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty." Kate stood up and just wanted to leave, and was stopped by the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Lions Army is resting now?" asked the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resident in Baden-Württemberg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke sank: "Go to the lion The Tooth Legion secretly transferred to Lille City. We have mastered all the secrets of the Babylonian Empire's Golem Corps. It will not take long for ten new Golems to be built. At that time..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke looked at Kate’s eyes and took another shot of him again. “The Lions Legion can be renamed the Bavarian Golems!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kate walked to the gate of the Grand Duke, he happened to meet Franco in a hurry. The two just looked at each other and immediately staggered their sights and staggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco did not go to Dagong’s study, but went to Catherine’s office. The public and political powers are in the hands of Catherine, so the matters that Franco is responsible for must report directly to the beautiful and terrible Grand Duchess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a special status and went straight to Catherine’s office, waiting quietly for her arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the bookshelf on the side of the study suddenly moved away from both sides, and Catherine and a maid walked out of it. Her long hair is still wet, tightly attached to the forehead, there is a faint red on her cheeks, and her eyes are still flashing with excitement and crazy light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Franco had been waiting in the study, Catherine gave a slight glimpse, and then remembered that he had let him come over this time to discuss business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco stood up and just wanted to say something, Catherine waved at him, lazy and said: "The documents are on the table. Now, organize it yourself, take it back and look at it first. I am a little tired today, something to say next time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Catherine’s work was vigorous and vigorous, and she would never let go of her business for such reasons. However, in the past two months, the situation has just happened three times. And every time Franco sees Catherine walking into the study from the secret door, she will find that she has a variety of styles, but she is lazy and full of a scene after the carnival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inferred from time, when Catherine became abnormal, it was not long after Rogge was detained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco’s hands are well maintained, and every movement he reads through the documents is firm and powerful, without any drag. There are only a lot of documents, and there are always times when they are finished. He picked up the heavy documents, his eyes naturally passed through the secret door of the study, hesitated, and finally walked out of Catherine's study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is only Rogge in the deep and high hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge lie on the steel platform, it is already a hairy hair. His chest and abdomen were all smashed, and the flesh and blood that was turned into a paste was slowly squirming. Under the support of strong vitality, it was difficult to regenerate and repair the wound on the body little by little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his eyes, but his eyes were completely confused. He looked at the top of the temple like that, and he didn't know what he was looking at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the entire hall shook slightly. The tremor was transmitted to the steel platform, which also affected the pain of Rogge. There was a line of anger in his eyes, and some doubted where these vibrations came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! A small yellow object fell from the sky and bounced a few times, just falling on Rogge's face. This is a piece of oil on the mural of the temple, which is loosened by the vibration of the hall. It slid down the skin. Suddenly, Rogge mouthed, a scarlet long tongue suddenly stretched out and rolled it into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibrating of the hall stopped, and Rogge also recovered the lifelessness, but the speed of his wound recovery, speeding up a little undetectable . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is returning to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time lapses quietly, I don’t know when, a gloomy roar broke the silence of the hall. Two thick red copper gates swayed slowly. A strong ray of light came in through the cracks in the door and landed on Rogge's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger glared at his eyes, staring at the top of the temple, that is, the glare that fell on his face did not make his pair as dead fish. The eyes are swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was not fully opened, and Catherine’s soft and angry voice came: “The Pope can’t do this! He promised to give me a month’s time. But now it’s only a little more than two weeks! Is it true that the respectable, noble, and great Pope is ready to take back his promise?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a low-pitched male voice rang "My Majesty the Pope promised you a month. But you didn't hurt him as much as you promised. Now the great existence from heaven wants to take him away, so your time is over."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't do this!" Catherine followed the man and tried to protest: "I didn't do anything to him! You can see it yourself, is there a scar on his body?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man snorted and ignored Catherine, just strode to the steel platform and looked at Rogge’s inanimate look and immediately wrinkled A brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his right hand and slowly stroked Rogge’s chest. With his movements, a gentle and slender sacred breath infiltrated Rogge's body, while exploring his body, while repairing some small scars along the way. The man suddenly snorted and looked quite surprised. In all respects, Rogge's body is too good to be better. Except for the strength of one body being locked by six magic nails, he is completely unscathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked at Rogge’s unresponsive eyes again, and he snorted and stared at Catherine. When he waved his hand, he pulled all the six steel nails in the hands of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s painful roar finally woke up. His body still twitched, but it seems to have recovered some of his mind, slowly turning his head and looking at the two people on the side of the steel platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge tried to distinguish the man's face. After a while, he struggled: "I recognize you, you are... Augustus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus They nodded and said: "The Pope wants to see you. Now that you are free to move, come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge elbow Taiwan, trying to get down from the stage. As a result, with all his strength, his body screamed and flew out quickly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus waved his hand and covered Rogge’s body with a soft force, put him on the ground and frowned: “Your strength It has been restored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s consciousness looked sober, he nodded, took a set of clothes handed over by the maid, and slowly wore it. neat. These days, Rogge has been nailed to the steel platform, and is constantly tortured. Every movement has to use all the power to move. Therefore, the power suddenly recovered completely, but he could not adapt to it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge followed Augustus through the room, crossed the two portals, and finally stopped at the gates of two spar before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these two majestic giants with a height of 100 meters, Rogge could not help but feel awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a natural door that can only be described by miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are faintly angels on the gates of these two black spars that seem to be inconspicuous. It seems that there are six angels on each giant door that can't stand floating. Most of the angels look very clear. Only one angel looks like a very pale and faint image. If it is not Rogge. The eyesight is extremely sharp, and I am afraid I can’t see that there is an angel statue hidden there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Rogge to see clearly, the two black spar giant gates slowly opened on their own, revealing the extremely deep and deep hall behind. In such a hall, even if a dragon stands in it, it will certainly look very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the direction of Augustus, Rogge slowly walked into the hall. The blood angel stayed outside the door and did not enter the temple with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant door slowly collapsed behind Rogge. At the moment when the door was closed, the scene in the hall completely changed. Rogge found that the temple had only ten Around the meter, I don’t know if the temple is getting smaller, or it is getting bigger. The fat man knows that no matter which one is, it is a real change, and it is not a temporary illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, you are finally here. How are you ready to convert to the glory of the gods?" The end of the hall sounded a The extremely old voice seems to contain the passage of thousands of years in every sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked up and saw the Pope standing on the other end of the main hall, and the pair of eyes that were constantly shimmering and glaring, staring at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s hand can’t help but tremble. At this moment, he’s already seen in the eyes of the pope, those brilliances are countless The process has only been accelerated by hundreds of millions of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man calmed down and smiled and said: "The dear Pope, your big prophecy is probably going to fail once."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope smiled and said: "Whether the big prophecy will fail, it can only be decided by the results of the prophecy. This time you are coming over, I want you to see something, I have seen these. After things, I think you will naturally make a choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded, followed behind the pope and walked toward the end of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope walked slowly and slowly: "The place where you are now walking is the most noble place of the Church of Light, the Great Temple of Light. The predecessor of this temple." It is the most sacred place of the Elven sacrificial war hero Hilo, the Great Hall of the Elves. So what you see now is actually the one that combines the highest wisdom of the Elf and the Terran, and combines one of the greatest magic ever existed. Miracle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the story of the Pope, the old and the young have come to the end of the hall and come to a new hall. This hall is much smaller than the front hall, and there is a huge statue in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first sight of this statue, Rogge almost produced an illusion, as if he heard the painful cry of the bound angels echoing in the hall forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stared at the statue, and the more he saw it, the more familiar he became, and his face gradually became pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope coughed and said, "Let's go, there is still a lot to see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge silently followed the pope to the next hall, his heart beat faster and faster, and his footsteps became paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the second hall is also a huge statue, the same lifelike. This is a two-headed dragon trying to flutter, but the four rifles ruthlessly staggered through its body and nailed it firmly to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s heart has become somewhat numb, just following the Pope through one hall after another, and there is a statue in every hall. He couldn’t count on the fact that after nine or ten halls, the Pope led him into a new hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was immediately struck by lightning and stood on the spot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statue is different. It is not pain, but happiness, that is solidified on the face of the graceful woman bound to the stone pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That once deeply stung his happiness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a demon with a double wings on the statue, holding the woman from behind. Although the face of the devil is sharp and sharp, his movements give a gentle feeling to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the way, Rogge is afraid of this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, how many past events have come to mind. Unconsciously, he was already full of tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long the Pope’s low voice sounded again: “Let’s go, there’s still a place to watch it.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge heard the words, and immediately followed the pope in silence. Finally, they entered the last hall. To be exact, this is two halls. The two halls are opposite each other, just like the twins of a common destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Pope’s movement, Rogge slowly turned to the left and looked at the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to have solidified... Rogge looked stunned and stared at the last statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mechanically, almost subconsciously slowly toward the statue, shaking and reaching forward, seems to want to touch her face, her black hair, and Her imaginary barefoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fingertips fell before the touch of her, and Rogge couldn’t move his foot again, spurting a blood and stumbling over the statue. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her grace, her beauty, her pride and calmness indifferent to life and death, have not changed. The only change is that she is no longer the eighth king of the world of death, nor the goddess of the kingdom of God alone. At this moment, like Elysses, who was the black flame of the week, she has turned into a fallen angel statue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of seeing her, Rogge has already understood all the causes and consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt breathless, as if an invisible giant hand slammed his heart, and the sense of hearing, sight, and smell became blank. However, it is also clear that a pain called loss has slowly spread and spread from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain in the moment, the heart and lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope slowly said: "She has not yet fully converted into a statue, so you have a chance to choose. You see, the invisible fire of the heavens is melting her. Soul, how painful this process is, I think you must be very clear. I can temporarily lower the flame of the heavens, but this is not a long-term solution!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
