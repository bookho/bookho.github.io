			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book, the sixth day of salvation (eight)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge carelessly in the clouds Flying, thinking about it. Going to do something about yourself? The problem is that he still has something to do now, in addition to finding a way out for the most important people around him. But how easy is it to escape the final trial? Fengyue has already completed the whole process of sealing God. If there is not much accident, she will always exist until the end of this plane. For this reason, Rogge was relieved to let her go to the turbulent flow of space. But how many of them exist in the storm that can be observed in the storm between the planes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Rogge counts is no more than ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighed slightly, his heart stunned. At this moment, he already has too much concern. Others don't say that it's just that the little goblin Froya can never get out of this plane. That is to say, the day of the Judgment Day is the end of her time. The confrontation with the heavens caused by Rogge was actually the same as pushing her into destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that, in a sense, the Bavarian Grand Duke is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flies high, the wind is passing by, and its profit is like a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and put all his thoughts out of his mind, his body flashing slightly and speeding to fly far away. At this moment, his mind was moving, and the speed was as electric as an arrow. However, the fat man just speeded up, there was a flower in front of him, and suddenly there was more than one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is self-pity and self-inflicted, slamming his head, and this person appears all without warning, until the discovery is completely too late to dodge. The man did not even think that Rogge would not be able to control his own momentum, and the result could not be prevented. The two immediately slammed into each other! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s instantaneous speed is extremely fast. At this speed, two pieces of hard rock will also smash. He couldn't think about it. At the moment of the impact, the mental power had already been gathered, and the body was stronger than the steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is secretly self-satisfied, thinking that no matter who is the opposite, this one will let him have a hard time to talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty with countless afterimages. Silently collided with the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible shock waves spread out in a circle, and hundreds of floating electric balls suddenly appeared in the clear sky. There are also a number of erratic black space cracks flying across the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stood in the air and did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man only feels the golden light in front of him, and the roar of his ears keeps on, as if he hit the mountain at full speed. No, this result is much worse than hitting the mountain. If the opposite is really a mountain, then the fat man will directly crash into it. Maybe it can be worn out from the other end, and it seems to be bounced back like this now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted, rolled over nearly a kilometer, and finally stabilized his body. He was not responding at a loss, and he did not exert his true strength at all. However, the reaction time of the other party was no more than that of him, but it raised the strength far beyond the fat man. This led to such a disparity in the result of the collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man opened his eyes in anger. Looking into the sky, the left hand has begun to have black light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is really unwilling. When he had not finished reading the book of Hilo, if he fought hard, there were not many who could make him cringe in the whole plane. Now he successfully jumped out from the seventh page of the book of Hilo, looking at the whole place. surface. Except for those old and sophisticated guys, what is his fear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of looking up, the fat man has seen the person’s appearance. This time, he was silent, and the flash of the figure had already rushed to the person, and the hand was hugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the brush, the figure opened a pair of golden wings, holding the hands of Rogge, then the one of the fibrillated hands spread out, light I easily grabbed Rogge's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog only felt that there was an iron hoop on his throat, which made him completely breathless. He smiled hard. Road: "Vina. I haven't seen you for so long, the way you say hello is still so enthusiastic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog smiled and said: "My strength is stronger and stronger than the gods of the heavens. So what do you want to do? You have to hide where you have been during this time. I can’t feel your presence. I haven’t been there for a long time. See, you seem to have changed a person. Let me see, it is different.... Well, your strength has grown, and now it’s perfect! This face is more lethal, hey, actually The body is getting more and more material. Have you specially modified your body? I have to say that this is indeed a very good practice, or I can consult for you..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the fat man hasn’t finished talking, he will be sent back by Wella. She cried in tears and laughed: "Dead fat, have you encountered any good things recently, and started talking indiscriminately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and held Weina’s hand took it from her mouth and said, “Where is there anything good to say? I just thought about something, so I felt a lot easier.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina nodded and suddenly silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger holds her hand and does not loosen it. However, Wella was like this, let him hold it, but let Rogge be taken aback, and I don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are so silent. In the end, Weiner took the lead to break the silence: "Dead fat, don't ask anything, stay with me for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s hand moved gently, and in turn pulled Rogge’s hand and pulled him to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, the two have slowly landed on the top of a dangerous peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain is extremely high and dangerous, only a few small and straight ancient pines, barely growing between the mountain wind and the rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dusk again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are sitting on the peak, looking at the sun, Ren Yunxia plated them with a slightly flaming gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Rogge..." Wella gently said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very tired and want to sleep for a while. Borrow a shoulder Come and use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for Rogge to answer, she leaned softly on Rogge and fell asleep. The wind picked up her blond hair and gently passed Rogge's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is warm and warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge embraced her soft body, feeling the faint scent, the peace and joy in her heart, and she fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing. Rogge regained consciousness. He looked around and found the four wild donkeys. You can't see the margins up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very broad position. Rogge instinctively felt that perhaps in terms of space alone, it was enough to hold hundreds of millions of planes in which he was. And this plane is very special, its stability and solidity is beyond the imagination of Rogge. As far as Rogge knows, there is no existence, no power can destroy the spatial structure of the place. In your own plane. He can easily tear the space barrier and penetrate into the turbulent flow of space. But if he wants to do this here, he will only be like a fly that wants to crash through the wall. No matter how hard he works, he is only a disciple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has a kind of intuition, so the magical plane is not naturally generated, but an artificial product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the existence of this, in order to create such a strong plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before such a miracle. Rogge finally felt that he should be humble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge was immersed in emotion and shock, he felt a light shining on his body. He turned his head and looked at it, only to find that the sun was rising in the distance! Although the distance is not far from the distance, but the blazing light has burned Rogge's skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s heart almost stopped beating. He covered his hand with his hand, blocking the radiance that was enough to burn his eyes, and slowly receded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a burning pain on Rogge’s back neck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned around in a whirlwind and was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After him, another round of glory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round of glory is not the first, nor the last one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it, after another round of brilliance, the light shines in the blink of an eye. A total of twelve rounds of Shenhui appeared in the sky at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes are closed. But still can't stop the intense light. The entire plane is filled with unspeakable brilliance, which is so strong. So that Rogge felt that every breath he breathed, it was light, and the fire was a fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he should have been burning in the light for a long time, but somehow, despite the burning of his body, he still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the brilliance of the entire plane suddenly dimmed, and the 12th round of the original fascination that could not be seen directly became soft at the moment. Rays. This is not because they are darkened, but because there is no way to describe their mighty glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked up to the sky, staring at the unimaginable but not dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the purest light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is full of the sky, filled with every corner of the plane, and also has a physical pain for Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light that filled everything, the message was eloquently conveyed, and the content naturally appeared in Rogge’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the Wannian Covenant, make the following ruling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge knows, this message At the same time, it also sounded in the twelve rounds of Shenghui. But he did not understand why he would know this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he was shocked and determined that there were many familiarities in the twelve rounds of Shenghui. Among them are Dimasson, the lord of destruction, and Isaac, the Redeemer. Rogge once again questioned Victoria and remembered the atmosphere of the war master Sant Niktoria. And hiding in the farthest, the most erratic light, but Rogge is the most impressive one, that is the billionaire chairman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has a future to think about what is the anniversary of the year, and what the so-called ruling is, I feel that the whole plane is shaking, and then the Lord of Destruction The glory of Smassen has expanded dramatically and become extremely dazzling, and the glory of Isaac, the Redeemer, is also expanding. The light of the Lord of Hundreds has fluctuated a bit. It seems to have changed, and nothing seems to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other gods are bright and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has not recovered from the shock, and he saw a round of Shen Hui suddenly dimmed into a burning fireball, roaring down to the fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s heart jumped wildly, because although he had never had any contact, he still felt a little bit with Weiner from this round of magic. The same breath. Is he the one who created the Tiramis of the Angels of Light? Why is he falling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge only felt breathless, his chest blocked, he wanted to cry, but he couldn’t make any sound. The fat man feels very strange, and he and Tilatemis are not relatives, from which point of view they are not guilty of this Lord God. So, where does this unbearable pain come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning Tilatemis keeps falling, and at the bottom of the pole, he finally breaks through the invisible space edge like a huge meteorite. Aroused a burst of embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, through the hustle and bustle of the space, Rogge glimpsed the other side of the heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a vast space, in the flow of light, there are countless wings flickering. Those are angels. They are neatly arranged and their eyes are closed. It seems to be sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
