			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Rogge laugh is that under the guidance of Hughes, the little goblin Froya spent a long time on his belly painted on his belly. A magical array. Hughes didn't know where to get a pure and infinite sacred energy. Without saying anything, it was infused with a magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the magical array was in operation, Rogge screamed, and the whole body was cold and sweaty, and immediately fainted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divine power directly burns the flesh and the taste of the soul is not something that ordinary people can bear! Then the pain of no stop was awakening his life. But in front of Fu Luoya and Androni, the two beautiful women, Rogge had to die to face, his face was blue, the whole body trembled, and finally resisted no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first magical array was running for half an hour! Rogge fainted and woke up several times. Compared with the time when the holy water was drenched in the church that day, the feeling of this time is the difference between hell and heaven. But the fat man actually still tolerated it, this perseverance made the people around him secretly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old fox’s method of finding out from the Elf books is indeed effective. *** The sacred energy left behind is exhausted, and Rogge’s wounds have stabilized, and no longer have to rely on the precious silver dragon spinal cord to sustain life. Since then, Androni has injected a sacred temperament into the magical array every day, of course, the effect is much worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, Rogge’s injury is always good every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin Froya always smiles in front of Rogge every day, but there is always a sadness that can’t be concealed. She and Androni will meet every day, but Froya will never say a word to her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sees this in his eyes, and of course he knows what is going on. The fat man is just a strange, what kind of girl can make Androni change heart, if there is a chance, he really wants to marry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is very quick, he has no ability to think about it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The once-day sacred energy burning has exhausted all his willpower and energy. Androni's divine energy is far worse than *** in terms of quality and quantity, so the time required to suppress Rogge's injury and even make it better has doubled. It is. However, although her sacred vindictiveness is much less effective, in pain, it is no less energy than ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has been tempering for many years, and he is optimistic, and he can only use this once-a-day temper as a temper. Especially when he has endured the baptism of the first wave of divine energy, the spirit has a slight rise, and the heart is even more ecstasy. From then on, he did not rely on mental strength to resist the pain, nor let Froya give him an anesthetic. Every day, he only bitterly bites his teeth, and often faints and then wakes up with great pain. He knows that this opportunity will not come again. If there is no pressure from a fatal injury, he will never suffer this pain again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After another week, Rogge was able to walk barefoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A news that surprised Rogge was that Wind Butterfly’s injury was also extremely heavy. The elf's physique was weak, and it was directly drawn by the silver dragon's giant tail. The bones of the wind butterfly were broken by dozens of bones, and the spine was broken into three pieces. If there is not a master of Fu Luoya, and there is a priceless raw material for the silver dragon spinal cord, the life of the butterfly will not be guaranteed. When Rogge could go to the ground, he immediately went to see the butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge first saw the butterfly, almost no one could believe his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful elf of the past has been withered, and a tassel-like gold has lost its luster and spread freely on the pillow. Her pale face was faintly cyan, and her eyes lost the glory of the past, staring at the ceiling. When she heard the door ringing, her eyes just turned a little bit, and saw that the person who came in was Rogge, and she did not react, and stared at the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya followed, took out a small silver bottle and dripped a drop of bloody liquid into the nostrils of the butterfly. A touch of redness slowly caught the cheeks of the wind butterfly, but her eyes were still hollow and stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is her injury?" Rogge asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge slowly sat down beside the wind butterfly bed and looked into her eyes. The wind butterfly is still a little reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s brow wrinkled even more! She didn't want to live, she was completely mad at her eyes. This should be one reason why she can't recover. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya looked at the wind butterfly, and there was a deep sadness in his eyes: "I have never seen such a wonderful elf girl, if it is dead like this." It is a pity. What did you do to her, she would hate you like that? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is very simple, love and hate are almost always written on the face. Rogge knows the savvy as Froya, it is not surprising to see this. He didn't want to explain. Even if he had a skin kiss, he should always guard against this little goblin. The problem of the wind butterfly, he is ready to go back and solve it. Rogge guessed that the wind butterfly is because he feels that even if he survives, he will resume martial arts. It is also hopeless, not to mention revenge to myself, only to die. It is not difficult to defeat her heart defense and resolve her death. The difficulty is how to cure her injury. If she really can't recover, then It’s a pity that Rogge had to pay a lot of effort.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it, decided to go to the elders of Hughes. Let that The old fox is well-checked in his 'elf chanting', is there any way to replace the 'Shen Yushu' to cure the wind butterfly's injury. It is easy to find a bright mage close to the big magical level, what Rogge knows. But a pope, a Burke Cardinal. But these two people, he is also a The one who is willing to see is to have the opportunity to see, and he definitely does not have the courage to see.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the elf guards, Rogge struggled to come to the elders of Hughes The residence, still not in the door, I heard a squeaky metal rubbing sound inside, with a sigh in the middle of the sigh. Rogge is a glimpse, he really can't think of anything that can make Hughes This old guy is so sad, can't help but feel curiosity and push the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, the door of Xiusi is never locked, inside the door There is no institutional trap. Rogge does not think that the nature of Hughes is just right, but this unfathomable old thing does not need these useless furnishings at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Keeping the Elf Guardian outside the door and passing through a cloister, Rogge, who has not recovered, finally struggled to move his body into the large living room of Hughes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;A piece of jade-like silver shines on the floor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Xiusi are sitting in the middle of the floor, There was a little silver in his hand, and his right hand was flashing with a short green mantle, and he was working hard. The harsh metal friction sound came from his hands. His neat silver-gray head was a little messy, and his forehead was slightly sweaty. A silver powder, a seemingly incomprehensible wandering.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is surprised and funny, he wants to see what it is to torture this old fox into This way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge entering the door, the scowling Hughes looked up at him and sighed, and lowered his head and delved into the things in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger came to the interest. He resisted the pain in his abdomen and slowly sat on the ground, picking up a silver-sized disc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this a silver dragon scale? How could it be so small? Old things, your two short swords cut open silver dragon scales is not a problem, why? Hard work? But then again, your good things are too much, and even the sickle has a sharply improved sharp and sturdy magical attribute, which is better than most of the magic swords. It is really eye-opening. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes snorted, his head did not lift, still squeezing and rubbing the little silver dragon scales in his hand, only half a martial arts stopped. He put the silver dragon scales carefully in his eyes, and then thrown them into a small pile of silver dragon scales that had been processed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing things. The hardest scales on the top and bottom of the silver dragon are the hundreds of fine scales between the jaw and the neck. That place is that the blue sky of Anne’s little guy can’t be inserted. Seeing that you have been so hurt this time, my old man’s heart is not going to go, I am going to take these hundreds of fine scales to make you a silver dragon armor, so that you can keep a small life. You don't know the human heart, but you still dare to laugh at my old man, be careful that I will come up with fire, and give you the silver dragon armor to cut corners! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge picked up a silver dragon's fine scales, and forced a fold. Under his brute force, the dragon scales did not move, and they did not bend. Although the scales are too small to be hard, but such a thin piece of dragon scale is so strong, it is incredible. The fat man of course opened the 'God's Hammer. One practice is to identify the raw materials. At this moment, a little try, he immediately Knowing the preciousness of these silver dragon scales, Rogge couldn't help but secretly rejoice that the day was from the back of Yinlong. He had carefully read all the information about Yinlong that he could find, only knowing that the back of the brain is the weakness of Yinlong. But I don't know if the fine scales under the neck will be so strong.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Rogge's temperament, it is definitely not going to touch the dragon's nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes picked up a silver dragon scale and began to sharpen the shape, drilling and chiseling. Looking at his progress, it is estimated that there is not a ten-minute period, and there is no way to make a dragon scale. Rogge saw it very clearly. Every time Xiusi was in the next moment, he raised his temper in that moment, so the little cockroaches everywhere, the scales flew, and the silver dragon scales were taken down a small layer. However, the vindictiveness of Hughes in this moment has reached 16 levels! It seems that if it weren’t for Xiusi’s hands, the elf craftsmen of the entire city of the gods would have no one to get the silver scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only possible to raise the fighting spirit to the 16th level in an instant, and then completely return to normal. If this old thing does not enter the sanctuary, Rogge is killed. Do not believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after repeated questioning by the fat man, Hughes only said: "I am a 400-year-old killer. The killer naturally has a killer. Usually hides the breath. It’s a qualified killer until the moment before the battle. That’s a qualified killer!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows from this old fox that he can’t ask anything. Come, in desperation, I only have to say: "You old things cost so much to do such a good good for me, is not a conspiracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Xiusi roared and the old man was born with misfortune. When you met such a god, I couldn’t make two pots of good tea! But if you don't keep your little boy's life, my elves will be in great trouble! I am helpless. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rughaha is also a smile! Without me, it is not easy for the elf to establish a foothold in human society! For the old things, you will look back again. Look through your 'Elves' loan to see if there is any way to cure the wind butterfly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sinks and says: "I It’s just a killer. It’s ignorant of magic and recovery. However, in my experience, the child who can’t recover from Fengdie is mainly because of the knot, and he lost his hope for future life, and he will die for himself. This knot is naturally easy to handle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted because the spine was broken, and the martial arts would be difficult to recover before despairing? Do not solve this, how to restore her hope? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed: "If I can solve even the light-recovery department of the Magistrate, I still need to solve it in the center." Have you been hiding in the mountains for four hundred years? The butterfly is a pity, but it is just an elf. I have limited energy. For the sake of the survival of the elves, I can only talk about it first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the hard-working Xiu Si, Rogge snorted, and he was not allowed to go out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dragged his wounded body and walked around the key points of the city of the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of the Gods The workshops are now in full swing, and the elf craftsmen are working hard to deal with the tough dragon skin and the pieces of hard scales that are harder than steel. The huge dragon skin can be made into nearly a hundred sets of light and strong leather armor, while the dragon scales are enough. Made more than 20 sets of heavy armor. Rog thought about it and ordered to make only 10 sets of heavy armor made up of silver dragon scales. The rest of the armor was only added to the most important part to increase the protection. In this way, you can make more than a hundred sets of magic armor. The only thing that is embarrassing is that the elf warrior is weak, except for the elite swordsmen and knights of the dark side of the moon, other elf warriors wear these Heavy armor martial arts will be greatly reduced. The leather armor made of silver dragon skin is far less protective than the dragon scales, but it is also a heavy infantry warfare. The universally equipped steel body is almost the same, but the weight is only slightly heavier than the ordinary leather armor, and it is suitable for the elven archers and killers of the dark side of the moon. The fly in the ointment is that these silver dragon leather shoes are too few. It’s not enough for the dark face of the moon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of the dark side of the moon, Rogge’s heart can’t help but gloomy. The dark side was originally eight hundred elves, but now there are only three hundred. The silver dragon battle, the dark side of the moon, all the melee warriors almost all died, the remaining elves are not archers, or killers. It seems that in the future, the main force, still I have to rely on the Terran army!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This elf wizard is also very devastating, and two elf elders are also on the spot. It is the magic lab set up by Rogge. A lot, but because of the guidance of Fu Luoya, the two elf masters who were forced to make medicines have benefited a lot. Froya gave them a few simple poison formulas, which are generally toxic, but they are better than raw materials. Sufficient supply, cheap price, system The process is simple, and it can fully meet the requirements of military production. Although these poisons are not killed on the spot, if they are not properly treated, they will return to the sky in half a day. On the battlefield, how can there be such an opportunity for you to be treated slowly? In the eyes of Rogge, these poisons are more important than the silver dragon scales.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the buildings in the middle of the elves have been demolished, and even the elders have been removed halfway. Only the elf temple occupied the best position on the side of the lake, and it was the farthest away from the old tree of the elves. Now the land has been leveled and formed a circular square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three low-pitched strange plants in the center of the square that are slowly growing. The magical lights of the two elf magicians are flashing and controlling these trees. Plant growth. It can be seen that they are not easy. After a while, their magic is consumed cleanly, and these plants have only taken a few new sprouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of elves are carefully crafting a tiny magic symbol on the ground. Elder Sarah was the only surviving elder wizard in the Battle of Silver Dragon. He held a thick stack of drawings in his hand and directed the elves to arrange this huge magical array. Looking at this progress, it is estimated that it will take another half month to complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked up at the old tree of the elf, which was already yellow, dotted with the green color of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical array is still not perfect, but Froya can design such a magical array in a few days, it is already a rare magical genius. After Roger was awake, he realized that under the threat of Fu Luoya, Xiusi had handed over the magical array of the magical powers of the elves to the little goblin. Based on the Elf Magic Array, Froya finally designed this magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are still many flaws, it is better than nothing. Rogge is ready to wait for the body to fully recover, then re-complete this magical array with reference to the magical magic knowledge left by Elysses and the memory of the sorcerer Elgra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, behind him came the sound of Androni’s crisp voice: "Rogge, you just got out of bed and ran around! It’s time for treatment. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face was white and almost sat on the ground. The elf guards who held him were all unbearable. Rog snorted and moved to the temple step by step with a tragic expression of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is getting darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the treatment was completed, Rogge’s heart was loose, and he lost consciousness half-sleeping. The elf maid pulled out Rogge's clenched fists and took out the handkerchief that had been pinched, and covered the body of Rogge with the quilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is also very tired, and it is not a small burden for her to continue to consume a lot of vindictiveness. These days, she is extremely admired for Roger's will. Tolerate this kind of pain, he does not struggle, does not shout, just lying still and suffering, fainting and then wake up. Androni asked himself if he had to change his position with Rogge, he would not only need to be tied up, but he would have to scream like a pig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extremely weak, slumbering Rogge still seems to feel pain, and the meat on his face will be smashed from time to time. Androni chuckled and whispered: "Live it! You have done so many bad things, and it should be a little retribution." But to say that she still sighed, using a scarf to face Rogge Gently wipe off the sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is also very tired, maintaining the magical array on Rogge's belly for a long time, even for a magician like her is a heavy burden. When Rogge’s treatment was over, she walked out of the room, as if she didn’t know that Androni was watching her melancholy. Froya knew that Androni had to guard Rogge for a while, and waited for him to recover before he would go back to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria quietly pushed the door of the wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the butterfly room is already dark, she has used the medicine, and now there will be no more people to disturb her rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is still holding a pair of big eyes that are lost, and there is no response to someone coming in. Froya's fingertips ignited a small group of magical flames that illuminate his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria...sister..." Wind Butterfly finally had some reaction, and spit out a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sat down at the bed of the wind butterfly, stroking the face of the wind butterfly, gently said: "Stupid child, how can you suddenly think about it? Is it afraid? Will the body be better in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tear ran quietly from the eyes of the wind butterfly, and she said hard: "I can't be good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
