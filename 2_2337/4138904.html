			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful torrents rushed from the unknown void, tangled into more surging giants, whistling across the conscious world. And he is a undulating leaf between the peaks and valleys, sometimes walking through the peaks of the peaks, and sometimes wandering in the roaring tide. The horror of the sea is like a rush of snow, and the huge waves come one after another. The leaves are thrown up and down, and the sandstones that have settled in the deepest memory are washed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one flashed from his eyes. Among them, there is a slumber that sleeps in the shackles. The peerless face is as clean as the Qingquan polyester stone. The singularity of the unbelievable 黛 黛 赫 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远 永远Elysses, there is also the Orpheus like the god of war. Then Ajia Ni, Fu Luoya, Androni, Hughes and others appeared one by one, and even a very short figure appeared in front of him, and could not go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to find out who the little figure was in memory, only to think that the gnome Nakbar he had seen was somewhat similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream of 6 strangers does not know how long it lasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have regained the moment before his death, and finally all the light and shadow are attributed to the silver and the darkness. But this time, the black flame gradually became one with the darkness, and it could no longer be distinguished. Only the silver enamel shining with soft light seemed to be the hope of majesty in the endless darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, someone held him tightly, his cheeks against some soft things, giving him a strange feeling of comfort and peace of mind. Cool and sweet aroma. It seems that there is a pair of cold, slippery and gentle little hands walking up and down in his body, where he has been tortured in his dreams and his pain has been swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly sank into the deepest ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it’s been...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly opened his eyes and a beam of sunshine It just happened to fall on his face. For a while he adapted to the glare and slowly saw the scene in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the Victorian-style deluxe king bed appears first in the field of vision. The mahogany bed column is engraved with the laurel pattern, supporting the overlapping stacks of treasury. These beautiful fabrics are the handicrafts of the large 6 southwest desert nation. It is precious not only because of the exotic art of exoticism, but also because of its rarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to move, and the reactions everywhere were extremely slow. Just like the distance of 10,000 kilometers between his brain and his hand, he was extremely uncomfortable at one time. He had to turn his eyes and direct the only neat organ to look around the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a large and gorgeous room, whether it is a rocking chair in front of the floor-to-ceiling window or a decorative cabinet in the corner, omnipresent curves, a lot of carved decorations, and a typical Luo Coco style atmosphere. It is worth noting that there is a crown-shaped ornament on the bed and the top of the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rogue Master, are you awake? Great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog feels This chilly and hoarse voice is very familiar, but I can't remember who it is. He tried to turn his head, but he didn't have any strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of cold hands stretched out and lifted him up. I don't know why, Rogge always felt that behind these gentle hand movements, there was a murderous murder and a strong bloody taste. This is not for him, but for a record of past experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger turned his head and looked at it, and it was the beautiful face of Rose. She is still cold and mysterious, just because of the dark circles that come from fatigue, giving her a singularity of the indifferent faces of thousands of miles away. She held Rogge and sat down with a blanket for him. The gentle appetite of her movements and the coldness of her expression are very contradictory, giving Rogge an inexplicable feeling. Why is it Rose, not Fu Luoya? Rogge felt that his thinking was still slow and he could not think well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Rogge was awake, and the physical feelings recovered a little. He asked weakly: When was it? What about the goddess? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei said: "You have been in a coma for three days." When the night battle was settled, the goddess' floating city had already flown away, and I have never seen it appear again since then. In addition, you are now in the Imperial Palace in Delaware, and the Delaware Chamber has announced the surrender, adult. "Next, Mei briefed the situation on Rogge briefly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them were killed by the help of the defenders, and many died in the chaos. In addition, there is a large and very different death block in the city. The soldiers who are full of streets and lanes don't want to say it. The civilians in the whole area are almost dead at home, and a few survivors are on the verge of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t listen to a woman’s voice, especially a woman’s scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles weakly, and he naturally knows that this is the masterpiece of the dead banshee. In this way, there are at least 200,000 more dead souls outside the city of Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Wake up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to summon ***, but still as usual, with no response at all. Rogge smiled a bit, and it took a long time for the Dark Dragon Magic Array to refine the soul energy, not to mention the incomplete Dark Dragon Faction. After all, I was only comatose for three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face suddenly changed, he suddenly remembered the wrath of the natural goddess! When he was in a coma for a long time, he completely lost the suppression of the wrath of the natural goddess. It is reasonable to say that it has long been dismembered by the goddess of the natural goddess. Rogge condensed the spirit, but fortunately, although his physical strength and magic are empty, but the huge unparalleled mental strength is still as good as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of his soul, the goddess of nature is condensed in one place, like a green pearl, floating quietly in the spiritual ocean, like a sleep, There is no sign of activity at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge glimpsed, completely ignorant of how the goddess of nature, who has always been so wicked, is so docile. His thoughts are only moving, and the sea of ​​consciousness is a little bit bleak. The goddess of nature suddenly gave off a soft light, slowly began to swirl, and the green mans were slightly expanded. Rogge still did not understand, the green light suddenly expanded into a huge green curtain, quickly rushed out of Rogge's body, began to look around for prey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s surprise is nothing short of a sigh of relief, his spirit is eager to condense, and the goddess of nature, who is madly counterattacking, is killed in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original rose by his side, exclaimed, and the flashing figure has already retreated to the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden burst of smoke in the room, and expensive beds, furniture, paintings and antiques instantly turned into fly ash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plop, Rogge fell heavily on the ground. His body is still unable to move at will, this fall, chest and abdomen is a sharp pain, only feels whirlwind, almost fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the rose explored the probe inside, a bite, and jumped in and lifted Rogge. Her movements are soft, but her body shines brightly with vindictiveness, apparently in full alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Rogge is really a bitter smile, and he did not expect that he did not control it for a while, and his mental strength was too high, and it would cause This damage results. It seems that this is the unexpected gain from the desperate struggle between the goddess of nature and the goddess of nature during this time. However, Rogge did not feel how to be proud of it. Although this kind of attack with mental power and unintentional movement is silent and invincible, it is not a level of skill compared with the spiritual impact of directly rushing into consciousness and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that everything in the room had been destroyed, and had to take Rogge to another room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a break and recovered a lot of physical strength and spirit, so he continued to listen to the situation in the past three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May is indeed a very good intelligence officer, she can always make one thing very clear in a few words. But one thing that surprised Rogge was that Wenna was actually caught by oysters! This master, known for his alchemy skills, is indeed an alternative to the top ten mages. It’s just that Wennain’s death did not fall, and he had been on a hunger strike for three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the legendary figure of the Great Magister, it is that people like Wallace don’t dare to mess around, and they can’t just torture, only Rogge decides. But Rogge has been unconscious, so Rogge’s friends began to intervene in 'persuaving' Wena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, Rogge nodded. He examined his body, although his body was still thickly bandaged, but with his horrible rejuvenation, the wound would grow completely in less than two days. He will know about Wena's information in his mind, and barely stand up, let's go to Master Wen. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wen’s situation is both tragic and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not an easy task to imprison a great magister. Even if you can't meditate, the magic of the big magister will slowly recover. Even if it is tied up with hands and feet, blocking the mouth, the silence and the instant magic are enough to make the approaching big magician become a very dangerous move. Moreover, magic such as unlocking, removing traps, and unbinding is not a difficult skill. Any big magician can easily attach a number of skills similar to extreme effects and tacit. Obviously, a large alchemist like Wena is an expert in dealing with imprisonment. But the person who imprisoned him is an expert among the experts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge glass jar in the center of the cell, which is tall enough to fill the water. Wenna is standing in this big tank. His feet were locked at the bottom of the tank, and his hands were hung on the ceiling, with a cotton swab hidden inside his fingers. If Wenna tries to move the magic with a gesture, then the action is a little bigger, and the steel needle in the cotton swab will pierce his finger, even if it is a person with a strong willpower, a sharp god on the finger. It is also enough to make the magic fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water in the tank just did not pass the bald head of Wenna, his nose was firmly clamped by a clip, a hose stretched into his mouth, For his breathing. If Wenna wants to recite a spell, then the water in the tank will immediately fill his mouth, and the remaining spells will be rushed into his stomach, and he will be able to kill him. And by soaking him in the water, even if he can cast silent magic, the magic of electric, fire, and ice can't be used, and the room left for Wen's wave is much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most important thing is the thread of several fine gold mixed with Wenner. One end of the silk thread is a scorpion magic needle made of Mithril, and the other end is connected with a magic torch. The magic flame in the torch is bright and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is a fierce person who used the Dragon Egg and the Amorro as the source of the magical power of the gods. He is a big expert in how to draw the power of life. . He knew that these scorpion needles were extremely knowledgeable. Every time Winner's magic power is restored, it will be absorbed by the magical needles for the magic torch lighting. It was Rogge who did his own hands and asked himself that he could never do better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, there is no one to guard, and Wenna is never able to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked around and saw that the cell was rushed from a laboratory in Winner, and there were many mechanical parts scattered around it. At the corner, there is also a large test bench with numerous sophisticated tools on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger indicated that Rose put some water in the glass jar and exposed Wen’s mouth. Wenna spit out the hose in his mouth and snorted heavily. He said, "You, these Asrofike pigs, have the ability to kill me. I want to give you life, it is a dream! Hey! These Damn ghost pin!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shakes his head and smiles, he is also a great magician, knowing that every drop of magic is sucked by the magic needle. . It is definitely a kind of torture, only effective torture to the magician! It seems that the people who arrange it all are not only deeply rooted in the weakness of the magician, but also very vicious. As long as I think that Wenna has been in this environment for three days, the fat man can't help but admire the will of the bald old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ignored the scream of Wenna, but gave a few words to the whisper. Mei went out of the door and turned around. More than a dozen Masters sneaked in, followed by a team of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you doing..." Wenna, who has been groaning in his mouth, suddenly screams with a louder voice, and the tail is still shivering with a shiver The screams.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled cheerfully, still ignores Wenna, but said to Mei: Remember, treat the noble name of Master Wenna Characters must not be rude. They must not be tortured like barbarians, and they can destroy the spirit at most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen or so masters commanded the soldiers to take all metal objects in the room. They all moved out. Every time I take away one thing, whether it is a finished product or a part, or even some metal strips that have just been cut, Wenna is very painful, screaming and screaming, and the swearing words in the mouth are getting more and more fascinating to the big magician. The roots are high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment ago, the room was empty and empty, and half-wire metal could not be seen. Wena also became languid, and even the snoring could not be heard. He swept away his eyes and tried to find something, even a strange screw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect this old man to hold on to the magic pin for three days. He wants to fight with me. It's still far away! I still have a lot of tricks to use!" This tempting and sweet voice Rogge is very Familiarity is the little goblin of Froya. Somehow, Rogge suddenly remembered the time when he was going to catch the dwarf, and the time that he walked with and hated and loved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at Wenna, and there was a smirk in his mouth. Sure enough, when Wenna heard the voice of Fu Luoya, her face immediately shook her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, if you are willing to listen to my advice, all the metal items in the cell will be evacuated, then I will guarantee the reputation of four hundred years of killing. He must have been unable to live for three days! The great alchemist who has such rumors must have a passion for the cause he is engaged in. He will not let him see things related to his work. It is the most severe punishment. "The voice of Hughes is always so calm." Just listening to his words, Wenna gritted his teeth and hated the look of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to use your method, I don’t believe it, the old guy can live this level today! "The little goblin is evil. Even if it is awkward, her voice has a kind of petite taste, which is enough for a man to think about it, but if someone suspects that her means is powerful, then she will regret it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the room while arguing, and saw Rogge, they all stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria, What good things have you prepared today? Rogge asked with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you awake? "Froya stared at Rogge. Almost subconscious, she raised her right hand and jumped back to the silk in front of the forehead. The other hand pulled the placket that emphasized the chest line. As for holding it in her hand. The big box was forgotten by the owner and slipped quietly to the ground. Hughes sighed and reached out and the big box flew into his own hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just woke up soon, and now I have no strength. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up. "Floria took a sigh of relief and the tone became very relaxed: "It is a matter of time before you wake up. There is nothing to worry about." You are here, just to see how I can clean up this stubborn gentleman. She said it easily, but when she saw Rogge woke up, her eyes were still a little red, and she secretly revealed something.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner took Fu Luoya And Hughes, both hate and fear in his eyes, his attention was immediately attracted to the big box.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery was revealed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the box is a very elaborate Tiffany model. It faithfully records the current state of Tiffany, and even can clearly see the melting of the beach under the gate. The floor formed by the steel brakes, and the scars formed by the burning on the wall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria slammed into Wendy’s face and smiled at him. Swinging to Sius, the latter took two steps in a very cooperative way, holding the model in both hands and keeping it under the nose of Wenna. She stretched out her hand and smashed it over the distinctive buildings of the Tiffany model. Dial the past.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you want to do?" Wenna snarled, and his angry eyes were covered with bloodshot eyes. He has vaguely guessed the idea of ​​this vicious little goblin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a very bad mood recently. What do you want to do when a woman is in a bad mood? You are so smart, you don't need to say it, you will know it. Something!” The little fairy smiled charmingly and dressed up as a beautiful little face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a soft bang, and Fuluya’s two spring-like fingers caught a section of the outer wall of the Tiffany model and pulled it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner’s breathing began to be heavy and heavy, and the eyes of the big ones were rushing out, holding the fingers of the sheep’s fat jade, as if looking at the world’s most Terrible things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblins apparently came to the ground before they came to the ground, knowing the source, strengths and weaknesses of each of Tiffany's chic buildings. Although she lacks magic, she also has a profound knowledge of magic. Therefore, all the features of the four spires of Winnera are beyond her eyes. The comments are extremely authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria commented on the building of Tiffany, commenting on one to remove one. And every time the sound rang, Winner would scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya is not afraid that he has no real threat. He just laughs: "Although the demolished model is enjoyable, my mood is still not good. It may be a good idea to go out and blow up a section of the city wall."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "Who is causing you? I will give you a sigh of relief. How can I split a city wall? I have to tear down the walls of Tiffany!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner sneered at the nose, gestured unbelief, and tried to support the unintentional posture, but how did the confusing distraction look over the savage characters in the house? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "I have the final say now. Don't just say that it is just a split of the city wall, it is to dismantle the whole of Tiffany, it is not a big deal. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenna took a closer look at Rogge and said with anger: "You are the demon who held the bloody double flag all the way? You slaughtered so much. The Delaware, do you still want me to sell you life? If you have the ability, you will kill me, and the wrath of the sky will avenge me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles Empty anger? I have personally sent him back to the embrace of the goddess of nature. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible! "Wen Naomi called, he looked at Rogge and dismissed the truth: "Is it by you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes coughs and takes the old man, your ten There are more than one hundred grievances attached to each of the killings! There are so many unrequited grievances that come out and say that we kill more people, and you are afraid that you can’t go anywhere! Looks like Delaware The number of people missing each year must be quite a lot. If they know that the great magician and the alchemist Wenna, who have always admired, originally created these killings by means of Necromancer, what would happen?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wen took a look, his face was suddenly white and white, and he was suddenly unable to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose whispered at Rogge's ear for a while, and Rogge nodded no less than Master Wenner and the blood of the Delaware Chamber, and his status is noble! Now that the Delaware Chamber is basically intact, if you return, I can recruit them in the empire and let them enjoy the worry-free life forever as the Duke of the Empire. You may wish to think slowly, anyway, Tiffany is not able to be dismantled in one day. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner closed his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes suddenly coughed, Wenna immediately The whole body trembled, and it seemed that he was still worried about the coughing of Hughes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Wenna, I am very reluctant to say something. There are many things you can improve in your killings! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner immediately closed his eyes and didn't look at him, but the corner of his mouth twitched it, and for a few times he wanted to open it, and forcibly endured it.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Xius did not let him wait, and immediately sighed: "For example, if the shell is made of Baroque dense steel in the era of the Elven Empire..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have the formula of Baroque's dense steel? "Wenner can't stand it anymore, open his eyes and scream!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have a recipe, but this thing is made of dense steel." . "Sius swayed the sword in front of Wenna. There was no decoration at the end of the hilt, and the faint blue light unique to the steel was shining. But in the eyes of Wenna, this blue light is more beautiful than all colors." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was extremely painful, exhausted his will, and finally closed his eyes. Even if there is no formula, as long as there is a small piece of Baroque dense steel for experiment, He is also very likely to develop formulas. This wonderful metal is known for its sturdness and peculiar flexibility. If it is used as a shell for killing, then it will no longer be as fearful as a heavy blunt weapon. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes coughed again, and Wena began to tremble, and the sweat of the beans rushed out of the bald head.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Wenna, the goddess has always been very courteous to a big magician like you. Maybe... I just said maybe, you can have a lab on the city of the sky, and you have the opportunity to talk to a vast lichens who have lived for thousands of years to explore the vast world of magic..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
