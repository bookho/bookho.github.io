			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory now has a grievance against his wicked master. In this hunting, which has been around for more than a month, he has always played the role of a hound and a bait. However, the fruits of victory were all taken over by the ***. Gregory looked at it and it was very troublesome to clean up a strong point. It gradually became a single zombie warrior. Although this is still a hundred thousand miles away from the peak of the *** period, it is much stronger than the Gregorian who can only deal with two zombie warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I had to eat those supplements, I should have been able to fly now!" Gregory thought as he hated and rushed to a small group. Next to the zombie, throwing one is a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for it to bite the head of the zombie, and suddenly a strong force came, and the scene in front of him rushed back. It was about to roar in anger, and a bone spear was inserted into the ground almost at the tip of his nose. Gregory almost fainted, and it gratefully looked back and it was the *** that pulled his tail. It looked forward and immediately shook and stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pure black hellfire horse in front, there is no coix seed in the bloody red eyes, but there is a vague burning flame. Its four huge hooves are swaying on the ground, and from time to time there will be a bloody flame coming out of the horseshoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately a dark knight, a dark full body armor, full-faced helmet, only a pair of bloody eyes in the helmet. The black knight raised a huge long knife, and the blade was streaked and covered with countless gaps. I don’t know how many souls have been lost. The seven-bone spears are fanned out on the back of the black knight, and a pair of giant swords are hung behind the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory instinctively felt the power of the Black Knight, and immediately hid behind the ***. Although it is clearly able to feel the anger of the owner, but nowadays it is not so much. Who told it to look after the thoughts, forgot to observe who is the boss of this site. After the event, I will definitely be repaired by ***! It thought with dismay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s still the demon dragon Gregory, the little dark knight in front of you will look in the eye and wait, see the flame hell horse ...this can never be a low-level dark knight! In the past, there was a dark knight under the master's hand, and the guy was riding a tattered shabby bone horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knight... Is it a high-level ghost knight? Even the hell of the Demon Dragon Knight Li Gaoli took a sip, this rider is not his own! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory! Look at the good things you do!" *** growled, and the souls of Gregory were almost gone. The communication between the high-level undead creatures of the outer world is purely by the spirit, so when the anger is angry, the soul of Gregory is often shaken, and the painful mark is printed directly on the sinking of its soul. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory quickly asked for mercy: "Master! I really didn't mean it! At the moment, it's not when you punish me, we, look... or first Run it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***After glanced at the four small short legs of Gregory, although the bone dragon can not blush, but Geli Gao Li still has no land. In the face of the ghostly knight, the master servant who lost his ability to fly could not escape. As for the fight, with the ability of the master and the servant, it is not bad to be able to fight together and fight the hellfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost Rider has no meaning to communicate with the invaders. In its view, these two small wastes are the food that is delivered to the door. It spurred the hellfire horse that had long waited for impatientness and rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory and *** are standing still, seemingly scared. In this case, the ghost knight sees much. Under the natural pressure of the Hellfire Horse, these weak undead creatures are often scared to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse is like a wind! The electric light flashed, and the knives have already collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory suddenly formed a group, then slammed a heavy foot on it, and the master and servant immediately left and right, just flashed the ghost knight one strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost Rider rushed over his head, and it struck the flames and horses very hard, and finally turned around. With a cry, a huge object was thrown over, and the ghost knight slashed and smashed the object into two segments. It is now, thrown over is a zombie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the hell fire horse was long and stunned, and the place was beaten. The ghost knight escaped from Gregory. A black and green mist was covering the hellfire horse. Scattered. The ghost rider waved his hand, and the bloody flame drove the poisonous fog clean, and then the horse chased the ghostly Gregory who escaped slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vanity of the bone dragon is bitter, and just a poisonous mist sprayed almost all of its energy, and it was also sneaked into the worst-prepared horse* *! That's it, there is no effect on the ghost knight, that horse is slower, and wants to wait for it to die, it is not the door. It can't help but resent the fate, why is it deflected to create a wind poison dragon! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not entirely unprofitable. A divine effort, the ghost knight was stunned by a zombie. *** Get this opportunity, throwing zombies one after another. But it can only be found that the ghost knight is sitting in an unstable position immediately, and even the Malays can't do it. As for the damage, how do you get a pile of carrion? The ghost knight has a full body made of two inches thick iron? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further zombie flew over, and the Ghost Rider had already seen the embarrassment behind the zombie. But this little trick is not in his eyes that have lived for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, it’s a bottom-up approach. When the ghost knight’s knives are suddenly approaching, a black fire suddenly turns into a five-meter long Great flame long knife! This knife not only cut off the zombies in front, but also hides behind the *** to stop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost knight looked coldly at half a frame and flew over to himself under the influence of inertia, only one right hand helplessly Caught in the air. The sly mouth is still fiercely one by one, and it seems that I want to bite myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It never does boring things, just waiting for the half-claw to smash on his armor. It even began to fantasize about the smashing teeth that collapsed in their armor. As a high-level undead, it not only has wisdom, but also has a little more sense of humor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;骷髅's hand caught his armor and scratched his shoulders helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fascinating metal friction sounded, and the ghost knight was surprised to see that the heavy armor was twisted and deformed under the skeleton of the hand, constantly cracking. The thin hand bone actually dig into its fine iron body armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long time of the dead, the ghost knight’s brain was somewhat sluggish, and it didn’t want to understand what was obviously not in line with its experience. It is still amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, *** didn’t give it another chance to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled back and turned into a face with the ghost knight, the bloody flames and the pale flames in both eyes almost met. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghost Knight felt a powerful suction pulling his soul and trying to pull it out of this armor. It prides itself on the fact that the skill of sucking the soul is very rare in the high-level undead, but it is a minority that has mastered this skill! The bloody flame in the eyes of the Ghost Knight frantically burned and began to pull the soul of the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of wrestling has always been a strong winner. The *** that was far from restoring strength gradually fell in the wind, and the pale flame in her eyes began to flicker and gradually dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Crashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, when the pale flame in her eye frame disappeared, a golden light that suddenly touched the eyes suddenly lighted up! This golden light infinitely expands in the eyes of the ghost knight. At this moment, it seems to see the faces of countless angels and demons alternately appearing on the face of the ***; at this moment, it has re-examined itself again. The process of being born to die and resurrected by death. It suddenly understood how he came to this place of the dead, suffering long and never-ending pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has lived in this world, the world is not so quiet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly recalling the past experience, the ghost knight was shaken. Just like a small spring on the dam, its soul core began to be sucked by ***. This then became the entire embankment, and the entire consciousness of the Ghost Knight was gradually pulled by the golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost knight fell to the ground. *** is still firmly attached to him, but at this time the blood of the ghost knight in the eyes of the flame has been dull, it seems to be extinguished at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell Flame Horse instinctively felt the master's crisis, it screamed, and the front hoof went to the half. It is only a hoof, and there is a huge pain in the **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory cares the enthusiasm, the whole body is hung on the hell of the horse, bite it is not loose! As long as ** is broken up, you can reorganize your body. If the *** dissipates, it will only have a way to bury it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One dragon and one horse are wrestling and wrestling here, and the horse wants to set the dragon to death innumerable times, but the rogue bone dragon is dead. Gregory can be clever, and knows that as soon as his mouth is loose, he will be trampled into the bones of this angry hellfire horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse suddenly stood still, and then Gu Gregorian was still trying to bite it, fighting on his limbs, slowly retreating . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost knight does not know when it becomes a shell of armor, a thick black, seemingly life-like fog above the armor is constantly Rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense fog is getting denser and more and more tumbling. There seems to be an invisible suction in the fog. The hell flames are smashing in the ground, but they are still pulled back by the suction, leaving four deep mud grooves behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swipe! The huge wings suddenly unfolded from the dense fog, and the right hand of a demon came out of the fog lightningly, ** the head of Hellfire and the horse. The horse screamed and slowly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory hurriedly jumped from the horse, crouched beside the black fog, swaying his tail with enthusiasm, and greedily glanced down on the ground from time to time. Hellfire horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's right hand pumped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory screamed and threw himself on the body of Hellfire, and began to enjoy this rare supplement. It began to feel that it was not bad to do it under the master's hand! At least the master teaches how it directly absorbs the soul energy of undead and how to reorganize its body with new materials. Before encountering the master, it was silly and instinctively fighting and evolving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that this is a skill similar to the devouring legend of the Devil! In the devil world, being despised by the devil, he is born with the demon of the devouring skills but only three people. They are now the strongest of the exclusive side! If you can return to the devil world, Gregory also has the confidence to become the strongest of the Devils! At that time, see who else dares to look down on it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is admitted that it is obviously more horrible to teach this skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory bites the horse's head and carefully sucks the soul energy that is floating inside. After a short time, countless white filaments grew out of its body and slowly rolled onto the body of the Hellfire Horse. More and more filaments, more and more dense, eventually turned into a white big cockroach, wrapped in bone dragon and hell flame horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog of the ghost knight’s armor is getting thicker and thicker and gradually becomes more substantial. Slowly, a left hand condenses in the fog, then two feet, and a pair of slender legs...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the black fog finally Dissipated, a beautiful, evil figure stepped out of the fog. She is like a dark black glass sculpture with a soft glow. A pair of straight, slender legs are bare, but there is a natural armor in the waist and hip. The upper body is also covered with natural armor, and there is a faint glow in the armor. On the head, it looks like a very long and straight drooping. If you look closely, it will be completely integrated under the flashing luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a long, but a naturally generated helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face is constantly changing, from the beautiful angel to the fierce demon, the illusion. Only closed eyes have not tasted <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has any changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the closed eyes opened, and it was a pair of silver eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her hands and her hands were delicate and perfect. The left hand is the luster of the glass, and the gloss reflected by the right hand flows slowly as if there is life. There will always be a bloody electric fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She started the wings again, so she slowly rose and floated quietly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, hesitated for a long time, she pointed to draw a circle, a clear water appeared in front of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face reflected in the water is clear and perfect, classical and mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Standed for a moment, countless tiny scales were created on the face, slowly joined together, and finally combined with a long helmet. It became a covered helmet, revealing only the double eyes like a void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color is full of cover and majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Gathered the wings and leaned over to pick up the eight-bone spear left by the Ghost Knight, and left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is still asleep in that huge white. ***I know that this rare hellfire flame horse is too high for Gregory. I am afraid it will be digested for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Not in a hurry, she also needs time to digest the huge power of the Ghost Knight. Alien is a concept of no time, she does not understand why all people are so rushed in that colorful world. In particular, the person who has a soul contract with himself will make many inexplicable things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly knows how much ambition is hidden in the depths of Rogge’s soul. But why is he not directly pursuing power, but going to do so many useless things? When he just woke up, Rogge’s power was far better than himself. But now, *** sigh gently, he is afraid that even Gregory can not beat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The rogue hanging in the past few days was spent in fear. As long as he thinks about the future, he will shudder. Now he is a big man who is killed or will not go to see the church, heresy, this is a crime that has always been heavier than rebellion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge could not explain the uneasiness in the depths of his heart, but he clearly remembered the topic of destiny that he had talked with Froya. He jumped out of the water. Because he was on the back of Rodriguez, he jumped far higher than the average fish, although he was just a small shrimp. Although it is still unclear what will be waiting for himself in the future, this uneasiness is enough to make him decide that it is time to make some preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty is not afraid to go out now, all things can only be supported by Lens and Franco in Lille City. At the thieves' guild, the more and more fascinating rens gave Rogge a whole set of must-have tools for wild adventures and more than a dozen ingenious, sinister and powerful traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco has acquired a lot of magic scrolls for Rogge, and even a magical magic wand that can make three decompositions! In addition, the six-level magic ‘Death Ring’ scroll is the most precious. Rogge carefully placed the reels in various positions of the clothes so that they could be reached when needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the black crystal that forbidden the dwarf king and the soul of Paulus. He hesitated. Now, refining undead creatures will inevitably give you feelings, and it’s not much to find death. But in case something happens, the souls of these two strong men are not so easy to find, throwing this crystal can not be reluctant. If you don't throw it, this is the iron card of the Necromancer! After hesitating for a long time, Rogge finally made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, he re-sensed the existence of ***, although he did not dare to summon her to see, this still makes the fat happy! So, at noon at a bright sun, the fat sneaky scorpion sent the two souls to the outside world where the *** was. The reason why I chose to do this during the day is because people are mixed up at this time, and it is the time when the characters of the church are the least vigilant. After all, undead creatures are common sense in midnight activities. There is no such thing as a Necromancer who will perform a Necromancer experiment at the Great Noon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the time, the fat man fights his life and recites the space magic book, he knows that this book is not a big road that can be obtained from the magic guild . After ten days, I had to embark on the road to escape. But it is not necessary for a big man like Orphee to give himself such a valuable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Rens and Franco felt that Rogge had some fuss, not just a few senior church members? It’s not a good job to close the door. It’s a big deal to hide in Reyesburg. It’s close to the battlefield, just need someone to defend! But the uneasiness in the fat man made him resolutely prepare for work. He always felt that these things are likely to come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the battlefield of Ron thousands of miles away, Orphey’s prestige is once again rumored by people. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Rheinland Army occupied the Fortress of the Passage, Marshal Rosjorio opened the army and confronted the Leiden Fortress, which was stationed by the Knights of the Heavens. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leiden Fortress has a 50,000-strong garrison, which is personally guarded by the deputy head of the non-Tian Knights. The deputy head is an old knight who is over half a year old and has a lot of experience in war. Through all kinds of channels that he could not see, he knew the exact news of the shortage of the Rheinland Army. The city of Leiden is deep in the river, has abundant food, and has enough groundwater. With these few reasons, he made up his mind and couldn't keep it, and he was prepared to spend a year and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry, Rosello is not in a hurry. He left only 30,000 old and weak defensive defensive channel fortresses, and the remaining troops were divided into 5,000 teams, such as locusts, scattered into the rural villages of the Ron Principality, began to harass the place, looting the military food. Even more exasperating is that he ordered the expulsion of the nobles from all parts of the Ron to the city of Ron. The troops of the Rhine League told these nobles that this was because the non-Tian Knights did not dare to go out of the city without a knightly spirit, and let the aristocrats of Ron's Principality endure the result of war baptism. When the old turtle climbed out of the fortress and the battle was right, the Rhine Union would return the property of the all confiscated Ron nobles. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rheinland alliance has strong and weak troops, including the third-rate troops composed entirely of knights and the main knights composed of reloaded knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this locust storm blew, two legions splendidly created a battlefield myth. The natural ones are the Golden Lion Knights and the Lions Knights led by Ofi Rock. Although there are only more than 5,000 knights, their combat power is famous in the world. In terms of unit combat power, they are far from the non-day knights of the top ten knights. Under the leadership of Orpheq, this cavalry was a ghost, and the East was defeated by the West. It defeated six small and medium-sized mercenary groups, and even one of the four major mercenary groups was defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another legendary regiment is the Knights of the Wolfs led by David. The Knights of the Wolf Knights have always been famous for the military squad, and the Cavaliers’ personal combat power is still countered. After the monks led the public, they did not neglect the military discipline. They slanted and slanted to the hinterland of the Principality of Ron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron’s national wind is strong, and the small city along the way saw this weak and attractive army, often resisting the temptation to gather three or five thousand people. Just kill it and prepare to give the intruders a headache. Unexpectedly, this David was scheming and set the bottom, basically killing the daring master who dared to leave the city. Of course, this David really has a set of people who know the Ron Principality and the small-scale combat mercenary group, he has to go far away. From this sinister point of view, he and Rogge are quite similar, and it is no wonder that he is bent on collecting Rogge as used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod’s Knights always appeared near Ron City, scaring Ron’s grandfather, and strictly defending the non-day Knights stationed in Ron City. The most elite knights are transferred to guard the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inexplicable war and absurd tactics forced Orphey to reveal all the strength. Now the whole world knows that there is another young paladin in the Rhine League. Now the Paladin is moving around the kingdom, how can the elderly Ron be afraid? He began to worry about his life safety day and night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Marshal Rosio, who has 30,000 infantry, still sits idle in the middle of the army and listens to the reports from all over the world. The defending garrison of Leiden saw that Rosherio had only 30,000 troops and thought that there were cheap and arrogant, so he killed it and tried several times to capture the fortress of the God of Passage. However, Marshal Rosherio used the soldiers to be as stable as the mountains, and did not leak the water. He did not let the other party discuss it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three attacks, a total loss of 6,000 people, the non-day Knights had to go back to the Leiden Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days passed slowly, and the more than a dozen troops sent by the Rhine League were defeated and defeated, and one of them was completely smashed by the Night Motors Mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
