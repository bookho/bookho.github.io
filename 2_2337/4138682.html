			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick soldier reached for Rogge’s collar and shouted: “The little nephew really wants to find a fight, is it? The Laozis are the Knights of the Wolf. ...just halfway through, his wrist was inexplicably in the hands of Rogge, and then there was a burst of bones in Tikal. The man screamed just halfway out and was taken by Rogge. In the shade, he sucked his mouth and fell to the ground, his face instantly became purple, rolling over the ground, but he couldn’t make a sound.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another knight was shocked After taking a step back, he felt that Rogge had already disappeared. When he was looking around in horror, a huge pain suddenly came from the back. He was black before he knew nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger kicked the second knight, followed by the left foot on the knight’s ankle, and the bones rang constantly. Rogge expected he had no The ability to stop the self again, just on the back of the two fallen knights, another person made up a foot, kicked a dizzy thing, saved screams and bothered <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sound, the sawdust was flying, the door of a room on the second floor was kicked by Rogge. To see the situation inside the house, Rogge almost fainted. In the past.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few old acquaintances of Rogge in the room. Liliths is wearing a white cloth strap on each of her hands. The cloth belt circumvented the beam of the house, and the two ends were held in the hands of George and Blanc. The two brothers constantly tightened and relaxed the cloth in their hands, and Lilith was still struggling with indomitableness, which made the girl white. The dazzling body is like a fish caught in water, squirming and squirming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of white cloth is stuffed in Lily's mouth, There is also a red palm print on her left cheek. The clothes on the girl's body are all torn into one piece, obviously intentional. Under the girl's body twisting, the full chest and white thighs are hidden. I can see the men in the house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides George and Blanc, they are dressed in trainees. In addition to the brothers of the knight's suit, there are three or four knights dressed in military uniforms of the Wolf Knights. One of them is full of flesh and looks like a man in front of the girl. He holds the girl's waist in one hand. The other hand is pushing up the girl's white thighs and trying to put it on her shoulders. His armor has been taken off the side, and the ugly cock is rising high, trying to get into the girl's warm and tender body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl unexpectedly did not cry, a pair of eyes staring at the man in front of him, struggling to struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blank and George Brothers face twisted, smirked, and constantly tightened the tape. The girl’s body is getting higher and higher, and the room for struggle is getting smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s anger is mixed, and the blood is rising, and the vision of looking out is already blood red. An unstoppable killing is coming from the depths of the soul, and in a moment Rogge only wants to tear all the living creatures in the house. He opened his mouth and screamed, and the spiritual shock wave instantly hit every inch of space fifty meters. When the people in the house went out, the eyes were protruding, the blood in the mouth and nose was overflowing, and they fell softly. Liliths also suffered an electric shock and his face suddenly turned white. Even a few neighbors have been affected, and several old people have fallen to the ground on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the only clear line, in order to take care of Lilith, Rogge reluctantly suppressed the power of this spiritual shock. Fortunately, Liliths is determined to be strong, and the ability to withstand mental shocks is clearly far beyond the wolf knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blank and the George brothers both loosened their hands and the girl fell to the ground, but Lilith had already entered Rogge, and she immediately ran away. Come over, she has never cried in the humiliation, but she burst into tears at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wolf Knight Squadron leader followed suit and recovered. He jumped up and yelled: "Which thing that doesn't open your eyes dares to break down the good things of my Gost! Come, pull me to the military camp, Lao Tzu must exercise this grandson!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not falling, a fist is constantly expanding in front of his eyes, followed by the flying Venus. Gust's huge body flew up and slammed into the wood wall. Before he slipped, Rogge made another punch on his stomach. The brute force of the fat man is extremely horrible. He tries his best to control his anger and his strength, so that he can break through this Gust. This is the case, just a punch, let the strong Gust put out a blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gust crashed to the ground, Rogge still did not let go, stepped on his penis that had not yet softened, with steel and spurs The boots were crushed and smashed. That Gust was screaming, a huge burning candle in the room suddenly flew up, lightning bolted into his mouth, flames and wax oil blocked his screams in his throat. That Ghost’s eyes turned a few times, and after a while, he fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the people of the Knights of the Wolverine are still somewhat courageous and have not been completely intimidated. They whistled and prepared to attack. Rogge screamed like a beast, and the figure walked through the audience for a week, and the wolf knights slowly fell down with a blank expression. In an instant, Rogge smashed the shoulders of all the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at Blanch with his bloody eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blank is treacherous: don't mess! We are all...all are the Knights of the Wolf, and the head of the group will not let you go! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf Knights? I don't dare to mess around, I really don't dare to mess! Rogge smiled and picked up the coma in Gost, tearing off a muscle from Gust's arm. The pain awakened Gust from the coma and then sent him back into a coma. Gosts in the coma is still a few times from time to time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge licked his lips and came to Blanc. Come over Don't kill me!” Blanc even cried and cried, using his hands and feet to retreat, reaching the corner and retreating. Blanc's figure is tall, at least half a head higher than Rogge, but at this moment Rogge's endless killing pressure, can not afford to revolt or escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently patted Blanc's face and smirked: "My Blanc cousin, we really have a good relationship, I didn't expect to see you in Lille. Can you tell me why you are here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blank is cold and stiff, tongue Knotted and stammered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge left the night, the two brothers were dragged into the woods by several unidentified black men. Shortly afterwards, seeing the little Rivers family territory can no longer squeeze out any oil and water, and fear that the secret forces will start again. The brothers have just raised their bodies and left the country. Under the recommendation of Brown's old friends, they invested in the Knights of the Wolf and served as the two trainee knights of the Gustner Light Cavalry Squadron. After three months, they will naturally become official cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brothers and Gust have the same taste and mix very well. Soon after the two newcomers, although they have no ability to do evil, but the heart is still there. When Gosts is guilty, he is helping the hand on the side, making a fun, and having a good addiction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day the two patrolled, happened to meet Lilith, then quietly followed her to this small hotel. The two brothers think of Rogge, and the new hatreds come to mind, and this Lilith is also a delicious food they have thought for a long time. This time they see it in a foreign land, naturally they can't let go. However, they are only trainee knights. They still dare not go too far in Wangcheng. They have to rely on this Ghost. Under the guise of two people, Gosts was so sullen, and today I brought a few knights to this small hotel. When I saw Lilyston, I was shocked to be a heavenly person. I sent people to the store and I was ready. The eroticism, but unexpectedly killed Rogge this comet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slightly suppressed his own killing at this moment, and immediately remembered the task of his own Ronowski, reaching out and blacing The trainee knight's ankle is made like a paper paste and is easily torn open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stared at Blanc's lower body, which was still covered with gauze. After some tossing, some blood was oozing on the gauze. Rogge squeezed out the teeth from his teeth: "You know that Lilith is my person, and I dare to put my idea on her head? The goods are the goods, they have already smashed a knife, how can they still resemble a horse Ah, the patron is this Gost? Fuck your ancestors, the Cavaliers squadron elders will not dare to provoke him, huh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every squeeze out a Rogge Just stretch your right hand and put a finger on the gauze. Roger's brute force is like a cow, and it is under anger. The power of this bomb is less than a few pounds. Blanc's face purple rose like a drop of blood, but the mouth was firmly held by Rogge's left hand, where is called half a voice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Blanc has been awake by Rogge for several times, and he has seen more gas and less gas. ** A pool of blood, red is shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Blanke is already out of prison, Rogge’s eyes turned and he saw George in the knights in the land. A cruel smile floated on Rogge's mouth, his eyes quickly turned into silver, and then the blood red completely covered the silver. George's body was held by an invisible giant hand and rose into the air. The demonic Rogge slowly walked over...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter night The wind whistling, driving the last ray of sunshine out of Lille City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge turned his head. Lilith didn't know when she had changed her clothes outside. She was leaning on the door frame at the moment and looked at him with some fear. In the girl's pupil, Rogge saw a face-faced monster, covered in blood, a knight was tied in the air by an invisible rope, and a monster was slowly digging into the knight's eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster, isn't it me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is drenched in a basin of cold water, Rogge suddenly woke up. His mental strength was loose, and the knight in the air lost his reliance and fell heavily on the floor. The knight did not wait to recover from the huge pain, and he cried and climbed to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog stunned, see Gust fell on the floor in the middle of the room, a left leg was thrown on the other side of the room, a look of extreme fear Forever condensed on his face. There are a total of five wolf knights in the house, and only two are still alive at the moment. The marriage of Blanc and the George brothers has already ended the life of sin, pain and twists and turns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly opened the window and a cold wind came. He took a few deep breaths and calmed his mood, which turned around to face the hellish scene in the house. After all, he was a man who had experienced the storm. In the twinkling of an eye, he made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilys reluctantly suppressed vomiting, seeing Rogge recover his mind, and then let go of his heart. This relaxation, she can no longer hold back the surge in the stomach, kneeling on the ground and spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger gently patted Lilith's back until she emptied everything in her stomach. He hid the left hand in the back and gently shook it twice. The two surviving wolf knights screamed softly, head to head and followed their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing of so many Knights of the Wolf Knights is no small matter, Liliths understands this. So when Rogge went downstairs, the girl did not try to stop, just slammed her face and sobbed, with a mixture of prayers. Lilys finally couldn’t stand it and fainted when the two screams of the downstairs came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue looked at the dead bodies in the room indifferently, concentrated on the spells, and the two hands kept drawing various magic symbols. . A variety of magic symbols floated out of his hands and slowly melted into the magic circle that had just been drawn on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stench was filled in the room, and then the darkness came out of the big group in the magical array, and the two ghouls climbed out. They immediately appeared in front of the delicious, desperately squirming the fat body, flew to the corpse, and chewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s spiritual strength has caged the entire small hotel, capturing every magical wave that tries to escape. In this bustling city, especially in a city that believes in a bright church, he must be cautious. The body that was swallowed by the ghoul, whose soul will be carried along with the depths of Hell, will become the ghoul's excrement there. Even the most wise pastor can't redeem or summon this completely filthy soul. In this way, naturally no one will summon the things that have been born here through the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gusthur is not a glorious thing, so he is coming from his confidant. Others don’t know what he is doing this time, where to go. . This Rogge easily asked from the mouth of the Wolf Knight. He figured out that if you carefully cleaned up the traces of the scene, perhaps the endogenous things in this hotel would never be known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! At least David knows! Rogge time sweaty heavy clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, Rogge didn’t figure out what to do, he had to decide to take a step and see, and soon David would open the cards. Right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up all the traces, Rogge came to Lilith's room and undressed to bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liliths was already tired and very sleepy, but in a blink of an eye was awakened by Rogge. After a very stressful day, and a long time reunion, both of them need some way to vent. So the small building was refilled with a crazy atmosphere, but this time, the breath is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is not bright, the melodious bell of the church awakens the sleeping Rogge and Lilith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger got up in a cloak, he looked at Lilith, hesitated for a moment, finally said: "Or, you still go back with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the expression of relief, Rogge’s face flashed past, and Lilith felt the pain in her chest. But on the surface, the girl has recovered the liveliness and happiness of the past. She only took Rogge's hand and said softly: "Remember to come to see me when you have time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded, went out, and did not notice the sadness of the girl behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge returned to his small building, Lille City just woke up from a deep sleep. Leaning against the lounge chair by the window, Rogge finally had a quiet time, and he could relive the thrilling experience of these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting with David, Andrei and Froya, although only a few times, but every time I meet, Rogge has a rabbit and The feeling of three wolves drinking coffee together. In particular, Froya and Andre had a breath that made Roger feel extremely dangerous. After the encounter on the street, too strong stimulation made Rogge feel awkward until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger looked at the bloody red glow of the window with some irritability, and the red made him feel extra thick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should I kill so many people? Why can't I control myself, what is the killing effect? ​​Even when killing them? Very happy! The feeling of crushing the ribs by hand! How can there be a kind of happiness for a woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His finger taps unconsciously The table shows the tension that is beyond his control. Killing is not the first time for him, and it will never be the last. However, this does not mean that he agrees with the indiscriminate killing, and he is never willing to be a bloodthirsty person. Killing should be just a means, and it is a means of using it when it is a last resort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand! I am afraid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the 'Night Return' Inn The real reason for the massacre was still the fear of Rogge. That is the deepest part of my heart, the fear that I don't want to face. It is a fear of the overwhelming power of Andre and Froya. Although the strength of Orpheq and Elysses is deeper than the depths of the world, they are far from the scope of Rogge’s understanding, but they are a backing for Rogge, he can feel that Orpheq is against himself. Repatriation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Andrei and Froya are different. Froya has always been a beautiful smile that has been devastating for thousands of years. However, in the short time of street conversation, she has already killed Rogge several times. If it’s not that she’s ugly, her acting is in place, maybe she’s really going to kill. For a princess, killing a subordinate aristocrat is at most a little trouble. I am afraid that this trouble will not be much larger than having to wear a tight vest for the purpose of attending a party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre gave his own oppression more than Froya. In front of him, Rogge carefully concealed his mental strength, so as not to make a hint of exposure. Andre’s vindictiveness rushed into his body like a Taotao river, and he explored unscrupulously. It was in this contact that Rogge deeply received the terrible essence of "starry temperament". This kind of vindictiveness implies the power of the stars in the sky, and has the terrible power to transform the material and crystallize it. In the process of Andrea's exploration of himself, if he is willing, he can make himself fall in the same way as the crow at any time. The feeling, like the lamb lying on the cutting board, can only watch the butcher compare with his knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Roger is timid, he is not afraid of death. At that time, I was able to fully participate in the performance of a good clown, which made him think that it is incredible in retrospect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, although he was superficially ill, this fear grew up in his heart and accumulated the slaughter in the hotel. It was actually this fear. Catharsis. He relies on slaughtering the weak to prove that he is a strong man to solve this fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlocking this knot, Rogge finally felt more relaxed. He stood in front of the window, took a deep breath, and slowly spit it out. Deep in his consciousness, his mental power slowly swirls, like a cloud of lavender and shining a few Venus clouds. As his eyes turned silver, the whole world was once again flattened in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog tried to remember the experience of connecting with the spirit of Elysses and providing her with a spatial orientation. He raised his hand to touch the world of the plane in front of him. There was a ripple in the space. The people of Rogge were still in the same place, and their hands were still in the forward position. His spirit has already broken through this space. Once again in a strange alien world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
