			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenes in the air seem to have slight fluctuations, but they have returned to their original state, as if nothing had ever been born. Rogge, who was quietly at the top of the peak, saw a group of blue energy rising to the Dragon Peak with astonishing degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it him? When did the son of the son become so deep? Actually know the post-production." Rogge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the deserted village to the passage to Longfeng, Andre was hit harder and harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen bodies lying in the village, and several of them are extremely horrible, almost letting Andre spit it out. Andre knew that these people were all Druids, and several of them were still killed in the effect of the deformation, leaving the body still half-human and half-beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre does not believe that there should be any kindness in the battle, but these bodies include a girl and have been stabbed at least fifty Sword above! The people who started the hand were obviously very clever, and each sword cut only a thin layer of flesh. Andrei saw at a glance that this cut is the most painful way for the deceased. The person who started the hand obviously has a pathological enthusiasm for the killing, and the girl’s lips, eyes and eyes are cut off! On the sleek and delicate belly of the girl, she was cut out of a devil's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre trembled slightly, angry almost mad! Looking at the girl's body, the coolness of the shower straight into his heart from his fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to kill this murderer! Andre has never been so strong to kill! He wants that person to taste the taste of being an important part of his body! For a time, countless new hatreds poured into his heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter who you are, even Karajan or Chrisma, I will never let you live out of the forest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene on the mountain road makes his mood more gloomy. At the beginning, only the sporadic old man and the child’s body fell on the side of the road. Later, more and more old and weak women and children were getting more and more, and the law of death was getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a massacre. A massacre that allows the butchers to fully demonstrate their skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andree reached the summit, before his eyes, is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood! Blood is everywhere! Purple-black, blood that has not yet fully solidified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody sea is full of skulls, arms, half body and pieces of internal organs. The corpses and weapons are even covered with tens of meters high cliffs! In addition to the extremely strong bloody taste in the air, it is also mixed with a bit of sour smell. Among the corpses on the ground, there are dozens of blackened cockroaches, and some cockroaches still maintain a fighting stance! Andrei can't see what it is that can turn so many people into embarrassment in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a cry of sparse pull on the square. More than a dozen surviving villagers are crying to check the bodies of their loved ones and take care of the people who are seriously injured. Most of the seriously injured who have not yet died, most of them helplessly lie on the ground, squatting, waiting for the arrival of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened here?!" Andre was shocked. After tracking the people of the church for so long, he is very aware of the strength of this team of holy knights. However, what kind of enemy is actually able to kill more than a hundred holy knights in such a cruel way? He does not think this is a masterpiece of those crying survivors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre has been a huge hole on the cliff for a long time. The crystal ball in his hand shows that the magic mark is in the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully maintains the effect of invisibility, walking between the deceased, the deceased and the undead. Although he tried to avoid the body, he could not avoid the blood everywhere. In the blood lake that was not completely coagulated, several footprints appeared quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre a flip, gently fell on the hole. Leave the hellish world behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave is tall, deep, dim, and damp. In the depths of the cave, there will be huge winds and loud rumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre is careful to go inside, he has already raised his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extremely loud voice suddenly sounded, obviously with anger: "Who is it! I smell the smell of humanity! Who dares to invade the noble Trillen Hugh's palace! Show me up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge light eye emerges in the air. The light eyes opened and the entire hall lit up. Andrei immediately showed that his invisibility effect had disappeared. Can you cast a "real eye" without a spell? Andre was shocked by the strength of the other side, but did not know where the great magician was hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A green hill in front of him suddenly moved, and two golden flames ignited, staring at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out to be a dragon! Andrea felt that his body was completely cold. He still doesn't think he can challenge a dragon, maybe Pross can, but he still can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the blue sky, trying to improve his vindictiveness, the blue light shines, and the essence. He didn't dare to move a little. He had to wait for the Green Dragon to strike, and he had a chance to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei, who is very competitive, quickly calms down and faces an angry dragon. If you don’t calm down, it means death. Just why is Rogge in this dragon? Could it be that he has become the dish of this dragon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei quickly showed the extremely eye-catching wound on the ventral side of Trillen Hugh, and he noticed that there was only a short cut in the green dragon. The wings. He also said that the large scales of the green dragon have disappeared, and the place where the scales were originally flesh and blood is blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After weighing it carefully, Andre smiled. Obviously, this dragon has slaughtered a church squad of a whole squadron. However, Karajan and Chrisma did not make it much better. The wounds in it were still bleeding. Suffering such a heavy injury, it is a miracle that this dragon is not dead. Andre thinks that there is a treasure in the place where there is a dragon. Now the name of the dragon and the treasure of the dragon are waiting for him to harvest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two idiots Karajan and Chrisma seem to have lost a lot of time. They have sown the seeds, but they have harvested the fruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Green Dragon, if you are a healthy dragon, I will choose to run away immediately. After all, I have not reached the level of the Paladin. But your injury now. Obviously very heavy, maybe, my blue sky will once again let you know what pain is." Andre smiled, gently waving the blue sky sword, leaving a beautiful blue flame tail in the air. His vindictiveness has been transformed into a blue flame, and a little starlight continues to fly out of the flame and slowly dissipate in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre in the blue flame is beautiful as a dream, but this beauty is a naked threat and intimidation in the eyes of Green Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid humans! It’s my injury, it’s enough to crush you! Make a price for your arrogance!” It screamed Andre rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s coming soon, Andre is more difficult than Chrisma. His figure is lightning fast, leaving a pale blue afterimage in the air. Trillen Hugh was completely unable to keep up with his movements. However, even more annoying to the Green Dragon is that the power of Chris Mart is insufficient, and the Green Dragon is stinging at most, and Andre's Blue Star Sword is an artifact! Under the full force of Andrei, the blue sky can easily pierce the scales of the green dragon. Every time a sword is pierced, Andrei will fully inject starry air, and the scales and a small piece of skin around the sword will slowly crystallize and gradually become blue and transparent crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, a huge green dragon slammed in vain, and a blue light band circulated around it, always with a blue The electric fire blasted between the green dragon and the light belt. A long, screaming dragon shook the wall with gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trilen Hugh felt that several of his sword wounds gradually lost consciousness after heching. It was slightly stronger, and then the blue crystal of the sword wound on the forelimb was stunned and fell off, leaving a deep hole with a depth of several inches and a round of flesh and blood! A burst of pain in the heart came from the wound, almost let it plant a turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain is even more irritating to the proud Trill Hull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suddenly has a huge mouth, a green spurt against Andre! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre was shocked. He thought that this was a dragon that would not breathe. Under the spur of the moment, he reluctantly condensed into a shield to meet the green dragon's breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei fell to the ground, and stood up tenaciously. Some blood was stained on his white face like a jade, and it was as beautiful as snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to spurt a bite, Trillen Hugh spit out almost all the dragons and dragons. At this moment, he only had a breather on the ground, desperately condensing acid and toxins in his throat. The violent action during the breath caused the blue crystals on several of his sword wounds to fall off, revealing several huge wounds, and the green dragon was dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trillion Hugh never thought that there would be such a sinister temper in the world, even though its acid and poison breath is not much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person and one dragon stunned for a long time, Andre suddenly smiled and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trillion Hugh instinctively felt the crisis, it saw a blue flame re-emerged from Andre’s body The sword once again released Guanghua. It has no choice but to squirt a dragon's blood with a dragon's blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei smiled proudly, and the starry spirit formed a blue shield. He was one of the swords, and snorted, and rose from the ground, flew to the dragon's head in the face of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a beautiful blue shooting star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteor greets the faint dragon, and Andre has already had a triumphant smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is about to end the life of this green dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to collide with the dragon, there was a sudden looming ripple in the space. Andrei only felt like a giant hammer suddenly slammed on his head, and there was a fascinating color band in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does this be the dragon magic? I am still too big..." His last thought was not finished, he lost consciousness, and then he sang He hit him hard and flew him far into the corner of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trilen Hugh also felt black in front of him, but the dragon’s mental strength was very strong, and it shook a few times and he recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha!" A smug, maddening laughter echoed in the hole. "I didn't expect to have a grandfather to come out and clean up the mess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trilen Hugh's eyes are vague, it tries to identify the comer, only to see Entering the hall is a chunky human, a guy who seems to be a demon and a low-level bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strange combination, it thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This combination is not weak, but it is not its opponent. But now, it has not much strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked around the hall, not knowing that because of the mental impact, the two nosebleeds were hanging on the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trill Hutt, you still don't want to do unnecessary rebellion. I know that, in normal times, we can't even take care of your once-in-a-life. But now, can you stand up? Haha! You can rest assured that I will take care of your treasure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this damn shameless fat The idea of ​​dare to hit his own treasure, Trillen Hugh was mad at the time. It is extremely angry, and stood up with pain! A pair of golden eyes stared at Rogge from the height of seven meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was shocked. He never thought that in the vicinity, the dragon standing up could have such a strong sense of oppression! Rogge's neck was tight, and the whole man was suddenly pulled back to the rear. Then a faint stagnation of a large group of pale blue dragon blood hit the place where he had stood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Gregory, the owner is not afraid of Trinity Hugh’s sour dragon, and the owner’s owner will naturally not be afraid. But Rogge knows that this is not the case at all. Whether the dragon blood is poisonous or not, it is hit by this dragon's breath, and the end will definitely not be better. He looked at the green dragon's breath and turned dozens of holy knights into blackened beggars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was furious, summoning a tall fire element, and summoning a sword spider, directing them to the green dragon. Later, he began to put cheap flame arrows on the green dragon's wounds one by one. This three-level magic consumes very little magic, but at the moment it is very vicious magic. The flame burned mercilessly with the green dragon's unprotected flesh and blood, and it hurts it. It’s just that the green dragon is already dying, but it’s the power of Rogge’s magic. It’s really a lot of time to kill the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Praying gently, Rogge was surprised to notice that her tone of voice was somewhat similar to that of Cara Yang, which I had not noticed before. After the prayers are finished, *** pull out a bone spear, raise your hand and finger, and immediately burn the raging pink fire on the bone spear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The wings are fully open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trilen Hugh only felt that his body suddenly heavier several times, and the seriously injured limbs could no longer support such a heavy body. There was a huge click on its forelimbs, and then the legs were soft, and it was obvious that the bones had broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is gravity control possible? Isn't this the exclusive stunt of the Lord God? Why? Why!" Trillen Hugh was so shocked that he almost forgot The pain that comes from everywhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咻! The harsh whistling sound, countless gravel was shaken down, and it was broken into stone powder in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning bone spear flies over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone spear is not fast, but it is a great power. The exhausted green dragon was no longer able to dodge, watching the bone spear pass through his neck, and completely disappeared into the stone wall on the other side, disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body of the Green Dragon crashed down. It was full of doubts, anger and unwillingness. Several indigo liquids flow out of its mouth, eyelids and ear holes. This liquid is like life, automatically brought together and slowly condenses into a fist-sized dark blue crystal. There seems to be a blue liquid in the crystal that is slowly flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon Crystal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge exclaimed. The fat man like a breeze swept past Gregory, the action is fast, almost no more than Andre! This shocked Gregory, a terrible existence of a great wizard with such agility! It was secretly glad that he was never too rude to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge picked up the dragon crystal, the crystal is so deep and beautiful, there seems to be a deep blue liquid flowing slowly. He observed for a long time and finally concluded that it was a piece of jasper dragon crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dragon is dead, if it is in extreme fear or anger, and has already spread the full potential of life, it is possible to leave the dragon crystal. Dragon crystal is actually composed of dragon's brain fluid, which brings together the energy essence of Long's life. Like the green dragon, the low dragon left the possibility of the dragon crystal is very low, I did not expect to be hit by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade Dragon Crystal inherits the attributes of this green dragon, but often only the more advanced Ice Dragon will leave Jasper Dragon Crystal. With this dragon crystal, Rogge's ice and poisonous magic will increase greatly in the future. At the same time, Longjing is still the supreme raw material for making the best magical props. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge felt that this piece of dragon crystal was not rest assured, and finally the heart was swallowed and swallowed. Although his stomach is large, the place for storing items is very small. After installing a black crystal and white jade, he can barely pretend this dragon crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** is also busy. In front of her, a blue mist of mist flashed, and from time to time there was a cyan light spot in the surrounding space, which was immediately inhaled by the mist. These light spots are the souls of Trillhuw's scattered. The soul of the Green Dragon is too strong, and *** can't control it completely. It can only collect some before the Green Dragon soul flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ran to the body of the dragon, grabbed the eye of the green dragon with both hands, and made enough effort to finally dig a long-eyed dragon eye. come out. The longan has completely condensed into a huge amber bead, a deep purple cross star in the bead, which is the pupil of the original dragon. He forced another dragon's eye out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two longanes, apart from being very rare gems, seem to have no other great use. But Rogge sensed a strange wave of volatility from it, presumably this longan can be used to refine some special magic items. He sighed, if Fes is here, naturally know how to wave the magic of these two longan. But the fat man, the incompetent alchemist, can't see what the two longanes are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The soul of the Green Dragon has been collected and led Gregory back to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is still too much to be used on a dragon, it will not run away. Rogge was even more eager to see what kind of treasures Trillen Hugh had collected in his millennial years. He eagerly searched the entire cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow of Rogge's eyes suddenly swept to a person who fell in the corner of the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately became alert. Andre! How did you forget him? It’s already the harvest season, so don’t let him destroy the good things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly rushed over to Andre, and lived in a hard place five meters away from him. If Andre is fainted, then this should be able to swindle him. However, Andre has no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked lightly, fearing to wake him up. His mental strength is at its highest state. If there is any change in Andre, he is ready to give him a mental impact. This is the secret weapon of the fat man. Although the power is far from fatal, most people, including Andre, will not guard against such unsuspecting attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre is lying quietly, as if asleep. His chestnut long has been spread out, and a few silks slanted on his face. His thick eyebrows were slightly twisted together, and he bit his lower lip gently, as if he felt pain in a coma. The skin that was originally like ice-like snow is now covered with a layer of faint cyan, apparently the poison of the green dragon Trillen Hugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s courage is slowly getting bigger. He first kicked and kicked Andrei tentatively and saw that he was totally unresponsive. It has been inspected for a long time with spiritual power. Andre’s mental strength is in a state of extreme debilitation, and the blue soul energy is dim and dull, and the stars that have overflowed in the past have long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is a little relieved. He reached out and provoked Andre's chin, carefully looking at the face of this beautiful and near demon. However, Andrei was still in the past, and Rogge’s hand could not help but shake, and his heart beat fast. As long as Andrea moves a little, he will scream and escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, this face, this skin, this eyebrow is really exquisite! Oh! It’s a little more than a little leprechaun !***, are you still a man? What do men do so beautifully!” Rogge’s mouth is not dry, but his heart is really afraid of being so close to him. So he turned Andrea over and found the rope and tied his hands tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre’s hands are long and thin, and each piece of nails has been carefully trimmed, and it feels cold and smooth, soft and boneless. Rogge couldn't help but touched two more. Then he rubbed his hand on his clothes a few times and shouted: "Hey! I don't like men like the perverted aristocrats. But the men who are so beautiful are really not seen!" If this Andrea is dressed as a woman, it is estimated that he can kill all the nobles who like men. Rossis accepts him as a disciple. Is it also seen at this point? After so many years, it is impossible for the mentor and the teacher to have nothing. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was thinking about it, while tying Andre, and adding a spell of magic. Such a simple second-level magic, because of distraction, actually failed four times in succession! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flipped Andre again, and hesitated: "***, such a beautiful man is a man, it is a fairy! After letting go, I will never be able to meet it again. As soon as I get to him, I will kill people immediately. I don’t know anyone who knows some big nobles. Ten of them have four or five favorite men. It’s not too much!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Andre’s slightly eyebrows, and he’s getting more and more heart-throbing, and he couldn’t help but reach out and touch him. The face of the face, the feeling of the tentacles, called ice muscle jade can not be overemphasized. Is it the memory of Elysses that remains on the fingertips, but that's it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly woke up and gave himself a slap in the face: "***, actually almost let a man fascinated and said that he also knows Luo Ya is also looking at your face. ***, if you are standing on a piece of Froya, I really can't say who is more beautiful! Waiting for Laozi to draw your face, see who you can still be No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the rumor said, Rogge was hesitant about whether or not he killed Andre. David has always been wooing himself. This Andrea and himself have not had any deep hatred. Although he has followed this time, he does not necessarily want to kill himself. To kill himself, he has long been an opportunity. Rogge thought about it, and decided to leave Andrea first, and explore the tone. At this moment, he has become a deadly enemy with the church of the world, and can erect an unfathomable enemy such as Marshal Roscio. It could not be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He explored Andre’s breath, and now the breath has become nothing. So he hurried down to listen to his heartbeat. He only thought that this Andrea's chest muscles were surprisingly thick and soft, and he couldn't understand whether he still had a heartbeat. Rogge was a little annoyed and tore his clothes. The force was used too hard, and his entire shirt was torn into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
