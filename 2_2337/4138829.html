			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the cost of heaven and six chapters in hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter six price<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly wakes up, but her mind is still faint, that is, she doesn't understand what happened, and she can't figure out where she is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to move, but the body seemed to no longer listen to her will, and then a burst of burning pain hit her from every part of the body Come, let her squat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to open her eyes and there was only a white glow in front of her eyes. There seems to be something behind the light, she tried to see, but nothing can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wake up." A thick, low-pitched voice came from behind the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly wants to move, but in addition to suffering more intense pain, she still can't move: "I...what is this? I...dead "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are on the verge of life and death. Answer my question, Elf! This will determine your life and death."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is still a piece of white, and nothing can be seen. She smiled a bit and said: "If...you can choose, I would rather choose to die. But... I can't die now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still want What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I want...want...powerful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill those Druids..." The butterfly almost squeezed out the words from the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart is still hurting, and the two lines of tears fall off the corner of the eye uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one she has paid for everything, has it gone like this? She paid everything, but she never exchanged anything. just now. Even his minimum ** existence has been obliterated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between life and death, all the love and hate in her heart are thousands of times clear. That pain is equally clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound behind the white light is silent for a while, once again: "I can give you strength, but the cost is equally high."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to pay...any price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White light fades away, and the consciousness of Wind Butterfly once again falls into a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Wind Butterfly once again woke up. This time. The burning pain and the incomparably strong desire for blood have disappeared, and her body has returned to its ability to act. It just feels weak, the body is empty, and there is almost no power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her eyes and stared blankly around. Now her mind is still in a very slow state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that comes to your attention is the huge magical array drawn on the ceiling. Dozens of various magical lights are slowly floating in the air. Each of them has its own invisible trajectory, staggered and will never hit each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly looked at the magical lights that fluttered for a while. Suddenly, I turned around and felt that my heart was extremely troubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you awake? Don't look at the magical array on your head. It's a very strong dark curse. You won't be able to stand it for a long time." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly struggled to sit up and look around, only to find that he was sitting on a white jade table. The room she was in was very large. At the moment, the magical array was drawn on all four walls. Various magical flames, crystals, gems, and many things that she couldn't name were embedded in the magic array. They all shine in a flash of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge workbench in the corner of the room, filled with bottles and cans, and a fat figure was busy in front of the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat body shadow does not return to the ground: "Is not who I am?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to me? I only remember one of Relo’s Remember the dagger, but now... how can I have no strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curse of the soul of the dagger, the stronger your power, the curse The power will be bigger. In order to temporarily control the curse attack, I have already eliminated your power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I need strength!" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat smiled: "Don't worry. Soon you will have more powerful power. Later you will find that those Druids will be in front of you." It will be vulnerable. Of course, this is a price, because I am not a god after all. It is necessary to lift your curse and give you more powerful power. I can only think of this method. However, you have not said that it is powerful. Can power pay any price? It seems that you finally understand that in this world, only power is supreme. With power, you can act according to your own wishes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts of Wind Butterfly are a bit clearer. She looked down at her naked body. The perfect curve is still enough to make any man sin, but at this moment the skin has completely turned into a lifeless light gray. There was a fine wound at the chest, and the mouth was neat and there was no bloody oozing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Rogge, can you tell me what is the price I have to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge injects a small bottle of blood red medicine into another large crystal dish, saying: "Wind butterfly, you must have heard of a taboo name of the elves' thousands of legends, Dark Elf Wangkla Moss. Bloodmoon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly trembled and said: "Cramos. Bloodmoon? He introduced countless elves with the power of darkness. The fallen bottomless abyss became a scorpion who only knew killing and bloodthirsty! Before he was destroyed by the three great elves, he and his dark elves were covered with the blood of the elves. You want to Turn me into a dark elf, this... How is it possible? Cramos. The dark power of Blood Moon is so strong that it even covered the entire sky! And how could you know how he introduced the elves into the dark?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dark Elf King can simultaneously turn hundreds of elves into black Elf, of course, I am not so strong to the metamorphosis. But with the power of magic props, I am sure that you will become a dark elf. What's more, there is no other good way to do it now, you can only take risks." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door opened, and Froya walked in with a tray, and there were dozens of bottles of large and small on the tray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thinking of Fengdie is still very late, and she wakes up for a long time. He whispered and tried to cover his body. It was Fu Luoya who was waiting to see it, and she just let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned and said, "Okay, let's get started!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Under his gesture, the wind butterfly, whose mind is still confused, slid down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took off his coat and had only one pair of trousers. He stood still for a moment. The pupil slowly turns into silvery white, and the body gradually grows taller and taller. The skin's black scales are faint on the skin. He picked up a slender brush and smacked it in a bottle of cyan magic potion, and drew it on the shoulder of the wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Rogge’s horrible appearance and infinite physique, carrying this brush seems to be very difficult. He painted one stroke at a time, and each stroke went down, and the butterfly would feel a cold and chilly, deep into the bone marrow, and her face had turned into cyan. The body kept shaking. But she has tolerated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge finished her left shoulder. The fat man is already sweating and can't help but gasp. He took a break for a while, grabbed a brush again, this time it was a bright red potion, the right shoulder of the butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning power of a rush can not rush into the body of the butterfly, she only feels that the blood is boiling, can not tell the sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge made a sum. Despite the slow drawing, but in the blink of an eye, the wind butterfly has been painted all over the body. During this period, Wind Butterfly seems to have withstood all the pains that have been suffered in life. But she bit her teeth and stiffened. Let the fat man can not help but admire the tenacity of her will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time Rogge draws a stroke, the consciousness of the wind butterfly will be clear. At this time, her mind has been completely awake, and she only feels that the strength of one stock is different in the body. She sat up and glanced at her body, which had been painted with various colors. What surprised her was that these magic lines were beautifully drawn and elegant, which made the extremely beautiful butterfly slightly put down some thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Rogge to pick out the finest pen and wanted to go to the dark black pigment in a tiny crystal bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." The wind butterfly stopped Rogge and asked, "Are this time after...I will become a dark elf?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger nodded: "After the dark coat of arms on your face is drawn, I will use the dark curse to trigger the power of all the magic lines, and then you The body will be completely occupied by the power of darkness. Although it is different from the black elves of Cramers. But it is essentially the same. The powerful power of darkness will dispel the curse you have received."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly stares at Rogge’s face. I found a slight hesitation in his eyes and immediately asked: "Do you have anything to tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed: "The curse in you There is a very strong bloodthirsty craving. In order to completely suppress and replace this curse, after you become a dark elf, I will add a dark bloody curse to you. This curse I changed some, removed the curse Command this part and weaken the power to increase your power when you start the blood. In this case, the curse will be much lighter to your will. With your will, you should be able to overcome the damage caused by the curse, but not all No risk. This curse must be strong enough to dispel bloodthirsty**."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I fell into a dark elf, would it be like a legend? Like the dark elves in the middle, completely lose their will, only knowing to obey the command of the Dark Elf King to kill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated: "Wind Butterfly , the nature of power does affect The temperament of the owner, but this is not absolute. For example, a low-level monster or an undead is only the most primitive slave, but the wisdom of the higher Mozu or Necromancer is not lost to the human or the wise in the elf. Can you overcome the influence of power, keep the mind clear, and completely look at your own will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly asks: "If I can't overcome the power What is the impact? What will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, you will lose your will and listen to my orders completely. But as your strength increases, There is still a chance to restore my mind in the future. You can rest assured that I will let you kill enough Druids."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, why don't you let I simply died, but it took so much effort to save me? I can see that you have spent a lot of precious magic materials. It is not worthwhile to say that you are not lacking people like me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge tiredly said: "You want to kill Ruyi, I also think, helping you is actually helping me, nothing to thank. The magic material is gone, you can find it, buy it again, and then grab it. If people don't have it, they will never find it again. Before Jia Ni left, I will take care of you. I can't even satisfy her little wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is silent for a while, Suddenly asked: "Rogge, I heard that the dark elves are all... very..." When she said this, her face was reddish and she couldn’t say anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and said: "Do you want to say **?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, history records always have untrue places, even more so in legend. Dark elves admire power and worship dark gods. Although I also It is not clear which god the Dark Elf King believes in, but obviously, the morality of the bound elf can no longer bind the Dark Elves. If they have **, they will satisfy it. In the eyes of the Elves, this is of course uncompromising* *. But in the eyes of the Dark Elves, they are only obeying their truest instincts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogdon paused and said: "Of course, Under the power of darkness, your original instinct will be strengthened by multiples... For you, this is also one of the costs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind butterfly Looking up to the sky, I don't know what I am thinking about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
