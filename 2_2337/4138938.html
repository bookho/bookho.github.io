It has a purple color in the blue-blue. This lightning has greatly reduced the lethality of the creature, but it has some paralysis effects and will amplify the pain when it is hit. It seems that this is the lore that Froja used to deal with the maid who dared to wake her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled, letting the tiny electric fire move back and forth on the back of his hand. He bent down and hugged Fulua. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria moved, and this barely woke up from her dreams and opened her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still the parallel space created by Xius, but it is much deserted. The magical flame that danced on the altar had already been extinguished, and the silver dragon egg that had been floating in the flame had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya remembered that Rogge had inserted his hand into the silver dragon egg from his left hand, and as if he had lost his soul, he could not stand still. And Xius told her that at this moment, I must not disturb Rogge. As for the final result, it is only a matter of resignation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria only waited, she didn’t know how long she waited, and finally fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time she finally woke up and looked at Rogge for a long time, and then dared to confirm the person in front of him, really is the dead fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin smiled. However, the tears in the two lines could not stop falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and wiped her tears and said: "You are more and more crying now!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria snorted and said: "You will be proud! Anyway, my tears are so much. When the day is over, I will never cry for you again. You were there. What do you do? Do you win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled proudly and said: "Of course win! If even the silver dragons that have not been born for a lifetime have been cleaned up No, I am really alive. Haha. It’s funny, this little thing actually wants to fight with me in its spiritual world! It probably doesn’t know. I don’t have any other skills, I’m still thinking. In the line. Well, and this little thing is not so lucky, I recently saw a detailed analysis of the terrible capabilities of an evil dragon in the abyss world, so I tried to become this dragon. I didn’t expect it to be finished. This cockroach actually won, it’s really boring. Haha! If the image of the dragon is not working, I would have Try the natural goddess, the gods of the heavenly gods, and even the highest gods may change to try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria heard a fog, She looked at the fat man and suddenly felt that it was becoming far away from him. She looked at it and suddenly snorted and said, "Dead fat, your... How did your appearance change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She left and right Look. It was finally discovered that Rogge’s left eye was already amber in color, and the pupil was a vertical slit, which did not look like a person’s eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya suddenly wakes up, if Rogge’s left eye is magnified dozens of times, it is a dragon eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did your left eye become like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated to be a dragon egg The reason for eating too much." Rogge said nothing, he slammed his eyes a few times. The left eye has returned to its usual state. That dragon eye, I don't know where he was hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge holds Froya and sends the door to the space in the corner of the platform. Froya struggled and jumped off the ground and said, "Wait a minute, where did the elders of Hughes go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, since he said that this is the place where he put some hidden items, I think there must be a lot of good things! Let's find it first, then go no later." Fu Luoya's eyes are blue, four times Look at the parallel space that seems to have nothing. I am eager to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled bitterly. As soon as he reached out, he took Fu Luoya up. Smiled: "This old fox is screaming! Do you think he will only have such a space? I have already turned over, nothing! Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The little goblin was unwilling to lie in Rogge's arms and asked: "Have you swallowed the dragon egg? What new things have been added?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""A dragon egg only, how much power can I add? The biggest gain is that it has taught me how to think and survive in a silver dragon way, or to say that a pair of dragons Look at the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is somewhat embarrassed:" This...is difficult to explain. But there is a place to understand. Froya, when you are facing a big magician, or a strong man, will you use low-level magic such as paralysis, confusion or lethargy? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not!" Fu Luoya replied slyly: "These low-level magic casts on these There is no chance of success at all. I am better off using dissociation! Although it is not likely to be successful, there is at least deterrence. Or I will apply some protective magic to myself. It’s useless low-level magic.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: “That’s it. We know that these low-level magics all have enhanced effects. Versions, they are not only much more magical, but also have a lot of spells and gestures when they are cast. But these high-level magic actually produces the same effect as basic magic. The only difference is that they are more difficult to resist. I just discovered that after the Dragon language magic is cast, the effects of paralysis and chaos are the same as our magic. However, the negative effects of Dragon language magic are very difficult to resist. In fact, this is not because of the Long language. It’s complicated. You and I know the dragon language. It’s really nothing special. The only difference between them is that you can use the dragon language to magically the high dragons. The soul and spiritual strength of the dragons are much stronger than ordinary humans. This is the key to determining the resistance of magic. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fool Ya frowned and nodded. Then he shook his head again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "I will give you a look, you will understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Speaking, I didn’t see any movements from him, only a slight flash of silver in his eyes, and Fu Luoya suddenly became stiff and unable to move. It was already in the middle of Rogge's instant paralysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria was shocked. If you combine this with the most common numbness of the instant, then Rogge must have at least the magic of applying seven levels of magic to do it. Therefore, the fat man must use low-order paralysis. Rather than strengthening the paralysis up to the fifth order. However, after Froya meditation in the practice plane, not only the magical control power is greatly enhanced, but also the magic resistance has increased, especially the magical ability to resist the spirit is more powerful, how can there be an ordinary paralysis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must be a coincidence! She thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried it several times in a row, but she couldn’t solve the magic in her body. Rogge smiled, and the same silently added a demon. Removed the paralysis from Froya. Next, it is paralysis, devil, numbness, demon, and repeated ten times, and Fu Luoya did not have a resistance success! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has some understanding of Rogge’s meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Rogge had already taken Froya out of the space door and appeared in the room of Hughes. Hughes was sitting in the corner of the room, drinking tea while reading a book. I saw Rogge coming out. He looked up and looked at the fat man carefully, then smiled and said: "Congratulations to Rogge, you are finally alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man laughed, "I can't lose with a little guy who hasn't seen the world. How can I lose? What book are you reading?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not falling, Luo Ge has already reached out and grabbed the book from Hughes. in the whole process. His left hand was always clutching Froya's waist, and the little goblin was as long as he was, and he would not leave at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge flipped a few pages, and sure enough, the book was written by a magician who tried all kinds of curses. The fat man slammed the book on the table and said, "Who is this written again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A nameless magician. His good deeds are all kinds of curses on the body. Of course, if you look at the book carefully, you will find that it has not been written. Because the book is the final chapter of the book. It is about the curse of death... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog thought for a moment and picked up the book and put it in his arms. The last time I learned from Xius, the magic book about the relationship between speed, time and space finally gave him a lot of inspiration. After curing the acceleration, knowing how to hide and dodge, the fat man combined these experiences and came up with many wonderful ways to escape. Nowadays, people who are generally point to it are trying to catch a fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all the books that Hughes read carefully, there are more or less weird, Rogge already knows this. And he has now discovered that thinking about problems from other perspectives can sometimes lead to unexpected gains. For example, thinking from a dragon's perspective finally made him understand the source composition of some very useful low-level magic. But this is easier said than done. Without absorbing the soul of the young dragon and truly having the experience of a silver dragon, how can you know the essence of the dragon magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, looking at the world from the perspective of a goblin will not have the same gain, so I don’t know for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual world is very wonderful. Goblin is a pure, stupid, bold and crazy creature in the spiritual world. Rogge instinctively feels much more dangerous than a silver dragon's spiritual world. He is not willing to take this risk. As Furya said, it’s hard to be sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man finally let go of Fu Luoya’s hand and said to her: “You have to go to rest first, and I have to discuss some things with the elders of Xius. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Froya left, Roger sat in front of Hughes, sinking and said: "Elders of Shusi, you must have heard the declaration of him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, well-informed is the basic requirement of the killer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man nodded. , said: "I am very surprised, why is he so madly issuing a challenge statement, does he really have invincible power? Does his power surpass God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hughes said: "In my opinion, his power may be stronger than some lower gods. But it will not be too strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's good!" The fat man nodded: "Let's discuss it, see how you can lie to a place where you can't escape, and then everyone will embrace it and let him stay in this plane! He had already suffered a big loss last time. Will it be as stupid this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the fat face of the fat man, Hughes couldn’t help but laugh, he Shake his head and say: "Roger adults. These guys in the heavens are not all stupid, especially those who are not physically restricted. I think he must know that his strength is limited. But this time is still the case. Zhang Yang, there must be considerable certainty that we are not afraid of adopting the European tactics. Rogge, we are likely to have another way to find out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you think, we use What is the best way?" Rogge stared at Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hius raised his head and greeted Rogge’s gaze, calmly and said: “Nobody, Rogge, is omniscient and omnipotent. I can do this infinitely. How can I know everything? In this case, I really can't give you an answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗The grid nodded and said: "I understand." Then he strode out of the room of Xius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the endless mountains, there is a beautiful and peaceful village. The mountains blocked the cold winds of the west, and the hot springs were moistened with the valley's land, so the snow was scattered outside the mountains. But it is still a delightful green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village is living in harmony and tranquility, almost in a state of complete self-sufficiency. It is occasional fierce Warcraft coming from the mountains. It is just to add a game to the villagers. Almost everyone in the village has practiced martial arts, and it is not weak. The source of all martial arts comes from the old Vito. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle age, Vito traveled to the world, and finally one day, he met a lifetime bride. It’s just that the days of happiness didn’t take long. Even the honeymoon was not over, and the executors of the church trials came to the door. Vito knew that his wife was originally an avid anti-church. Next, there is no retreat, battle, hunt, ambush. Blood and fire, killing and death have become the whole of his life. As time goes by. He has forgotten to put the number of bishops under the sword. But his wife did not have the same arrogance. Finally in a battle, because Vito protection is not good. And fell under a wide range of killing magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few years, Vito’s memory was completely blank. When he woke up, he was already in this small village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years, or forty years? He has long remembered it. He only knows that the dust on his giant swords is thicker every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon the sun is red and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vito’s eyes just picked up and found that there was already a strange presence in front of him, and the purple-red robe of the person’s body did not Living in a fluttering, like a flying flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vito is really unable to describe the beauty of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this person has just appeared, and several children who are still practicing sword skills in the square are silently fell to the ground, and then turned into a group of rich red. Ascended to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vito stood up. He has already known that the horrible sacred atmosphere that he has revealed in the past, the light church still finds him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to take the sword, and the people in this village are innocent." Vito calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need. You can't take the sword and the result is the same. And I am very busy." Achilles softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Vito, suddenly there was a large thick red. He tried hard to find out that this piece of red is actually composed of several pieces of flying red silk. He tried his best to find that at the last moment, every piece of red silk was made up of countless thin red lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That piece of red quietly passed through Vito's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the quiet village has been turned into ashes in the enchanting red flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the independent port city of Reia, located on the southeast coast of the mainland, is welcoming the sky as usual. It was only a fiery red sunset in the sky that suddenly fell and landed on the city government. When the red glow is gone. The entire city government, together with the legendary city master of Saya, has disappeared out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samai has been the master of the city for more than 20 years, and Wu Yong’s strategy is extraordinary. He has repelled the attack of the three Crusaders and maintained the city of Reya. Independent status. Since then, the powers of the countries along the southeast coast have risen, and the forces of the Guangming Church have been forced to stay away from the coastline, and Sama has no use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Achilles's action is fast." Augustus said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Great Hall of Light, the eyes of the Pope’s hollow eyes stared into the distance. After a long time, he slowly said: "Yes. But O'Brien has a lot of people, adults may have trouble. So, you send two people to the north, the right to assist the adults!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! But..." Augustus hesitated and asked: "This matter is of great importance, you have to ask for another point. What are we? Which two people should I choose?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all elderly people who are older, the Pope’s reaction is surprisingly slow. After a long time, he said: "You can do it. Achilles's action is very fast. Just pick two people who can catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand." Augustus stepped back, and the burly body was hidden in the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has come, but the faint red light from Achilles reflects the peak of the snow. He quietly looked at the old man who was still struggling. Her hair has been grayed out, and her teeth have fallen by half. At this moment, the whole person is floating in the air, unable to help and desperately struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
