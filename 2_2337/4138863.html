			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the three chapters under the brave <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Army did not continue to march into the dark forest, and It is a direct return to the capital. The city of Yunxiao has become a noun in history at this moment, and Alexander has prevailed in the battle with the imperial prime minister. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the price of victory is the life of 40,000 fighters, this adventure is still successful, and the two imperial names will not have to continue to venture in the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the 40,000 warriors who died in the war included 5,000 Poseidon warriors. Now in terms of power comparison, although the two names will have an absolute upper hand, but there is also the ‘trend’ legion in the Straw camp, which is not completely recalcitrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge had purchased a house in the Imperial City, and after rushing to clean up, he moved in. Because of the special wrath of the natural goddess, it is the fat man who hides in the emperor and hides in the house. Even the emperor does not see it, only that he is seriously ill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, in front of the Great, everything naturally has Pompey and Alexander to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon on this day, Pompey and Alexander came to visit the reclusive Rogge and had lunch together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of lunch is very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large dining table with a ten-meter-long dining table. Two emperors were sitting at the end of the table, and Rogge was sitting at the other end of the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servants of the food delivery never approached Rogge within five meters, and the simple dishes in front of Rogge were delivered by Androni. . Then she sat quietly behind Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger wore a thick velvet black robe with bare feet. The dress looks very strange. However, Pompey and Alexander have been eccentric. They took food and introduced Rogge to the progress of the imperial political situation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the return of the army to the imperial capital, the emperor was really furious, but after the wrath of the sky, he gave Alexander and Pompeii some insignificant punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This result has long been expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about the loss of Straw?" Rogge asked, inserting a piece of beef. Sent into the mouth. As soon as the beef was imported, he suddenly bite it all out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a sharp scream. A piece of Rogge spit out the bitten beef. This well-baked beef has now become a dark blue strange thing, still trembled in a moment, and made a fine bark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what it used to be, it has been chewed by Rogge and it’s no longer a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei turned a blind eye to the strange scene in front of him and said: "The gift we gave him was surprisingly good. I heard that this time not only came out a few abyss Queen of Naga, there is also a dark spider! Straw's Hutu warriors suffered heavy casualties, and his Druids were almost completely killed. This is a big gain."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? So they can re-seal the door of the abyss, it's amazing!" Rogge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must have a few cards that we don't know in the hands of Straw!" Alexander said indifferently: "However, no matter how many opportunities he has, since We have already got the upper hand, and if it can make him pull back the game, I and Pompey also took the soldiers for decades."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Suddenly, the hand sneaked into the thick table, and dug out a piece of mutated wooden block that could not be struggling, and pinched it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned slightly: "Sorry, these little things are too active today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He didn't finish a word, and his head leaned back slightly. Let a faint black light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a slender black cloth that turned out to be a piece of cloth on the shoulders of his robes. In the twinkling of an eye, Rogge's left index finger nails have been stretched out, and the tip of the tip is a little cold. His left hand trembled a few times in the air, and the strip had been cut into several segments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Androni's weight-lifting technique, both Pompey and Alexander showed their appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "I am sorry. These little things are getting worse and worse. Let's talk about it! Our next goal. Should it be? Turning to Frederick? I heard that he is the most determined believer of the natural goddess! Of course, we are only targeting himself. Now the empire has lost a lot of troops, and the soldiers of the 'tidal' legion are best not to be affected. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei nodded: "Yes! Straw is a politician and may compromise with us in the face of extreme disadvantages, but Frederick Differently, he is a believer. Now we have overthrew the city of Yunxiao, and it is impossible for him to stand on our side. However, after he believes in Druid, his heart has become too soft, and the tradition of imperialism In recent years, he has a powerful 'tidal' army in his hand, but he has no place on the southeast front. Therefore, he has too many handles to grasp. I think the next goal is set for him. Good body, Frederick fell, Straw I can't fight against us either."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander sighed and said: "The old is more and more confused! The southeast front has been hit for three years. Actually, I still hold Druid’s set of things! I thought that in the past, he used to rely on 20,000 people to lay down the territory of the three provinces for the empire!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three are negotiating how they can be defeated by Frederick. Suddenly, the servant reports: "The general manager of the Sarahello Palace seeks to see Lord Rogge!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Salvatore general manager is always the boss of the emperor. In his hands, the power is so great that even Pompey and Alexander are afraid of three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the slow-moving old man came in, all three stood up and greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Emperor heard that Rogge was very sick and very worried, so let me see how the situation of Rogge’s adult is." The sound is as slow as his movements, and he is lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took two steps forward and smiled. "Look. I am already sick like this. How dare you meet the Emperor? When I arrived at the Great Emperor, my little Principality could not bear such a serious blame!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s originally expensive black robe at the moment is ruined, Just like a sash. There were a few big holes in the long dining table, and the chair he was sitting on became a wooden strip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss managed to nod and slowly moved the thin, dry body, passing by Rogge. Directly to the table. He held out a dry finger and slammed it. Gently tapping on the table, a piece of wood suddenly popped up on the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood block popped up when it was no different, but after flying in the air, it suddenly changed color, and then turned into a group of strange creatures like gelatinous, crazy creeping . It physically stretched out more than ten hands with sharp tips, but these tentacles danced in the air very stunned, apparently did not find where the target is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss is in the same hands. The strange creature has fallen into his palm. Those tentacles were desperately waving in the air, but none of them dared to stab the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss took the mutated creature to his eyes and looked at it with turbid eyes for a long time before putting it back at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the hand of the boss, the strange creature has changed back to a common piece of wood, and it fell on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss closed his eyes as if he was asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a quiet place in the restaurant, everyone is waiting for the breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know how long it has been. The boss finally opened his eyes, and the dizzy old eyes looked at Rogge, and slowly said: "Roger, it looks like you are the wrath of the natural goddess. This is the top magic in nature magic. One, fortunately, its power has been dispersed, and it is not completely concentrated on you, so you can support it until now. But it is the goddess of nature that has been deeply rooted in your body, I can’t think of it. Any method of expelling divine power. The only person who is likely to expel the goddess of nature is the Pope of the Church of Light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss always swallows: "The goddess of nature is very weak at this moment, but it will slowly absorb the natural forces and gradually grow and grow. It should be more and more difficult to guard against the attack that it summons. Crack it There are two ways. One is to find someone to expel the power in your body. The other is that your own strength growth rate can suppress the speed of divine growth. But the growth of strength has limits, and the growth of divine power is completely endless. Ge Daren. How long you can live, but also your own efforts. Of course, you can hide in the Devil, Heaven or Bata Abyss where there is no natural power, so your condition will at least not deteriorate." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and sighed desolately: "Because you need to apply for the goddess of the gods, you need at least three Drews when casting the wrath of the goddess of nature. It is possible to succeed at the expense of all the elders' life and magic. So... Rogge, you can rest and rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the boss Going to the ground, Rogge smiled unconsciously, and returned to the table, smiling: "Two adults, this is a very good news, I can still support a long time. Let's continue to talk about how to put "I am going to get off the stage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey and Alexander are also slightly admired, they just sat down and listened to the report: "Imperial Prime Minister Mr. Trau asked to see three adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three looked at each other, and some could not guess what the intention of visiting Straw at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Straw has sneaked into the restaurant. He couldn't help but see Rogge's rotten robes and the messy furniture in the room. But he immediately recovered his smile, just as he did not see anything unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dictatorship of the imperial power for decades has been a temporary choice, a heartbreaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three adults gathered here, presumably in the discussion of how to send General Frederick to the gallows?" Straw smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and others were shocked, but no one said anything, quietly waiting for Straw's following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve’s gaze passed over the three faces and then said: “If you feel a little tricky about this, maybe I can help too. "Get busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of Pompey and Alexander flashed a little bit of surprise. Although they knew that Straw’s tactics were very powerful, they still Feel inadequately prepared. In either case. There are still many opportunities for Straw to bring the situation back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei smiled and said: "Why do Straws have this proposal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Straw Road: "Pompey and Alexander are unparalleled in their style. The battle of the city of the Clouds is unpredictable. But although the city of Yunxiao is ruined, the glaciers and the Poseidon Corps are more than 40,000 soldiers. Especially the Poseidon Corps, I heard that this time more than 3,000 sets of the Battleship armor were permanently damaged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey and Alexander both nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strao again said: "The Battle of the Abyss, the Hutu 50,000 soldiers, there are 37,000 people who died in battle. There are more than 6,000 people with severe injuries. In addition to the loss of the Poseidon Corps in the Abyss, the Empire... has lost 100,000 soldiers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Strawton had a meal. Only a few vibratos said: "Several adults, don't you think that the infighting between us has gone too far? This is the most elite warrior of the Empire 100, so I am here, Three adults will drop. Tomorrow, I will resign as the prime minister of the empire, and the Hutu warriors will also listen to a few places. I believe that there will be a few talents. I will not treat my Hutu people!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Straw left the seat and finished the whole dress crown, and even crouched on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander and Pompey immediately stepped forward, and Sterow worked hard on one left and one right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stroud Master...." Alexander hoarse the scorpion, the empire's generation of military gods, for a moment they did not know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
