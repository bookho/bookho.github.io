			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road from Selesburg to the Principality of Ron is already very run-down. Benjamin is familiar with the terrain here, so every truck has only two tons of cargo. Even so, this kind of road is a severe test for the trucks of the caravan. Fortunately, this time, the crowds of the caravans gathered in the crowd, and they encountered a place that could not be passed. Four people carried a car and it passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two days of hard travel, this huge caravan finally passed through the desolate and rugged mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the last hill in the territory of the Bavarian Principality, everyone’s eyes suddenly brightened. A huge, beautiful, green basin waits quietly in front of them. At this time, there are few plant buds in the cold mountainous area of ​​the Selesburg. All the way, everyone sees some clear scenery. Wherever you want to get separated by a mountain range, the colors such as dark green, emerald green, verdant green, and geese have already made this basin so full of vitality. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle slope extends down the hill to the basin, and the silky satin grass on the gentle slope is dotted with unknown wildflowers. Several wild deers were frightened by the crowd and leaped lightly into the distance. A gentle river passes through the entire basin. There are many neat farmland on both sides of the river, and the green seedlings are soothing with the wind. Far from the basin, it is a vast forest that blends in with the mountains of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the basin, a medium-sized city is built on the river. The sturdy and heavy walls are towering, and the numerous towers indicate that this is a military fortress. However, countless farmhouses were built around the fortress, and many of them formed villages, and they were peaceful everywhere. Obviously this land has been out of flames for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team began to slowly head to the basin, and several people still stationed at the top of the hill to admire the picturesque river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin said with a beard and said with fascination: "This 'Luoshen Basin' has been the fish and rice warehouse of the entire Principality since the founding of Ron. I have never experienced turmoil. This is a mountain range. It is said that in the ancient times, when the gods and gods war, a god fell from the sky and broke into the basin in the mountains. Its blood became a sash. The skin turned into fertile soil, and its heart is still beating, bringing the warmth and moistness of the basin to the spring season."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched his finger to the front Pointing at a small village in the distance, said leisurely: "The village is the hometown of the old man. It is also the oldest place chosen by the old man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other places, such as Rogge, are also very happy, not to mention other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frojace immediately took a step forward and asked: "The legend is a legend after all. But after a mountain, the climate difference is so big, there should be other Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin smiled and said: "The Princess is really smart, this basin is surrounded by mountains on three sides, only the southwest is a plain sea." The warm air can be unimpeded, and the cold winds in the north and east are blocked by the mountains. So it has always been wet and rainy. In addition, the remaining veins of the Ron volcano have been extended here, so there are a few in this 'Falling Basin' Hundreds of hot springs. With the drizzle of the wind and the moistness of the earth, there is such a basin with a season like spring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya nodded volcano? The teacher said that it was one of the top five volcanoes on the Big 6. Wherever the underground volcanic mountains go, there are naturally many rare mineral deposits. This is why the Principality of Ron is rich in all kinds of rare minerals and is called the 'country of mines'. It is no wonder that the dwarf will look at the land. But it is also strange that Ron has everything, that is, there is no iron ore. What city is that? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the city named after this basin, called the City of Fallen. The city was stationed by the ‘night motorcycle’ mercenary group. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before coming to the Principality of Ron, the noble youths made up for the customs of the Principality of Ron. Knowing that the 'Night Mo' mercenary group is The four major mercenary groups have reached a scale of 15,000, almost all the troops of a small country, both active and reserve.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ron Principality is extremely tolerant of mercenaries. Almost half of the famous big mercenary regiments on the Big 6 are based in the Principality of Ron, so they are also known as the 'mercenary'. The Ron Principality is only 3,000 square feet. Kilometers, with a population of more than 5 million, the total number of domestic standing soldiers and mercenaries has reached 150,000. With the smelting and weapons manufacturing industry, the Ron’s regular army 'non-day' Knights are extremely well equipped and the number is as high as 20,000, the overall combat power has been among the top six Knights.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although the Ron Principality, which is rich in various rare minerals, should be a piece of fat in the eyes of big countries. However, over the past two hundred years, because of the prosperous force and the booming mercenary industry, the Principality of Ron has repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the invading enemy. One of the most famous battles is the 'war of the defending nation' 30 years ago. It was the ‘non-day’ Knights and the four major mercenary groups. The total of 60,000 people participated in the 10,000-kilometer and 30,000 infantry of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Finally, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, which was in full swing, was forced to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this campaign, the ‘non-day’ Knights officially entered the ranks of the top ten knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principality of Ron put some cities in the territory and even some of the more important military fortresses to the mercenary group, and part of the tax as a commission The funds of the Corps. In return, the mercenary group must pledge allegiance to the Principality of Ron and defend against foreign enemies when the Principality is invaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the top-level mercenary group will also serve as the official residence of the Principality of Ron. The leaders of the large mercenary group will often accept the canon of the Principality and formally become a hereditary aristocrat. . As a check and balance of the mercenary power, the Ron’s royal family mastered most of the weapons manufacturing industry in the public, and the strong fighting power of the ‘non-day’ Knights was enough to ensure the safety of the Ron royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred years later, the Ron’s royal family and the mercenary group formed a strange and unique situation of mutual dependence, mutual penetration and common prosperity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night Mo? How many cities they manage in the Principality of Ron, as if their headquarters is not in this city." Fu Luoya asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, Night Mo is the largest mercenary group in the Principality of Ron, managing a total of three cities for the Grand Duke. This city is home to six thousand The mercenary Mo's proud of the reloading of the dragon gun infantry. According to the villain, there are two brigades in the city with a total of two thousand dragons and infantry, two thousand infantrymen and one thousand knights. There are a thousand infantrymen." Benjamin is simply knowing everything and saying nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon Gun Infantry? What kind of arms is that?" Kate interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This dragon gun infantry may be the most annoying thing for Kate. The 'Millet' mercenary group's dragons and infantry are equipped with heavy armor. Three layers of fine iron tower shield. Each two dragon gun soldiers in the battle will lift a seven-meter dragon gun. The whole dragon gun array can be divided into three layers. The dragon gun has a rear seat, which can be supported on the ground during wartime. The ability to resist shocks. Oh, when it comes to this, Kate adults must understand that this dragon gun infantry is used to deal with the reloading knight. According to the villain, these dragon gun infantry were transferred here in the last three months. Benjamin answered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thinks secretly, this city of the gods is built here, its meaning is self-evident, ten is to resist the possible invasion of the Rhine Union. As for the stationing of the dragon gun infantry, it is naturally to deal with the three Knights of the Rhine League with the Lions Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria continued to ask: "In this way, the Principality of Ron is ready to fight against the Rhine League?"<br /><br /> Benjamin reverently replied: "This is not the case. According to the villain, the people of Ron Principality are still very peace-loving. The situation in front of us is the voice of the Rhine Union to fight against the Principality of Ron. High, so the Principality of Ron strengthened the readiness. This is only based on defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rens intervenes: "How do I feel the military power of the Principality of Ron? Stronger than the Alliance? Such a big place, actually piled up 70,000 regular army and 80,000 mercenaries! 'Non-day' Knights are still one of the top ten Knights! The Rhine League seems to have only a hundred thousand troops in total, this is still Put those light infantry into it." He scratched his head and continued: "When in the city of Lille, how do you say that the alliance is able to easily destroy the Principality of Ron?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria sighed softly: "This should start from twenty years ago. At that time, Ron’s grandfather was so powerful that he led the 50,000 army to the Allied Alliance. The result was that he met the Bavarian Grand Duke, who was still a baron at the time. At that time, the combination of Baron Rheinhardt and Lhasa Warlock was called the gold combination. With the genius's command and the absolute superiority in the contrast of the magician's strength, the Baron played 50,000 Lions mercenaries against the 50,000 Ron mercenaries, but it was four wars and four Czechs. In just two months, it was in full swing. The non-Tian Knights lost more than 10,000, and the Lionheart Knights lost only a thousand people. The Ron Principal had to retreat. Later, Ron’s grandmother was unwilling, and he had several infringements of the Rhine League, both in Rheinhardt. The Grand Duke was defeated and the Grand Duke finally became depressed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sighed: "These reports were returned to the dynasty, and it became The Alliance took the initiative to send troops and beat the Principality of Ron to fight back. Slowly, the lies became the truth. For decades, the father and the ministers thought that the Principality of Ron could go down the battle. But no one thought carefully. Want to Rhine King duke years strongly opposed to war and why Luo Engong country but now, the Grand Duchy of Bavaria ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Rogge waited to see the beautiful back of Fu Luoya's melancholy, and suddenly there was infinite tenderness in her heart. She just wanted to hold her in her arms and take care of her. He immediately woke up and secretly surprised the charm of Fu Luoya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team ran all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Lost City has already seen this huge fleet, and the soldiers on the city have a commotion. After a short time, the city gate of the Fallen City opened wide, and a small team of black armor knights came to the team. A young knight, for a long distance, shouted: "Which Chamber of Commerce is the team? I am the 'night motorcycle' mercenary team captain Gail! Fengcheng master's order to check the team!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An old man from the Clark Chamber of Commerce greeted him and said: "This is the Clark Chamber of Commerce team! We just returned from the Rhine League! Is the Card City Lord? I For the elders of Benjamin, I would like to extend my best wishes to the Lord of Cards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gail was taken aback. When he was close to the team, he jumped off the horse and said to the old man: "Is it really the Clark Chamber of Commerce team? Is Benjamin also here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin Zema Out, and slyly: "Young knight, I am Benjamin. The 'Night Mo' mercenary group and the Clark Chamber of Commerce have had a friendship for 50 years. From when, the 'Night Mo' mercenaries have not recognized their friends. What's the banner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gail's face swelled red, he dared not look directly at Benjamin, cramped: "Benjamin, not my intentional offense. I just Joining the 'Night Mo' mercenary for less than half a year, so...so...a lot of things are not known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin nodded less than twenty years old Right? It’s been a knight captain for half a year, and it’s amazing! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Benjamin’s compliments, the young knight’s face was even redder. But he still stepped forward and said, “I apologize for the offense. However, Benjamin, even if it is the Clark Chamber of Commerce, I have to check out the box. This is where the duties are, please understand! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man of the Clark Chamber of Commerce was somewhat unhappy and coldly said: "In the past ten years, the 'Night Mo' mercenary and the Clark Chamber of Commerce have cooperated no less than 100 times." . This is the first time that the old man has heard that he has to check the goods of our Chamber of Commerce. Humph! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gail looks even more tense, sweaty on the young, tender face, and some stuttering, but the tone is extremely determined: "I am sorry! However, in the lower body of the knight, the lord of the Lord was asked to check the pedestrians of the past caravans. Responsibility, have to be like this! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin glanced at the 50 'night-money' knights in front of them. These knights are very young and capable, and they can see the skills from the immediate riding position. It’s not bad. The young knights are resolute and show their pride in the identity of the knight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin suddenly laughed and said to the old man around him: Let them check it out! Don't be a young man! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was surprised: "Elder Benjamin! This..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the Clark Chamber of Commerce, the young knights of 'Night Mo' began to inspect the trucks one by one. See the steel ingots of the whole vehicle, Gail is getting more and more surprised. Although he is young, he knows what this high-quality steel ingot means in the current crazy preparations. As for fine iron ore, he can't recognize it. The Clark Chamber of Commerce is interested in him. Naturally, I don’t even say it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young 'night-money' knights are uncomfortable. This caravan guard is far from ridiculous, but it’s no wonder, now The batch of steel ingots is a very tight material, and the quantity is large enough for the biggest knights to be jealous. What makes them uneasy is that some of the fascinating people in the guards have always been consciously or unintentionally not to leave their hearts and minds. There are dozens of people who are quiet. An unpredictable look, but everyone has a strong momentum. The rest of the guards get together and, at first glance, they know that they are veterans who have fought in battle. This kind of person is the most on the battlefield. Terrible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;The young knights are like the chicks that shuttle through the wolves, performing their duties in a treacherous manner. However, the knight’s honor does not allow them to retreat. For a moment, these knights are already sweating in the chilly spring. Heavy clothes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes them more red-hearted is the beautiful beauty who is interested in watching them! Her every move is so elegant, As for raising one hand and raising your head, these young boys are full of blood. The young knights struggle to straighten their chests, overcome their fears, and perform their duties with the most elegant and graceful manners they consider.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the princess's car be checked at will? Froya’s two maids stopped in front of the carriage and did not mean to give way to the two night knights. Although they are dressed as men, the too pretty face allows the night knights to recognize their true gender. Looking at their men, Gail shouted: "Two ladies, please don't hinder us from performing official duties! Otherwise, I will offend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ten carriages are not within the responsibilities of the 'Knights'!" A maid said. She deliberately emphasized the four characters of the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gail blushed, because he was despised by the beauty, he was still annoyed and said: "My duty is to check all the past caravans and pedestrians! Everything! I think Miss you can fully understand the meaning of this word! Come here, please let the two ladies make a way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" Frowning Benjamin shouted. "Mr. Knight, these ten carriages belong to the most respected VIPs of the Clark Chamber of Commerce. They are not within your responsibility! If you insist on checking, I can only think that the 'Night Mo' mercenary group no longer cherishes Clarke Chamber of Commerce's friendship!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, Benjamin, this is my duty..." Gael argued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maintaining the reputation and friends of the 'Night Mo' mercenary group is your more important duty, Mr. Knight! For your rude behavior today, I will The head of 'Night Mo' has a good discussion. The team! Ready to leave, we will go to the next town camp!" Benjamin no longer cares about Gail, leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team changed course under Benjamin’s command and slowly headed west. Gail followed Benjamin's back and anxiously explained what he was, but he eventually went down to the city with his knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco suddenly said: "The night motor mercenary group will actually train the men with the orthodox knight training method. It is really amazing!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lens shakes his head and says: "These little guys are good, but unfortunately they are too rigid. Hold on to those dogmas!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are learning more etiquette, and they can't learn the essence of it. A country mercenary will never become a true aristocratic knight." Franco commented a little viciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so! These little guys are on the battlefield, and the passionate knighthood will make them extremely disciplined and fearless. In other words, These people are the best soldiers.” Kate, who is familiar with the military, does not agree with Franco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s maid came over and cried, “Lord Rogge, Miss, please come over!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;; nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, although reluctant, but in broad daylight, it is estimated that Froya will not poison himself, so he followed the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria and Rogge ride together, others are far away from the fun, lest they listen to a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, David values ​​you very much. I don't understand yet. After seeing your territory, I know why."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, the more softly, the more whispering, the more cold Roger is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the villain is just a laity who eats lascivious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fool Ya did not pay attention to Rogge’s desperate self-deprecation and asked himself: “You said, if the Bavarian Principality is fighting with the Principality of Ron, how many odds are there?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The villain has always earned a little money. These military affairs are actually ignorant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stared at Rogge, suddenly Giggle smiled. She reached out and grabbed Rogge's hand and gently stroked the back of his hand. Froya's little hand is smooth and cold, as a milk slowly flows over the skin, making Rogge extremely useful. However, this taste is reluctant, and Rogge must also give up. There are countless pairs of eyes around watching his every move! Although no one dares to look here, the inadvertent afterglow is enough to capture all the shots they want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you dare to pull your hand back, I will shout!" Froya whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
