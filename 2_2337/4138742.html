			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is again a wave of fluctuations, the huge body of the bone dragon appeared. I haven't seen it for a few days, and its body is much bigger. It has been nearly ten meters long from beginning to end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue spar in the center of his forehead has also grown a lot, just like having his own life, there is a blue flame inside. Flashing. Numerous blue crystal wires are like blood vessels, and they are deeply plunged into the skull of the bone dragon. Its huge skeleton is also mixed with a blue crystal grain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone dragon appeared, and cried: "Master's master! Are you pretending to be dead? It's too sinister. It still has urgency, suddenly The atmosphere was wrong, and I immediately closed my mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Toughly climbed the back of the bone dragon, tapping its head gently, the bone dragon stood Get up and start a huge double wing, you have to jump back to the outside world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! What the hell are you...what...what? "Freak eagerly, suddenly there is no word to call ***. Her existence has completely out of Frey's understanding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I What is not important. In the words, Frey seems to have heard a little bit of desolate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon jumped up and disappeared into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak looked at the yard that suddenly became empty, looking at the wind butterfly that was still bleeding, remembering that the only brother had left, with the father Since then, I have become a stranger, and I can't help but sigh again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is really lonely..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is passing quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge lies quietly in the blue crystal, as if he is sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak doesn’t know how long it will take to return. He claims that Rogge is working hard to study a powerful new magic to suppress the temptation. Adventurers. If the adventurers know that Roger, who is a fierce god, has something to do, they still don't know how many things will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani finally woke up after three days of sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't!" The sound of a sharp calendar suddenly tore the calm before dawn! Then there was a loud bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak in the dreamland was suddenly thrown off the bed by a huge force, stumbled, he suddenly changed from the room of Ajani . He immediately woke up and grabbed a piece of clothing and rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani’s room has turned into a rubble. The smoke was so confusing that I couldn’t see what was inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freland is immediately tight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, Ajani conquered everyone, but fortunately there was a mysterious *** that saved her back. Frey never wants this venerable girl to make a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed, a flash of green light, Drew’s secret law ‘war machine’ has moved. He did not hesitate and immediately rushed into the smoke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as he entered the smoke, he flashed a large piece of golden light in front of him, followed by a whirlwind! Then there was another huge pain on the back. Frey's huge body flew out of the smoke and fell heavily on the ground! His bronzed face turned white and instantly soaked in cold air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You! An exclamation came, and the surprised Ajani covered her big mouth with her hand and forgot to help Fry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frey was hard to get up, still involuntarily sipping cold air, a large piece of bruising on his face, and one eye was swollen. He smiled bitterly: "How can you become so powerful when you wake up?" There are also a lot of changes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akani woke up, she stayed in the memory of the day. I felt someone was rushing, she thought it was a death class, and immediately instinctively counterattacked. However, it was such a freak that she could use the secret law of the 'war machine' at once, and she felt incredible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the feeling of ethereal and translucent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rogue? Where is he?" Ajani asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri Long sighs and is now asleep! However, there was a mysterious day... saved you, I think, she can also save Rogge. "Well, Frey took her to the room of Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking quietly in the blue crystal Rogge, Ajani surprisingly She didn't cry, she just touched the crystal, and the tears fell silently. She sensed the elves' unique keenness, and now Rogge is a corpse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one click, Ajani fell to the sky, and there was a trace of blood flowing down her mouth...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, an urgent order came from the city of the gods. The wind butterfly, Ajani and all the guardian warriors were transferred back to the city of the gods. Frey did not care about the actions of the elves. He only wanted to stay with his brother. He had another layer of worry, that is, fear. The city of Yunxiao will send a killer again. Ajia Ni is worried about the safety of the city of God, and he is helpless to the status quo of Rogge, so he first returned to the city of the gods. She pinned the last hope on the mysterious *** Body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, Frey closed the door of the government and refused to see the guests. The servants were not allowed to enter and leave at will, but they also banned the password. In the fierce battle that day, more than half of the servants had some disabilities, and the golden coins of Frey had been sown, and everyone’s mouth was immediately sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the sky is overcast and the sky is snowing. There seems to be no end in this cold winter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The same is the same cold. Unlike the world, the outer world is always winter, and the sky is always covered with fine clouds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ligao squatted on the ground, squirming a piece of boulder with his tail, and then volleying it. Occasionally it is a little higher, it will spurt a light blue breath, turning the flying stones into blue crystals. Gregory's nature has already collected a lot of beautiful blue crystals. Unfortunately, the quality of this crystal is a little worse, only a thin layer on the outside, it is still a stone. And it can't be a few days, crystal It will slowly turn into stucco and gradually peel off.<br /><br />&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gregory is already very satisfied. The new breath is much more powerful, and it is especially effective for the undead in groups. In the past, it was a melee way. A land kills the opponent. There are so many strong men in the world, the master got the body from the woman's body, and soon after, he put a spar on his forehead and did not know where to get it. In the breath, there is a haze of scent with a starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its current body is too big, so big that it can no longer enter the tomb. The limited wisdom of the bone dragon is used to study how to shoot the arrogance of the ***, and now can not be with the host, it really does not adapt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has recently produced a lot of things that it can't understand. What makes it most unclear is that the owner who is omnipotent is actually hurt! And the injury is so heavy. This makes the bone dragon full of fear in the world over there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the encounter with the owner, its days have been very comfortable, and the strength has been easily improved. There is a master, it just needs to pat the flatter at any time. Gregory can't imagine how the days after losing the master should be. Fortunately, there are enough supplements in this world for the owner to add strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the owner of the master, when the bone dragon saw him, there was only one empty shell left, and his soul did not know where to go. It stands to reason that the soul should not disappear so quickly?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory does not want to think again, it has already started to have a headache. However, Bone Dragon is very proud of his wisdom. Generally speaking, the wisdom of undead creatures has always been directly proportional to strength. For example, the flame bones and the newly joined lords have some wisdom and can communicate with Gregory. But compared with clever bone dragons, their wisdom stays at the level of one child at most. But if you talk about strength, Gregory knows that the two of them are still stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master returned to the deepest part of the tomb as soon as he returned. Bone Dragon knows that the owner is trying to find a way to restore strength as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is thinking about it, suddenly heard the call of ***, it immediately jumped up and ran back to the door of the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** floating in the air, she has completely restored the majesty and momentum of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demon lotus" re-flowed with a soft luster, and the black streamers were full of vitality dancing. Different from the human world, the slender nails behind the demon lotus are covered by the white wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under ***, the Flame Bone and the Lord of the Lord have stood there, Gregory quickly ran over and joined them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The left hand is lightly lifted, and three powerful undead creatures fly out three small round bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Demon Lotus" armor suddenly blooms, and the wings of the *** are stretched out. She pulled a feather from the wing and threw three round pieces of bone. Then her white feathers flew out of the lightning and nailed the bones over the gate of the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the bones flew out, Gregory felt as if something was suddenly missing, that is the feeling that the soul was taken away a little. Bone Dragon also can't figure out why he knows this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Looked at three powerful undead creatures that have been following her for a long time. The loyalty of undead creatures is unquestionable, perhaps because of their low intelligence. Once the masters are identified, there is no complaint or hesitation in how they will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that this time out, maybe no one can come back. If any of them can resurrect, and through the connection of the soul, they will return to this tomb. At that time, the new undead will learn to devour from her feathers. Of course, the premise of all this is that the new weak and undead can successfully return here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The wings are retracted to ‘妖莲’. She opened her mouth and made a whistling sound like a sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle sounded for a while, and spread far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground suddenly turned into a rough sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray soil tumbling violently, and one zombie and a skeleton came out from the bottom of the hiding place, and they huddled in fear, waiting for it. * The next command. It didn't take long for the dense zombies and cockroaches to lay the entire hillside. The bare mountain was like a forest that suddenly grew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the guards and zombie warriors hidden deeper also climbed out of the ground, and they smothered the lowest waiting around them. The creature has won a space for itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghosts flew in groups and hovered over the mountains, and they were able to fly at the feet of the ***. The number of ghosts is so great that the mountains are beginning to dim. A few small pieces of black clouds flew over, and it turned out to be hundreds of higher shadow spirits. They arrogantly flew back and forth over the lower undead creatures before they floated at the feet of the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When more than a dozen zombie lords appeared, the undead creatures immediately produced a commotion, and they pushed me to squeeze out space for these strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor of the armor came, and the black warriors of a team were coming from afar. They were proud knights during their lifetime and maintained strict discipline after death. Each team of black warriors is led by an exceptionally tall warrior. The tall black warrior walking in front of the team, the armor of the chest also carries the coat of arms of the knight, and the huge double-headed chain in his hand sways, and every time he takes a step, he will release a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior leader walked to a place very close to the ***, but stopped at the periphery of the lord of the lord with some fear. The pale flame in the eyes of the lord makes it feel inexplicable fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind suddenly blows up, and the weak cockroaches are immediately blown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three dark brown dragons slammed their short three pairs of shredded wings and flew over. The blue crystals in the center of Gregory's forehead suddenly illuminate, and all the crystal lines in the body are shining. It suddenly screamed at the three-headed dragon, and the dragons immediately made a mess. They flew a few laps in a panic and landed in front of Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Still waiting, there is no day and night in the outside world, no time goes by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground trembles slightly. The flames of the bones, the lords and the Gregorian eyes all showed the look of alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead creatures on the hillside suddenly became chaotic, they desperately squeezed open on both sides, and a large passage suddenly appeared on the hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A melodious whistling sounds on the other side of the hill, and the whistling sound of this whistle, the lowest screams have begun to disintegrate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corners of the two twists first rise from the side of the hill, followed by a huge head, then a little ridiculous pair of bones wing. There are only a few skeletons on the bone wing, and the steps are one by one. Finally, a huge body that did not lose to Gregory appeared! More than ten incomparably large bone spurs fully explain its tyranny! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a skull dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It obviously doesn’t have Gregory’s flying ability and breath with magical attributes, but the body is much thicker and stronger, and the huge claws are everywhere. A deep footprint was left on the ground! Like a demonstration, the giant tail covered with horror bones occasionally slams the ground heavily, leaving behind a large pit with a few meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new bone dragon has just turned over the hills, and the eyes that shine with green fire are eyeing Gregory. Its wings slammed open, and the spurs on the back were all raised high! The mouth is full of challenges and low-pitched! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was immediately shocked, but in front of the owner, it refused to show weakness anyway. A layer of faint blue light shrouded the bone dragon, and the ice-blue smoke spurted out of its huge nostrils. But in terms of momentum, it is far too far from the newcomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The silver glow in the eyes, she looked at the new bone dragon coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newcomer suddenly felt that his body was several times heavier, and the four giant claws were deeply stuck in the plaster, and they continued to slowly sink! Bone Dragon struggled and struggled, and each movement seemed to be extremely difficult. After a while, its huge body fell into the ground, leaving only one head on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon finally lowered his proud head. The alien world is a world in which the strong is king. It has been completely under the pressure of the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the glare of the eyes of the ***, the bone dragon finally struggled to climb out of the ground, and honestly fell at the foot of the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Standing in the air, once again glanced at his huge, spectacular undead army, then looked up and looked into the distance...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory! You stayed behind to see the tomb." *** suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was shocked. It thought he was out of favor with the owner, but he was smart and immediately felt wrong. Reminiscent of the owner's move to remove the skull bones, it suddenly understood, the owner did not want it to die! This time, the master summoned all her legions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading such a strong army, but still holding the determination to die, the bone dragon can not think of how powerful this opponent will be! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s heart was excited, and he shook his head and shouted: “Master! Don’t think about throwing me this time! Or bring me. Or you will destroy me now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Somewhat surprised to see the bone dragon, this is the first time that the bone dragon dared to defy his own orders. Do not drag the water, just nodded simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone dragon suddenly regrets, undead can also be destroyed, the clever bone dragon already knows fear. Gregory was in conflict with his heart, but he did not dare to reveal it. After a long time, finally, the idea of ​​helping the owner to pass the front of the moment prevailed. The strength of the bone dragon is not too bad in this world. If there is it, the odds of *** will increase somewhat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gorgeous, exquisite helmet appeared in the void, slowly covering up the fascinating appearance of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved the huge Death Scythe in her hand and pointed to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge undead army turned to the place where the Death Scythe pointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge army formed by tens of thousands of undead creatures merged into a slow-moving torrent that headed for the unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth began to tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the everlasting sky in the opposite world, the huge undead army is constantly moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of this torrent, all the undead creatures feel the instinctual fear, they either choose to hide deep into the ground, or leave the nest, Zhang Huang escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A distant mountain is slowly becoming clear on the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Remember this mountain, when she was still a little sly, when she walked alone in the outer world, she had been with Rogge more than once. Hunting weak undead creatures under this mountain. At that time, she and Rogge did not know how powerful the existence of this mountain was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now *** knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was before, she would never step into the place where she could see the mountain. She knows that the owner of the mountain has existed for a long time, with incomparable wisdom, unfathomable strength and an extremely large army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she still came, took all her legions and came to the mountain. Although she instinctively refused to meet the ancient creatures on the summit, although her legion was less than a quarter of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From afar, a dense forest surrounds the towering peaks. But a few high-level undead creatures know that it is a forest of zombies and donkeys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory can't help but be chilly, it doesn't even dare to think about how to form such a forest, what a huge undead army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, several other undead creatures don’t know what the fear is, the flames and bones are even excited to start to emit a faint flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two regiments began to approach, and the foremost scorpions and zombies began to scream and scream at each other. In contrast, the corps, which seemed to be very large, was very weak at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five tall figures in the forest. The bronze armor on them is surprisingly heavy, the iron-blue face is expressionless, and the bloody eyes are extremely beautiful. . They either use a giant sword or use a heavy hammer to slowly walk out of the zombies and the forest. Behind them, followed by a number of huge bone dragons, and then, is a variety of high-level undead creatures, looking at the past, dense, can not see the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The heart sinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy the Cavaliers is a tyrannical creature standing tall at the top of the outer food chain, and even most of the bone dragons are not their opponents. ***I know that this is likely to encounter such a terrible enemy, but she did not expect that she would meet five at once! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy the Cavaliers’ scent of breath immediately caused the uneasiness of the entire legion, and even the newly added land dragons were somewhat cringe. As they approached, the entire army of *** began to retreat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Achieve a grasp, immediately added a bone spear in the hand, and then the fire of the pale demon lotus ignited on the bone spear. She screamed and raised her hand to spear the bone spear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world seems to suddenly light up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most destructive knights in front is difficult Looking confidently at the big hole that suddenly appeared on his chest, the light in his eyes faded. With a bang, its huge body fell heavily on the ground, hitting a bone dragon that could not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stunning electric light flashed four times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four devastating knights fell one by one, and the ***'s demon lotus armor also lost its luster. She slowly fell from the sky, and the toes slid gently on Gregory's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Despite the destruction of the five destroying Cavaliers, the number of undead creatures in her army is still far less than the opponent. The flames of the bones and the lords were surrounded by dozens of zombie lords in the center, and the situation was not good. The newly added bone dragon is very powerful, but it is also very difficult to deal with the three skull dragons alone. The huge bone spurs are bitten off by the opponent in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Gregory is in a good position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon is clever and almost sturdy, it will never fight like a companion with a powerful opponent, but with a smart jump and short-range flight dodging The opponent's attack, after seeing the right, will give the other party a breath. Regardless of what the other party is, in the sinister breath of the bone dragon, the body will be covered with a thin layer of blue crystal, and an activity will be broken, and the thick bone will immediately be thinned. Even a bone dragon that is not weak, after a continuous breath of Gregory’s more than a dozen breaths, can not withstand the endless erosion of the haze, disintegration into a pile of white bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the biggest reason for its success is that *** is standing on top of it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how the bone dragon jumps, the *** is like a willow with no weight, and the toes are always light on the top of Gregory. Occasionally, undead creatures threaten the safety of the bone dragon. She will wave the death sickle. After a black light flashes, the unlucky undead will always be divided into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of ***, her legion was like a sharp knife, deeply inserted into the opponent's queue. Destroying the place where the Cavaliers were guarded was originally the strongest place on the defense line, but when they came up, they were destroyed by the spear of the demon, which turned into the weakest place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the corps of the *** continue to deepen, as if a blade of the boat is close to the peak, the other army is empty and there are a large number of undead creatures can only Looking at both sides. The number of zombies and cockroaches is too much. These low-level undead creatures are extremely slow and the undead creatures are entangled in a group, but they block the road of undead creatures behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dark sky, more than 100,000 undead creatures are fighting in a desperate battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a grand battle, I don’t know how many times I have been born in the endless years of the outside world? Perhaps, only the sky that is always faintly gray can be known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** No matter what the casualties of the Legion, her head was always looking up, staring at the tall, as if to penetrate the peaks of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The corps sensed the owner’s mind and became even more crazy! The zombies rushed to the opponent, and the zombies in the back row pressed against the front partners, one layer at a time, and they resisted the enemy's tide-like offensive. The flexible cockroach jumps on the top of the zombie's head, then leaps high and throws into the enemy group! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the tip of the sharp knife stabbed the foot of the mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Gently patted the head of the bone dragon with a slashing knife, leaving a thought: "Let's live, wait for me to come back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Suddenly a loud whistling sound! The demon lotus armor radiated a strong milky white light, and for a moment, it even brightened the entire mountain! The undead creatures that are illuminated by the light screamed, and there was smoke and smoke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon lotus armor was completely open, and the powerful undead creatures looked at the pair of white wings with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Just like a meteor, it has been cast to the mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she completely burned herself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows, she has regretted her heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden black rain in the air! It turned out to be the wreck of the undead creatures that were blocked in front of the *** and smashed by her death and thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From afar, *** is like a burning flame of war, quickly rising on the mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle suddenly stopped at this moment, and all the undead creatures were shocked by the pressure of the moment. They looked up and silently watched the light rising rapidly and disappearing into the peak.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain peaks are surprisingly flat, standing alone in a quaint, magnificent, desolate temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Without hesitation, in an instant, she appeared at the door of the temple. Behind her, several dead dragons that wanted to stop were taken down. Head. They still don't know that they have been sentenced to an end, and the huge mouth is still in vain, trying to bite the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud bang in the top of the mountain, and then two ten-meter-high bronze gates fell from the summit. For a long time, they fell from the summit to the ground, and smashed a pit of more than ten meters on the ground. Hundreds of undead creatures became their victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** finally stepped into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge space in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one hall with a length and width of 100 meters in the huge shrine. The huge vault of 20 meters high is covered with traces of years of erosion. . At the end of the temple, there is a small altar with four lifeless four black dragons carved on the altar. In the middle of the altar, there was a small group of purple fires that could not stop jumping and burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a plaque in front of the altar, it looks very thin, holding an unreal white bone magic wand, only the golden crown of the head-style style is obviously not Everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer turned around, the flames in his eyes flashed, and a cold, cold, arrogant, evil spirit wave filled the entire temple instantly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the way you visit me is not friendly, I still want to welcome you, the eighth king of the world of death!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless gorgeous fireworks suddenly illuminate around the ***, and the pale black ripples and the faint faint shroud of the milky white light collide. The collision of two huge forces caused the ancient and magnificent temple to tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings behind the *** are slightly fanned, and she is still steady and determined to walk toward the lich in front of the altar. There is only incomparable ice in the spirit of ***: "How do I call you the king of the world of death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call I am Elgar, or Lich Elgra. The kings of the world of death have noticed your existence, we have already recognized the identity of your new king. It will not take long for you to establish spirituality with other kings. Contact. Young new king, how should we call you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Step by step approaching the Lich Elgra, the latter waved, a black flame ignited ten meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young king, our world is a world that has been abandoned, but it is still vast, the territory is not a problem, the world of death has enough space to accommodate More kings. But now, your army is fighting in my territory! The world of death has its own rules. The first rule is that there is no fighting between kings. I can ask you Do you want to? Dear ***, what do you want? Territory? Followers or my temple? Despite your requirements! No matter what you want, even if you come up! As long as you can pay At the corresponding price, nothing is impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The gaze crossed the Lich Elgar, the altar behind it, falling on That group of burning purple fire above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four dark five-headed dragon statues in the four corners of the altar are vivid, the body is flowing, and each of the five skulls spurts a faint cloud. Twenty clouds of air are collected in the central purple fire, forming a cloud of clouds, and the purple fire is firmly locked in the center of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Regained his gaze, she rumors to Elgara with her thoughts: "You have harvested a soul in my world, I am coming to retrieve him now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected ***, what you want is this soul! Did you sense its extraordinary and powerful? Oh, you made it It is a pity that you don’t have enough money to exchange this soul. So, respect the ***, please go back to your own territory! The source of the undead is endless, but the competent ones are still very It's hard to find. Let's end this unnecessary consumption! You have been respected by the kings. There is no need to measure each other's strength through the war between the kings of the dead world."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual fluctuations of the Lich Elgara become impatient: "The young king! Please follow the first rule of the world of death! For us who stand at the top of the world, other laws can follow us. The mind is determined. But only the first rule, the principle of no war between kings, must not be violated! It is the cornerstone of our existence for thousands of years! If you are willing to go it alone, even if you have become the eighth king, I can't afford it! Now, my temple no longer welcomes you, please come back, ***!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon lotus armor blooms,* The wings of the ** have been stretched to the limit, and she slowly flew off the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding space has begun to be distorted, and countless gravels have floated up, and under the influence of gravity, they began to move irregularly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole temple was trembled slightly, and the stucco and gravel could not fall from the high vault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual fluctuations of Lich Elgara are full of anger and surprise: "Do you really want to provoke a battle between the kings? Do you not know death? The true meaning of the law?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The answer is simple and straightforward: "What kind of rules can't restrain me, give me that soul!" Her power Beginning to increase, the whole temple began to vibrate violently! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space around Elgara is also covered with dark ripples, and it can't face the power of lifting power, it also has to move its own field, Avoid being killed by the fighting type *** suddenly close to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the angry scolding of Elgar, the power of the two kings could not be lifted, just like the sea of ​​screaming, the waves were higher than the waves A wave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth began to vibrate and the mountains were shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world of the death world has sensed the changes here, and a powerful spiritual wave has swiftly crossed a distance of more than a thousand miles, passing each other amazement and Do not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to increase your strength again! Stop now! "Ergra shouted desperately. However, *** did not care, she lifted the spear of the demon lotus, and the bone spear released a dazzling light!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world suddenly darkened, and the wind blew up without warning!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is simply jumping, huge stones flying in the air The undead army that is fighting under the mountain has stopped fighting, and even the powerful bone dragon can't stand the power and breath of the king of the world, and it becomes scary and frantic!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The spear of the demon lotus has completely turned into a shadow, a shadow that seems to be connected to another endless void world. The boulder, the gravel and even the white bones have all been thrown into the shadows and swallowed up without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is shaking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death is like welcoming its own dawn, suddenly changing It’s lit up, and the clouds in the sky are slightly red. This red is covered with a big half of the day. Just above the mountain peak, the clouds are already red and bright, just like the same red day, you will wear the clouds!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Immediately aware of the changes outside the temple, she glanced at Algra, the lich had desperately gathered his own force field, completely arbitrarily slaughtered. Intuition made *** also stopped the improvement of power, demon The shadow formed by the spear waved and finally disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The last demon of the devil was finally used up, but her death sickle has been put on On the neck bone of the abandoned Elgra, the latter is busy preparing a complicated spell, *** know that this is not for her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After a strange wave of volatility, the temple of the Lich Elgara suddenly disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a burning car was wearing a cloud Out!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of the gold armored warrior on the chariot searched the whole world, but there was no gain. He unwillingly suppressed the chariot and crossed the plate. The lower, carefully observe the entire space <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;The chariot kept circling, and the golden warrior on the car waved the spear formed by the fire, throwing a blood-red lightning into the ground, and thundering in the thunder, the ground continued to appear as deep as ten meters. Giant pits, dozens of undead creatures screaming and being thrown into the air, as long as they are stained with a little red electric fire, the whole body will immediately ignite a fire, and in a blink of an eye they will be burned to ashes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergra glanced at the ***, she was still very calm. The lich chanted a spell again. The soil at the bottom of the peak suddenly split, and a dark gray giant bone dragon rose into the sky, fluttering to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning chariot immediately turned his head and caught up with the bone dragon in a blink of an eye. Then, countless burning bones fell from the sky, just like a fall. Field meteor fire and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thunderous laughter of the triumph, the chariot drilled back into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, you are indifferent to the first rule of the world of death, attracting the heavenly patrolman! Your behavior is equal to all seven kings Challenge! But in the long 2000 years, the world of death only newly created you and the two new kings of the Black Warrior Emperor. Any king is the most valuable wealth of the world, so as long as you leave all the Legion And leave my territory, I can still forgive you. You go! You are young, and have an enviable ability to devour, you will be stronger after a while." Elgar calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hand over the soul." *** The cold thoughts don't have a bit of emotion and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergra finally got angry and said: "You ignore the first rule and challenge the dignity of all the kings. I have forgiven you for being tolerant. You are still there. I am the king of my wealth! If you destroy my body, you can't completely destroy me! And without me, you can't untie the dark dragon and release the soul!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unlock the magic array!" *** cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have the dignity of the king, I refuse!" Elgara said proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, let's destroy it together! Although I don't have this ability, the Heavenly Patrol Hunter can do it!" Start crazy and increase your strength! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are choosing to be an enemy of all kings!" Elgra screamed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about that?" The power of *** quickly rose to the tipping point, and it was necessary to step into the field where only the king had entered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take it to you! However, you will face the anger of the seven monarchs soon! "Aergra almost screamed and said these words!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, a tidal ice suddenly filled the entire temple. The irresistible anger and grievances contained in the icy ice even made the Lich Ella shudder!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gloomy sneer suddenly in the Lich and ** * The soul of the sound is deep, and Elgara can't stand the chill of the laughter and immediately sneak into the shield.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** But it is stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious purple does not know when it is full of the whole temple, turning it into a purple world!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the altar, a dark purple deep purple dyed with 20 smokes. These smokes seem to suddenly have their own life, lingering with dark five heads The dragon's statue, the twenty small faucets are cut off one by one!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergra is shocked and chin has to fall!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang The sound of the lich, the altar of the sorcerer's life, was smashed, and the purple fire immediately turned into a huge purple mist!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple fog swept the altar's debris It became a mushy thing. Then, in the heartfelt gaze of Elgera, the purple mist and the wreckage of the altar were condensed into a ball, and finally turned into a purple fat figure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Elgar, you and your four little pets, these days I am so miserable! "The fat man smiled at Elgara.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
