			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the tidal heavy cavalry entered the city, the resistance of the city of Solatu began to collapse like ice and snow, and the gate quickly fell, half thick The fine iron gate of Rice collapsed from the inside to the outside, announcing the fall of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An earth-shattering call outside the city, the cheers of the Chaowu soldiers completely drowned the Sortu’s desperate cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tides of cavalry and infantry from the city wall gap and the inactive defense gates are pouring into the streets, and the banner of Solatu falls from the city. Replaced by the blue flag of the Chaoshan Legion, from time to time accompanied by weapons, screams, heavy objects falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden flag is finally in the blue ocean, and the badges with countless logos no longer show off or exaggerated. All show the glory of the Astrafik empire Prince Aley from the blood and fire. Sorato is still in the thick clouds that bring endless nights, and there is no trace of light that can reach this desperate city through obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four fires reflect the fascinating light on the golden flag, as if the undead are blinking, and the dark red on both sides of the huge pupil is near purple. rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood double flag! The massacre!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where the first cry of a woman and woman More dense and higher fire smoke, sometimes a loud noise, mixed with vocal screaming and crying, bloody and burnt smell is getting stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the long, low horn sounded in the sad resounding over the city of Soratu, like a giant hammer, hitting people’s atrium, three short and one long The sound of the number represents the bloody double flag has been lowered, the moment of killing, finally passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a very fine money is projected from the air, and then more and more, more and more dense, the thick clouds finally split, and the flow is scattered in all directions. It disappeared as soon as it came. The sun is pouring over the walls of the walls that are full of dead bodies, broken flags, and broken weapons. The hooligans are everywhere on the bluestone streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solato, the light and warmth of this night has never been needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the bloody crazy warriors can't hold the butcher's knife for a while, but the dazzling sunshine dazzles their eyes, while adapting to the light. How much rationality has to be restored, not to mention that there are not many people in the entire Solato for killing, so the horrible ones have quickly subsided. The Chaoshan infantry began searching for survivors from home and drove them one by one to the central square to determine their ultimate fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue walked in the official residence of the city of Sortu f, with no expression. Robsky followed his footsteps. Try to add a bit of a bargain to the fate of your own. And Rose is behind the two. There is occasional blood dripping on the blade of her hand. Robsky's feelings are very keen, and the chill behind him reminds him all the time. One answer is not good. This ice-cream woman will not hesitate to divide him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, Rogge knocked on Robinsky’s dark red leather-covered luxury desk, and sighed: “It’s actually using the Alaska Ice Sheet. I have never used such a good thing. Only the crystal cup seems to be some years old. Who said it, anything, as long as it is old enough, it has value." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the famous quote of Maxwell, who said that the original intention of this sentence was to satirize the paintings or poems of the time, and the value immediately rose sharply. The situation." Rose answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said sadly: "It turns out. But it doesn't matter, this sentence is also suitable for use here. This bottle of wine looks good, but I don't. Big understanding of wine. Rose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May is still stained with bloodstained hands, pick up the bottle, bite the cork, just sniff in the bottle mouth When you are alcoholic, you will say: "The origin should be from the Sunshine Bay. The wine is about sixty years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles at Boski. No, Viscount Fernandez, it seems that your days are really good!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robersky was shocked. Immediately laughed and said: "Adults, this is not the case at all!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge nodded and walked to the window and looked out. Seen from this window, he has a complete view of the main square of the city of Soratu. At this moment, the square has been packed with survivors, most of them women and children. The young men with rare numbers are mostly wearing uniforms and guards of the former city government. After Robertsky surrendered, Rogge promised to leave a life for everyone in the city government. They then surrendered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Viscount Fernandez..." Rogge called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, you still call me Robersky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Luo Boschi, who among the people in the square, is there anything related to you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, the villain is almost alone, only a few guards and a general brought from the family, but they are already dead In your hands, no, no, it’s fortunate to die under your unparalleled bravery. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the outer door boots are screaming, and the Chinese cuisine has taken a big step into the big man! The whole city has already searched, and the aftermath and clean-up have begun. Now all the people who are still alive have been concentrated in the square. How do you deal with them?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog has indulged a few moments and I have promised to stay. They have a life, as a sage, this reputation should still be there. In this way, figure out the value of each of them, and then sell them to the Imperial slave traders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Wallace stunned, and he thought that Rogge would follow the custom of the Emperor and burn these people to the square. Now selling as a slave, for the survivors of Suratu, the ending is finally a little better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighs secretly, but is not moved by Rogge’s insignificant goodwill. Frederick is generous and kind, even when dealing with enemy civilians or prisoners, it will not hurt. In his decades of military career, he has never raised a double flag of blood. However, Rogge’s acting style is obviously different. His cruelty was revealed when he rectified the disobedient Chaoshan Legion, and then he finally showed up when he first appeared in the army. In the first battle, he sacrificed the bloody double flag and killed only 60,000 soldiers and soldiers in the city of Soratu. Thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace also thought of a battle report that he saw not long ago. At the other end of the battle, the top three regiments of the Chaoshan army increased their strength after joining the remaining Poseidon Corps. Pompey also changed the mild style of the Frederick era. After the end of the army, they immediately attacked and won the game. One of Pompey's strategies is to never exchange prisoners of war. All prisoners of war and the men and men who have been captured are arrested and sold to slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his roots are compared to Rogge, who has raised his bloody double flag. Still have to be a little worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walley was about to leave, and Rogge stopped him again: "Wait! These prisoners don't have to report to the emperor, this thing you I have to find a reliable guy to secretly do. As for the money to sell slaves, I will use it to make a war for the soldiers in this war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hua Lai The priest once again. Even in the country where the military discipline is strict, the senior generals will sell the spoils privately. However, like Rogge, all the private slave sales were turned into soldiers’ pensions, and they did not leave them. It was indeed the strongest of his military sisters, and he also saw the first time. Before leaving. Wallace finally gave Rogge the first military ceremony. He still does not care for Rogge, at least for those who died in battle, he felt that he should respect a military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wallace left, Robsky couldn’t wait to be authentic: "Master Rogge, you are so cherished by your soldiers, you are a little arrogant, and heroic Invincible, in the chaos of the army can be no harm, it is simply the emperor! I am also a good swordsman when I say it. But just on the battlefield. You only look at me from afar. I will not be able to move immediately -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" Rogge smiled and said: "No more nonsense, how do you mix To the position of the city owner, what other people are you in the Delaware Empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robersky said: "Adult, the Principality of that year After the birth, the villain was timid, so he immediately fled back to the north. Later, the villain came to the Delaware Empire and liked it very much. After he left, he became a child who wandered around an ancient family. You know, complicated And the noble genealogy, the ancient different kings' bloodlines, and a piece of land that does not exist at all, the proof of these things is everywhere. Home for sale. In the Delaware Empire, as long as you spend fifteen gold coins, you can get a set of documents that even the heraldic pedigree experts can't discern. So, I didn't know how long I knew Winnie. And married her, with the power of his family into the upper class of the empire. Forgot to say, Winnie's father is the first assistant of the Empire's financial giant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robsky lamented that the Lahua belt empire, whether it was the promotion of the title or the acquisition of the land, the military audio and video is the fastest way. The villain spent several months carefully studying the record of the battle in the city of Sortu in the past ten years. He believed that the main direction of the tidal legion was not taken here, and according to the current power comparison, the villain definitely has the confidence to live in the city. So come to apply for the city owner here. You also know that ~ no one in this position is willing to fight with me, so I was immediately promoted to a very good title and was appointed here. After the villain wanted to set up a few military exercises here, he immediately tried to change his way back to the emperor, but... knowing that the commander ridiculed the army is you, the villain said nothing will come to Solato... ah no, small People will desperately seek the position of the city of Solatu, and then give the city their hands to the adults, and never resist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robsky, I This time the army marched south, but in the first battle, the bloody double flag was sacrificed! You have to think carefully, if you follow me, how should your family arrange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky firmly said: "Every time I have to start a career, I will fall into the hands of adults. Of course, if the thief is bigger, it will be a career. This can only be said to be the arrangement of the god of destiny! Master Rogge, this time, regardless of the price, I will swear to follow you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just looked at him faintly. Under the gaze of everything, Robsky slowly lowered his head and whispered: "Adult, Winnie had just given birth to a daughter for me last year. I will see if she has always been loyal to you. The home cluster is a chance to trust you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded this time to pay a bloody double flag in the city of Sorato. It was just a warning to the Delawares, so that they would stop trying again." For resistance, as for your family, as long as they are willing to take care of me when I am under the city, I will preserve their lives, property and titles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Berski is grateful. How much is this since the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press to clean up the locks on the battlefield, naturally there are generals who deal with them. Rogge himself personally commands a group of soldiers to completely carry out the city of Soratu. Cleaned it up and then withdrew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within 100 meters of the city's main government, no one is allowed to enter, because there will be women<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The residence of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather in the North is very cold at the moment. The passage was initially cleared on the street for the officers’ horses and heavily loaded vehicles. The bodies were piled up on both sides of the avenue waiting for the engineers to carry them. A large piece of blood stains had frozen into ice and stuck firmly on the road, while the surrounding <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is covered with pieces of frozen meat that have been frozen as hard as iron. It looks like a picture of the so-called Fauvist art in a southern country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog strolled on the widest street in Solato, indifferently watching a team of Chaoshan Legionnaires searching through the house. Take out all the wealth and enrich the national treasury. The Chaoshan Legion is extremely disciplined, and ordinary warriors never dare to hide in the process of looting. As for the senior officers, they will not be too hot. As for the troops of the Ayre Principality, such as the Tiketon warriors, the dark side of the moon will not do this kind of lock-up work, and other troops, even Rogge himself feels that they do not have the Chaoshan Legion<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors are trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night, the new kingdom of the Principality led by the Bauhinia Butterfly also arrived. In order to resettle these tens of thousands of new troops, the city is noisy again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned a blind eye to everything around him. Hearing his voice, his eyes only fell on the most magnificent building of Solato, the city of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, under the night, all the buildings in the city’s capital have a layer of milky white light, which indicates that the goddess and his entourage have settled in. City House, the building along with the surrounding area. It is now both a holy place and a forbidden place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body of Yinlong is in front of the gate of the city government and has begun to sleep. It’s just that Longwei, who is in his body, hasn’t been weakened by sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no buildings in the two blocks around the high walls of the city. The only exception is the bell tower standing on the south side of the Grand Place. Now if anyone looks up at the towering spire of the clock tower, it will be reflected in a round of blue moon. The delicate carvings suddenly more than doubled. If the eyesight is good enough, you will see this inflated carving inlaid with two silver. gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thoughtful eyes were taken from the city of Solto, who was exhausted and exhausted, and looked back to the city's main government. All the black warrior emperors who saw the war in the daytime during the war in the city were repeatedly played back in their minds. Rogge is almost certain that he is the king of the world of death, the black warrior. As for the other two mysterious characters wrapped in black robes, Lich Elgara is Rogge's old acquaintance. As soon as he casts his magic, Rogge immediately recognizes the familiar atmosphere. Only the last black robe, Rogge, did not know who it was, but the degree of death in his body was not inferior to the other two kings. Ten is also one of the seven kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, why are the three kings of the world of death appearing in this world? They are completely incompatible with the space laws that fat people know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, other kings? Bone Long Gregory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, most importantly, ***?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of ecstasy The chill came quietly from the bottom of Rogge's heart. In an instant, this chill almost completely frozen him! In the vertigo of that moment, the silver eyes, the headless angels, the demon lotus and the black seemed to coincide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently puts the chest armor that has been turned into two, and slowly removes the rest of the heavy armor. Finally, Rogge took all the magic items up and down the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge touched the whole body again, at this time he had only one jewel, and all the metal and magic items had been removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again looked to the sacred glory of the city, and his eyes gradually became silver. In the sea of ​​Rogge's intent, it seems that the three kings are standing in the city's government, watching him sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge clearly remembers when he left the world of death for the last time. The war between the kings is still going on. Now the three kings suddenly appear in this world, but there is no news in the bone dragon! What does it mean?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want to think again I don't dare to think again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath. Tears open the chest. A delicate and complicated magical array slowly emerged from his chest. It was the magical array of elves that he exchanged for the price of erosion, which could store the magical magical array! Although it is not perfect, it can only store some divine energy, but now for Rogge, these are enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blue moonlight, the figure jumped from the high spire. Dive to the city's main house by the thick night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned into a vain image, quietly walked past the sleeping silver dragon, and stepped into the high gate of the city government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping silver dragon moved a little, his nose flew into the sky and sniffed a few times. He vaguely felt that there seemed to be something more around him, but the faint pure sacred atmosphere made him feel very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go with him. This may be an acquaintance! Feeling...somewhat like that woman. No matter, there are still powerful guys guarding it." Yinlong was thinking in confusion, and returned to the pile of treasures in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main gate of the city has a large courtyard between the main building and the main building. Rogge knows that this is not a good thing. At this moment, following the goddess, you can stand in this holy land and the forbidden land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not afraid of encountering the sanctuary, only praying not to encounter Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on the sacred atmosphere. The body changed to a faint silver radiance, and as the silver light gradually faded, all the scent of Rogge faded away and turned into nothingness. He then blessed himself with a high-level invisibility, and now even his faint figure disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a gust of wind in the courtyard. After the wind, Hughes did not know how to appear in the courtyard. He smiled and said: "The adults of Rogge are so late. I didn't expect your interest to be so good, I have the mood to wander around the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger stops Not moving, still maintains an invisible state. He looked up and Xiusi stood in front of him. He closed his eyes again and felt that Hughes was still in that position, with no partial deviation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
