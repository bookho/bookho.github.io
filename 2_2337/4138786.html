			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 15 Survival<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that night, the huge shadow of Nicholas is in the hearts of everyone I can’t go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small life is worrying, Rogge immediately lost interest in the civil war of the Holy Alliance. Early the next morning, he handed over the daily military mobilization to Charlie, and he narrowed down in his study. The battle with the Latvian army on that day, the strength of the several units that Rog has painstakingly established has been fully proved. Charlie presided over the overall situation, and the Latvians could not change any tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Nicholas has never appeared in these days since he appeared on that day. But Rogge knows that when Nicholas returns next time, it will be accompanied by a thunderous blow. Will there be any good luck at that time, no one can tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Hughes came to Rogge’s study and saw Rogge’s worried look, comforting him, as long as he was in the city’s capital Forgive me that Nicholas did not dare to show up. Therefore, although Rogge can rest assured that he will find a way, the silver dragon who is too clever will not come to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted after listening, completely unbelief, he stared at Hughes and looked at the left and left, really can't see the atmosphere of a half-pointed man. He has repeatedly scanned his mental power. The strength of Xiusi is very clear. The killer of the 16th level is not much, not a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the strength of Rogge’s great spirit, people who can conceal their own strength have not counted three or five people. These people are the top powerhouses in the world. It’s not like the top powerhouse, just looking at the wounded Chris Ferrena’s slap in the face. Rogge turned to think again, if this old thing is really capable, how can he sit and watch so many of the most elite elf warriors die? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Rogge frowned and said: "I know that your old man is superb. But if Nicholas loses patience and is desperate, what can he do?" The implication is that as long as the silver dragon starts, Xiusi has only escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also true, I am afraid that he will be desperately desperate." Hughes also sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "Since we have mastered the general whereabouts of Nicholas, can we sell this news to the Black Dragon King? Is it okay to let them fight for both? "Let's come back and sell cheap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes shook his head and made the big man, Nicholas was not in the Moonlight Dragon City. We sent it to the Black Dragon King last night. It is. You may not understand that the Black Dragon King, who will not be deformed, is unlikely to go deep into the human race and fight against Nicholas. If it is not the Black Dragon King, then the Black Dragon has not yet been able to fight with Nicholas. The strength of these two dragons is too strong, and the scope of the fighting is too wide. If a large number of civilian deaths are caused, according to the usual practice, the strong people of the human race will temporarily unite and kill them. Their individual strength is stronger, and there are too many people who can't stand the strong people! You see, three of us were there last night, and Nicholas didn't dare to do it. Of course, even if he knows the true strength of my old man, after he has started, he must at least be seriously injured. As long as there is another person in the Sanctuary on the way back, the silver miracle will never want to return to Moonlight Dragon City. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger snorted and asked: "Where is Nicholas now?" "This is what he really cares about.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes said: "You also know that the accuracy of tracking magic has always been poor. I can only say that Nicholas is still within five hundred kilometers of Bora City. Of course, now that your goal has been clarified, then with this degree, this distance will come. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silently, he is in a bad mood. The feeling of being stared at by a dragon is absolutely uncomfortable, especially the dragon can still A blow to him will kill.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly thought of a problem with the elders, Androni’s strength is already on the edge of the sanctuary, but she is Nicholas has no hands-on ability before, but you are not affected by Longwei. What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: "This old man didn't pay attention to it. Because she is a girl, her mind is delicate, so she is particularly susceptible to the magical spirit of Longwei. Don’t say that she is just a swordsman, she is a princess who pays great attention to spiritual cultivation, and she is not in the same spirit. Magic without knowing it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiusi said: "God has made the use of spiritual magic such as enchantment more and more fascinating. Even my old man is very admired. If it is not a little strange reaction of Princess Froya, I can’t detect you. In the dark, you have done your hands and feet. Unfortunately, you are too young, the cultivation time is too short, and the magic is still insufficient. However, depending on your ability to use mental power and magic control, it is only a matter of time before you become a big magician." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to be a big magic guide, you have to pass this level before you? What is the big devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With God's ability to make adults, death is not the end of everything. In fact, purely by force, the demigod lich is above the majority of the magician. If you can't stop Nicholas After you die, you can become a lich. This is actually a good choice. Do you want to think about it? Of course, after choosing the undead body, your life will be less fun, but the pursuit of powerful power. , enough to compensate you."< Rog categorically refused: "I'm sorry, but the power and money beauty is more attractive to me! I don't want to die for the time being!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the best way to improve your strength in a short period of time. Since there is no interest, then we only have to find a way to conceal Nicholas. There is no hope for a positive conflict. Of course, when he kills you. In a flash, it is bound to reveal flaws. As long as we grasp the opportunity, we can all have his life. Although it can't stop his revenge, I can always get revenge for you. Speaking of it, we can be worthy of you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge can't smile, but he has to ignore the absurd suggestion of Xiusi. He looked around first and then lowered his voice and asked: "Is the death class worthy of trust?" "Although I have to rely on the power of the death class at this moment, but Rogge has always had a lingering fear of killing himself once." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although he is not very good, he belongs to the kind of person who is old and disrespectful, but we are the killer, always the most credible. This time he has I received my money, so if you are reassured by the adults, as long as we pay the agreed rewards, the death class will not be turned back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue A cry, no. Judging from the performance of Hughes, the reputation of the killers is very doubtful. The old fox basically does not lie, but always misleads people into another direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria is okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness has a new goal of pursuing, It looks so good that it can't be better. Of course, if she can get rid of some of the habits of pleasure, it is perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: "Elder Sisters, do you think you should send the wind butterfly and Androni away? They can't help here, and they will be in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is not appropriate. Wind butterfly is also the goal of Nicholas, and it can be protected by staying here. Miss Androni has a rare double attribute vindictiveness, her strength is very close to the sanctuary, just The understanding and use of power is not enough. Once she breaks through this bottleneck, it is not far from stepping into the sanctuary. Even now, if you give her a protective magic weapon that can defend against Longwei, she will become Our help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded. In addition to being placed in the paradise of the paradise, Fu Luoya's magical equipment all over the body was searched by him. There are several features that have a shielded mental attack. In addition to the blue sky and the breastplate, Androni rarely uses magical items. There are a lot of places on her that can be equipped with these things. But he turned to think that the battle of people in the Sanctuary, even if Androni did not have much room to intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is impossible to provoke the fight between Black Dragon King and Nicholas, Rogge still has a lot of poisons, and now he talks with Hughes: " Since Yinlong is injured by a large number of civilians and will be surrounded by strong people, then do you think that we are pretending to be Nicholas killing him thousands of people? With my magic, there is no problem with making a dragon, plus point illusion, It seems that it is almost the same as the silver dragon. We choose another night, and there are even fewer flaws."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said this, thinking about it, Wrinkled again. Everything else is easy to handle, and the only Dragon Flame of Yinlong cannot be simulated. But this is not insurmountable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes shook his head and said: "God makes great people, and it is a good plan. But these strong people can not lie, I have no confidence to win them. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is close to the strong, and only knows the wrath of the sky in the northern Druid. When he thinks of it, his mind has nothing to do with the Druids. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God made the adults really visionary, and Silver Dragon has always had a good relationship with the Druids. If you don't remember to kill you, this time Nicholas may also go to the city of Yunxiao!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked and the situation was not good enough. Yes, you can't let them unite again. Mom, this dragon doesn't understand the world, it's almost its only shortcoming. If there are those Druids helping him, how can we live! Death class Is there any way to stop the city of Yunxiao from helping Nicholas? If he can't help, then I will rush to Frye... I will not associate with the killing enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hughes advised: "With my old man and the death class, as long as I pay enough, he will definitely come up with a way to prevent the city from breaking into the sky. Frey is a good man, keep it. He will be useful in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silent for a moment, suddenly said: "Since the old man is so good with the death class, the last time he killed me Why didn't you say hello to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses has a red face and coughs: We also only recently realized. At that time, my old man did not know his existence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that there will be no result in this issue. . He took a few hands in the room and suddenly said: "Elders of Xius, look at the situation last night, you already know the existence of ***?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hughes nodded and said: "Yes. God makes the adults hard on the mountain, it is beyond the expectations of my old man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles Elder, I want to know if there is any way to stop *** from coming to this world. If she comes, she can send her back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes looked at Rogge and asked in a meaningful way: "God makes adults, you mean, once the battle is defeated..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighs: In the length, at most a few decades, you should be able to kill Nicholas, I will avenge, why bother to die together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, this situation is not unimaginable. It will be much broader when you step back. Do you want to consider becoming a lich again?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no doors! Can't eat, drink, and play, what's the point of living?" Rogge categorically refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two discussed for a while and did not discuss what happened. Hughes was still going to find the Death Class to discuss the city of the Clouds and the Silver Dragon Alliance, and left in a hurry, leaving only Rogge in his study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat for a while, suddenly touched the magic whistle of the night dancer, and smiled bitterly: "It is useless to use him, right and try it!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blew his magic whistle. Although the whistle had no sound at all, Rogge felt an invisible wave that spread far and wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Rogge was reading the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly looked up, and there was a breeze blowing out of the window, and Nicole had stood in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She really came alone this time, without the killer who never had the chance to name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Rogge, are you looking for me so soon?" Nicole looked happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "Yes! This is a lot of trouble. Do you know the ultimate deformation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole nodded and said it. I heard that the ultimate deformation technique can be transformed into a variety of very powerful terrorist creatures, such as dragons. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know a lot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nickie spit out his tongue All the teachers taught us. I didn't pay much attention to it when I was studying. Anyway, our killer will not have the opportunity to use the ultimate metamorphosis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole was shocked. This is not a trivial matter. I have to go back and report it to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sooner the better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie nodded and was about to jump out Outside the window, she suddenly had a figure in front of her, scared her to scream and tried to stop her body shape, which did not collide with the opposite person. But the distance between the two people was so close, almost the tip of the nose touched the tip of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicco hasn’t recovered, and the person on the opposite side has a deep kiss on his lips. Nicole screamed. After taking two steps back, it was only to see that the sneak attack on the original is the handsome and almost demon swordsman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger said: Noisy! Jean Ni It’s important to go to the right thing!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled reluctantly and let the road open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie is full of faces, and his heart is in a mess, rushing to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Nicole’s back, Andronie Hing asked: "How do you call this little killer? Don't tell me." "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled bitterly: "I can't think of it, let's try it. Who knows if the night dancers really have a way!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said: "It’s hard for you, but now I still laughed that my master is just fine!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge went to Androni and looked at her carefully, seeing her uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat! Are you wanting to take advantage of it again? You should be careful with me, don't die under the silver dragon, but instead be given by my blue sky "Cut!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, you are not the target of Nicholas, or leave here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Androni was shocked. She reached out and touched Rogge's forehead and wondered if he was burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sober!" Rogge was a little crying and laughing: "You don't have enough skills now, and you can't help it too much!" Now Nicholas's goal is I will not care about you alone. I want to go quickly, I see you pack up now and go back to the city of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Androni asked puzzledly: "Dead fat, this is not like you are a man! Besides, why don't you escape, do you have to stay here and die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head and smiled: "I have been stared at by Nicholas. Now I can feel him looking at me all the time. It seems that he has locked my soul that night. Now I It’s useless to escape far away, and sooner or later he will be chased by him. So it’s better to think of ways to fight with him when you have two sacred masters around you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead fat, how can I be better than Hughes? How can you let me go, but let him stay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "The old fox is too embarrassed, even if we are all dead, he estimates that there is also a means of life-saving. So we don't have to worry about his life and death, since he is willing to stay, Let him be self-defeating. I have come up with a method, ready to gamble on a gamble, it will be able to temporarily solve Nicholas's heart, but if not, I guess this time will be a small life. Good luck. If you can escape, you can still be a lich. If you are not lucky, it will be completely destroyed. So you should go quickly! Why should you stay here to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s heart became a mess, but his face was calm, and he asked, “Why do you want me to go, do you need to tell me what to do?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked up at Androni, and then smiled for a long time, shook his head and said: "Well, there is one thing that demands you. You have a rare sight. Double attribute vindictive, martial arts is high on the sky. If I fail, if you have the heart, give it to me. Enmity! Silver Dragon's life is very long, this is not anxious, waiting for you to stand on the peak of martial arts one day, and then bring a bunch of people to kill Nicholas. He is too powerful, no matter how you cultivated in the future To what extent, it is always risky to fight alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
