			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Heavenly Chapter of the Heavenly Chapter in the Hells<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter XI <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the 'Wind Rift Valley' has restored the purity of water, and a huge moonlight blue moon floats quietly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons have already left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the day, the witnesses today have only a thousand corpses with different postures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the night, several figures sneaked on the edge of the rift. They watched cautiously until they confirmed that all the dragons had left, and they jumped into the rift and searched the bottom of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a fat figure movement is awkward, the other three are lightning fast, and in the twinkling of an eye will be the big 'wind anger rift' The search is complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the four gathered in the center of the Rift Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead fat, we have all found the bottom of the valley, and did not see the longan of the three dragons, may be taken away by which dragon The body of Yinlongwang is gone, it should be taken away by its people. Looking for it, there are only dozens of dragon scales useful at the bottom of the valley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; These four people are the returning Rogge and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body of the dragon will have a soft glow of gold coins in the eyes of Rogge, especially these rare high dragons, but it is worth the price. ! Although Rogge is close to bankruptcy, he clearly knows that the harvesting of the dragon's body and treating it as a precious raw material is a huge insult to the dragon. Although he remembers the body of the Silver Dragon King and the eyes of the three dragons, he will never pick it up in front of many dragons. In the event of anger, these dragons, especially the mysterious colorful dragon. Rogge estimated that four people had to be buried with the Silver Dragon King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dozens of huge scales that still carry a trace of the silver dragon king's flesh, Rogge felt that it was a bit of a harvest. Although the longan is precious, he still does not know if there is any way to use it. It may be a good idea to sell the royals to the royal family at a high price. Longan can provide these people with a rare opportunity to show off, they will certainly make a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes saw that Rogge had some unwillingness, and immediately said: "Rogge, from the traces of the valley. The red dragon that was injured by you." It is left alone in the southeast direction. The red dragon is not known for its resilience and suffers such a heavy injury. It is estimated that we can catch up with it within a few days. 'The pure red anger flame' should be very valuable."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Rogge just wanted to say, interrupted him with a violent cough, and even a little blood star spurted out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed: "Rogge, the cursed scroll is cheap, but the stronger the power, the more cursed. And the reel is more powerful. The scrolls are also greatly discounted, such as the steel shovel you use. It’s surprisingly short in time. So it’s a good thing to use in the future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has calmed the violent cough and gasped: "Don't be tight, these curses are nothing, I can't solve it, and I can still hold it. It will be good for these few days. That red dragon... first Let it go, the situation inside the Principality is still unstable, we have been out for a long time. It should go back. Don't let Druid give it a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just upon returning to Dresden, Rogge received an urgent report from the Eye of Wisdom, saying that the main hall was attacked by an unidentified assassin, and the Holy Baby was killed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was expressionless and immediately rushed to the main hall of the Eye of Wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a secret room in the main hall, Mora and Elder Carmen and Rogge secretly for a long time. Rogge finally got a general idea of ​​what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rogge and others left, a group of killers raided the main hall of the Eye of Wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of their attack was chosen at noon. At this time in the early autumn, the weather in Dresden is still very hot. At noon, many people will sneak a nap for a while, which is the time when defense is most relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These killer targets point to the holy baby. They know the layout of the main hall of wisdom. Directly broke into the back of the main hall and rushed to the prayer room to place the room for the baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Rogge has already arranged everything. On that day, Mora was only a good-looking baby girl. This baby girl was placed in the prayer room on weekdays. Before the altar, occasionally accept the worship of believers. A baby girl is also placed in another closely guarded chamber. Every day, Mora will go to the secret room for a little while. At the door of this room, there will be several martial arts guards at all times. Every few days, Karlmont adds magic to the Defence Magic Circle on the door of the room. The other dozens of selected baby girls were placed in several small buildings behind the main hall, which were taken care of by some believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target of this killer raid is the baby girl in the Chamber of Secrets. However, they did not let go of the baby girl in the prayer room. Under the attack of forgetting the dead, the killers opened the road to the altar and the secret chamber at the expense of their own lives. Their actions were extremely fast. When Mora and Calmon got the news and came with the brigade guards, the killers had killed dozens of guards and two magicians, and succeeded in stabbing two baby girls. To retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a fierce battle, more than 20 attacking killers died in the battle, seriously injured three people, only two people successfully escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Er. Carmen immediately informed the Grand Duke and summoned several torture experts to see if he could ask something from the lively population. However, in a few days, all the torture has been tried and there is no result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened and immediately set off to the dungeon where several killers were held. Fat people know that these killers must have been specially trained and very resistant. But their will is even firmer, and in the face of Rogge, the necromancer who is good at manipulating the soul, he also wants to keep the secret in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dungeon is not far from the Grand Duke. It used to be the place where the Principality used to hold the most dangerous and serious offenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warden received a message from Rogge to personally review several prisoners. Immediately rushed to the three killers for a simple treatment, and fed some spirits that can boost the spirit, lest Rogge adults to overweight, one accidentally killed the prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Rogge stepped into the dark and wet prison, the two women, one man and three captured by the wall, recovered the appearance of some people. Seeing that Rogge came in, their murky eyes only turned subconsciously a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked back and forth a few times in front of the three, and finally stopped in front of the male prisoner. Put your hand on his chest. The male prisoner’s face was immediately distorted, as if he had seen the most horrible things in his life. Called desperately. But even though he has done his best, there is no sound in his throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obese warden who stood behind Rogge, although he has been used to all kinds of cruel scenes, but the strange scenes in front of him still make his face white, forehead cloth Full of sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male prisoner struggled for a while, suddenly twitching, and did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger brows slightly wrinkled and shook his head. Going to the female killer again, the hand gently pressed her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Rogge’s surprise, the female killer struggled only a few times and her head fell softly. Rogge thought for a moment, reached out and opened her loose hair and looked at her face. He tore apart the clothes of the two female killers and looked at their bodies and then walked away without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rogue Master. Have you finished the trial?" The warden hurriedly followed Rogge and asked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their physical strength is too bad, there is no need to review it again." Rogge faintly said, "Whoever did them, I will see them before sunset." The heads are all important prisoners in the dungeons. Since they can't manage their own underground body, then I will help them. I know that only the dead are the most self-disciplined."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly stopped and stared at the warden, slowly said: "These two girls are pretty good, how many times have you done?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warden scared almost to the ground and cried: "Rogge, I just want to sit safely in this position and retire, with the goddess O'Reilly. In the name of He, I can't move these two prisoners with one finger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the big dungeon. Rogge pondered all the way and returned to the eyes of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killers apparently come from a tight, large organization. The most critical part of their memory has been cursed very brilliantly. Although Rogge is also the master of the curse of the dark and the dead, and as careful as possible, it still inevitably triggers the curse. The second female prisoner was too weak, and even Rogge’s search magic could not afford it. The curse had already died before it had been attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These killers don’t know much about it, but Rogge only knows from the part of the assassination plan that he’s snooping, and he knows the other’s eye for wisdom about the baby. The arrangement is almost always well known, and even the defensive magic arrays laid on the door are cracked. It can be seen that there is already an enemy traitor in the eyes of wisdom, and the status is not low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger Adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock analyzes the composition of the curse in his heart. Inadvertently responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roger Adult!" The man screamed again and pulled Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked back and saw that the carriage had entered the main hall of wisdom. Santa Mola did not know when she was sitting next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of the fat man could never be as low as this, but by instinct, he knew that Mora had no hostility towards him. This may be because of the goddess O'Reilly, perhaps because of the eve of the night, perhaps for other reasons. Rogge is completely unruly to Mora, so she can sit silently with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mora, you are coming right. I only know that these killers are from a small organization. This assassination may be just a temptation. You will Just pick two baby girls, one on the altar and one in the secret room. Every week, we will change two girls to go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Rog has not finished, Mora suddenly fell up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her little mouth is almost attached to Rogge’s ear, and the voice has been pressed very low and low: "Rogge! Goddess... just arrived !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked. Gazing at Mora. Mora nodded slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is a great feat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is afraid that Audrey Rey is really afraid, but she has always been on his side. Not to mention the height of her god, the size of the gods, the mere possession of the gods is enough to reverse the situation in the entire north! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are many gods worshipped in this world, except for the supreme god of light gods. What Rogge knew was only the hero of the war, Hilo, who had shown miracles. The goddess of ice and ice, once a glory of the empire, has been silent for decades, and the natural goddess worshipped by the city of Yunxiao has not heard of any famous miracles that have been shown recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the goddess O'Reilly is not only showing miracles frequently. Now even directly in Dresden! what does this mean? Rogge is already excited and can't think about it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the goddess of the gods, as he recently saw, it is easy to dig up the mysterious three-headed dragon Istarazze one eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fast! Take me to the goddess!" Rogge’s voice was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess has just arrived, although it is on a baby, but the advancement of the main, this few days of flattering is essential. Rogge has been determined to take the goddess O'Reilly to the water at all costs and drag it onto his chariot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora seems to know what Rogge is thinking. Gently smiled: "The goddess has lowered the gods, except for me, no one is allowed to enter her room. Master Rogge, I think you better not to violate the goddess of the goddess, otherwise..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora suddenly fell close to Rogge, whispering like a smile: "Rogge, with your lascivious temperament, 10,000 pairs of goddesses It’s a disgrace. It’s a big disrespect! To the underground of the gods, you must be clear when you are in the Church of Light...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly remembered something and whispered to Mora: "The goddess is coming. Does anyone know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess only let me inform you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was somewhat flattered and said: "The goddess is coming in the body of the Holy Baby. Do you need protection?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora smiled and said: "The goddess is omnipotent. If someone dares to offend the goddess, his fate must be very bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger nodded and whispered: "Where the real baby is, I must not let Androni know. If she asks, you will just give a baby girl to her. If she wants Grab the baby girl, you resist a little, let her snatch it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora was shocked. Whispered: "Miss Androni is arrogant in martial arts. But if she offends the goddess, it is not a trivial matter! She...shes...is it the same as you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the blushing cheeks of Mora. Surprised by the big mouth, Rogge was shocked by her snow and ice, and did not know what to say, or could only laugh a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage bypassed the magnificent main hall and turned to the building behind the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one noticed that there were two shiny boots on the top of the main hall. The heroic swordsman in the British air stretched out and laughed and said: "Dead fat man, dare to carry me to play tricks! After I succeed, see how I can clean you!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the saint of the eye of wisdom, Mora himself has occupied a beautiful building behind the main hall, and the tall tree wall separates the small building from the outside world. Open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a refined and luxurious layout in the building. The decoration is mostly based on religious themes, which fully meets the identity of the Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the large bedroom of Mora, a little baby girl is rolling on the bed. It seems that this little baby girl is still young, with a blonde hair, dark blue eyes, and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her every move is full of surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a white and tender little hand on the bed, and the small body will fly away from the bed with lightning. But at this time, a crystal-like long finger will appear, gently on her forehead! Then the baby girl will roll over the air for a dozen or so times and then fall back heavily on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl’s blue eyes burned with raging anger, and she turned over, her little calf on the bed, and the one standing in front of the bed. The abominable black-haired silver-haired woman rushes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the wind and the moon seem to have sensed something, suddenly hidden into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl obviously can’t control her body, and she suddenly emptied into the air and straight into the door of Androni’s quietly go with! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni subconsciously took the baby girl in her hand, to see that it was a very beautiful blonde blue-eyed little guy, she could not bear When I lived with a smile, I wanted to kiss the little girl who was so cold that she had a blown face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl struggled, and Iy yelled, seemingly calling someone. Androni looked around, the whole room, only her and this little baby girl, there is no second person at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby girl called for a long time without responding, anxiously flushed. She suddenly had a mouthful, and there was a bolt of lightning in the small mouth that had no teeth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was shocked, but her martial arts were amazing, and the slight side of the head escaped the lightning. Looking at the struggling little baby girl, she couldn't help but feel the smugness in her heart. She smiled and said: "Small winds, I will raise you up slowly. Hey, I won't be afraid of you not coming!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little baby girl groaned and suddenly laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature in the room suddenly dropped sharply, and in the blink of an eye, the early autumn has become a cold winter! . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
