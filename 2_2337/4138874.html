			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the nine chapters on the dilemma<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter nine difficulties<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is whistling, the earth is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northland Wilderness is trembled under the wrath of the flame tyrant Donk Bakkara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is a thick lead cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few flashes of silver flashed in the clouds. In the long dragons, five silver dragons swooped down from the clouds and rushed to the ground. Hovering in the air when the distance of 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the silver dragon in the sky, Don Kebala calmed down. A circle of flames ignited from his feet, and his huge body was protected. In his hands, a dark red lava appeared, and the drops of magma dripped from time to time, and a shallow pit was moxibusted on the wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shield of the flame of attack and defense is a powerful and effective magic. It not only provides the caster with a certain defensive power, but also gives the melee attacker a certain amount of fire damage, depending on the magic level of the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flaming Shield cast by the Flame tyrant is so powerful that even the Silver Dragons with powerful magical defenses will suffer considerable damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Donk Bakala’s fighting stance, Cranio’s heart passed a shadow. But she still holds the last line of hope and asks: "Respected Don Kebala, you have crossed a long distance and come to Moonlight Dragon City. Can I ask your opinion?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame tyrant silently stared at Cranio. After a long time, he roared: "Two silver dragons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cranio was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the soul and dragon blood of two silver dragons can wash away the shame of my suffering!" Tang Ke Bakala's anger is gradually rising: "A despicable The silver dragon ruined my altar and made me lose contact with the entire dark forest! Only your blood and soul can make such a rude inauguration!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Cranio firmly said: "This is impossible! I am guaranteed by the identity of the Silver Dragon King. The Silver Dragon in the Moonlight Dragon City has never invaded your territory. Your anger of Tao Tao is obviously a wrong target. Please go back to the abyss, the respected Don Kebala."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangke Bakala’s voice turned low, like a thunderous rage: " The tender silver dragon king, I promised in the name of the dark gods, it is indeed a silver dragon! Hey, always a proud silver dragon. Now even his own evil deeds dare not admit it? It doesn't matter, originally I came The purpose of the Moonlight Dragon City is war!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kranj Suddenly I knew exactly who destroyed the altar 唐克巴卡拉, but she really can not understand his actions. Destroy the altar and cut off the connection of Don Kebala to the dark forest, and there is no benefit to Moonlight Dragon City. Yinlong has never had any ambitions for the vast dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His behavior is completely harmless to the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio expelled him from Moonlight Dragon City, but did not expect the Silver Dragon to still pay for his inexplicable actions. This price may be very heavy and heavy enough to be unable to afford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but. As soon as she thought of the skeletal bone on the endless wasteland, her heart filled with unbearable pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you, you..." Cranio was so sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragons now understand that the ruin of the flame tyrant's altar must be Nicholas. But from a time perspective, he was already seriously injured and dying at that time, and his strength was not as good as a dragon of the lowest. How did he get through the flame tyrant's feelings and ruin the altar under Don Kabakara's eyes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two old silver dragons made a silent exchange with spiritual fluctuations. Then nodded to Cranio. Communicating with spiritual fluctuations requires a very deep understanding of strength. Cranio is too young, she can only listen, and can't send her thoughts with spiritual fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respectfully Donk Bakala..." Cranio’s voice is very firm: "The Silver Dragon has never preceded the battle without a fight! We respect your territory and dignity, but this does not mean that Moonlight Dragon City will fear war. The silver dragon that destroyed your altar, has returned to the embrace of the dragon god. If you still insist on the unreasonable request, then I will accept the declaration of your war in the name of the Silver Dragon King!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two Silver Dragons!" Donk Bakala whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too conceited about your own strength!" Cranio said coldly: "Under the Moonlight Dragon City, it is your land of destruction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for Donk Bakkara to answer, the Silver Dragons will fly to the moonlight Dragon City. Behind them, they could not stop the violent roar of the flame tyrant who could only walk on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has come to the edge of the dark forest, he is closing his eyes on a giant tree. It seems to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint dark forest suddenly became a little brighter. Serrafi, who radiated a faint golden glow, walked out of the woods in a silent way, like a beautiful ghost. She went straight to Rogge. Looking at the fat man with a tired face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are here." Rogge opened his eyes and was slightly tired. He has been struggling with the wrath of the natural goddess for a few days, both mentally and physically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can relax now. It is very consuming to deal with the wrath of the natural goddess." Serafi was faint, but her tone was vague. The taste of gloating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge relaxed and said: "The dragon skull has already been taken. What is the situation on your side?"<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Silver Dragon King Cranio is very smart, she actually knows how to let the Babylonians and the Frost Giants kill each other. Her strategy is still a good sight, and she has succeeded in rushing the Babylonians. On the way forward to the Frost Giants. Donk Bakala just had a talk with Silver Dragon, and it was a big fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serafi said and suddenly waved the Great Sword. On the giant tree that Rogge leaned against, a few pieces of wood jumped out of the trunk and fell to the ground. They have all been replaced with bright green and green, and they are very soft. They are still writhing after falling on the ground. But their struggles are in vain, and they quickly turn into a beach of clear water under the overwhelming power of Serafi. Infiltrated into the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the mutant creature caused by the wrath of the natural goddess has not yet formed, and it was broken by Serrafi’s sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a god of O'Reilly!" The fat man sighed with a glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraffy suddenly smiled and asked: "You also met the goddess O'Reilly. You said. Is it beautiful or is she beautiful?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question hit Rogge a surprise, he stared at Serafi, said: "The relationship between you and the goddess, it is really strange... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraffy took care of his hair and chuckled: "What is the relationship between me and the goddess, not within your care? First answer My question!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fingers are intentionally or unintentionally, tapping the hilt of the Great Sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case. Rogge certainly knows how to answer: "It is very difficult to tell. But let me say, of course, you have to win some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman in front of It is the most beautiful, this is the answer that will never be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that an invisible chill has quietly enveloped the dark forest. In a flash of effort, the fat soul is almost frozen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill is fleeting, and if it is not that Rogge’s hand is still shaking, he almost thinks that the cold current is just an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just... what happened?" Rogge asked, his teeth still fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of Serafi is enough to make Rogge's heart shake, coupled with her powerful power and eccentric character, constitutes an inexplicable but fatal attraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the thoughts were involuntarily attracted to Serafi, Rogge still felt that what she said was not true, and it must be said otherwise. It seems that she has been insinuating something, as if to say to another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the matter matters. Rogge had a hand and enchanted the magic. A moment later, a magic map was formed between his hands. The center point of the map is Moonlight Dragon City, and it seems that the map is not covered too much. There are several shining signs on the map that represent the Babylonian statues of Fire, the tyrant of the flames and the giants of the frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the Babylonians?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraffi refers to the point that the sign of the Babylonian moves in a curved manner, and finally stops at the frosty giant to go to the Moonlight Dragon City. On the road. Marking the moving trajectory represents the route of the Babylonians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "Hey, Lentini and her six steel golems can deal with twenty or thirty giants at most, it seems to remind Babylon Let them escape the giant warriors. Don't let themselves die. We have to maintain devastating pressure on Moonlight Dragon City, so we can't let them fight first. But look at the distance. The giants can still arrive in two days. Babylonian position, I can't catch up, or... Will you take me a ride?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think not!” Serrafi vetoed She said again: "I will find a way for the Babylonians to realize their dangerous situation. As for you, run over yourself! In the next plan, you can't play any role!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head in a dumb, ready to go out to the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." Serafi stopped him: "You haven't had a rest for a long time. Sleep now for an hour, I will look at you." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and lie down on the ground and immediately screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are piles of giant rocks everywhere in the Northland wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock mountains of up to 100 meters provide many excellent hiding places for the people. Even the huge steel golems can hide, of course, they still need some magic camouflage. But Princess Lentini has brought a lot of magicians this time, enough to be the task of disguising the whole team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind in the north is very strong, and there are many large gravel in the wind. If the traveler is hit by these sandstones, it will hurt for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a big wind, but it has not yet reached the point where it can roll up a thick green slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a piece of such a greenstone plate actually rolled in with the wind. It has been flying to the mouth of a cave on a rocky mountain, and this has fallen heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rock Mountain came up with a low-pitched call, a scream from the Babylonian Empire, a disguised spit. The piece of greenstone fell almost against his nose and then slammed on his foot. Fortunately, this sentinel is well-trained and has to resist the pain. It is not too loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cursed in his heart while bowing his head. I have to look at this piece of greenstone that almost killed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that a few lines were still engraved on the slate board:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Beautiful princess. You are blocking the road of the Frost Giants, and they are still a lot. You better change places to ambush, believe me, six steel statues can not stop so many giants. An admiration Your thief is respectful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landing of the Qingyan board is engraved with a smiling fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentinel immediately looked around, but the sky was a lead cloud, and the ground was a wasteland. Without a little bit of life, I couldn’t see who was throwing this piece of greenstone. The sentinel had to struggle to pick up the huge slate and return to Princess Lentini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for Lentini to fly back with some anger. Under her series of orders. A rock of more than ten meters high at the root of the rock fell slowly, and a deep hole was left behind. Hundreds of warriors and six steel golems sneak out, a whole team, and a magician casts camouflage magic for the entire team. After the magic is completed, look at it, this team looks like a smoke that slowly rolls forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent. The Golem Army of the Babylonian Empire rushed to the next scheduled ambush spot at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the heavy lead cloud, Wella is watching the Golem Corps rushing to avoid the Frost Giant. The thick clouds are also unable to stop her gaze through everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He did a good job this time, at least so far, everything is going on as planned." Wella said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her, the gray-haired black-eyed gaze watched the Babylonian Golem Legion, faintly said: "The plan is not over yet."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fengyue, at least for now, everything is going well. According to their speed of travel, the Frost Giants will be within half a day after Donk Bakkara arrives at Moonlight Dragon City. Arriving at the battlefield. It seems that the Silver Dragons still think that the Frost Giants will fight with the Babylonian Golem first. The trip will be delayed for at least two days. So they will decide to rely on the Moonlight Dragon City’s natural danger to come with Donkaba. Kara decided to fight a battle to reduce the casualties of the Silver Dragon. Hey, their decision, just let the two most powerful enemies gather under the Moonlight Dragon City. It seems that Cranio is too young as a Silver Dragon King." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was the sense of the future fate of the people, the dragon soul gun shook slightly, and the dragon soul imprisoned in the gun seemed to roar in anger. When Wei Na's five fingers were slightly tight, they suppressed the uneasy dragon spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that time was satirized by the wind, in front of her, Wella is no longer willing to appear in the image of Celafi. As for the question of who Wella and Fengyue are similar to each other, the two have already fought countless times, and of course there is no result every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is perhaps the only light color in the gloomy sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After a while, we should go to Moonlight Dragon City, where there are still a lot of silver dragons. In case of any accident, you can deal with it." How many silver dragons?" Weina asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will escape." The wind is faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina glimpsed, and then chuckled: "I think the same! Fengyue, you finally learn to stop working hard."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon did not answer, just looking into the distance, seems to be thinking about what is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner said again: "But Gregory can't escape, it just has a sacred dragon, the real power is too bad. Far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon are cold and authentic: "The silver dragon will not kill the sacred dragon. If it is a surprise, let Gregory be in the moonlight." Stay in the Dragon City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also good." Wella indulged for a while and suddenly asked: "But what about him? Do you think?" Always maintain the current situation, always hiding behind the demon lotus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is he?" Fengyue has no emotional fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Wella saw her hair that was always drooping in the mirror, and a few hairs fluttered in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s mouth smirked with a faint smile, and asked without any relaxation: “Of course you know who I am talking about! Well, Fengyue, you don’t feel yourself Is the behavior very strange? For example, you can spare no effort to protect him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue suddenly looked up, both eyes in the silver mans, and looked at the ice coldly Na. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s gaze on the wind and moon is not at all concerned, but she said: “But you are in front of him, or you are in the form of a goddess. Either you are hiding in the demon lotus to see him. Anyway, it seems that you are not willing to let him know your true colors! There must be some reason for this, maybe I should go to see the origin of God before... ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
