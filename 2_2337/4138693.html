			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing a lot of big scenes, Furo’s lab opened up Rogge’s vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason for him, it is the word big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s little camp outside looks like her main servant is a little crowded, but there are no fewer than ten rooms, which is already surprised by Rogge. It is. However, when the lab door opened, Rogge only had a big mouth and couldn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presented in front of him is a huge hall with a radius of 100 meters. The hall is empty and empty, with a mist of mist. There are many unknown creatures in the fog that are moving around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gallery opposite the hall. The entire laboratory is so much about Rogge’s understanding that Rogge has seen more than a dozen doors on this gallery. A few three-meter-high bandits came back and forth in the channel and didn't know what to do. All the rooms were banned with a lot of magic. All the way, Rogge also has more than a dozen deadly magic traps, and he did not know how much he did not find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the first layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s lab is divided into three levels, each with a height of six meters. Each layer of the lab is transported by a special magical array. In front of the magical array on the first floor, there is a huge steel scorpion guard full of five meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While following Furo’s entry into the magical array, the red eyes of the steel stared at Rogge and watched the fat man jump. He is very aware of how powerful this war machine is! If the giants of the hills can deal with ten human knights, then the steel can also deal with ten hill giants! The masters of the steel shovel are master-level magicians and alchemists. The steel shovel is made up of a large and complex magical array, so it will be attached with all kinds of magical protection, so that most of the magic Immunity. As for the physical attack.... Steel 傀儡 is not a name, only a few centimeters thick steel plate can test the strength of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria took Rogge directly to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the magic array, Rogge took a face with a ghost banshee. The translucent banshee has a beautiful face, and there is a faint fire in the eyes. She floated in the air, faintly able to see the upper body wearing a low-cut backless evening dress. At least the lower body is a faint mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heartbeat of the fat man paused for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost banshee is definitely among the most powerful undead creatures. Her sharp screams can directly pull the soul of the creature out of the body. Her own ghost form makes her immune to most weapons and low-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is a Necromancer, and of course the horror of the ghost banshee, so when he is still staring at him, he is faint It’s gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya has a yellow glow on his body, as he glides on the surface of the water. "If you don't hurry up, I can't wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for me, Your Highness! Your Royal Highness! ! ! Rogge yelled, trotting all the way, followed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two came to the front of the main entrance of the promenade, and Froya whispered a few words. The mantra, stepping forward through the door, and Rogge scalp, slamming his head toward the door, thinking that he wouldn’t be able to hit a bag. In any case, the fat man would not stay in the gallery full of ghost banshee!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door is actually a space portal. Rogge slammed into a huge laboratory. The fat man with his eyes closed only felt soft and fragrant on his head. Then he heard an exclamation. He immediately felt that the big thing was not good. He looked up and saw that Froya was knocked down on the ground by himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria High, and Rogge is almost the same. The fat man is bending down and slamming, this part of the collision is extra soft... Rogge dare not think again. Did not wait for him to think again, the angry Furuoya Throwing small magic such as fireballs, lightning, and negative energy shock waves like rain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rooms, Rogge suffer less than a dozen in mind magic, till he screams loudly <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Froya finally finished the gas, and said: "Do not call so loud, I know that you have nothing! Get up, do something right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lab is enveloped in a piece of blue light. In the small magical array on the ground, the green mist smashed, and hundreds of dead souls rushed in the magical array, struggling desperately, but they could not rush out of the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bizarre, horrible creature is taking shape in a large magical array in the middle of the lab. The creatures struggled in the fire, and the souls that were banned were unable to endure the burning of the flames, and the crying of the crying. Rogge was sweating, and the undead energy of the whole body was flying around, and he had done his best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic loses too fast! Slower! Slower!" Froya kept pointing around, and the attitude of pointing was not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this spell written? Does your tongue not roll?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The posture of the right hand is wrong! What magic symbol do you draw, how can I not understand it? No wonder you can only call out the soldiers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗One, the soul in the magical array couldn’t stand the burning, and the screams turned into a light smoke. The biomass that is about to be formed becomes fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed. Froya pointed to the magical fountain in the corner of the house, surprisingly did not rebuke him, softly said: "To add some magic, don't worry, anyway there is something to be there!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night passed quickly. There is Fu Luoya pointing at it, and there is ample supply of magic, and the level of Rogge's Necromancer is greatly advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally summoned a two-meter-high general with the soul of the giant, and successfully summoned three knights with the soul of the golden lion knight. There are more than a dozen warriors. Other souls are either smashed by Rogge's improper control or by the burning of the flame of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Froja’s lab, Rogge finally retaliated against the little demon woman in a short period of time. He asked the origins of this lab with awe. Fu Luoya smiled and thought that you know a lot, how can you not even see the 'lost paradise'? "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> One of the artifacts, with the power to manipulate the space freely. If the owner of the artifact is powerful enough, he can even formulate some rules for the space created by the 'lost paradise'. The power of this artifact is even scrupled with the demon, I did not expect Actually fell in the hands of Fu Luoya.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya looked at the Rogge in the room, smiled lightly, but did not have the ability to build such a grand project. The lab in Paradise Lost was originally built by my teacher. Later, he watched me running too hard, and if I couldn’t eat well, I sent this thing to me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Jero... How many artifacts do you have?" Rogge asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Luo has no artifacts right now. Artifacts are in my hands! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is willing? Rogge asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so pitiful, of course he is willing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...like other great wizards, as well as paladins, holy warriors, and so on, have never heard of so many Artifact? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My old man is not very good at the magic, it is estimated to be the end of the top ten magic." However, he loves to dig into the grave. After decades, he has become a top ten magician. "Froya replied faintly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue now keeps the words "adventure tomb" in his heart, especially under the word grave Also marked with a few key points.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, a tired Rogge came out of Froya’s little camp and slammed into the insurance Luce. Paulus was angry and stunned in his eyes, and he snorted heavily. When he was in a good mood, Rogge would like to take care of him and go back to his account and fall asleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't sleep, the dwarves have killed again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you dead again?" Rogge asked confusedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send a fart to death! The people who come are too much, and there are giants! There is a big giant who really has his *** Over the head! I went to the front, the brothers can't stand it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the giant word, Rogge’s spirit rose. When you hear the words "big guy", the fat man has no sleep. He flew tidy and tidy, poured a bottle of magic potion on his head and rushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the camp, the adventurers are in a tough fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Dwarf King mobilized all the miners, and all the sick were treated with bloodthirsty. Counting the remnants of the warrior, the hammer of the anger is full of 1,500 dwarf warriors! Of course, most of them are miners. All the hill giants also played, and there are two little guys just two meters tall. After the little giant hid behind the array, he stoned a dozen kilograms of stones to the Terran team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking thing is to rush at the forefront of the mountain giants. He holds a huge warhammer. The hammer handle is one foot thick. The huge hammer is one meter long and two meters long! Every round of the Anyan Warhammer will bring up a small whirlwind, blowing human warriors. Any soldier who has a little hammer on his side is at least a fracture, and even the Golden Lion Knight is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous left hand wrapped around a bright white electric fire, each waved, there will be more than ten two-foot-sized electric spiders rushing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the angry rock, follow the four adult hill giants. The dwarf Wang Wuyan Shen hammer is charged side by side with the angry rock, and a flame shock wave is poured into the human warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anyan has already rushed to the gate of the camp. The soldiers standing on the gate of the city gate just looked at the angry rock. Rogge looked at the angry rock, and the more he saw it, the more happy he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymously screamed, and slammed it all out! The sawdust was flying, and the four-meter-high gate was crushed. More than a dozen Terran soldiers were thrown out by the collapsed tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry rock that rushed into the camp was now in front of Rogge. He suddenly calmed down and said: "I feel the soul of my people in you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although my heart is shocked by the power of the angry rock, Rogge still smiles with a smile: "Are you talking about this?" After that, Rogge began to curse, and a tall general was formed in the fire. The general was wearing a full body armor, holding a huge sword in both hands, and his eyes flashed with blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Rogge summoned the knights and the warriors. As soon as he ordered, the undead creatures swarmed and rushed to the rage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the general, the face of angry rock is full of sadness and anger. He screamed and sighed: "My people, angry rock will give your soul peace!" The rock of the angry rock sheds blood, and the hammer in his hand has a holy white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s sword opened a hole in the anvil’s leg, but it was also crushed by the angry rock, a pale green soul in the light. The burning is exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked, not recalling other undead creatures, and two knights and a dozen warriors were crushed by angry rock. The undead creatures destroyed by the wrath of the wrath with the sacred bonus effect, the souls that have been banned have been purified, and will not be summoned in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has a heartache, and the horse rushes to the angry rock. On the wrath of the rock, the holy light was great, and he couldn’t take other undead creatures. He hammered him to Rogge. The hammer has not arrived, and the wind has already pressed Rogge to breathe. The fat man jumped from the moment and even climbed to hide to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Rogge’s mount was smashed into a bolognese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is extremely flexible, while he is hiding from the crazy offensive of the flashing rock, while he is desperately making a wish in the heart. Can't hide, the fat man can only use the soul to block a few times. The soul of the soul is a battle axe worth a million dollars, and several iron pieces have been cut from the hammer of the angry rock. It was just that the hammer was too big. A few pieces of iron were insignificant. Instead, Rogge was dizzy. The fat man still wants to avoid the electric fire that is released from time to time when he is angry with the angry rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya looked down and smirked: "You have dealt with it! Your hands are a little troublesome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness can be like this... ..." Rogge is miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, Froja began to curse again. The dwarf king yelled: "You demon! There is a kind of down to fight you to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria has been cursed for a moment, laughing: "Do you even have a waste that you can't fly with?" If you have a kind, you will come up! Can't you come up? Then try my 'Hell's Gate'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the dwarf battle suddenly raised a large earthen bag, and countless bloody bones stretched out of the earthen bag. The bones are constantly growing, and a giant bone door of up to five meters in the blink of an eye stands in the short crowd. Unspeakable evil and horror breath out of the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf warriors retreated in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood-red electro-optic light begins to shine in the bone door, with a whistling sound, a back-winged hell demon from the bone door Stepped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green eyes of the demon look around the body, screaming in the sky, then bowed and bowed, opened the mouth of the sharp teeth, and blew a round The green whistle of the ice cold. Dozens of dwarves were instantly frozen into ice sculptures. The demon giant claws stretched out, grabbed a dwarf, bite him half a body, chewing in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farly seeing the raging sorcerer on the battlefield, angry rock angered and mixed, he was anxious to solve the annoying, slippery fat man. With a wave of hands, more than a dozen electric spiders began to crawl around. Rogge flashed his hammer over the angry rock, and the Tomahawk crossbar swept away two electric spiders. Two steps and the angry rock opened the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous rock is not present, this time an electric spider called out is unusually large and is still expanding dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous suddenly felt a cold ice behind him, he suddenly turned and saw the electric spider blasting open, a huge sickle in the electric fire splashed to him Neck. The angry rock lifted the arm and blocked it. The steel arm was cut by a sickle and a large piece of flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Jumping across the electric fire from Gregory. At this time, the *** is no longer a bone shelf. She is covered with a layer of purple and black unidentified material. Several blade-like bone spurs protruded from the elbows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days have not seen, Gregory has completely turned into a bone dragon, the original carrion has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the ***, the look of the angry rock is dignified, he asks: "You have broken the bondage of the contract and crossed the magical imprisonment! You have It is a real life! Why should we obey this despicable, weak human?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***No answer, you can't speak. She has a pair of wings, flying from Gregory, and the sickle is going to the rock. The angry rock sighed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory also jumped up and bit the thigh of the angry rock. Anger took a step back and flashed this record. He didn't think that a light green dragon spurted out of Gregory's mouth, and the calf of the anger rock was in the middle. A green gas rushed from the calf's calf and his movements were less flexible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory smugly screamed silently, how to say that he is also a dragon, although it is a bone dragon, or the weakest wind Duron is the kind of stupid dragon that can only spray poisonous fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in any case, what dragons are contemptuous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combat with *** is completely different from Rogge. *** Elegant and flexible, the flight route is very different and seems completely unaffected by gravity. She couldn't help but scream at the angry rock with her left hand, and the devil's right hand was also caught by lightning. Even though the skin of the angry rock is so hard that the sword is hard to damage the eye, it is not much worse than the tofu. As long as it is brought by her claws, it is a wound. After a while, the anger rock has been bruised and bruised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The battle with the alpine giant Rogge can't get into it. However, this battle did not last long, and the angry rock was inserted into the chest by the ***. The giant yelled and struggled a few times, crashing into the ground and overwhelming a row of houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Gathering the wings and falling lightly on the chest of the angry rock. There is no fear of death in the eyes of the giant, only endless grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angry rock looks at the ***, sighs: "We are all tied to fate from the time of existence. And you are How lucky, I can break free from the bondage of fate! Answer me, strong alienity exists, is your choice now really correct? Answer me, step out of the river of destiny, why should you return again? Origin?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Looking at the angry rock, I did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh," the giant laughed hard and low, and the blood of the big stock began to flow from his mouth. "In any case, you are lucky. You have the power to choose after all. From five hundred years ago, I saw this day and waited for this day. It is a sad thing to know the fate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the eyes of the angry rock began to swell, and he said hard: "Let the two children of my family... life... should not be so cherished... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyan finally finished his five hundred years of life journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful soul of the giant began to drift away, and Rogge rushed forward to try to collect. *** But suddenly reached out and grabbed the soul of the angry rock, the pale flame ignited in the hands of the anger, and the soul of the angry rock completely dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What...***? Rogge tried to communicate with ***, but nothing happened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Bend down and gently lift the eyes of the angry rock. Then he jumped on the back of Gregory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart echoed the words of the angry rock repeatedly: “You have already broken the bondage of the contract and have already crossed Magical imprisonment! You are already a real life! Why should we obey this despicable, weak human? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to himself: "***, have you been free?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling sounds in the sky, Froya is flying all over here, she is not there, the crisp cry is first passed: "Good You are a fat man, actually dare to lie to me! What is the crocodile on the back? Is it your pet! ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is furious! This little human woman dares to say that he is a crocodile. In any case, the owner must teach her! He still has Knowing yourself, knowing that you are not the opponent of this little woman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya is not here, a gray magic net is like a hood ***The left hand is tight, a white flame is ignited from the handle, and the knives are turned into a flame giant in a blink of an eye. The flame python rotates, and the two-and-a-half-moon-shaped death flame volatility easily cuts the magic net into Four pieces, the rest is not stopped, and went to Fu Luoya.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya was slightly surprised and propped up several magic shields. Death Flame The volatility exploded on the shield, only the outermost shield was broken. A smile appeared from the mouth of Froya, but then the mouth was big, and I was surprised to see when I didn’t know when it appeared in front of me. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Take your right hand and grab it like a ray like a thunder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Twelve The guardian! "Floria's two rings are out of glare, and twelve magical masks of different colors are instantly generated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is like the most splendid fireworks.* **The right hand is getting closer and closer to Froja’s throat, and the shields of the road are unstoppable. With a bang, a ring in the left hand of Froya blasts.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the last two shields against the devil's right hand. The *** then retreated, and instantly returned to the back of Gregory. Froya's face was rare and serious, her The forehead has oozing out the fine sweat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Silencefully watched Froya for a while, turned and rode Gregory back The world has gone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the space ripples after leaving, Fu Luoya put a hand on Rogge’s shoulder, soft and greasy: "You pet is very fierce! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: "That's not a villain's pet. Where can a villain have such a powerful pet?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the four hill giants have fallen under the breath and claws of the demon. The Demon immediately began to slaughter the dwarfs beside him, and even the close Terran warriors were killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round of the Flame knows that the trend has gone, only hope that the land of the Dwarf Dungeon will kill several invaders. After personally leading the team, he led the dwarves to withdraw to the dungeon. In this battlefield, the dwarves have already opened a few tunnels, and now they are all used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two little giants couldn’t get into the tunnel, they thrive and fled to the distant forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate, Paulus began to command the men to hunt down the dwarfs who were defeated, and no one cares about the little giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, who is passionate about collecting souls, doesn’t look at it like this, and he pursues the two giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer who has not fully satisfied the killing has rejected the order of Froya to return him to the devil world. The irritated Froya took out a delicate little emerald wand, and then the demon looked desperately at the five pale green balls of light flying toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five decompositions! Even with only half the chance of success, five decompositions are enough to completely eliminate it twice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being completely disassembled, the demon only had a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When life is threatened, the potential is often endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two young giants strode forward and fled a few kilometers away in a blink of an eye. Rogge has just gotten started with the undead magic, and his desire for the soul is almost morbid. Seeing that the horse is not catching up, he blessed himself with the "power of the bull" and "adding the skill" and jumped down to the horse to chase. This made him gradually closer to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chase and escape, and then ran a few kilometers. Just less than a kilometer from the forest, Rogge jumped up and stopped before the two young giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the young hills giants, a man and a woman, the two little giants have run exhausted, how can they still be the fierce opponent of Rogge? At this moment, the fat man is very proud of his heart. Although the undead creatures summoned by this young heterosexual soul are not as powerful as the adult giants, the advantage is that they can grow. Observing the evolutionary process of undead creatures will be of great help to Rogge's Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, Rogge should humiliate his opponents at this time, and even consider the possibility of alive. In front of this female hill giant, in terms of human aesthetics, the appearance is still decent. There are many quirks in the upper class of the Terran, and this little giant may be able to sell a good price after catching it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man who is familiar with the history books knows that there are many people who are too arrogant before the battle, and the result gives the other party a chance to turn over, and the king becomes defeated. In the end, I turned myself into a negative example. He does not want to make this mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty smiles, I can let you go, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Giants Showing an unbelievable look, listening to Rogge 'but' below.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Rogge suddenly shot, an axe stabbed the male giant, while using The volume-in-a-line female giant cast a set-up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, the male giant’s axe on the leg slammed into the ground. The female giant was paralyzed and was stunned by Rogge. An axe was shot in the back of the head and fainted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, if there was a wind that hits Rogge’s back neck, the fat man can’t escape. The neck was shrunk. A strange weapon set a fire on the armor 'reincarnation', but in the end it was not able to cut through the reincarnation. The rear wheel of the Rogge tomahawk, the sneak attacker escaped lightly.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cold sweaty Rogge came back and looked at the sneak attacker. If it wasn't for the reincarnation, change the general armor, the fat man's head is not in the neck anymore.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak attacker has a dark green armor, and the armor is extremely beautiful and beautiful, and it can be seen that it is tailor-made.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the figure, this is obviously a female knight, her mount is a huge white tiger. The horsewoman wears a covered helmet and can't see the appearance. But the long and pointed sides of the helmet are extended. The ear leaked the identity of her elf. She wore two holes in her left ear, dotted with a black, white and two pearls. A circular blade wheel was placed in the hand, and the outer teeth were covered with sharp serrations.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an elf! Look at this platoon is not an ordinary elf! Rogge's heart tickles and is intertwined with greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fierce humans, you have slaughtered their parents, isn’t the child even allowed to let go now?" The elf knight sternly questioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The juvenile giant is taller than the elf riding on the back of the white tiger. The delicate elves instead put on a frame to protect them. Rogge looked at this strange scene with great interest and asked, "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the guardian of the elves, I heard The call of the angry rock came specially to help his people. The elves have been friends of giants and dwarves since ancient times, and I will not sit and watch your bad deeds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is there only one of the guardians of the elves? What about other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am alone, it is enough to protect the people of the angry rock!" "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> ;&nbsp;The elf female warrior is obviously somewhat unnatural, eats authentic: eager to save people! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be a very tender elf. But it’s really good, especially this body... Rogge glanced at the huge white tiger, obviously I am not satisfied with my horse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer with Rogge nonsense, the elf female warrior slammed the white tiger and rushed up. Suddenly, the face flew A few magic missiles surprised her. Then a huge sword spider suddenly stopped her, and two sharp forelimbs were inserted into her chest. A knight and several warriors followed the battle group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge’s equipment and fighting between the young giants, the Elf Warrior always thought he was a warrior. He didn’t expect him to be a magician! In a big way, she immediately fell into a hard fight. She was so hard to summon a few tree people to help, but was burned by Rogge several fireballs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Still stop! "The cold voice of Rogge came. The elf warrior turned around and suddenly stopped. Rogge's tomahawk was on the neck of a little giant, looking at her smugly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are despicable! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is no need to say it! How are you, are you bound, or are you ready to continue to work, watching me kill this poor child? Rogge’s gaze was fascinated by the elf’s body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf was shaking all over, she waved the wheel saw, and she smashed it. Hey. The giant screamed, and Rogge stabbed her on the lap with an axe. The female elf was so angry that she screamed: "Don't hurt them!" They are still children! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yeah, child. A child who is taller than me. But now you can't hurt them, the right can be when you are not me! As long as you don't do it, they won't have anything to do! Rogge smiled smugly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you want to let them go!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's actually very simple, I am a very kind person, you take off your helmet first! Rogge smiled insidiously. He knew that he couldn't make too many requests at once, just a little bit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf female warrior hesitated, the little giant is again A scream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf took off his helmet and said with anger: "Now you like it? Can let them go! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the elf he saw, but in front of him The beauty of the elves is not something that should exist in this world! The angry, deep-eyed eyes, with magical power, almost sucked the whole soul of the fat man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You can't let go! "The elf anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man replied a little bit of reason and said: "Throw the helmet and your weapon!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
