			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this special winter, all the people in Lille talk about the upcoming wedding of the Bavarian Grand Duke and Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be an unprecedented grand wedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the grandeur of Bavarian Grand Duke and Catherine itself has made this wedding the focus of attention, this is not the main reason why this wedding is so sensational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wedding will be held in the newly built and magnificent St. Peter's Basilica. Pope Paul will personally preside over the wedding. The witness will be the Marshal of the Rhine Union. And the head of the Holy Knights, Blood Angel Augustus. Ten of the fourteen cardinals of the Bright Church came from all over the country to hold a blessing ceremony for the wedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighboring countries all sent 66 congratulations to the envoys, and many small kingdoms and city-state lords even personally came to congratulate. Both the monarch and the envoys brought the most elite troops in their country as guards, of course, the maximum number was only 500. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wedding has become a stage for countries to show their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Lille is now completely transformed into a large barracks. In the history of the city, there have never been so many troops. At present, there are more than 50,000 regular knights stationed outside the city, and various infantry, auxiliary arms and logistics units have passed 100,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking of the Cavaliers is to teach the Holy Knights. The 20,000-year-old sacred knight is led by the blood angel Augustus of Megatron, which is enough to level a small country. In addition, several mysterious knights have also appeared. These knights are not too large, and they are all in the upper and lower ranks. The resident is scattered throughout the city of Lille, and the ring is guarding the Grand Duke. The Holy Knights are concentrated in the South City near the gates. It is a far cry from the St. Peter's Basilica where the Pope lives. However, there are blood angel guards around, no one dares to call the Pope's idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 20,000 Cavaliers commanded by Marshal Rocherio are stationed outside of Lille. There are also nearly 10,000 ordinary knights in the Bavarian Principality in the military camp outside the city. These knights are scattered throughout the Principality, but now they are concentrated in the city of Lille. At present, there are only a few second-rate legions in the main sites of the Principality, and it is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;通<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scepter of Louis IX’s huge luxury can’t help but slam the ground, The pale right hand holding the scepter is too strong and erect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a demonstration! This is blackmail! This is the most naked insult to the Bourbon dynasty!" Louis IX roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of ministers in the hall, look at me, I look at you, don't talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing? Why don't you talk? I gave you the title, the land, the gold coins, the slaves, and the power. Now the country is in danger, don't you just Watching Rosherio and Rheinhardt's two things in a hurry, are there any ways? Cough!" Louis IX was so excited that he coughed up and his face rose red. Froja, who had been standing behind him, held his arm and patted his back gently, which made his cough better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the year, the Rhine League was an eventful event. Louis IX enjoyed his life, but he did not expect to be in danger of ruining his country in his later years. Day and night worry about labor makes him look aging, white gradually become sparse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, this time Marshal Rocherio is really amazing. Now almost all the troops that can be mobilized are trapped in the Principality of Ron. In addition to the 20,000 Guards who guarded Wang Du, only the private army of the noble lords had some fighting power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis IX Go, see what he said is the heir to the throne he appointed, the great prince Alan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan continued: "Father, the situation is now in jeopardy. In addition to the kings, the defense of other strategic locations is almost completely empty. So now Time is of the utmost importance to us. We should do everything we can to delay the time, seek the assistance of our allies, and mobilize all the forces that can be mobilized. Therefore, I propose to requisition the private soldiers of all nobles and reorganize them into formal Armed, unified dispatch and command."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burly four prince Deschamp strode forward and angered: "Alan! You cowardly, don't dare to face the battlefield. You still want to smash at this time, fight against the aliens, and consolidate your personal Power! What do you mean by trying to receive the arms of all nobles at this time? Can you wait to sit on this throne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan The face immediately rose red, and he was too angry to speak. Russell Russell coughed and said: "I think that the advice of His Royal Highness Alan is very reasonable. We must now delay the time, concentrate the power in our hands, and seek the help of external allies. Now is not the time of fighting, Marshal Rosrio The betrayal puts us in an extremely unfavorable state, so the temporary weakness on the surface is not a manifestation of embarrassment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dechen coldly feels that it is When you clean up the inside. The father, the alliance to the point of today, the key lies in the transformation of Marshal Rosio. However, Russell Russell and the traitors Roscherio and Rheinhardt have made good contacts for many years, and everyone in the league knows it. Roscherio’s plan to attack the Rwan Principality by the soldiers of the country has always been approved. If we say that we are suddenly surprised by the marshal's apostasy, Russell Dagong will not know a little bit of wind beforehand, and some can't say it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell was shocked and said: "His Royal Highness, I have played for the Bourbon dynasty for 30 years, never have two hearts!" If you blame me like this, can you have any evidence? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell Dagong holds the power of the league's internal affairs for more than ten years, with a high degree of authority, and Deschamps does not dare to be too aggressive. He turned his head and said: " The situation of the Confederation today could have been avoided. If my dear sister, His Royal Highness Princess Froa would like to consider a little bit for the interests of the Alliance, and if Orpheus is brought over, now Rheinhardt may not be rebellious. However, she went with the son of the traitor Rosherio, openly hooked up, which made Orphey Roque get the stage? Has she ever thought about the dynasty and the father of the heart? However, there is still a chance at the moment. The Chelsea Prince of the Dro Empire is very promising to inherit the throne. He has always liked Froya. If this marriage can be successful, we will rely on the Dro Empire, one of the three great empires, and then Don't be mad at the two traitors! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blow made Froya's pretty face white, and she said with anger: "Don't the Bourbon dynasty have fallen to the princess who needs the royal family like a prostitute." Is it the case to sell the hue? His Royal Highness! Do you still have the minimum pride and dignity of the Bourbon royal family? Father, you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis IX is sullen, and thoughtfully, it has clearly moved for Deschamp’s proposal. Two sounds, Louis IX did not hear at all. Her heart slowly sank.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria's pretty face was covered with a layer of frost. Deshang looked at Deschamps coldly. Deshang snorted and glanced at her from top to bottom, and the greedy, fierce flame flashed past her eyes. Others did not realize that Deschamps intended to make Froya see clearly. Clearly, this kind of gaze has been seen in the eyes of Wang Xiong since childhood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See suppressed Froya and Russell The important figures of Dagong, the two great princes of the Alan faction, Deshang’s heart is proud, and he still respectfully said to Louis IX: “Father, these two traitors now concentrate all their forces on Lille in order to show off their strength. City, the current knights assembled in Lille City have passed 50,000 people, and the infantry has exceeded 100,000. Now the strategic defensive positions in the Bavarian Principality are extremely emptiness, which is a good opportunity for us to sneak up! Father! As long as I bring 10,000 Guards and 40,000 aristocrats, I can take advantage of the Principality of the Principality's defensive emptiness, so that the Principality's entry into the Alliance will be firmly in our hands! You are determined to agree to the marriage requirements of the Dro Empire. When the army of the Dro Empire arrives, you are not afraid that the two traitors will be mad again! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Never! "Dr. Russell finally couldn't help but drink.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Da Gong, your own suspicion has not been cleaned up, what high opinion is there?" Deshang asked contemptuously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell did not pay attention to Deschamps, and he followed Louis IX: "The wedding of Catherine and Rheinhardt is actually regarded as A political alliance activity. All countries invited to attend can be considered to have temporarily joined the camp of the Bavarian Principality and the Church. In this way, the significance of the other party's collection of Lille City is obvious. Now that the other party has not officially announced the rebellion, if we attack at this time, we will give people a mouthful! Moreover, this wedding will be personally presided over by the Pope. If this sneak attack attracts the Holy Knights to participate in the war, Deschamps! How confident are you holding the Kerry Fortress in front of the blood angel Augustus? ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deshang wants to say two words, but when he speaks to the mouth, he swallows it again. Even if he is arrogant, he knows that he wants to be under the strength of the army. It is an idiotic dream to block the Holy Knights led by blood angels.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris, the obese legal minister, quickly stepped forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people in the Roscio family have not escaped?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The important figures of the Roscio family have left the alliance, but most of the family is still under our control. According to the reported figures, the Roscio family and the pedigree have a total of 1,460. Six people are still in the league. As long as you order, I can bring all the people to you in two days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yi IX is one heavy The scepter, said: "Put these people together and throw them into the prison of Zhanshi! If Rocherio really dares to betray me, then kill these people! Other things will be said tomorrow!" Bryan/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan, Russell, and Froya were in a hurry, and they wanted to persuade them, but they were stopped by a very harsh look of Louis IX. The old king snorted and turned back to the apse, only to throw the next aristocratic ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most prosperous Fifth Avenue in Lille has been somewhat degraded. In the past, the luxury carriages were full of enthusiasm, and the spacious avenues were often crowded. Today, only a few carriages are parked on the side of the road, lining the bare deciduous paulownia on both sides of the road, which is particularly deserted. "The Hammer of the God of War" is still in the three-story building. After suffering, it has long since disappeared. The square in front of the door where dozens of luxury carriages can be parked is now empty, and only the beautiful maids in the magnificent hall are waiting for guests who don’t know when they will come to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a pub opposite the "Knight of the God of War", a man with a good instrument is sitting alone on the second floor, with only one in front of him. Bottle of twenty years of red wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hustle and bustle of the pub suddenly calmed down, the air seemed to be a little solidified, and there was a bloody smell in it. The man in front of the window smiled and slowly poured red wine in two crystal cups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the armor snoring, a knight with a blue armor walked up the second floor. His face is quite handsome, and although he has no expression, he still looks very gentle. It’s just that he is constantly murderous and bloody. The guests on the second floor felt extremely unnatural, and even dared not look at him, and they left the checkout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight sat at the man’s desk and took the glass and drank it. The bloodyness on his body made the man unable to help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kate, although I have asked this question several times, I still can't help but ask again. How many people have you killed in the past six months?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Franco, you will never want to get an answer to this question. I want your curiosity to torture you! Haha! My murder is less. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a lot less blood on your body, and the murder is still as strong. Can't control it?" Franco inadvertently expressed concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate shook his head and tried to completely control the murderous, I am afraid that my vindictiveness will have to go one step further. Your vindictiveness is up to tenth level? I really didn't expect that you managed the fortress of Sellesborg and the God of War, and you still took the time to practice the sword. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that Franco’s smile is not for life? I didn’t expect to live alive from the Inquisition. The Sallesburg and the Ares It’s the blood of the brothers, the dead fat man doesn’t know where to go; you only want to bring the lion tooth knights to practice killing; the Lens color ghost has no interest, only pick up the girl in the thieves’ union every day, until now I haven't broken through the seven levels. These everyday troubles are thrown at me, you are very happy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate smiled and glanced at the window The hammer of the god of war, said again: "How is the situation of Isabella and the foggy old man? Is there a good point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco sighed full No improvement. In addition to the personal maid, Isabella can't see anyone, especially a man, and I don't even dare to go see her. Fog illusion also has to be watched day and night, otherwise it will always cut a few times, oh! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate's voice is low and Sabella is crazy, and the fog is crazy. Fes is now just drinking, no longer building weapons. Are you tired?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hammer of the god of war is now only a military business. There are slaves of the Dresden slaves, the military weapons we produce. The quality of the armor is still unmatched. The profit of this piece is also quite a lot, or the dead fat eye is poisonous! This is the basis of his lay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Franco added: "I will hold a wedding soon. What are you going to do in the future? Is your father still in the kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate lowered his voice: "He has already set a plan. When the time comes, our two families will leave the king together. I am still guilty. I will stay in the lion's camp first. There are many brothers who have been playing together between life and death. Yes, I will have the opportunity to gather together later. Right, listen to Robsky’s kid, the golden lion knight and the two round table knights who are still alive are very disappointed with the Grand Duke, ready to resign from the military and leave the Principality!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco’s face is also dignified, whispering: “Is the message true? Dagong will he let these people go?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate shook his head and I don’t know. You are now the closest person to the Grand Duke. How did Orpheq’s adult die? Have you heard any news? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I heard that it was related to the church and Elysses, but further information could not be heard anyway. The old departments of our Orpheus adults can only protect themselves and act on their own. Although the Grand Duke saved us from the church, it is not clear whether he has another purpose. I can't see him more and more now. But there is still good news. Bishop Hart revealed a bit of a tone, and the Big Three of the Last Judiciary is now not left. I heard that the two died on the way to hunt down the fat man, and the other has never heard from the Grand Duke. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well!" Kate hated and said: "But I really didn't expect the fat man to have such a skill, but he can pick up the two giants, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco said: "How can he have this kind of skill? But he has the most tricks, maybe he used some disgraceful means to clean them up! Now still I really miss him, oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them are thinking about Rogge, but they are very comfortable now. He now has a mansion in Dresden. This house was originally the property of the palace magician Gnawala. After the magic test, the overwhelmed Tikke Grand Duke had no hatred for Gennawara, not only to imprison all his relatives, but also to confiscated all his property. This house was logically transferred to the new Princess Magister Rogge. Rogge walked around the house and had to feel the wealth and wealth of Gonawara. This house is a little bigger than the house of Carlos, and the luxury is farther. The maids inside are even better. Of course, this is in terms of the standards of the Principality of Aray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in Roger’s luxurious and lavish bedroom, the fire is raging and the room is like a spring. There is no bed in the bedroom, but directly on the ground with a thick wool blanket, and a few thick mats on the carpet. In the dozens of cushions, the high-hanging crystal chandeliers sprinkle soft warm light, and then match the portrait of a naked woman from the famous hands on the four walls. This bedroom is really incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is wearing a brocade robes, leaning against a pile of cushions. The aunt who had just bathed was wrapped in a robes and crouched on Rogge's shoulder. He didn't care about the large white skin on his thighs. Carlos is also a casual dress, sitting opposite the two. In the middle of a short section, there are several delicate dishes and a bottle of tequila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a relaxing and enjoyable time, but the topic of discussion is somewhat different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Rogge, this afternoon my father just lifted the big brother's forbidden order. Just before I came over, I heard that my eldest brother had entered the palace to see his father." Carlos frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the magic test, Carlos has begun to rely entirely on Rogge. In his eyes, the powerful and intelligent Rogge is simply the angel God has given him. Rogge, who has the Elf Guard, has been too strong for a small country like the Ayre Principality. Now there is a mysterious Frey and his party joined Rogge's camp. This made Carlos awe in Roger. More than once, he was fortunate enough to meet Rogge, and Rogge’s auntie had always been good with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what do you think?" Rogge asked carelessly, shaking his glass of wine and staring at the green wine from the wall. Slowly flow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Brother He..." Carlos hesitated, and said: "I am worried that my father will restore trust in his older brother and regain his power. He has always been eloquent." Well, the father is old, and he is stunned by him, maybe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie twitching the body of men is really boring, except Woman, is the power to kill! Second brother, you have always been so indecisive, no big things can be decided! You are now the heir to the throne, and Rogge and I support you. What are you afraid of? As long as you keep the seat of the heir to the throne, the eldest brother will not listen to you at the end? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie Jiao smiled and said: "Two brothers, you are really useless! You think about how the big brother was against you at the beginning? Can't you deal with him the same?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos face is not wrong, but the big brother, he has always been strict, not good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Carlos," Rogge suddenly said: "A thousand Snow Bear Knights are now the main force of the Are. If Dan Luo directs the Snow Bear Knight rebellion, even if I help each other, the Principality is also badly hurt? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos is a matter of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as I know, the Principality of Aray Originally in the Holy Alliance, it was the last small country. If there was another civil strife, what would it be?" Rog asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still use that?" Auntie said, "Is there a few good things in the Holy Alliance? Those kings are old ghosts!" If it is our civil strife, they can't wait to divide the Ayre Principality!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly took a look at Rogge, Jiao smiled: "Not to mention Roger's Elf Guards There are quite a few beautiful girls in the middle. Especially the wind butterfly, it is a beautiful woman I have never seen before! For these elves, the old fellows of the Holy Alliance will not be safe. We are not chaotic, not just gave it. Do they excuse? After stealing these elves, the only thing that will be unlucky because of the resurrection of the devil is the Ayre Principality. They will never have any consequences. So, second brother, you can’t hesitate! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos nodded heavily and said: "I understand! Now I am the heir to the throne. I will find a chance to turn over the guards these days." The Guardian of the House, and then sent me to kill! Master Rogge, when Men expert available to tune a few things that I can not afford to fail ah "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;!! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Rogge product his drink, eyes closed in silence. Auntie gently kneaded his shoulders. Carlos waited for a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a fat man’s mouth, exhaling a light green wine, said: “It’s a good wine! Your Excellency Carlos, actually your current position. It is very advantageous, why should it be so obvious? This will also give the other countries of the Holy Alliance a good mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos hurriedly said, "What should I do?" We can't let the big brother turn over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles and says that you can't hesitate. This matter must be solved, and it must be fast. But we have to change the way. You are now the heir to the throne, and all we have to do is to keep you in this position. In fact, the simplest and most straightforward way is to let you become the Grand Duke of Ade from the heir to the throne! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos was shocked by what you said...the father..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue leisurely : "Dagong is old, he has enjoyed it. He is too old, old and has begun to get confused. If the old man is already confused, what has already been decided, maybe it will suddenly change. But he The decision is still the highest decree of the Principality of Aray. Think about it, if one day he suddenly changed his mind about the heir to the throne..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child is silent. Carlos's face was cloudy and uncertain, and he struggled repeatedly in his heart. He couldn't make up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie yawned and lazily said: "Two brothers, you are still useless! Rogge is right, as long as you are on the Grand Duke You don't have to worry about anything. You don't want to think about it. If the big brother became a grandfather, would you have a good day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos suddenly Drink a glass of wine and throw the glass down on the wall. A guard at the father's side is my confidant. This thing can let him do it. Afterwards, it is! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said coldly: "Not necessary." Dagong is old, but he still has a woman every night. If you are overworked and suddenly you can't do it, it is normal. I will arrange this for this matter. However, Carlos, after you become a Grand Duke, you must hand over all military power to me. There are too many adventurers who want to hit me with these elf ideas. I have to deal with them with the army. If the elves plucked back into the mountains, we would all have to escape before Amuro's resurrection. This is a big event that is going to happen in our country! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos nodded again and again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos is determined to have been down, and Rogge has promised to help, and his heart is very happy. He laughed a few times and went away. He made up his mind that one of the beautiful maids in the palace tonight could not be let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;********************************** *********************************************<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the morning is still not bright, Rogge is already sitting in the study. While eating the breakfast prepared by Ajani, I listened to the report of the Elf messenger. At this time, Auntie is still asleep. Where is Roger's physical strength like Warcraft, she can resist it. Every time she is conquered by Rogge, she always sleeps until she gets to the top of the mountain. During this quiet time, Rogge is used to deal with large and small transactions. As for the people of Frey, the wound on the face is not completely good. It is kept in the room all day, and only the night is willing to come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger listened to the messenger’s report and his face became more and more ugly. He screamed wildly: "There are only 1600 poison arrows? One thousand six hundred? My "dark side of the moon" can only be divided into two arrows per person?! What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf messenger did not dare to rise up on the ground, and replied: "God makes the grown-up, the elders of Hughes say that the rights of the Presbyterian Church have been greatly limited by the temple. Now the weapons and armor workshops have been taken over by the temples. The rules that you have set for the elves to design their own armor styles have also been abolished. The elders of Xius said that the status of the temple is lofty and these decisions are deeply rooted in the spirit of the elves. There is no way for the Presbyterian Church. These arrows are still secretly created by the elders of the Hughes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reluctantly suppressed his anger. I thought about it now and told the elders of Hughes to let him seize the command of the 'dark side of the moon' anyway. After three days, I will return to the city of the gods once. At that time, I will talk to those short-sighted sacrifices! "The last few words, Rogge almost bite his teeth. The elves in the presence are almost all dark moon people, it is Hughes and his absolute confidant, Rogge is not afraid of his disrespect to the temple. Going out. In fact, his disagreement with the temple is already an open secret.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retreat of the elf messenger, Rogge is immersed in contemplation. Only in the study The elves guarded the warriors, and the wind butterfly stood still behind Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge looked up and asked Ajani. : "There is a big event in front of you, you need an elf who is willing to sacrifice himself. What kind of person can you have? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni’s heart suddenly jumped, she whispered: "Rogge, I can do it!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janenie Sister!" Wind Butterfly stepped forward and hugged Ajani and pulled her behind her. "Master Rogge, why do you always want Ajani to sacrifice!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughs, I won't let Ajani go. The guardian warrior is my most precious treasure, and there are still many big things to do in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and slowly walked in the room and never sacrificed any of the elves at will. No one would be allowed to be unnecessary." Sacrifice. Ajani, in front of this matter, as long as an ordinary elf can be. If you go, it will only be a major loss of the elves. Understand? So I want you to provide candidates, not let yourself go This elf woman, as long as the will is firm, and has the determination to sacrifice everything for the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly stares at Rogge, what do you want to say? And endured it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble elves have never lacked the courage to sacrifice, and the elves who will take over this mission are surprisingly many. After seeing these elves, Rogge selected an archer of ‘the dark side of the moon’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days of night, the sky is densely covered with clouds, it is a moonless night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf archer was brought to Rogge's room by Ajani. Rogge was wearing a robe and was reading in the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Elf Archer came in, Rogge put down the book and gently asked: "What is your name?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mei Lan, God makes adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Lan is a middle-aged figure in the elves, but with the eyes of the human race It seems that it is a rare beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
