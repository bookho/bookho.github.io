			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of old and weak women and women ran on the reciprocating mountain road on Longfeng. People panic but not confused, some people fall, and the people next to them will help. Despite the screams coming from behind, as soon as possible, those voices are likely to be the ones they loved, but everyone did not look back and did not cry hysterically. A hundred years of hard life in the mountains has already given everyone a strong heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the crowd of people, Kara Yang is not in a hurry. He had eaten too much bitterness in the mountain, and he almost threw his life on this land. It’s time for him to enjoy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently cut a girl’s throat. This is already the 61st sword he stabbed in this girl. At the fifth sword, the beautiful black panther lost the effect of the metamorphosis and restored it to this girl. It is a pity that she is ugly, and in front of her subordinates, Kara Yang can not enjoy his greatest pleasure. But it doesn't matter, killing is also a good choice. After the sixty swords went down, the girl had completely lost her beautiful body, and Kara Yang finally decided it was time to end his game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should go looking for the next goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, Chrisma and Dess, although they claim to be the divisions, fears and deaths, in fact, they are the nine-order angels who get them in the heavens. Take charge of such an important responsibility? It is in this world that there are only a few figures above them in the Church of Light. The three of them are actually only in the Inquisition in the trial of these three kinds of crimes. The subordinates tried to figure out their intentions and added these three names to them. The three people were willing to accept the resignation and they were glad to accept it. Is it anyway to call inside the Doomsday Judgment? What is the relationship? After a long time, they seem to have some illusions, as if they were in charge of these functions at the time of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Orphee has been awkward, and Augustus has been badly hurt, which has greatly increased their hopes in the early days. And the death of Wella is simply the good news of Tianda. As a light angel in a special battle form, she is obviously unsuccessful in adapting to her new body and encounters the challenge of Rodriguez. The nightmare of the Necromancer and the church for three hundred years has vanished in the light of judgment. Although Kara Yang is arrogant, she also knows that if the Necromancer still exists in the world, he will not be tempted to provoke this character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as this credit is made, the Pope’s old things must at least give Dess the boss a position as deputy head of the Holy Knights. Risma, at least, will be promoted to the deputy presiding judge of the religious trials. Actually, although this task is a little troublesome, but the pope seems to take care of us, let us hunt down the 10th level magician? This is simply a white delivery If the guy is pretty good, just pick him!" Kara Yang turned to the horse's head and sneered at the Druid teenager who was in his teens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the dozens of young Druids who volunteered to stay behind were already ruined. The holy knights have caught up with the tail of the fugitive team and started the massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy knights and law enforcers from Kara Yang and Chris Ma are no strangers to the slaughter, and can even be said to be very familiar. They are very effective in dismembering the elderly, women and even children who are totally resistant. When the first sword goes down, it is always just right to let people lose their ability to act or resist, and it will never be easy to kill. Then they will cut carefully in the non-fatal key parts, and give these pagans as much pain as possible to punish their mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cloud of fog on the mountain road. However, more than half of the villagers have successfully climbed to the summit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang cut down an old man and climbed the summit. For a moment, too much impact made him completely stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After boarding, he was only here, it was just a peak. In front of Kara Yang is a hundred square meters of open space, the other side of the open space is a stone cliff towering hundreds of meters, 10 meters off the cliff, there is a huge hole. The villagers rushed to the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cara Yang did not chase, because in the darkness of the cave, two golden flames are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flame is clearly the eye of a huge creature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang seems to have a cold current in his heart, he instinctively felt the crisis. This is an intuition based on reason, a sense of crisis that has only existed in the face of the most powerful enemy. Kara Yang looked back and saw a calm face of Chris Ma and his men, and they decided to settle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred knights lined up in a neat formation and began to move slowly. The Masters of the Light continually sang the spells, and the knights from time to time showed a variety of brilliance, showing that they had been blessed with magic. They approached the place where the villagers were less than 30 meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cara Yanglang said: "We are knights from the Church of Light, the representative of the Most High God in this world! Now, in the name of the Lord's mercy, I ask you to pay The murderer of the sorcerer and the servant who killed the Lord! Now, I will give you three seconds to consider! If you can't do these two things, I will rule you as a heresy in the name of the Lord, and execute it on the spot! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers under the hole still have sixty or seventy people. They looked at Kara Yang indifferently, ignoring his threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the Dragon Peak, Rogge was properly attached, and the movement under the peak was being observed with the eyes of the wizard. What he can see, *** can also see. Only Gregory could not see anything, and some were anxious. But he can't make it. The same family below it is much stronger than the vanity bone dragon. If it is already seen by it, the three of them must have nothing to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence on the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So!" Kara Yang finally spoke up. "The heretics, ready to bear the wrath of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A deep, huge, majestic voice suddenly sounded: "Humble humans, here, only I am the master who dominates everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Blowing in the square, a huge figure flew out of the cave. The wings that it unfolded were so broad, and for a moment, the squares that were 100 meters apart seemed to be dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure hovered in the air for a week, the bottom of the holy knights to see this, it turned out to be a huge green dragon! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Dragon Trillon Hugh proudly displayed his majestic flight posture in the air, followed by a dive and rushed down to the Holy Knights. When he was still in midair, it opened a huge mouth, accompanied by a resounding dragonfly, and a dark blue breath was overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang's lips floated with a sinister smile. His sword swayed from the bottom up, and a strong arc-shaped sword flew out to the sky. At the same time, Chrisma also swung the sword from the left and right, and the horizontal arc-shaped sword first arrived, catching up with Kara Yang's sword in the air. The two swords merged into one, forming a huge cross-light frame that flew to the green dragon, Trill Hugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters of the Light mourn the same spell in unison, forming a thin protective light curtain above the Holy Knight before the dragon's arrival. The law enforcers greeted the green dragon with different colors of light balls, which is their unique magic to reduce the enemy's protection. And several advanced sacred knights plucked into the rifle and flew into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cross-light frame easily passed through the dragon's breath, printed on the body of Trillen Hugh, and a burst of blue smoke suddenly emerged. It screamed and fell down, almost planted on the ground. It was a bit weak with it, and the unique magic of the law enforcement began to play. Fortunately, the magical protection of the Green Dragon is far beyond these human imaginations. With so much magic, it is only slightly uncomfortable. However, the rifles were not so good, and two of them were directly stabbed in its abdomen. They pierced its hard scales and entered the meat half a foot deep. This is not a problem, but there is a gun stabbed on its fragile right wing, directly penetrating its right wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trilen Hutt finally couldn’t support it. The huge body slanted to the ground and landed in the middle of the villagers, killing more than ten villagers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the chasers of the church also paid a heavy price. The Green Dragon's breath was held in close contact with the shield formed by the Master of Light, and the shroud was completely shattered, covering dozens of holy knights and law enforcers in a green mist. A few superficial skills were immediately unsupportable, and in a moment they were mixed with a highly poisonous and strong acid dragon into a skeleton of blackening. The rest of the people took up the vindictive body and desperately escaped the scope of the dragon's breath. It was just a dozen meters away, and more than a dozen knights fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden blow hit Trilling Hugh and completely angered it. It can't be imagined that these humble humans dare to resist it, and actually hurt its incomparably noble body! It refused to see the pain in the body, roared, and finally stood up. Everyone can see its true face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green dragon wings swayed and easily jumped over a distance of more than ten meters. They fell into the group of sacred knights, swept the giant tail, and swept the two law enforcers with a strong wind; the front paw swung and a holy knight Fell to the ground. The green dragon bit him, and then he slammed it and tore him into two pieces. The blood of the internal organs and the big canopy fell to the ground like rain. The sudden and tragic scene made some of the holy knights stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling sword light lights up again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Karayang people walked with the sword and flew into the sky! Jianguang passed, the green dragon half of the left wing was alive and kicked down! Trillen Hugh was so embarrassed that it turned around with agility that was incompatible with the huge figure, and stared at the perpetrators who were still in midair, and immediately slammed the lightning and hit the Karajan who could not escape. Kara Yang is like a broken kite, and is planted far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the peak, the sneak probe of the Gregory stood up, and he was going to beat the fallen dog. Rogge grabbed its neck and lifted it back and pressed it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is furious, and says that if you look at the master of your master, you will dare to rely on your ten-level little magician. To move the neck of Laozi? It has forgotten that the vanity bone dragon is at least two hundred pounds, and Rogge is as easy as a hen. Where is the performance of a ten-level magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge concentratedly watched the fierce battle between the dragons and the church chasers, and praised: "This dragon is really amazing! Breathing Billy High It is also poisonous, and it has the properties of acid and fire! The defense and magic resistance are too high to say, the movement is also agile, and the rabbits are not a fuel-efficient lamp! Chrisma, this bastard, I really didn't see that he was so powerful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wicked fat man! If you see the noble dragon family, you will know what a really powerful dragon is like! It’s Lao Tzu, I didn’t die, this little green dragon saw me and I have to respect it! From your human point of view, if the dragon is a big aristocrat in the dragon, the green dragon is just a peasant! I want to be in that year...” Gregory said that the longer he was, the more he was prepared to revisit the heroes who had not known how many times he had said it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In the first place, Gregory’s skull smashed a heavy bone spear. This time all his stories were hit back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This green dragon was injured and it was a very serious injury. *** Suddenly said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is it hurt?" "Rogue is excited. The nature of the dragon's wealth is well known. A dragon that is nearly a thousand years old will inevitably accumulate countless treasures in its long life. Now that there are people in the church who are leading the way, and it seems to be evenly matched, so good, When both of you have lost both sides, Roger is ready to come out and take advantage of this big deal, hurting the water dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has injuries on the back and flesh. It was very stubborn when it was out of the hole. Now, it can no longer fly. *** said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory proudly said: "This is the difference between the higher dragons and these lower dragons! When our Demon Dragons are strong enough, the role of the wings is to let them fly with magic, and even some dragons can control gravity! This kind of dragon that can fly by blasting will be laughed at. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! Gregorian licked another *** a bone spear: "You are now on the wings of the wind, it seems that you can't fly." Let's go! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly said: "I understand why this dragon will live with these Druids." It can't fly long distances, so you can't leave your nest too far, and foraging is a problem. No creatures are willing to be neighbors with a dragon? It is really good to have this group of Druids who can control animals. Oh, it’s a smart dragon! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart suddenly moved, and another magic mark in his body jumped. He smiled a little and carefully used the mental power to mark the magic from the body. Moved out and stuck on his magic tracking arrow. He slammed into the cliff with a sneak peek. The dark magic arrow silently turned into the hole, quietly Nailed in the depths of the dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing this, Rogge smiled. "***, do you think the following two parties will win and who will win? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trillen Hugh did gradually gain the upper hand. Although its wings were cut off by Kara Yang and Chris Ma, its defense was too strong, and other knights and law enforcers could not form it. What threats. Carayan and Chrisma did not dare to face its powerful breath. The natural high magic resistance of the dragons makes it basically ignoring magic attacks. And humans fight with a dragon? The result is imaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak has been fighting for a long time, and Kara Yang has more than a dozen of his hands on the mountain. All the Masters of Light and the jungle parade were killed in the breath of Trilition Hugh in the first few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trilen Hught is also not good, the wings on its back are only a short one. Many scales on the body were opened, and the bleeding wounds were blurred. Its movements have been much slower, and the breath has changed from dark blue to pale green. It has a huge wound on the hind leg that can already see the bone. Even when it is slammed, the hind leg is retracted and try not to touch the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its opponents are even worse. Kara Yang has been seriously injured and has been carried out of the battlefield. The last two Masters of Light are constantly putting on him detoxification, healing and recovery. Chrisma is struggling on the battlefield, and only he can give the green dragon Trillen Hugh a real threat. He walked around the green dragon flexibly, and when he got the chance, he inserted it into the gap between the scales with a long sword, and then took the strength to pick it up and peeled it off alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Dragon Trillhuw’s scales are far beyond Chrisma’s expectations, and it’s consuming more than half of them by picking up ten scales in a row. Fighting. He also has hardships. Chrisma's sword technique "backwind" pays attention to skill and degree, but the disadvantage is that there is a slight lack of lethality. In fact, the "anti-wind sword" is enough to easily kill a full-armored heavy cavalry. However, when faced with Trillen Hugh, an opponent with perverted defense, the headwind could not give the green dragon a heavy blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Trillen Hugh’s swift attack, whether it’s breath or bite, is not what Chrisma can afford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, what do you think is the weakness of the dragon?" Rogge asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a noble and powerful dragon have weaknesses? Gregory immediately became dissatisfied. The wind behind his head made it known that the owner was even more dissatisfied with this answer. The bone dragon who knew the current situation immediately changed his tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Although we have no weaknesses in the dragon, but the low-level dragons, such as the Green Dragon, Sea Dragon, Blue Dragon, Red Dragon and even the Black Dragon, have more or less weaknesses. Except for the Black Dragon, which is almost completely immune to magic, like our Demon Dragon, other dragons are affected by some magic. For example, the magic of your human great magician is completely deadly to the green dragon below, and our magic dragon is not affected at all. For example..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory! Say the weakness of this green dragon below! "*** is a little angry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory immediately put away the oil chamber slip, succinctly said: "Any winged dragon, the scales at the root of the wing Both are small and thin. Since this green dragon has been injured, and the back is the back and the dragon wing, its old wound is a weakness. Hey! Master, I am not interested in nonsense! Since you already know that this dragon's abdominal protection will be worse. Also, the green dragon's magical defense is general, and Rogge's master can use magic to put it to death..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's face is red, this self-knowledge He still has it. With his magical power, he also wants to kill the dragon. It’s almost like a dragon egg.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The green dragon will be particularly soft in some places, such as Said eyes, anus, under the jaw. In fact, this little dragon, I really didn't put it in my eyes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the Green Dragon have any special fear of magic? Or is it a special attribute? Asked Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Green Dragon? They are generally sour dragons, and the melee ability is also average. The strength is inferior in the dragons. But it seems that there is nothing particularly scary. Gregory struggled to reflect on previous knowledge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following battles have become extremely fierce. The last Master of Light gave Kara to the cost of his life. Yang Shi exhibited advanced recovery. Kara Yang's face was obviously rosy, the wounds no longer bleed, and the new granules grew out with the naked eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Chris Ma has already called for bitterness. Every time he is hit by a green dragon, he feels like he is being stepped on by a group of galloping elephants. His vindictiveness is rapidly consumed. If Kara Yang is exhausted before he recovers, all the holy knights will sleep on this mountain. He regretted it. If he knew that this green dragon was so powerful, he would not be positive against it. His swordsmanship is too delicate, power is not enough, it is difficult to open the scales of the sturdy steel of Trillen Hugh, and only Karajana's powerful sword skill "斩云" can truly break the defensive power of the green dragon. It’s just that during the heyday of Kara Yang, he could only make four memories, and at the moment he recovered from the healing magic, but he could also throw a few swords and clouds? How many more clouds can you kill this green dragon? Chrisma doesn't want to think anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sacred knight couldn’t escape, and Trillen Hugh, who was rushed straight, slammed into the air, like a broken kite. The green dragon rushed to the height of ten meters, caught up with the knight in midair, and bit him into two. Only ten knights are still fighting, and all the bright mages and law enforcers are in a pool of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft curse sounds on the battlefield, using a solemn, mysterious language. Chrisma knows that this is a prayer prayer for angels to improve their strength. However, it is very cumbersome to use, and the time is short. After the prayer effect, the combat power will drop sharply, so they are not used often. Chrisma has been fighting with the green dragon, no time to pray, is to pray, the anti-wind force is still not enough to break the green dragon's defense. His current task is to entangle the green dragon, so that Karayang will come out of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the name of my lord, give me the supreme power; in the name of my lord, give me the glory of the supreme..." Kara Yang continually prayed The body gradually glowed with golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Kara Yang’s prayer, *** suddenly trembled. She listened attentively to every note of this prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma raises the last vindictiveness and fights with the Green Dragon. The proud Trill Hull also had to admit that the sacred knight's sword skills are superb and versatile. It’s just that he just restrains his strengths and makes the battle so one-sided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden brightening on the battlefield, and Kara Yang’s hand seemed to have a rising sun, and it’s shining in the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden flame tumbling out of the sun, lightning hitting Trillen Hugh! The green dragon screamed and fell to the ground, rolling up extremely painfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-meter-high, 15-meter-long behemoth is tumbling over the ground. What a horrible picture? The four holy knights and dozens of villagers who were crushed at least experienced their lives more or less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma took the opportunity to get out of the battlefield and lifted Karajan, who had gone all out, and fled to the cliff, and the Emperor fled. He knows that Kara Yang's sword has hit the Green Dragon, but it is only a heavy blow, far from being fatal. It is a fool to escape at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoge’s eye-opener is that Chrisma is still busy sneaking while running, kicking five long swords and stabbing several villagers. It’s a bit of a bad breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining sacred knights also want to escape, but the mighty Trillen Hugh has recovered from the pain. It held the passage on the edge of the cliff and looked at a few helpless knights coldly. Karajan's sword left a deep wound of one meter long on the ventral side, and the light blue blood was constantly flowing out of the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid humans! How dare you hurt me so much! Today, I will let go of my identity and pride, and entertain you with horror and despair!" Green The dragon is almost roaring out of the trial declaration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It easily knocked down a few knights, shredding them bit by bit with the slowest degree and the finest detail it can achieve. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared coldly at Karajan and Chrisma, who were constantly fleeing, and the light in his eyes became colder and colder. He sneered a little and was ready to follow. In the past, he added *** and Bone Dragon is not an opponent of an adventing angel, but now it is different, and he is seriously injured, exhausted, and has a poisonous adventurous angel. He is not afraid of a few more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge seems to see it again, in the fire, the beauty of the greatness of Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
