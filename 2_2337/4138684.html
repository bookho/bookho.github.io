			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the city of Lille and even the entire Rhine League are already undercurrent, on the surface, the city is still peaceful and prosperous. The ‘God of the Gods’ has been rooted in this impetuous and luxurious city for a short time, and ‘the old fairy spring’ has become a topic that the nobles must talk about every time. The affiliation of the third ‘no old fairy spring’ is even more remarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Hammer of the God of War' will secretly auction ‘不老仙泉’, and the news of the high price has spread throughout the aristocratic society with astonishing degree. The charm and vitality of rumors have once again been proved. It is said that this third ‘the Lord of the Rings’ can greatly increase the chances of conceiving a woman in addition to the miraculous effects of aphrodisiac. In addition, there are various benefits such as rejuvenation and physical fitness. There are also people who have vowed to declare that this ring of magic has sealed the devil power from the mysterious Eastern world, which can make men absorb the essence of women's life in bed. According to another news circulated from the killer organization, the ring can extract energy from it and automatically attach a protective shield to the main person, so the holder can rest assured that he can be happy without fear of being assassinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge arrives at the 'Knight of War,' there are not many guests in the store, but here you can see the most respected people in Lille. . The guests were in the hall in twos and threes, and most people knew each other. There are acquaintances in the guests, and they will say hello to each other very elegantly. There is no way, the *** of the upper aristocracy is so small. If a big aristocrat or a wealthy businessman who has status status recently has not turned to the ‘God of the Gods’, he will be afraid of being misunderstood as having no financial resources for shopping. Of course, there are always a few giants who don’t have to prove themselves in this way. However, being able to go upstairs to the ‘God of the Warrior’ is just the right stage for these giants to show their superiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'God's Hammer' will be clothed with a new product every week, according to the price of 'God's Hammer', this new product is not fast or slow. . In fact, this is already the limit of Fiss. Every time a new product is clothed, customers who have the strength to shop in the ‘God of the Gods’ will gather. Of course, nine of the ten people will not buy it, just show that they have the strength to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sneaked into the store from the back door and slammed a few oily hands on the pretty female clerk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate and Franco are already sitting in the small tea room on the top floor. On the Fifth Avenue, which is inch by inch, this small tea room of more than ten square meters is the office and conference room of several aristocratic youths. The largest room and the best orientation are left to make a VIP reception room. The last large, beautiful room on the third floor gave the old fog a lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning is generally not to see Rens, this is his professional characteristics. Lens has worked hard recently and has worked hard on thieves. According to him, it was to get the dragon out of his mouse hole at an early date. In fact, everyone knows that at least part of the reason is that they can go to the heavily guarded aristocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them negotiated for a while and set aside the gifts needed to visit the bishop in the evening. They were all ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day passed quickly. The afterglow of the setting sun will have a little bustling feeling in the small garden of the monastery of Gennad Hart. Unfortunately, several people in the study have no interest in appreciation. Kate, Franco and Rogge are screaming around Bishop Hart, and very euphemistically expressed the hope that Bishop Hart would introduce the three to the Archbishop of Burke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart squinted and was complacently immersed in the tide. He hasn't enjoyed this kind of arrogance for a long time. These flatterings are not indiscriminately touted. The rare thing is that the words are simple and unpretentious, and the feelings are sincere and enthusiastic. When the three people taught the adults to debut, almost every piece of Hart’s small achievements will be raised, and the comments will be explained in detail. It is also difficult for the three to turn it out of many trivial old memories. Naturally, many of them do not belong to the bishop's merits, and they are all counted on the head of Hart. For these small omissions, the bishops are broad-minded and naturally do not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy wrap-around bag is leaping together in the hands of Bishop Hart. Every landing will sound the sound of gold coins colliding. Bishop Hart’s eyes were all laughing, and when the three men’s assaults came to an end, he said: “When I received the church’s canon, I saw that several of your future must contribute to the glory of spreading God. Praise the omnipotent God, who brought you to the Church of Light in the most difficult times of the Rhine District. I believe that you are the most faithful believers of the Most High God, and I should recommend the talents of yours to Burke. Archbishop of Red! But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man did not hesitate, he handed this small bag of gems. Hart smiled open, opened his pocket, carefully played for a while, and smiled: "The quality of these gemstones is really good. It seems to be worth at least five thousand gold coins! Are these really for the old man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and said: "This is a little dedication to my supreme god. The bishop is the messenger of the Most High God, the communicator of glory, these dedications should be handed over to you. It’s the rule!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of Hart struggled to move the slightly bloated body in the chair and put the jewel in the palm into a small pocket. in. He touched the beard with some gems, but it is not a common item. Is it afraid to use it as a raw material for magic equipment? Have you seen my shabby house, do you think that a thousand gold coins are a huge sum for me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger and others listened to this and immediately became flushed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart Bishop Looked at their expressions and smiled: "Don't be so nervous! A thousand gold coins are indeed a huge sum for my old man. The cost of my broken yard for a year is only four hundred gold coins. Since you have been thinking about it for so long, I still have to go to my door, and I have not voted for the righteous Griffin Bishop or Taylor. I can't let you down. I will accept this thousand gold coins, gems, you still take it back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco thought that Bishop Hart was still doing his own gesture, and quickly advised a few words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bishop Hart, with a few beards on his chin, said with a smile: "I have served the Supreme God for more than 30 years, and the time to sit on the seat of the bishop is not short." As for my divine power, hey, you can see very clearly that it is an eight-level priest. What has been the ups and downs of these decades is that Griffin and Taylor have been unable to get me down. What is the reason? In fact, there is nothing else, that is, this person is not greedy, has self-knowledge, knows how much his appetite is, eats enough, does not think about things that can't be eaten and can't be digested. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Over the years, the old man has seen many young talents, talented and powerful. They are very smart and very ambitious. But they fell down one by one, and I haven’t had a long time for me to be old. It’s because I’m too anxious. Like a strong shepherd dog, all sheep are afraid of it, so it really thinks that it is extremely strong, go out and challenge the wolves. The old man knew how powerful his strength was, so he chose to stay in the flock and rely on the strength of other shepherds and shepherds to defend against the wolves before they lived to the present. So people, you have to know what you can do, what to do, how long your hand can stretch. Always looking at and thinking about things that don't belong to you, one day, you will forget to look at the road under your feet and walk to the cliff. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot Bishop stood up and placed the jewel pocket on Rogge’s hand and said: "These gems are related to the business of the 'God of War.' You still take it back. The ‘God of the God of War’ has prospered, and the old man is relieved to receive some dedication. As for the Archbishop of Burke, there is an opportunity in front of him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock and others immediately extended their ears, for fear of missing every word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha Extraordinarily said: "The Archbishop Burke has had a lot of disappointments in the past year, so he wants to order a new crown and turn a gas and mood. The Griffin and Taylor Bishop had already taken this task half a month ago. The old man did not dare to take this task because he had no suitable candidates. Since you have come, it is perfect. The Burke Church pays a deposit of 10,000 gold coins. If the crown is selected, the difference will be filled. However, Lord Burke’s life is clear, I am afraid I can’t afford the magical crown that is too expensive... Do you understand what I mean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who are all in the air, and can't hear Hart's words?<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hart Master" Rogge asked, "I don't know what Bishop Burke likes." For example, style, color, and, are there any types of gems that you particularly like? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the hobby of the Archbishop of Burke, several aristocratic youths are coming immediately, and the beginnings of the slogan begin to sneak into the bottom. They all dig deeper. The attitude towards Bishop Hart has become intimate, just like he has known for more than ten years, making Hart laugh and cry, deeply admire the cheeky of several people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Gonard Hart smiled and said: "I have been with the Archbishop of Burke for too long. I can think of something that Burke can guess. come out. It is you, maybe you can give the Archbishop of Red and I a surprise. Come, don't worry, I will tell you the life story of the Archbishop of Red, and see what you can understand. Housekeeper, butler! Get ready for the night of four people! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything went smoothly, and he quietly gave birth to a hint of arrogance, and felt that many people in high positions were no different. It was possible to meet with Hart Bishop, but let him have a few cold sweats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This old guy is really making him cheated. It seems that these old guys, which one is not simple, really think, which A person will easily get the position of today? More or less will always be somewhat extraordinary. Be careful when you are a man. Be careful. The hammer of the gods is too swayed? At the same time, I was tempted to go back to my small building and rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the next two days, several aristocratic youths gathered together with Fog and Firth to figure out the thoughts of Bishop Burke. Two days later, Bishop Hart sent 10,000 gold coins and a request for a custom-made crown. Bishop Hart also personally sent a ruby ​​with almost the size of the egg and the texture. Looking at this meaningful gem, Rogge was immersed in contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hard day, Rogge went to the Grand Duke to visit Orphee Roger, and a deep talk finally made Rogge set his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten days and nights of work, the preliminary completion of the crown was brought to the Grand Duke by these aristocrats, and Orpheq personally cast high-level sacred spells' The Light of the Holy Land has completed the magic blessing of the crown. This work is only available to Orphey Roque. As a paladin, Orphee can cast a sixth-order magic, which is also due to his birth in the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the last modification of the fog, the crown was finally completed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cathedral of St. James in Lille is one of the 19 Great Shrines of the Bright Church and the home of the Archbishop of Burke. As the cathedral is located in the city of Lille, only one hundred Knights of the Temple are stationed symbolically. In a partial hall of the cathedral, the Archbishop of Burke closed the two extremely elegant boxes in his hand and sighed with satisfaction. Griffin and Taylor are smart and strong, young and promising, and they work closely with their own minds, far from Hart's old-fashioned Hart. This time, the two crowns they presented were noble and gorgeous, and the materials used were extremely elegant. The inlaid gems were worth at least 30,000 gold coins. It’s a real problem to say which one you like better. The tall and thick Griffin and the mighty Taylor were standing next to each other, and quietly observed Burke's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shrine knight came in, "Berke adult! Bishop Gonard Hart wants to see you!" Hart has not been pampered in recent years. Fin and Taylor directly met Burke, and they needed Burke to be able to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke stunned. I didn’t expect this Hart to get the crown so quickly. Wouldn’t it be a good thing to come? Thinking of this, the Cardinal is somewhat interested. Griffin and Taylor looked at each other and their eyes seemed to spark in the air. Burke looked at everything and waved his hand and let them all fall back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gonard Hart entered the eccentric hall under the leadership of the Knights of the Temple. Rogge, Kate and Franco followed, and Kate held a big box with no humble eyes. Bishop Hart took a step forward and whispered: "Berke, please look at the crown that was commissioned by the 'God of the Gods'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Berke was not willing to sweep the box in the corner of his eye, and listened to the word 'God of War', only to mention some interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge secretly looked to Bishop Burke. Burke was tall and draped in a deep red robe. The cross embroidered by the Mithril line shimmered in the candlelight. His long, short roots were erect and trimmed very neatly. The lines on the bishop's face are resolute, and the care of the short beards adds a bit of dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke is extremely powerful, standing in this small eccentric hall, it seems that there is a trace of light from the body from time to time. Rogge’s heart was uneasy, and Burke’s sacred breath was shot from time to time, and it was a huge pain. Fat people can't, can only bear it. I thought that I would endure this time, and I will be better off in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Hart’s gesture, Kate strode forward and half-baked his hands on the box. Burke felt the sacred breath in the box, and couldn't help but change his face. He took a step, opened the box, and a milky white light rose to the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g sucked a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crown is high and low, and it is composed of red and gold. The base is the fox fur of the best magic flame. Four circles of rimmed gold are pan-purple, and Burke is a person who knows the goods. He knows that this gold is produced from the glazed gold in the Western Hills, and has a strong effect of adding light to the gods. Only a variety of rubies are embedded in the entire crown. In the middle of the crown is an oval-shaped ruby ​​with an egg size and blood red. A looming light can't stop moving in the gems. I don't know what magic is being blessed inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these are not to make Burke so rude. What really makes Burke ruin is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach the crown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crown is actually a top crown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke’s look changed, and the big drops of sweat couldn’t stop. Suddenly his power increased sharply, and he was surrounded by the light. He said, "What do you want to do when you do this thing!" Although the sound is so strong, the sound is deliberately depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnard Hart slammed down, tears and cried, "The old minister is incompetent, following you over the years, no credit has been built." Burke’s life spreads to the gospel of the High God. You are the embodiment of God in this troubled world. Although the veteran is unbearable, there is still a small eye. These people are extremely admired by the adult, and willing to work with the old minister. Follow the Burke adults and spread the glory of God throughout the Big 6!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate, Rogge, and Franco also fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke’s look is uncertain, and the sacred ball that hangs in his hands is also flickering. In the field, you can only hear the heartbeat of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally his look gradually eased, and the light of his body slowly faded. He sighed a special ah, Hart, you have been cautious in your life, how come this time is so impulsive! These are the people who founded the ‘God of the God of War’. It’s really good, it’s good! It is indeed a talent! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop of Gennad Hart introduced Rogge and others to Burke. When it was Rogge, Burke took a picture. Cross, click on Rogge's forehead to show his blessing. Rogge was so excited that his tears rolled down. Burke was moved, but he didn't know that the fat man had other difficulties.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This damn sacred magic! It’s so painful to go back, you must practice the shield! My shield! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the shackles of everyone, Burke slowly put on the crown of the top, and his hands were slightly trembling.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach the crown just brought, a holy light rises to the sky, and Burke's own divine power stirs each other. For a time, the holy song echoes in the small hall, and the holy light forms a white The light belt, which circulates around Burke. The flowers of various colors are always appearing in the light. There is a child-like little angel who appears in the light of the light and dances around Burke for a week before it disappears.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birk in the hymn is as majestic as the gods on the earth!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart is busy offering a silver mirror Burke carefully looked at himself in the mirror, and his manner became more sacred and solemn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the hymn gradually disappeared, and the light gradually disappeared. Burke took the crown and was quite reluctant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate quickly stepped forward and presented a rich and luxurious box. It is also a crown of law, with gold inlaid jade, quite cheesy. Bishop Hart whispered: "Berke adults, this crown..." Burke nodded and gestured. Bishop Hart observed and observed Luo. Gege and others retire, let Burke alone to play the top of the crown.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another day, Burke summoned the parish meeting in St. James's Cathedral In addition to the church clergy, various secular celebrities are invited, and even Rogge and others are invited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The main hall of St. James's Cathedral is magnificent, and hundreds of people sit in the temple without any crowds. The bright sunshine shines on the altar through the stained glass at the top of the church, reflecting the three crowns on the altar. In the choir's singer's voice, Burke led everyone to complete prayers and confession.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burke then took the middle of the crown, facing The clerics and secular celebrities in the hall announced: "This crown is from now on. After the law is to carry on crown bright Bavarian parish church cardinals! May the glory of God be with us! Bishop Taylor! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor couldn’t suppress the excitement and smugness on his face, looked at the bishop of Griffin, and the annoyed Bishop Hart, on the fast pace. Before, he was in front of the Archbishop of Burke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berke’s solemn voice is like passing from the sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The holy water poured out from the golden holy grail and sprinkled on Taylor's shoulder. Taylor fell on the ground and excitedly shook. This time I finally defeated the old rival Griffin Bishop! Burke’s age is high. When he retreats, is the position of the archbishop of red, not his own in the palm of his hand? I don’t miss the 50,000 gold coins that I have pulled out of my pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Taylor retired, Burke announced that Knights Rogge, Kate, Franco and Lens had made important contributions to the Church of Light and had been committed to spreading God's glory, sincerely return to the church; hereby declare that the area of ​​the Reselesburg region will be a sub-diocese, will set up a church; awarded the title of Rogge, Franco and Rens, and authorized Rogge to form a guardian sacred knight in the division. To resist the harassment of pagans. Bishop Gennad Hart will travel to the parish of Sellesborg to take charge of everything about the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Kate is already a guardian knight, there is no separate reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Temple is the first armed force owned by the Holy See. Its full responsibility is to protect the safety of shrines and churches everywhere. The outstanding knights of the Knights of the Temple will be awarded the title of Glorious Knight, and when the knight's personal strength is strong enough, he will have the opportunity to become a Templar. The Templars have the supreme glory in the church. Their main duties are to command the various armed forces of the Holy See and to study the martial arts. Orphey is the youngest of the seven sacred knights in the Holy See. One. The Templars will also serve as important members of the Holy See. For example, the ‘blood angel’ Augustus, who is in the Templars, is the head of the Knights Templar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two decades, as the power of the Guangming Church has expanded, the industries, land, and wealth of the various parishes have also expanded dramatically. In order to protect the interests of the Holy See in the secular world, the Holy See began to authorize the various parishes to establish secular armed forces: the Knights of the Guard. The leader of the Guardian Knights will be awarded the title of 'Guardian Knight'. According to tradition, the Templars always reserve a position for the guardian knight. The guardian knight can be a real job or just a virtual title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This result is beyond the expectation of Rogge, originally he just expected to get a short title of the guardian knight, mixed with the name of the bright church. I didn't expect Burke to list his territory as a parish and authorized him to form a holy knight! This is the real power, far from the virtual title of several guardian knights! Not only can he establish the power that is actually attributed to himself, but this power is still the church's one! Confronting with Rogge is the opposite of the Church of Light. It is tantamount to finding a dead end with the bright church with 10 million believers, 50,000 knights, and countless bright masters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog trotting all the way, finally mixed into this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneaked a glimpse of Bishop Hart, the face of the bishop is still so vulgar and ordinary. Unconscious, Bishop Hart smiled at Rogge with encouragement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the acceptance of holy water baptism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain is still painful. But this time, the fat man feels sore and really comfortable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officrock and David are both sitting in the first row. David is obviously very surprised by the result. He turned his head and whispered to Orpheco: "Ophrey Roque, your subordinates are really talented, and there are always people who can have surprises. Your knowledgeable person. I really admire, don't hesitate the title of 'Golden Lion'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officoch smiled gracefully and whispered back: "Speaking of subordinates Talent, isn’t there a lot of talents around David? Not to mention that your brothers have also inherited the pure blood of Rohsio’s Grand Duke, and they are all extraordinary. To say, I want to envy you.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so acclaimed! Right, why didn't you see Miss Elysses? This solemn and sacred occasion is the time when she showed her brilliance! Is it true? Will she still feel uncomfortable?" David asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is indeed a little uncomfortable today, and there is a concern for Dr. David. But the driver and the Princess Froya’s car heard that they will come again in a week. Lille City. In such a short period of time, 'back and forth' rushed so far, it is really hard to make a brother, don't be tired." Orphee Roker replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it comes to Shedie and the princess, I understand that Miss Elysses is uncomfortable. Oh, the golden lion has problems that can’t be solved. But Orphey is assured that the younger brother will "take care of" the princess for you!" David did not relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
