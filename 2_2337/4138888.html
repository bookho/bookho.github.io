			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crime and Punishment Volume 15 Dusk Twelve Chapters<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death Class Slow Enter the room, close the door of the terrace, and block the whistling wind from outside. However, the temperature in the room is much lower than the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feng Yue adults, long time no see." Death class smiled and said: "You come to a retired old man like me, I am afraid I don't just want to have a cup of tea." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and said: "In fact, you can do it yourself, why use such a big battle."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class completely did not feel a little breath of life from the three followers behind Feng Yue. When he closed the door, he secretly sent out three rumors to detect the vindictiveness, but as soon as he was close to three mysterious characters, he was swallowed up by the darkness that extended from their black robes. From then on, like a sinking sea, no more Message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class is speechless, only a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most basic skill of the killer is observation. The most important thing in observation is to observe and detect the strength of the enemy. The Death Class has found that any of these three mysterious guys may have no strength in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, there is a windy month in the room? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is cold and cold: "You are retiring now, don't you think it is too early? I can extend your life if you are not attached to pure human form." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class, while preparing for the cup of black tea that he had planned for a long time, slowly replied: "I am not attached to life." The long life is just a heavy burden for me. I really like the present life, relying on the meager savings to live a simple life, sunning the sun every day and seeing the lake. When the weather is cold, it is by the hearth or poetry. Occasionally, I can go to the pub for a drink. The peace here can make me forget the dark world, away from the memories of the past. Waiting quietly for the arrival of death. Now, this is my only purpose of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class did not allow the wind to sit, because the wind never sat down. He also did not prepare tea for the wind and three mysterious people, they did not seem to need such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" One of the mysterious people asked, his voice was extremely low, hoarse and vague: "What are these?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached for the wall next to him. A faint black spread quickly spread across the entire wall, and the brick wall collapsed silently. Exposed a secret room behind. The Death Class noticed that a dark black armor glove was revealed from the sleeves of his large robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pupil of the Death Class has shrunk slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bright magical light in the Chamber of Secrets, which illuminates the various weapons, armor, and exotic magical items. These magical equipments are the treasures of the Death Class and are his greatest hobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon handed a trick, a fine sword in the middle flew to her palm. This is the fine sword that the Death Class has been wearing. The sword body is surrounded by a light gray mist. If you look closely at the blade, you will find that there are countless subtle lines of silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class just put the cup on the mouth and stayed still. He couldn't help but tremble with his teacup and quickly hit his teeth. However, he was unaware of it, just staring at the hand of Fengyue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue left hand holding the sword hilt, the right index finger on the sword front, gently stroking, the sharp edge of the blade can not hurt That soft and watery fingers are half-divided! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue fiber refers to the place. The hazy fog was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magical attributes on the sword, it was so wiped out by the wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class was gray and trembled, watching the sword that accompanied him for more than 30 years. When he was in the blue veins, he appeared in the moment, but in the end he just sighed and sighed. In an instant, the death class is as old as ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Fengyue’s finger, at least wiped out the true value of this sword by 70%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, another mysterious man has been slowly hanging open his hands on his chest, and only a deep darkness can be seen in the wide sleeves. The winds of the chilly winds rushed out of the sleeves of the robes. Although the Death Class is not as good as the Undead Mage, it can see the eyes of the soul, but he is also a strong sage. At this moment, you can tell that there are countless souls. Fly out of the cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon pointed out that the volley was a little bit, and the souls gathered in front of her fingertips to form a silver stream of light. Fengyue pulled the silver light stream with his fingertips. Write a complicated demon in the air. The silver light forms the symbol once the book is written. A layer of purple-blue radiance emerges like a tulle on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refers to the flying, one after another composed of silver light flow, the magic symbol is formed in the air. Azure, earth yellow, rose red ... all kinds of colors wrapped them in turn, the last one has a total of twelve magic symbols, slowly flying around the wind and the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every piece of magic symbol exudes a different atmosphere, representing a unique power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class slammed the shock in the heart and carefully distinguished the breath of these magical symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve magical symbols, representing weakness, aging, slowness, dimness, fatigue, poisoning, illusion, artifacts, confusion, violent, breaking the law And the twelve negative states of armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right index finger of Fengyue once again stroking on the sword of the fine sword, exudes khaki radiance, representing the slow magical symbol seems to be drawn by an invisible force , falling on the sword of the fine sword. With a bang, the fine sword suddenly trembled, and the whole body began to shine with a very pale khaki. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class suddenly stood up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be afraid to believe what happened in front of him, first closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and then opened his eyes. His gaze, since then, can no longer be separated from the sleek sleek sleek sword in the hands of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is completely dark, the room has no lights, only eleven magic charms and fine swords exude a touch of light in twelve different colors, reflecting the death class The face is flickering. Fengyue and the three mysterious people are like the darkness. The middle of the room, only the sword stood proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, the Death Class finally took his eyes off the fine sword and swept through the eleven magic charms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this sword..." The voice of the class was extremely dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will soon have a new name." The wind and the moon are faint, then added: "If I want to..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the name?" The Death Class is extremely nervous, and there are some unbelievable expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon slowly said: "Twilight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...12 movements!? Impossible! This is never possible!" The Death Class cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve twilight movements, the legendary weapon of the dark world. The darkness that has always been hidden only in the darkness. This unskilled short sword is said to have made every blow, and its victims have to be tested in twelve negative states at the same time. If the strongest of the peak of the sorghum power is or is special. At the same time, the chances of resisting twelve different negative energy damages are almost zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the tyrannical existence is stabbed several times by the twelfth movement of the twilight, even if it is only scratching the epidermis, it will become weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelfth twilight movement is the gift of every killer dream in the dark world. But this short sword has not been revealed for nearly a hundred years, and there are rumors that it is too fierce to anger the heavens. Has been destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, the twelfth movement of the twilight, how can each of these killer dreams be reproduced so easily in the hands of the wind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class eyes received back from the fine sword and greeted the silver eyes of Fengyue. He is wondering, what is the existence of Fengyue? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class is filled with fanatical eyes and looks at the eleven magical symbols that are still floating in the sky. Just want to return the sword to the wind. When I thought that the wind and moon would not be picked up, Ren Jianjian fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has one left hand, and the remaining eleven magic charms have fallen into the palm of the white, like snow into the warm water, dissolved into the almost transparent skin Inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." The Death Class is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have branded the twilight prologue on the sword and counted as compensation for the disturbing class. We will leave." The wind is faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class remembers the phrase ‘if I want to...’ that Feng Yue just said. He sat down, holding his head in his hands and clutching his hair indiscriminately. In a twinkling of an eye, he jumped up again and walked around in the room with a restlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class tried not to look at the fine sword that was inserted on the ground. However, his eyes always involuntarily fall on the blade of the radiant radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are twelve kinds of light on the sword. What a glorious scene that should be... The Death Class is thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately concealed his ignorance, when the twelve movements were played. All the worldly glory will be condensed, and the fine sword will fall into absolute darkness and will not reflect any light. It is the sword-bearing person, and he can only grasp the shape of the blade by his own feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Moon! You... Good! Counting you! You say, how are you going to let the twelve movements be heard?" Bloodshot has begun to appear in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the wind seems to have a smug smile, she is not in a hurry: "Great music has always been with time. So every month, I I will recall a piece of music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class continues to pacing silently, but this time he is like a headless fly, hitting the east, touching the west . He suddenly set himself, staring at the wind and moon, gnashing his teeth and said: "Good! I am not retired, I am selling for you! Is it not eleven months, I recognize!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve months." Feng Yuedao, "If you want the rest of the music, then the first chapter will be counted as one month. Of course, the class, you can continue after receiving a few movements. You are retiring. In that case, you will have a lot of power in your sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class snorted heavily. Legend has it that when the twelve twilight movements are sung in the same breath, there will be more powerful additional abilities. However, this ability is something that no one can say clearly. Even if there is no extra function in the twelve movements, he will not tolerate the loss of a piece of music with his passionate love for artifacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class puts the slash in the waist, like a gray shadow, wandering around the small building, and then appearing in front of the wind, he The usual dress has been restored. Holding a slap in the hand, hate the earth: "I am ready. Can go! Where are we going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is faint, Gradually hidden into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious man in a black robe slowly sounds like a metal strike: "We will take you to the next destination, where we will The wind meets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sky, the peaks and the clouds, the scenery above the high clouds is still so monotonous. The sacred dragon Gregory is following the wind and the moon to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It raises the speed as much as possible to keep it close to its own limit. Although Gregory's power is not good. But its speed is already very fast, at least not to make Feng Yue angry. However, the long flight is really boring, and the scenery around the body is really unremarkable. After I couldn’t stand the loneliness of Gregory, I finally found the right topic, so I asked: "Master, how do I feel that the blessing of the twilight movement should not be a simple process? Is it every addition? In a chapter, will the difficulty increase?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Double."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ligaoli immediately came to the spirit and was able to find a suitable inferior point. Sometimes relying on luck, sometimes using wisdom: "Master! You are so great! When the twelfth movement of the twilight is added to the last chapter, it is a work that only God can do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was stunned by this head-on blow. He couldn't help but ask: "But... what should I do in the Death Class?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Snorted. Cold and authentic: "Take him! Let's use it for a few months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is still heavy lead gray, large swaths of snow from the bleak sky Rotating and falling, endless, endless, as if to continue to the end of the world. There were no pedestrians on the street, and the thick snow flakes accumulated on the ground quickly, giving a happy "sand" sound. However, the winter in the north is cold and harsh, and it can only shake the prestige of the poor. At this moment on this snowy night, one of the most luxurious homes in the city of Schilde is ablaze, and the magical device for heating in the basement is fully activated. From the lobby to the inner room. The whole house is steaming and warm as spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Achilles is so arrogant!" Rogge looked extremely angry. I patted the edge of the bath and stunned the young maid who was massaging him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is just a little stronger, but you are the angel who serves the Lord God. How much brilliance in heaven is from your wings! If you are Mastering the kingdom of a country in the world, then Achilles is just a soldier with more strength. How can he be so arrogant to you?" Rogge was indignant, and finally did not forget to add: "I see the church. People's beliefs are not pious enough. They only know that they are divided according to their strength. They simply cannot see who is the angel who is really close to the supreme god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baths with more than one bath occupy half of the room, and are carved into a leaf shape with a whole piece of bluestone produced in Alang Mountain. At the other end of the large bath, Macbeth is also immersed in hot water, and his muscular body on the water is perfect, completely different from Rogge's chubby body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth looked up and looked at the ceiling through the smog of water, as if he had not heard of Rogge’s provocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Macbeth closed his eyes and said slowly: "The power of Achilles is not only stronger, you can't understand him." Powerful. Those in the church are not incompetent. At least both the Pope and Augustus have seen the power gap between me and Achilles, and they also know that the mission will come from Achilles. Finished, and I, just as an aid. So they are not wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not agree: "The light angel is just a few Only powerful guys, how can they compare with your wisdom, nobleness, and holiness? Even from the ranks of heaven, you are far higher than the angel of light. Oh, unfortunately in this world, power determines Everything. So the church will be so cold that you will be so cold. Even if you are only assisting... No, you should supervise Achilles. Church guys shouldn’t give you a follower! They can have tens of thousands of sacred Knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; Macbeth snorted and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gave a wink. Two glamorous maids behind Macbeth would like to know. They removed the large bath towel wrapped around them, and slipped into the big bath from the left and right. They put the elastic ** on the body of Macbeth, and the two pairs of hands that massaged him quietly. Did not enter the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth is like a statue, motionless. After a long time, he spit out a sigh of relief. Open your eyes. The blue-gray eyes are clear and transparent, and you can't see any yu fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s heart was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth brows slightly wrinkled. Dao: "The human body is really endless. It is no wonder that those low-level angels will fall down one by one. You two go out, I don't need these." Two maids wrapped around him, but Macbeth There is an unquestionable majesty in the voice, so they rushed to put on their clothes and retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth took another look at the maid who was wrapped around Rogge like a water snake, frowning: "You go out too!" The maid did not dare to disobey. I have to rush back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe White: "Rogge, if you want the magic to progress faster, you must restrain the body's **. Although the human body has potential, But the corresponding ** is too strong. It is because you can't get rid of the shackles of **, so there will be so few powerful people in your middle. Otherwise, how can there be only so few strong people in the number of human beings now? , Sanctuary. This level of power can actually be admired by thousands of people? It’s ridiculous!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth was not moved by Rogge's ass, he continued: "You have arranged for me these days, so I have a full understanding of this physical **. Rogge, you prove again Your own body. Although your body is subordinate to darkness and death, you believe in light. The world's understanding of power is superficial. They only know that the divine power will automatically fight against the negative forces such as darkness and death. In fact, it originates from heaven. How can the divine power of the earth be so rough and simple? The divine power is the power above all else. It can not only coexist with the darkness, but also turn the darkness into light. Rogge, do you understand, as long as you are religious to the supreme god, The Necromancer is not a no return. But if you are still immersed in the ** of the ** as you are now, then you have to wait for the redemption of the heavens. When I return to heaven, I will arrange your salvation. Before redemption, you'd better try to improve your strength so that after the redemption is completed, you will get more brilliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Redemption! how Listen to the word ah! "Rogge amazed. But his mood turned low and he sighed: "But. My body is full of evil power, will I be redeemed in heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth looked at Rogge: "Your strength does not come from the gods of darkness, so don't worry. If you can completely transform yourself into a sacred attribute before the redemption of heaven, then I can guarantee that in the Flemish Within the scope of the light, there will be a place for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart trembles, knows the machine, and immediately asks and translates to Macbeth. The method of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the understanding of the divine power, is it that the bright Masters who have studied all the time, how can they compare to the high-level angels of heaven? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time lapses unconsciously, but the water temperature in the pool is always constant. The bath is tilted up to a beautifully curved tip, and the trickle of hot air is injected into the pool without interruption, and the petiole at the other end is slightly pressed to remove excess water. In the red soil wasteland, such a bathroom can no longer be described as extravagant. But obviously the fat man has no time to enjoy the feeling of physical comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is roughly the case." Macbeth finally explained the basic application of the divine power, but he frowned and said: "Light and dark can't Direct conversion. You need to transform the magic of darkness and death into a force between light and dark, and then transform it into a light attribute. In the process, you need something to transform and store the magic. The equipment that can convert the power attribute is very rare, and the equipment for storing magic is relatively more. You should pay attention to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge can't be together for a while To understand Macbeth in a comprehensive way, he can only memorize it, and he will have a chance to study it later. He suddenly thought of something, and then asked: "Macbeth, the order chain you cast on the day should be driven by pure divine power, so it can only be used to bind the undead or other creatures composed of the most evil forces. But you use It binds an ordinary human! Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth replied faintly: "The order chain is indeed driven by divine power, but it is cast out. At that time, I have been transformed into the magic of no attribute. My order chain, not to mention a human being, even if it is a low-order angel, it can be bound. Your understanding of power is too restrictive to human poor knowledge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge jumped in the heart. What does it mean to be a chain of orders that can bind any of the attributes of each family? In the heart of the fat man, this is more than just a proof of deep understanding of the use of power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the country where most people believe in light, it means planting, framing, and framed, which means countless defamation cases, meaning that fat people can stand in faith and morality. And the bright side, in the name of justice, splendidly eradicate the difference on the way forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who can see through Rogge’s conspiracy will never be interested in secular power struggles. And those who can be crushed or attacked by Rogge with secular rights are simply impossible to see the power attributes behind the order chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth stood up from the bath and went to the floor-to-ceiling windows to open the thick curtains. Half-round bloody sunset through the floor-to-ceiling windows, sprinkled large pieces of golden color in the room, and also covered a layer of bright yellow halo for Macbeth's perfect body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, I don't have to arrange any enjoyment for me in the future, I don't need those. Now what I have to do is to master this body completely, so that I can restore my real The power!" Macbeth held his hand in front of the window, his voice was low and sweet, like a magnetic force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
