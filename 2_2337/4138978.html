			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如如梦章章十二日日中<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking around with a pair of doubts and Concerned, Rogge immediately filled his face with a warm and happy smile, and even with a little ecstasy, is a performance of a new father who is in a high position, without any flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a little girl for a while, Rogge warmed up and comforted a while. The fat man saw Mei weak after giving birth and told the maid to take care of her and left the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to his room, Rogge retired the maid and began to daze. He really does not know how to treat this child. Intuition tells him that this new life should be completely destroyed, and she will not let her leave a trace of this plane. But the reason is not to say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has repeatedly examined this little guy, she is an ordinary baby girl, in addition to her particularly strong vitality and exuberant mental strength. The girl who flows with him and blood. For the fat man who is not available for future generations, it is too ridiculous to kill his daughter with the instinct of the moment and the incomprehensible reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the emerald-like eyes and the little girl’s sneer always lingered in front of the fat man, making him feel like a needle and a shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of this daughter who presented a strange scene from birth, Rogge suddenly felt that the identity of his father had become a heavy burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the fat man was in a dilemma, a horrible storm was brewing in the meditation room of Effie's back in the back of the Icewind Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the third time! I have to repeat the prophecy several times before you are willing to let me go. If you don't believe me, why don't you go?" Prophecy? Prophecy can still be taught to me!" Effie frowned. Cried to Constantine, who was sitting opposite her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantine is sitting opposite Effie, trying to make a sacred and majestic gesture, trying to make Effie’s teacher The elderly have some respectful attitudes. Elf and human life are completely different in life and growth. Although Effie is placed in the human race, it is less than twenty. However, if the actual years of survival, she is likely to approach or even exceed the already 40-year-old Constantine. However, this difference in the age of survival has always been ignored by all major races. Therefore, Constantine’s own elders cannot be said to be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the storm between Effie's eyebrows is getting heavier and heavier. Seeing it is going to happen, obviously she does not put Constantine's hidden hints in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal can't help but look awkward. He also didn't know why Eve's temper today suddenly became so big. In the past, she was responsive. But the big facts in front of me are too important, so Constantine had to put down the shelf and honestly said: "Effie, this fact is too strange, so I have to let you try a few times, good I can confirm it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie stared at Constantine for a long time. I have always seen him smile and stiff, this is: "Good! I will predict for you again for the last time, you can see it yourself, including the spell, the degree, the magic props, the signs of the display, everything! I will never This question is predicted for the fifth time! If you don't believe me, then please prophesy yourself, ask the gods to ask clearly. Or you can go back directly to the south, so you don't have to worry about this problem again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin smirked twice. Nothing to say. As Effie moved, his entire attention was focused on the upcoming prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a temper with Constantine, and Effie throws a bunch of messy magical materials into the silver basin, stirring up a mess. Stir, you begin to recite the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her unrestrained play, Constantine not only smiled. Still a bitter smile. The prophecy was used by Effie in this way. I really don’t know whether it is said to be carried forward or not. However, Constantine has to admit that the success rate of this pure and unbelieving elf girl prophecy is simply stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Effie’s prediction of the spell’s mourning, the silver basin suddenly surged and then radiated a soft sacred glow. After a while, the water in the silver basin seems to have turned into a window leading to another mysterious space, but the space filled with only the rising mist and the faint flick of the sacred glow, can not see other physical existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the prophecy is exactly the same as in the past. Shown are the gods from the gods of heaven. The gods in the light of the Church have actually turned their backs on the faith of the Most High God, and their actions are preparing for the introduction of darkness and evil into this plane. Therefore, all the devout believers of the Most High God should eradicate the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in previous times, Constantine still could not believe the prophetic content. His past experiences and the facts seen in the Church of Light have proved that the church has not abandoned its faith at all, and that there are enough secrets in his cardinal identity, so it is impossible to introduce such a big move in the dark evil. I have to pass him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the breath that is emitted in the prophecy is indeed the breath of the heavenly god, although the cardinal does not know which god of the heavens has given such a god. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prediction is over, but Constantine is still staring at the silver basin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred church led by Rogge is now completely dedicated to the Church of Light, constantly attacking and persecuting believers who believe in the Most High God. According to Effie's prophecy, it is only correct that Cardinal Constantine helped the Holy Church to attack the Church of Light. Only then can the Holy Church compete with the Church of Light. But how does Rogge’s act of slaughtering the supreme believers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment, the huge contrast between the gods and reality made Constantine confused. Should he believe in God's eyes or what he sees? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be humble in the presence of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin suddenly remembered this sentence in the light religion. He took a sigh of relief and finally felt that he had seen a little ahead. However, the Cardinal still wants to finalize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Effie.."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said it. Just the last time Repeat this prediction!” Effie cut off the cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin said: "No, this prophecy is very clear and does not need to be repeated. Now I want to see your other prophetic techniques, such as your transformation. The prophecies used in the larvae of the royal bee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this, exam?" Effie said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...just be an exam!" Constance’s words were immediately reddened. The reason why he asked Effie to repeat this enough to influence his prophecy of choosing the camp was precisely because he tried it anyway. It is impossible to contact the gods of the heavens to obtain the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the exam passed. Is there any benefit?" Effie said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin was shocked. He didn't expect Effie to be so naked and ask for benefits. It seems that she had already seen the true intentions of the Cardinal, so she began to extort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal suddenly felt that today’s Effie’s watch is a strange reality, which is quite different from her usual style. He indulged and said: "If the exam passes, then I will teach you how to create a belief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie nodded and went out went. After a while. She didn't know where to get four identical snakes and returned to the meditation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin looked at Effie’s expressionless face, frowning and asked: "Effie, your behavior today is very strange, is it not? What's the matter? If there is anything that is difficult to do, let me know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie sneaked, then barely smiled and said: "I am just An ordinary elf. What's the matter?" But when the words were not finished, she suddenly had a small mouth and a large drop of tears poured out of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Effie wiped away the tears immediately, and sat down without a problem, rowing the four snakes in one hand. Not waiting for Constantine to ask, she would recite the spell of prophecy. See the dissimilarity of Effie. Constantine wants to ask though he is full, but only bears it, so as not to disturb her spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Feier’s mantra finished, and pointed to one of the snakes, saying: “God said, it will become stronger!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantine was taken aback. He has sensed a hint of dragon from this mutated snake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Effie’s second spell has been finished. He pointed to the second snake and said: "God said. It will also become stronger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four small wings growing on the back of the snake. The body slowly floated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third snake lost its entity under the prophecy and turned into a shadow-like creature, and the fourth snake took off a flesh and blood and completely became An undead creature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meditation room was quiet for a moment, then the four mutated snakes suddenly rushed together and killed each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Constantine couldn’t speak, and it’s hard to say: “Why do you respond every time you predict, and each response It’s different?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie ignoring the four mutant snakes that killed the dead, picking up the magic props and standing up, this is: “Because I found out There are a lot of gods that are very idle. They will respond to my call, but every prophecy of me can be answered by a god, so whoever responds the fastest, I use who."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin is completely speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie Path went out of the meditation room, but for a moment, her tears could not help but burst out. She bit her lower lip and wondered: "What use is there so many prophecies? The prophecy I really want will never come..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common theme in the Kingdom of God is loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country of Fengyue is no exception, but compared to other gods, her field can be said to be very noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this moment, the land that dominates her country is not only lonely, but also dark. The country that floated in the void was gradually dimmed, and the darkness slowly invaded everything. At the end of the day, there was only a light in the palace of the whole country, but the light was also weak as a candlelight in the stormy night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly. An unspeakable breath enveloped the whole kingdom of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear O'Brien, I am from the darkness of Barcelo Dimogan. Your courage and growth have earned my respect, so I am deliberately visiting your country. Please allow me to say that you have created a kingdom of God and you need to sleep now. Only when you wake up from a deep sleep can you have all the powers that belong to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon in front of the ice crystals slowly open, facing the darkness of the entire hall, and faintly said: "I still don't want to sleep."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness gently asked: "How are you going to win the upcoming war? Maybe I should let you see what we are facing together. What kind of enemy is this, it will help you Make the right choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant. In the hall suddenly flashed a dazzling electric light! The electric light is fleeting, but in this short moment, she has seen too many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is silent, it seems to be thinking about something, a black hair is slowly moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no wind in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness is extremely patient and extremely confident, just waiting for her to decide quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind slowly raised his head. The silvery eyes passed through the darkness, crossed the top of the temple, crossed the kingdom of God, and did not know where it was. She was almost a colorless lip, and suddenly she smiled a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Aurea Rey, you can rest assured that you will stay here. During your sleep, I will always be here. Your sleep will not be subject to any Excuse me." The darkness is the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind sighed softly, the silver eyes. Finally slowly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the kingdom of the gods is an island, then the nothingness that carries the kingdom of God is an endless sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is calm, but the undercurrent is soaring. In this vast and boundless sea, the country of Fengyue is really small and negligible. It is not even an island, but a large reef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a glowing reef. Its beautiful light will attract some mysterious existence. They traversed the wind and waves of time and space and gathered around the reef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, there is a terrible existence on the reef, it is huge, even beyond the reef under the wing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea sharks have quietly retreated. They are bloodthirsty, but how dare they go into the sea dragon territory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Fengyue opened again. From the time of closing to opening, it is no more than how long she usually blinks her eyes. However, her eyes at this moment are completely different, and the whole kingdom of God is also quietly changing. The vague decorations and sculptures in the hall are gradually becoming entities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the hall has been restored. The darkness that once shrouded everything did not know when it had left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly spins in the air for a week. The cold silver eyes glanced at the void around the kingdom of God. At this moment, the sea dragon has long gone, but the sharks still dare to linger in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while. They finally dissipated and will not come again in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting for a morning, Rogge finally decided to temporarily put down her daughter’s affairs temporarily. In any case, he really can't get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog stood up and stretched his sore waist and gave a sigh of relief. Suddenly he suddenly felt something, and immediately stayed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moments of fat, the silver awns in both eyes began to flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnome jumped out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body has not fully jumped out of the void, and can't wait to scream: "Master's master! You finally remembered me coming? What time is this? Commanded? Do you want to know which nasty guy to do, or do you want to know something? But if you have something about the two masters, you should discuss it carefully..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Unfortunately, its bargaining has to end before it has begun. The sudden appearance of the Dragon Soul Warrior gently picked up the ground gnome and sent it back to the void. As for where Wella threw it, it is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look for me?" Weina asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger nodded and said, "I want to go to her country once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "If you only go to the spiritual body, I think I can withstand the turbulence of time and space. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner frowned slightly, hesitated for a moment, finally said: "Well, I will try to see if I can take you in the past. If you can't stand it halfway." I will send you back directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat down on the chair, closed his eyes and breathed twice, saying: " Let's get started!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While knowing that Rogge was not the first time to walk through the space storm, Wella was still amazed at his skills. The frenzied space storm hardly poses any threat to them, and the space door leading to the kingdom of Fengyue appears in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space door does not have any brilliance, nor does it exist in substance. Only the existence of a certain connection with Fengyue can sense the existence of this space door in the space storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Rogge’s spiritual ontology is thrown into the space door as a meteor, it disappears. Wella also tried to walk through, but she slammed into a powerful and irresistible energy barrier and was bounced back! Unprepared, she was instantly swept by space storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
