			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to thank the fans for their support, the afternoon is especially to thank the fans of "亵渎" for holding "Smoke Rain Jiangnan - 亵渎 Signing Sale" in Shanghai Book City! The signing of the sale will allow you to have closer contact with Yanyu Jiangnan, and definitely give you a note worthy of showing off! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=========================================== ======================================================================== &nbsp; Regardless of the size of the country, the life of the royal family is always extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Layton is one of the best in the Holy Alliance. The luxury of the palace is always worthy of the status of the country. Otherwise, even if King Romon is willing to endure a hard life, the ministers and aristocrats will inevitably stop the king's frugality on the grounds that they will be looked down upon by neighboring countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Layton Palace covers a wide area, so that there is an artificial hill in the palace. At the moment, the southern country is already in the spring, and the north of the Central Mountains is still a desolate scene. Only the hill in the Layton Palace is green, and the trees on the hills are some of the most common species in the South. They grow happily, and the leaves are green and green, and it is not the dark green of the conifers of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass in the forest, although there is no trace of artificial trimming, but it looks like a thick green carpet, the grass is dotted with unknown stars. Wildflowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all the beauty is born for a beautiful elf girl who is sitting on the grass lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell sat thoughtfully on the grass with a hint of mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of her, there is a mirror of the ancient style, which reflects the beautiful face of the elf girl as if it were a light smoke. But in the eyes of Ikerel, it is not her appearance, but a mysterious and beautiful elf text. I have seen these lines of words for many times, and all the details of the actions have been repeatedly considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed softly and passed the mirror. The elf text in the mirror slowly disappeared and became an ordinary silver plaque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iklele closed his eyes and enjoyed the zephyr and the faint aroma of the wind. In this rare moment of tranquility, she will throw all the conspiracy out of her heart and temporarily return to the carefree elf girl in the green sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just half a month ago, this hill was still as absurd as the rest of the North. At that time, several people who claimed to be intelligent eye-seekers sought to see the king of Lomon, saying that they were inspired by God. The purity and kindness of the elf Ikerel touched the heart of the goddess O'Reilly and became a new god. Awkward people. They came here to build a world of paradise for the elves Ikerel and King Romon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King Romon will be suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard that the Eye of Wisdom has recently been exhibited very fast in the country, and the goddess they believe in has just shown God in the Dresden Palace in Aray trace. But in any case, this small church that believes in the nameless god is not in the north, there are dozens. As for the miracle is true or false, then only God knows. But this time the great aristocrat who recommended these people was a good friend of King Romon for many years. Under his great recommendation, King Romon would let them try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the wisdom of these magicians are really different, they selected a place of 10 meters, used a whole day and a lot of Magic crystal, only a complicated magic array. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, in the stunned King of Lomon and the ministers of the spectator, this magical array worked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature within the magical array is slowly rising and becomes warm as spring. Grasses and trees begin to grow wildly with the naked eye, and their growth patterns are completely changing with the minds of several magicians in the Eye of Wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the grass grows to two inches, it no longer grows. And more than ten small trees were stretched high, and on the second day, their crowns were covered with shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikelel was so ecstatic that he danced on the green grass, and the moment of the wind poured out countless onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the joy of Ikerel, King Romon is old and bright, he immediately told the magician of the Eye of Wisdom: "Good! Very good It’s true that it’s a church that believes in the true God. It’s really impossible for people to transform this whole mountain. If there is any difficulty, even if it’s open, I will do it well. Later, my Layton Kingdom will fully support the eyes of wisdom. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few magicians had a hard time underneath, they negotiated with each other, and the leading old magician replied: "Your Majesty, this can control the climate." And the magical array of biological growth is very complicated. If it is not the guidance of the goddess O'Reilly, we can never study it. It is not difficult to make the whole hill all the spring, but nothing else, just The consumption of magical materials is by no means a small amount! The magical array that can control the radius of 10 meters has already consumed more than half of the eyes of wisdom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp King Romon was unhappy and sighed: "The Layton Kingdom Will this money be unbearable? How much time and time will it take to turn this whole hill into a land? You can listen to it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The old magician sinks for a long time, only said: "Your Majesty, as long as there is enough magic material, it can be arranged in three days for the magic array. And under the guidance of the goddess, the effect of this magic array is permanent. But magic The cost of the material is estimated to be around 700,000 gold coins..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of Romon is even more unhappy. If it is not the special status of the magician, he has already turned his face. . He sneaked a bit of money and we are still worthy of the Leiden Kingdom! You can do it now, if you want to buy something, how much it will cost, as long as it can be arranged exactly the same as the piece of music in front of you! As long as I can satisfy my Ikerel, I will donate 100,000 gold coins to the Eye of Wisdom afterwards! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister of the Layton Kingdom changed his face, and he finally got the courage to whisper in the ears of King Romon: "His Majesty, this is the Kingdom's Treasury Five." One of the properties, you have to think twice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king replied bluntly: "If you can exchange gold coins for such a piece of paradise, That is also worth it. Behind me, my sons and grandchildren can also enjoy nothing! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikreel gently pulled Laromon's sleeves, and some slyly said: "Your Majesty, it seems...like money is spent too much Some more. We still don't want to renovate the whole mountain. Your Ikerel can have such a big place and it is already very happy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king laughed at the baby, this money is a big deal in other countries of the Holy Alliance, but our Kingdom of Leighton is rich and strong, this money has not yet Put it in my eyes! Just wait for it, here is it, it should be similar to your previous home? Baby, you complained to me about a cold winter. Now you will be satisfied. Hahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, the hill in the palace has really become an oasis in the snowfield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell sitting on the grass sighed and took back his thoughts. Her heart appeared in her heart. She faintly felt that this land was more or less a little compensation that God gave her to her, although this was not the main goal of his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building the huge cost of this magical array, after many complicated links, most of them will flow into Rogge’s pocket. After all, the most important and most expensive of the magical array of rare magic crystals, only in the city of the gods. These rare magic crystals have always been priceless, and there are few people, and there are fewer people to use. It is possible to open a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sold a number of magic crystals at a very high price to several major chambers of the Kingdom of Layton. Of course, these chambers of commerce are willing to enter this magic crystal. Because the magicians of the Eye of Wisdom will buy at a higher price. As for the difference between the tens of thousands of gold coins, Rogge knows that this is the price that must be paid. Behind these chambers of commerce are the nobles of the Leiden Kingdom. Two of the real bosses behind them are Marshal Emams who is in charge of military power. After paying these costs, no one will come back and trace whether the money is worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell has no concept of money at all, but she also knows that this is a big sum of money. It’s just that God wants adults to do so much money, she doesn’t know it, and she doesn’t care about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts were pulled back by a rush of footsteps, which seemed anxious and panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eckeler stood up and just yelled: "Sensi adults..." and he was hugged in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Ikerel’s small face, Sensi was excited and incoherent: “This is not a dream... Ikerel! Great! ...you are really here, tell me that everything is true!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young Viscount Viscount is not a general aristocrat. He is the nephew of the king of the Kingdom of Livi and the ambassador of the Kingdom of Levi in ​​the Kingdom of Layton. Since seeing Ikerel at the court dance at the Layton Kingdom, he feels that he has fallen in love with this elf. As a ambassador of the Kingdom of Livi, he can often enter the Layton Palace. He always seizes every opportunity, quietly approaches Ikerel, understands everything about her, and tries to impress her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the aristocratic youths of the Holy Alliance, Sensi is excellent in all aspects. After a while, his efforts finally gained something. Ikerel has noticed him, but his attitude towards him has always been annoyed if he intentionally and unintentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a ball a week ago, Sensi caught a short chance to dance with Ikerel and quietly confided his love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell listened, her face was still elegant and polite, cold, only faint, very light and extremely light: "Every afternoon, I They will be alone in 'Le Tu' for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ecstatic Sensi can't believe his ears, this is a very obvious hint! It is possible to maintain the quiet dance of this song, and has exhausted the training of Sensi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the powerful Powers of Sensi, crossing the Layton Palace is just a small problem. Now, he is finally able to have a short time with Ikerel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long time with Ikel, Sensi still couldn’t believe it was true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikreel smiled slightly and said softly: "You have stupid little mouth that has been blocked by Sensi.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kiss is frenetic and short-lived.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell gasps in a hurry and kisses her wildly on her Sensi said: "I like you to be more rude..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light sentence completely ignited the blood of Sensi's body. He grabbed the elf The cloak, with a strong slam, slammed Ikerel's blouse completely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell blushes on the face, snoring, I took a deep breath and my eyes closed slightly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senxi bowed his head and was about to enjoy the delicacies of this paradise when he was in his arms Ikerel made a clear, screaming voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Sensi was poured into a basin of ice water in the coldest winter, completely froze!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a loud voice in the palace, and I am approaching here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensi stares at Ikel, Watching her tears rolling down her cheeks at the moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he was just when he was alone with Ikerel, he still couldn’t believe it. It’s all true.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell sighed and said in a fine mosquito-sounding voice: “I’m sorry...”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bold! King Ramon rushed in a hurry and snarled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensi reacted and realized that the big thing was not good, King Romon to Ikelay Er's love was already famous in the Holy League. He hurriedly let go of Ikerel, thumped and hurried, and said: "Your Majesty! This is not my business! is her! She seduce me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the moment Ikerel fell to the ground and was crying. She was so pitiful that everyone’s heart hurts. Seeing that her clothes are ruptured, the crystal clear skin is blue and purple, and who would believe that she would seduce the Viscounts of Sensi?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
