			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream volume chapter 13 is like a dream<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, the room is also No lights, only the faint light that penetrated through the window reflected the outline of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine sword was slowly pulled out of the scabbard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the sword is dark, and the seven colors of light representing the seven negative forces are constantly changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, the seven-colored sword front reflects the intoxicated eyes of the Death Class. He reached out to his fingertips and touched the tip of the sword. The sharp tip of the sword gently broke his finger, so in the blink of an eye, seven negative forces poured into the body of the Death Class like a frenzy, repeatedly testing his magic resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class swayed, and finally did not withstand all the negative forces, and the slow effect. The temperament of his body was flickering, and it took a few minutes to put the slow effect down. When looking at the seven-colored sword again, the flame in the eye of the class is even hotter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the swaying flare of the beam through the window is accompanied by bursts of noisy vocals, among which there is a praise of the goddess. The group of people gradually drifted away from a long street not far from the window of the death squad, but the noisy voice was still faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a disgusting color on the face of the class. He closed the window and separated the humming voices. He knew that the group of people who had just gone was a fanatical sacred church. In response to the call of Pope Rogge, these believers are gathering in the Canberra Plains in the southern part of the Dro Empire, thinking that they will contribute their own strength to the victory of the final jihad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class is very disgusted by these fanatical believers, in the name of faith and sacredness. They actually do everything, and they are even worse than bandits and thugs. The class once mentioned this to Rogge several times and asked him to control these believers, but each time Rogge was only free to perfuse him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this war, the Death Class also felt bored. He really can't understand the meaning of war. He doesn't understand why there are so many countries worthy of investing in this unprecedented civil war. The longer the war is going, the more tragic scenes that must exist in various wars, the more the death class will miss the quiet days of the small lakes in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class has a strong desire. He wants to go back to the leisurely retirement life, this war. Does not belong to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when his eyes fall on the sword, he can’t live without it. From the beginning of the wind, he promised to add a movement to his land in January. Until now, there is only one chapter in the past few months. Although the death class is extremely angry about this, he is helpless to a goddess who is not trusting. Even if he is angry, there is nowhere to vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a little more! Just one more piece of music. I will retire. No matter how much..." The Death Class is thinking . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final moment is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before January, Alexander’s Glacier Army attacked the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and when more than 50,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers were urgently transferred back to the domestic defense by the Austro-Hungarian Emperor, Alexander Suddenly, he swayed south, and the road was like a broken bamboo. He won 11 games in a row and finally copied to the rear of the meat grinder line. Pompei’s Poseidon Corps was a surprise attack. Break through the front line of the Shenghui League, and meet with the Glacier in Verdun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the 100,000-strong army of the Shenghui League was cut off from all retreats and was surrounded by a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the Eastern Front, the Bavarian Principality achieved a major victory. In front of the 100,000-strong army in the Principality, more than 200,000 troops of the Dero empire were defeated every battle, and they all collapsed. The line of defense was fragmented, and finally 30,000 soldiers were killed and wounded, and the captured land was 100,000. Then count the deserters on the way to defeat, and in the end of the 200,000 Dro army, less than 30,000 people fled back to O'Siyah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After defeating the main army of Dro, the army of the Bavarian Principality turned to the west, converging the Holy Alliance Army at the eastern end of the meat grinder line, after reorganization, The Canberra Prairie has confronted the main forces of the sacred accords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time, on the endless Canberra steppe. The alliance and the alliances each assemble the army. The decisive battle is already on the horizon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this big decisive battle, in fact, the party of the Allies did not only have an advantage in the quality of the Legion, but also in the number of fighters. Therefore, before the war, Alexander and Pompeii agreed that only with the relatively weak forces to meet the enemy, it is possible to provoke the main force of the alliance to come to a decisive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of battles in the past have proved that in the traditional three empire, the Dro Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire have long since declined, and their army is still huge, but the battle The power is no longer the same. Only the two major troupes of the Astrofic Empire should be far above the countries of the South. Looking at the mainland, there should be no rivals except the Holy Knights who have never invested in the battle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in this decisive battle, even if the alliance side has a huge advantage in strength, it may not be able to defeat the Allies, unless the Holy Knights are all dispatched. This is the result that Feuerbach wants to see. The great emperor knows that in addition to the Holy Knights, the core of the light of the Church of the Light has a mysterious sanctuary. And no one knows how many powerful guys are hidden in the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what character is hidden in the Church of Light, the number of angels who have come or reincarnate in the church cannot change the destiny of their destiny. Because in front of the avatar of the dark Lord Barço di Mogogen, all the strong men of this plane will find their helplessness and despair! And bringing the avatar of the Dark Lord directly into the plane, this will also be an unprecedented miracle on the mainland! Even in the glorious era of the Elven Empire in the past millennium, this miracle has never been realized! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the day of the decisive battle, the wind and moon may also join the war in the form of avatars or direct descendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason for the contracting party to decide not to invest too much force is that when the Dark Lord God succeeds in landing, his horror stems from the darkness. The breath is enough to turn most of the weaker warriors into dark creatures without self-awareness! According to Sara Wenger’s estimate. At the moment when the Lord God of Darkness appears, there may be eight to 100,000 warriors on the party. Of course, when the lord of the Lord God enters the ranks of the Allied forces with a much lower average quality, I am afraid that more than 300,000 warriors will be transformed into dark creatures and become servants of Bartholomew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohini has almost become a city that never sleeps these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every night, the lights are bright, and a group of sacred church members say goodbye to their families. They set off from here. All the way to the Canberra grasslands to participate in the final jihad. No one doubts that the war will fail because the Canberra prairie has been foreseen as a miracle. The goddess O'Reilly will be there, and she will witness the heroic attitude of her followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger, standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling window and looking at the noisy night scene, sighed slightly. He naturally knows what will be waiting for these believers in the Canberra steppe. He drank the wine in his hand, and the scarlet wine had a special taste, which was somewhat bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge put down the glass and went all the way to the room of Hughes. On the eve of this war, his heart was always inexplicably uneasy. He wants to talk to the old fox, maybe he can talk about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter where. The homes of Xius are simple and elegant, making people feel very relaxed. He is reading tea while he is drinking tea. Seeing that Rogge came in, he smiled and said hello, and he even poured a cup of tea into Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is also welcome, sitting in front of Hughes, straightforwardly said: "Elders of Shusi, the decisive battle is about to begin. I feel very upset in my heart." But I can't find the reason. I don't know if you can give me some advice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled a bit and said: "Rogge, this time The main battle behind the two sides is the god of darkness and heaven. I think you are more clear than I am. Even if I know more than the average person, it can be an ordinary elf. How can I intervene in the Lord God? In the battle between the two? So I can't help you with this war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge indulged, and some did not give up: "So repair Elder, you have given me every single sentence in the book of Hilo: 'The gods are not omnipotent, and Hilo is omnipotent.' I really don't understand what this means. You have already studied The book of Hilo can be explained to me for hundreds of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that 'the gods are not omnipotent, and Hilo is omnipotent', the eyes of Hughes’s eyes twitched slightly, and the hands holding the cups were somewhat Trembling. How did his changes escape the eyes of Rogge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fourth page... ah!" Rogge said that he couldn't bear the pain and hit the top of his head. For a time, it seems that there are more than a dozen food ecstasy who are rushing to suck his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unspeakable pain, the content of the fifth page of the book of Hilo appears in his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Create light in the darkness, open the way in nothingness. The gods sleep and wake up, their eyes are full of confusion, their glory will be challenged The end of the dusty world is the starting point of the gods, and the ending before going to bed is the beginning of waking up. The gods will be jealous because they need to find the meaning of existence in nothingness. The distance between the ending and the beginning, even the gods It is impossible to cross. All attachments to the ending will become chains on the feet of the gods. There is no shackles in the gods, there is no midpoint, the front is the meaning of existence, and the back is the abyss of destruction."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods are not omnipotent, and Hilo is omnipotent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pain is waning, but the five pages of the book of Hilo make his mood colder and colder. Can it be said that once and for all, I went to the gods to visit the wind and the moon, trying to pull her back, would it be possible to drag her into the chain of destruction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Rogge, so it seems that you have seen the fifth page. The speed at which you read the book of Hilo is really beyond me. The expectation." Hughes looked at Rogge's pale face for a moment, and sighed and said: "Everyone who can read the book of Hilo will get his own understanding from the book. I can only say that the book of Hilo We have power that we can't imagine, in the face of such power. We should be humble. So I can't give you any explanation for the content of Hilo's book. In fact, all explanations will not help you. Now The only advice I can give you is that the book of Hilo has a total of seven pages. In any case, you should not look at the last page."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s head was sore and the whole person was like a collapse. The whole body was sweating and sweating, but the weak spot nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is at this time. The door in the room suddenly opened, and Effie rushed out from the inside like a gust of wind. She held a lot of various magic materials in her arms. When she went out, she said: "Elders of Xiusi, come over and see. The result of this prophecy is really strange!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie said it was crisp and fast, until after all. I saw Rogge also present. She immediately glanced at her eyes and stared at Rogge, watching it non-stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bitter experience that was almost drained by Effie a few times ago, and Rogge couldn’t help but feel guilty in front of her. Fortunately, Effie can also focus on the right thing, said: "Luoge adults, you come to see this prophecy!" The fat man sighed, and was very curious about Effie's prophecy, heard Stand up. Go inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing by Effie, the elf suddenly asked very lightly and gently: "Can you give me thirty minutes?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s legs are immediately soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very large room with steel panels on all four walls. This is because Effie predicts that accidents such as explosions are much higher than the average magic test. But no matter what kind of accident, she will not be hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a circular bronze mirror on the ground in the center of the room. The mirror is engraved with quaint patterns and many strange creatures. Rogge can say that everyone is a god-devil, and at a glance he recognizes a few low-level gods or first-class demons. But most of the statues he can't tell. And this bronze mirror is too big. Almost occupied the ground in the room, I do not know how it came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge’s gaze was immediately attracted to the images in the bronze mirror, and he could no longer leave. The more he looks, the more pale his face is. Later, the face of the fat man was completely bloodless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the bronze mirror has become completely transparent and looks like a window leading to an infinitely vast world. The world of clouds in the bronze mirror is lingering, and in the clouds and fog, you can see that there is a large land in the center of the world, with mountains and rivers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge only feels that at the moment he is like a god standing on the top of the clouds, looking down on the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it reflected in the bronze mirror? Is this our plane? Just in the heart of Rogge’s heart, he saw that the eastern part of the continent suddenly turned on, and a new continent, if a behemoth, suddenly rushed out from the depths of the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of this continent is about half of the mainland where Rogge lived. However, the mountains above are even more strange, the water is clearer, and the green is green, making people look and feel happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s heart leaps and screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is inherited from the memory of Rodriguez, or many legends on the mainland, there are countless records on the mysterious Eastern continent. However, Rogge's power is not too big, and the footprint can not be said to be wide. For more than a decade, he has never really seen a person who has set foot on the eastern continent. Even the memories left by Rodriguez are unclear about the Eastern Continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, it’s much harder to go to the mysterious Eastern continent than Rogge to the god of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the mysterious Eastern continent appeared in the prophecy of Effie, presenting the whole picture in front of Rogge! For a moment, Rogge even had a strong desire to jump into the world of bronze mirrors and take a good look at the mysterious eastern continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the next change made him stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colors on the western continent are constantly changing, and it can be seen that the four seasons are changing, and the eastern continent is always the same. After the mysterious eastern continent emerged from the clouds, it did not stop here, but the entire continent was slowly moving, and it was getting farther and farther away from the western continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, the Eastern Continent seems to have touched an invisible border, suddenly bursting out a glare, and then disappeared without a trace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time. Rogge is still staring at the turbulent clouds in the bronze mirror. Until the scene was repeated again, he only came back and asked Effie: "Effie, is the time for your prophecy clear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Time?" Effie frowned and thought slowly, "The prophecy generally does not give time clearly, but this time the prophecy is very strange. It seems that the result is not in the future. It is produced in In the past, so I only came to see Elder Chess to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately looked at Hughes, and Xiusi immediately smiled and said: "Let the gods It’s not all-powerful. How can I know everything?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is silent, once again read the prophecy in the bronze mirror, suddenly "Elders of Xius, how do I feel that the Eastern Continent is not leaving, but there is a mysterious force pushing it. It seems... it seems to be fleeing."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge only got silence. In fact, he himself knows that such a problem, besides the gods who are high above, I am afraid no one can answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and walked outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Rogge hasn’t taken the door. Just being pulled by one. The fat man turned back and just met Effie's eyes as bright as the morning star. In the clear eyes, Rogge saw the firmness that could not be violated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thirty minutes! One minute can't be less!" Effie did not leave room for negotiation. She closed the door with her hand and separated Hughes from the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door suddenly opened again, and a scream screamed, and the gnome was kicked out by Effie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first morning dawned through the darkness of the night, it was like a wildflower-like camp that was scattered on the Canberra Prairie. Countless believers in the Holy Church drilled out of the camp. Under the guidance of one cleric, concentrate on the designated place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast prairie has already set up hundreds of tall wooden poles, and flags of various colors are flying on the head. Every cleric of the Holy Church recites how many believers need to stand under each banner. It is only the believers who are not sure what they are going to do next. But because they are pious enough, the order on the grassland is still quite order. Despite this, when millions of believers are in place, the sky is already bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, the eulogy of millions of believers sing in unison has resounded to the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array that had already been laid on the high stage suddenly burst into the light, and the seven colors of light and fog were like a fountain, which was in the glory. Mora emerged from the magic array. Soared into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Mora’s body is surrounded by the glory of the rise, and the style is unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See this as a miracle scene. The voices of the believers are even bigger, and they are crazy. They used to touch the ground in the past to express their inner piety. Therefore, few people have noticed that the sky is already blue and the sky is gradually turning gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of the believers' prayers were overwhelming, completely overwhelming the sound of screaming in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the day, the Allied Powers stepped out of the military camp and laid a battlefield on the Canberra grasslands. As if it was a good agreement, the army of the Shenghui Alliance also went out at the same time, and hundreds of thousands of troops marched in front of the Allies. Not expected by the Emperor Feuerbach, listed in the center of the army of the Allied forces, it is 50,000 to remove all the disguised holy knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The covenant army deployed the cavalry in the two wings of the battlefield, the first purpose is to maneuver, and the second is to monitor the movement of the Confederate army at any time, so that they are being summoned after the attack. Millions of believers in the ceremony. In the center of the deal, the Poseidon Corps was replaced with a giant shield pike. Behind these heavy infantry, more than ten high platforms were erected, and the stage was full of mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tens of meters high tower that was erected at night behind the treaty battle, the Great, Rogge, Alexander, Pompeii and Sara Wenger all stood on it. on. From here you can overlook the entire battlefield, and you can even see the black-pressed million believers behind the line. With Rogge's eyesight, you can see the airborne Mora's fascinating figure. Only the fat man at this time naturally has no fragrant mood, see the summoning ceremony for all peace. There was no unexpected scene in the scene, and his eyes fell on the battle of the Shenghui League. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the fat man will see many long-lost people today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the group slowly boarded the high platform at the back of the St. Hui Alliance. Two high seats have already been set up on the high platform, and one of them is sitting on the old figure that has already been engraved in the depths of Rogge's soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope today is wearing a gorgeous robe, wearing a high crown, and holding a ruby ​​scepter. Only in the most grand ceremony, he will wear this dress. However, the pope's throne is not placed in the center of the high platform that represents the most respected status. Sitting in the center is a young man with maroon short hair and handsome and somewhat pitiful. It is strange to feel. His eyes were closed and seemed to be indifferent to everything that happened on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have sensed Rogge’s gaze. The young man on the throne of the throne suddenly smiled, but he was shocked by the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the drums and horns of Zhentian brought Rogge’s thought back to the battlefield. On the high platform, there are only three of him, the emperor and the boss. Alexander and Pompey did not know when they had stepped down the high platform and commanded their respective troops to fight. In this big battle, Rogge's Ice Warrior and Ice and Snow Masters have been handed over to the two famous generals in order to maximize their combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now there is nothing to do with Rogge, who has no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, you don't have to worry. I have seen the alliance's military. The number of their mages is far from enough, and the strong is evenly matched with us. Currently Although our disadvantages are large in military power, we believe that with the command of General Alexander and Pompey, and our overwhelming superiority in the number of mages, even without the help of the power of the Dark Lord, we have a great chance of winning." And the low voice can be clearly and clearly transmitted to the ears of the Emperor and Rogge in the battlefield of killing the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach’s face was cold and nodded. He is sitting in the high seat. Hold the wine on the left, hold the knife in the right hand, and look down on the entire battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war situation has become fierce, and Rogge discovered that he had inadvertently spent too much time on the unusually beautiful and strange characters around the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the tens of thousands of knights of the Holy Knights have already reached the front of the Allies in a violent storm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Pompey did it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the command of his land, the number of people in the position of the Poseidon Corps has a long embankment, firmly blocking the raging waves in front of them. The movements of each group of Poseidon warriors are neat and uniform. They struggled to send the five-meter dragon gun in their hands to the horse of the holy knight who came from the charge. Then they raised the tomahawk placed at the foot and slammed it into a huge inertia. The body of the holy knights who flew and fell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Knights launched the charge one after another, and the Holy Knights in the back row either throw a gun or throw a tomahawk. Throw these murders that are about to harvest life into the defense of the Poseidon Warrior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rapid crack on the long embankment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poseidon Warriors fell one by one. However, they would rather use the body to act as a barrier to the running horses, and would not step back from the berthed land! The sacred knights that rushed at full speed often slammed their Poseidon warriors in the roar. Then he threw himself from the horse and fell to the depths of the Allied countries. Even if the co-defense fighters are not chaotic, the knights with thick armor are so falling, it is difficult to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long embankment is shaking, it seems that it is getting more and more fragile, but Ren Chaoshui* how to slap, it always stands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central battle was caught in a moment, and the situation in the two wings was different. On the left, the Knights belonging to the Bavarian Principality were tough, and with a huge number of advantages, they suppressed the cavalry of the Asrofic Empire and began to split the wing of the Droo Empire infantry, forcing them to retreat. On the right wing, the glaciers that Alexander personally directed were able to defeat the ranks of the Austrian-Hungarian Knights. After a huge casualty, the 30,000 light cavalry of the Austro-Hungarian Empire finally fled back to the front of the infantry, and got a chance to breathe a little and re-team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky above the battlefield suddenly lit up with a burst of brilliant light, followed by countless attacking magic that dragged the beautiful trail across the sky. Falling in the battlefield of the other side. Then flames, frost, thorns, sand and dust, and even dark clouds that emit rich and dead air are on the battlefield. After the gorgeous light and shadow, it is the horrible killing power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every wave of magical offensives, there will be many blank areas in both fronts, especially in the queue of the Holy Knights. A gap! The magical resistance of the Holy Knights is far stronger than that of ordinary warriors. If this wave of magic falls on other units of the Alliance, the number of casualties may be doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very obvious that both the amount and the power of magic. The parties to the agreement have the upper hand in this magical attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the war, Konstantin revealed that there are more than 200 bright Masters in the Church of Light who can play a role on the battlefield. The total number of mages appearing on the battlefield by the Allies is about 300. In contrast, the parties have mobilized more than 800 magicians! This is mainly due to the magical culture of the prosperity of the Dro Empire. And in the past year, the Ice Church Masters of the Holy Church has produced enough new magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first wave of attack magic, the magician who assisted in the attack also completed the spell. They either provided offensive and defensive bonuses for the already-armed fighters, or weakened the enemy. Party strength. Naturally, the party that dominated the number of magicians this round suppressed the arrogance of the alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strong support of the methodologist. The defense of the Poseidon Corps has finally stabilized for a while. At this moment, the two fronts began to be intertwined, and the battle entered the most brutal phase of struggle. The two sides are like two wrestling fighters. It is impossible for them to bleed. The two sides fight to make each other's blood flow more than themselves and faster than themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundreds of thousands of warriors on the earth are fighting in desperation, and countless magic and feather arrows fly across the sky. At this time, as long as the feather arrow is shot in the opponent's camp, there will be a gain. Therefore, the 10,000 elf shooters who have been heavily protected in the covenant army do not play much more than the Terran archers. Only they use the special broken armored arrows at this moment, and the lethality is very impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of very few people, almost no one noticed that the sky was dimming, and the original blue was already replaced by dark gray. And in the gathering place of millions of believers behind the Allies of the Allies, the sky is completely occupied by darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness in the sky is very different, unlike the natural darkness of the night. Looking away. It is more like the sky curtain being torn apart by a pair of giant palms, revealing the dark black, dull void hidden behind the scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her to the night, to the day, and stretching her arms to the endless darkness, Rogge’s heart suddenly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge already knows that the will of the gods is not controlled by the common customs. He did not know what the consequences would be to bring the lord of the Dark Lord into this plane. He did not know what the power of the Dark Lord brought to him. Will it be as the Emperor said, where the footsteps of Bartholomew will be transformed into the kingdom of darkness? If that's the case. That's what he is doing now. What is the point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life or death, existence or destruction. This is related to the proposition of the fate of the whole plane, and it seems that he is so far away from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man does not care about the ups and downs of all beings, nor does he really care about the survival of the plane. He reads the book of Hilo on the fifth page, even if the body is destroyed, the soul can Long-lasting in nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the darkness of the day, listening to the roar and screams filled with the entire battlefield, watching the blood gradually penetrate the earth, looking at countless familiar people because of their own The reason is to fight in a desperate fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly feels that all this is so strange, so meaningless, if there is a dream, whether it is a hero, a child, or a dream, When the power is in the world, rich and glory, when you wake up, it is nothing more than a tear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has never been a moment when he wants to leave everything behind, and to create a kingdom with her in nothingness, and to accompany it to eternity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a roar of faintness between heaven and earth, awakening Rogge in the middle. From the sky that has been torn open, there are several large black electric lights that smash out and hit the vast grasslands. Every lightning falls. You will find a 100-meter square pit on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s palm was slightly sweaty, and the emperor stood up nervously. Even the calm Sarah Wenger’s eyes widened, and the two-way turbidity The eyes of the eyes flashed through the sultry light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An invisible pressure spread quietly, covering a hundred miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the eyes of all the strong on the battlefield fell on the ever-expanding darkness of the sky. The keen instinct has already told them how powerful the existence behind the darkness is. Whether it is the strong of that side, at this moment. At the moment when the powerful existence that has not yet emerged declares its majesty, it is almost tremble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glances at the millions of believers who are squatting. I also looked at the hundreds of thousands of warriors who were eager to die and fight, and inexplicably felt a faint sorrow for them. At the moment when Bartholomew's genus is in the shape, the dark frenzy will sweep the earth, and the vast majority of ordinary existence will be the victim of the sacrifice of the Lord God, regardless of which camp it belongs to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the existence of sacred and bright attributes will be the first to be hit, but it also includes the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness has quietly occupied the entire sky. Even ordinary warriors perceive the vision between heaven and earth, and the killing action in their hands has slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is darkness in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky has been torn, the deepest part of the darkness, and the purest darkness has come out. In the face of this darkness, there is no light at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge held his breath and waited quietly for the moment to decide his fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scream of screaming in the distance, and the voice was very familiar. It was the voice of Mora! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s heart trembled. He did not look at Mora safely, and found that in the deepest darkness, there was light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is absolutely light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious moments dispel the darkness that just occupies the entire sky and bring the whole world back to light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the brilliance is too strong relative to this fragile plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is substantial glory, if the sky is falling. When the air empties down, everything that Sheng Hui directly shines is instantly turned into nothingness under high heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheng Hui is like silk, if it rains, like a tide! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora, standing in the air, was first swallowed up by the sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred Church believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is not the dark Lord!" Rogge suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, he has seen a slowly swirling Shenghui tetrahedron through the strongest holy light in the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the breath of the heavenly god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of the endless majesty of the Lord God, the entire plane is constantly tremble! It seems that this sinister plane is not enough to withstand its own glory. The brilliance in the sky that is enough to destroy everything suddenly falls back. Concealed all the power of yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye. Presented in front of all beings, it is a blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of the moment has made Rogge red and swollen. Tears flow. He blinked his eyes, and he slowly saw everything in front of him. On the prairie where millions of believers have been stalking, at this moment, only a huge pit with a bottomlessness and a few kilometers is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really did not understand why the ritual of summoning the Dark Lord God eventually led to the glory of the Lord God of Heaven. He looked at the Emperor and the boss, Sarah Wenger, and found that the emperor was sitting in the chair, his face was solemn, and there were two blood lines in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a great change, but Feuerbach’s emperor seemed very calm. He leaned slightly and listened to the cheers of the alliance, such as the landslide, and then slow. Slowly said: "It seems that I have not read it wrong. The greatest dark god has not come to this plane according to our call. The one we summoned from the source of darkness is the main god of heaven..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence on the high platform, neither Rogge nor Sara Wenger, how to answer the question of the Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sara Wenger, have you been with me for twenty years?" the emperor suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, two days is twenty-one years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Nodded, stood up and fumbled forward. Sarah Wenger immediately took a step forward. Supported Feuerbach and led him to the ladder of the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sara Wenger, depending on your opinion, can we still win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Your Majesty, the possibility always exists in the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, my eyes are already invisible. When you charge, you are willing to Do I guide the enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very honored. Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two old people Support each other and slowly walk down the platform along the steps. Listen to the tone of their conversation. It seems that two ordinary old people in a small country village are calm and gentle as they talk about the autumn harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, there was only one Rogge on the high platform. He looked around, even though the sky was clear, but the wind that passed the high platform was still bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a special feeling in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Feuerbach took the sword and pointed it to the front. Sarah Wenger walked with him. For the great emperor to lead the warhorse, toward the front line of the Shenghui alliance, slowly accelerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the great emperor marching in the military squad, Alexander took out the sword and lost the force. Pompey took the handcuffs, they were at the same time as the emperor Instigated to ride, greeted hundreds of thousands of allied forces in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sara Wenger could not keep a thick black mist, and wrapped himself and the emperor. This group of black fog rolled forward, crossed the Pompeii's Poseidon Corps, and rushed directly into the Holy Knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred knights who are so brave can't stop the black mist! They were involved in the dark fog. There is no news at all, and in the back of the black fog, only one avenue is supported by the blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the ordinary warriors do not understand where the difference between heaven and earth is from the source, but they all faintly understand that the balance of victory has Tilt to the Allies. The Dro empire and the other servant countries have cringed, and only the soldiers of the Asrofik Empire followed their emperors and generals, and they turned their backs on the Shenghui League! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the cry of the North Warriors overwhelmed the Southern League cheers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do when I am desperate? Rogge shook his head suddenly, his eyebrows wrinkled tightly. Rogge understood that the emperor meant to ask him to find his way out. However, although the call of the Dark Lord God is not summoned. But the war in this plane may not be lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge decided to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that it is useless to escape now, if this war is lost. No matter where he fled, he could not escape the chasing of the bright church. At most he became the second Rodriguez, but it was only a few years with the Church of Light. What's more, he just found out that his connection with Fengyue has been cut off. Rogge did not dare to think about what happened. Since the Lord God of Heaven can appear in the source of darkness, it is possible no matter what happens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly feels different, and it seems that the surrounding space has undergone a minor change. He slightly appreciated this faint change, his face suddenly changed, jumping from the high platform, standing on the front line full of the mage's tower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when, the night has become night, the blue sky has been replaced by the evening dress, and the night is full of brilliant stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night and the sudden change of the night, just because the beautiful man who sits next to the pope has opened his eyes. Even after a long distance, Rogge can clearly see the distant night sky and endless stars in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night that comes from his eyes reveals mysterious, delicate and fragile beauty, consistent with his appearance. It’s just that there are endless murders in this beautiful star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever he is, all the Masters are struggling with pain, and the more powerful the Master, the less powerful they are struggling! At the beginning of the night, two dazzling magic torches lit up on the high platform of the Allies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana ignited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Rogge passed the term like a flash of lightning. For this spell that is not part of the orthodox magic system, Rogge is no stranger, even he himself can use the dragon's eye to ignite the magic of the Master. However, it is deliberate, and at most one is to deal with one or two wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with that person, wherever the eyes are, it is the domain of mana igniting. This, what is this god power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was still a line of hope in the battle, when the man opened his eyes, it was completely desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only high-ranking mages who can rely on the overwhelming advantage to reverse the situation, but in the field of mana igniting, the more powerful the mage The more difficult it is to protect itself. Moreover, the magical powers in the field of mana igniting at this moment are far from the comparison of Rogge's dragon's eye, and all the masters with divine mana are not affected by the influence of mana! This is to say. It is now that the Allied side has begun to have an overwhelming Master advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great Andreioli, before your break of the law. Everything that does not believe in the Lord is only destroyed. The glory of the Lord, look It is necessary to shine in every corner of this plane." On the high platform, the pope slowly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreoli seems to be arbitrarily scanning the entire battlefield, but wherever his sight falls, where the mana burning field will be multiplied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing the words of the Pope, he smiled lightly and said in a soft and ethereal voice: "I have not done anything. All this glory and glory should be attributed to me." Lord. Great dissmasen. Of course, the great Setanistoria has done a lot, and his brilliance should not be ignored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the call of Andre Orly, the two great angels who came to this plane with him came out from the void, and they summoned a chariot that burned the heavenly flame. Then, in the cheers of countless holy knights, flew toward the Allies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope raised his hand and Augustus immediately leaned forward and listened to his instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Augustus, let the war end as soon as possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blood angel nodded and then flew into the air. With the long sword in his hand, he pointed to the front line where the party has begun to present chaos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night, Shenghui is constantly lit up, dozens of sacred knights appear one by one, and their looming wings are slowly waving behind them. At the moment around the high platform, hundreds of mysterious warriors who have stood still have also sneaked into their robe, smashing into a group of people and swiftly rushing toward the covenant army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a fierce silvery light appeared in the night, which was self-defeating, and instantly broke through the half of the sky and finally fell on one foot. On the huge angel of the flame chariot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep black boots of the demon lotus stick out from the void, seemingly inadvertently stepping on the flame chariot. Then, if there is no power fluctuations, it will spread to every corner of the heavenly chariot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly bursts into a ball of fire up to 100 meters. Then a silver lightning broke through the sky. This lightning is so dazzling, it even makes the huge incomparable fireball look eclipsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was two sounds of thunderous roaring between heaven and earth. In this roaring roar, the Venus of a demon lotus finally appeared, her lip is sharply and now overflowing with the golden blood, and the eyes shining with the golden cross star stare at her. The blood angel coming, Augustus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She holds a huge wing originally belonging to Aga in her left hand, the wing is still twitching painfully, and her dragon soul gun has long since left. Nailed on the wings of another huge angel, Lennon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel who lost a whole wing fell to the ground, and he couldn’t hold a few meters of flame in his golden armor. Turned into a huge fireball, and then roared in the camp of the Alliance side, the sudden burst of the flames of the flames swept over thousands of fighters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennon struggled painfully in the sky, and he could no longer control the flame chariot. The chariot burning with flaming flames flew aimlessly forward, then drawn an arc and fell into the camp of the party. The next moment, the raging flames rose into the sky, eventually forming a mushroom-shaped fire cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly came a long dragonfly, the sacred dragon did not know where to drill, bite the dragon soul gun, and then desperately Shantou! Lennon snarled and the backhand pierced the sword of the Holy Flame into the chest of the sacred dragon. The sacred dragon made a painful dragon scorpion, biting the dragon soul gun, and turned away and fled to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Dragon Soul Warrior, wearing two huge wings that are still open and close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennon is still in power, and then the scars behind it have begun to smear the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope sighed. There is no power in the air: "I am incompetent, let Otto Reh restore power in this plane, destroy the two angelic power angels you bring..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Andreioli smiled faintly, his eyes were not placed on Wella, but with Rogge, he casually said: "No, servants like Aga and Lennon. I have already been in front of the seat." There are too many."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Rogge has already landed on the platform standing on the mage, taking a crumbling Froya in his arms. . She looked pale as paper. The silver tooth bites the lower lip and is desperately suppressing the magic that is boiling in the body. When she was held in her arms, she was like a small boat hiding in a safe haven, and her expression eased. Not only her, Roger's magic in several mage in the middle of the week has gradually subsided, and the Master who is farther away from Rogge is still suffering, from time to time someone turns into a shining magic torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See this strange. The surviving mages on the high platform are desperately squeezing toward Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk, I immediately want to send you away, then you will find a place to hide, don't be discovered by the light church. Remember?" The fat gentle kiss on her lips, tasted on the tip of her tongue. A trace of bitter taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gale hit the high platform, and the ruthless mages around Rogge were blown off the platform. The appearance of Miro in the wind, what he had just said, Rogge suddenly stood up and sent Fu Luoya to his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro was taken aback. Road: "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty Road: "Take her away immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, why don't you escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and turned to look at the direction of the Shenghui League, sighing: "I?" ...I can't escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro looked down at Rogge's gaze, seeing a few kilometers away, that pair of eyes hiding thousands of stars I was looking at Rogge. Miro no longer talked, and picked up Fu Luoya and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war situation has now become a massacre. Dozens of Augustus showed a faint light wing of the sacred knight, like a meteor, and rushed into the dark fog that is still in the doldrums. The black fog was still a moment, and then a central column of inflammation was rising. Straight up to hundreds of meters high. This gradually dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where the Yan column rises, only a blank area with a diameter of 100 meters is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class took the stiletto in his hand from the throat of a Templar. The feet swayed slightly. He looked at the new group of churches that came up, and his face gradually became dignified. Each group will have two or three melee warriors, a long-range attacker, several mages, and one or two Templars who specialize in protecting the Master. With this combination, this group of churches is enough to send a Sanctuary strongman to the path of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few strong people who can break through the sanctuary, but the sanctuary close to the sanctuary can be cultivated in large numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the power of the horror in the hands of the sword, the Death Class has sent the two groups of churches to no return. But in a blink of an eye, the third group was surrounded by him. The class does not expect to have assistance. He knows that all the sacred strongs in the area will certainly face the threat of two or three groups of churches. He took a deep breath and gathered the last vindictiveness. He gently shocked the seven-colored swords in his hands and suddenly leaped from the top of the church and threw himself at the mages who were hiding in the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming sound of a slap, a pure water blue sword with a smothered gas smashed the sword of the Death Class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this war-torn battlefield, Pross looks so calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurricane or flame with destructive power is constantly falling in the sky, with white or golden feathers falling in between. Under the night, there are scattered colorful lights and drifting space gaps. It is impossible to see the figures of Wella and Augustus fighting in a deadly battle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved the blade of Molke with one hand, clinging to the starry sky in one hand, swept through the two groups of sacred churches like a breeze, leaving behind only behind More than ten broken bodies. Then he stretched out his arms and stopped nearly a hundred of the churches that swarmed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whether the fat man is charging, retreating, soaring or hiding, Andreioli’s eyes are always locked on him, and there has never been a slight deviation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This six-winged angel with a day of stars seems to have no interest in other people, and does not care about the progress of the battle. Just Ningning fixedly looked at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this extremely fierce battlefield, the passage of time is very slow. Miro, who was holding Froya's flight, did not fly out of the battlefield until this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a populous voice between the heavens and the earth, but the powerful voice: "...the Lord said, it should stop, and will not move forward!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How familiar is this sound...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the world completely lost color. There is another sound that is clear enough to wear the golden cracked stone: "God said, when the water is gone, go without it! It should be forward..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, the world has completely turned into a world where black and white dominate everything, and it is also a world of absolute silence. At this moment, the voice of Effie has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge knows that this time the Pope’s great prophecy was disturbed, so the rest of the world will not last as long as the previous prophecy. His mind moved slightly, looking up at the sky that lost color. I did several actions in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this quiet world, only the voice of the pope is still echoing in the depths of everyone’s soul: "...you are born by the glory of the Lord, adhering to it The glory of the Lord is done. But at the end of the path of abandonment and depravity, all the glory that you steal will dissipate, only the heavy chains..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The estimate of the grid is correct. The Pope’s words have not been finished, and the world has restored its original color. At the moment when everything ended, the figure of Rogge disappeared from the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s finger turned to the void. At his finger, Wella echoed from the void, and the dark black demon was entwined with dozens of criss-crossed chains of light, which could not shrink with the Pope's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the voice of Effie rang again: "In the name of the gods, give the angels in front of the eyes of the free action..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky bursts with splendid fireworks, and the locks lock the Wella chains one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just under two conflicting prophetic spells. Effie’s voice suddenly murmured. At this time, Constantine’s tall figure was in front of Effie, and the hands of the faithful cockroaches stretched forward, and they resisted the fierce energy of the two in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s gaze crossed the distance of a kilometer and fell on Constantine’s body, seemingly sighing with great regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin shouted, and the sun was shining like a flame, and forced to withstand the impact of the two prophetic techniques! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he immediately discovered that all the holy forces in his body are like snow and sun, melting quickly! In the blink of an eye. The turbulent flow of energy formed by the two prophetic entanglements has found a breakthrough. If the flash floods suddenly, rush into the body of the cardinal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy of the madness did not damage the body of the Cardinal. It blows away his fallen soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the dissipated consciousness, Constantine’s soul repeatedly echoed the Pope’s prophecy: “...but at the end of the path of abandoning and degrading, Everything you steal will be dissipated..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the shackles of faith burst. Until the last moment, the Cardinal did not understand how he fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal of the stalwart body slowly fell, he finally could not give Effie more wings. However, the Pope's big prophecy resounded to the world again, and this time the goal was directed at Effie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord controls everything, the Lord creates the world! The Lord says that it will be destroyed, that is, it will not exist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Effie opened his mouth, but only spewed out a blood, no sound can not be sent out. In fact, all the sounds on the battlefield have been suppressed by the Pope's great prophecy. The voice of the pope is so loud that most people can't hear anything at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a sigh of sighs, Xiusi quietly appeared in front of Effie. The calmness, dignity, and sorrow that can't be said at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes raised his hand to Effie, and the loud voice was as good as the Pope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord controls everything, the Lord creates the world. The Lord says that if he wants to live forever, he will be immortal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This time the two opposite prophecies met, and the sound was a silent thunder! Thunder suddenly spread thousands of miles. As for what kind of storm has been provoked in this plane, and how many tangible and intangible beings have been destroyed, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, he picked up Effie, who was unable to stand. Slowly stepped into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! A beautiful tea pot fell to the ground and smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Verna wings are in the sky. The remaining chains on the demon lotus disappeared. She stared at the giant sword that Augustus had stabbed, and her face became colder and colder. From the moment she played, she killed two powerful angels in a short time, and fought with the blood angel Augustus, and suffered the impact of the Pope’s prophecy, even though she was known as the perfect angel of fighting art. At this moment, the power has been drawn to the edge of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Andreioli is still on the high platform! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe others can't see. But in the eyes of Wella, the six sky-blue wings were clearly reflected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina has a bitter bitterness in her heart. When she has to fall, she knows that there will always be such a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also tried to resist, but the overwhelming sense of powerlessness is always in the chest, so she will be in the field of God. Wella knows that no matter how far forward she is in the gods, she is impossible to match the glory of the heavenly god. So always. She is waiting for the advent of Judgment Day in numbness, and is ready to accept all fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of memory was sealed by her at the deepest part of the origin of God. She believes that Fengyue can't see this memory. However, when Judgment Day really came, Wei Na discovered that the taste of suffering the fate was so bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fell into awkwardness slightly, but still instinctively grabbed the sword of the Great Sword. It’s just that Augustus’s giant sword suddenly misses. It even escaped the power of Wei Na as a light stone. Weina was shocked to find that the result was even a surprise to Augustus! Before she pursued her, the face of the blood angel changed, and the flash of the figure appeared 100 meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his original position, there was a flash of blue water, and then an empty fat man was cut out to show his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to do! Go away!" The fat man roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't go!" The fat man screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a soft voice suddenly coming from the void: "That may not be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound Not falling, Adelaide has stepped out of the air, blocking Andreioli staring at Rogge's line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre Orion outside of the kilometer couldn’t sit still, but his mouth was slightly smiling, and he seemed to stare at Adrienne inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne snorted. The body immediately spewed a raging black flame. In a blink of an eye, it turned into a burning torch! Adelene in the flames endured the suffering of the magic, but she did not call. Not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a hell of his ah!" The fat man screamed and appeared in front of Adriani, welcoming Ander. Ray Orly's gaze. Then an invisible force field emanated from him, shrouded Adrienne's body, and instantly extinguished the black flame on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the fat man returning to his own sight, the six wings are adorned with stars, and the eyes are again gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next change is completely beyond the imagination of Wella. She only felt that she had a flower in front of her, and there was already a dying Ade Renee in her arms; then her back wings were tight and she was caught by a fat man. Wella was soft and immediately felt an irresistible force, and she was thrown into the space storm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly felt puzzled, just a short moment, somehow, her senses and reactions seemed to be a hundred times slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ripples in the space have not yet been dissipated, and the blood angels wrapped in the flames are flying in the air, and the swords in his hands are lit up. A little bit of precision, when the space barrier has not fully recovered, Willa will be forced out of the void again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
