			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream scroll five recalls<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter five recollection<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a warm darkness, there is finally a little light. This spot gradually expanded, and a smiling face appeared in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller snorted and slowly opened his eyes. He is still very uncomfortable with the intense light around him. It takes a long time to distinguish the surrounding scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you awake?" A very familiar voice came from the Orc. He tried to remember where he heard the sound, but his thoughts were still very embarrassing, like floating in the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to make a move, but found that the feeling of the body was just a blank. He wanted to breathe, a mouth, and an ice-cold liquid in his throat that completely blocked his throat. Ogan Heller is a bit strange, he obviously can't breathe, but why isn't he still feeling depressed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar voice said again: "It seems that you are not very comfortable, but everything will soon be better, the respected Ogan Heller Grand Sacrifice "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sacrifice casts his gaze on the source of the sound. After a few minutes of staring at the speaker, his slow thinking is remembered. I saw this fat man in front of the beast training hall. Immediately, the raging fire, the shrine that collapsed, and the orcs who smashed in the fire flashed through his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinctive anger makes Ogan Heller want to raise his left hand and solve his opponent with the powerful magic recorded in the magic book. But his left arm did not feel at all. He also wants to swing his right hand's staff. His usual staff has a strong curse skill, but his right hand feels nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a great sacrifice in the end of the anger and wanted to pounce on the front. Bite your opponent's neck with your sharp teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fangs are still there, but the action of jumping and swooping can only be thought of in the heart, and there is no reaction at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "It seems that you started to think about some past things, but you still don't understand the situation. Or, I think you are roughly like this. I can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A magic mirror appeared in front of Ogan Heller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one skull in the mirror, and it stands strangely in the crystal tray. His pale green skin is now covered with a thick layer of gray, and the entire neck is immersed in a gray-black liquid that is ten centimeters deep. The liquid in the dish exudes a strong stench. Like the corpse of a certain creature, even the smell of the beast body feels that the big sacrifice also feels unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most amazing thing is the big sacrifice. He is still alive, and he can live in this form! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not to be surprised, because I am a necromancer who is not too bad, and the existence of a special form of life is the essence of Necromancer. "The fat man who looks good and good seems to know what the big sacrifice is thinking, directly answering the question in his heart, and then said: "My name is Rogge. You may have heard of me, maybe I don't know my existence at all. But this There is no problem. I think we can talk about it now. Ah, I almost forgot to water you, so that you can be more comfortable and think faster."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, Rogge took a copper pot and poured a bit of magical and life-filled water on Ogan Heller's head. The power contained in the clear water quickly infiltrated into the skin of the Great Sacrifice, which made him feel refreshed and his thinking was much faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and sat in front of Ogan Heller. Tao: "We have a lot of topics to talk about, such as the history of the orc empire, or you can talk about the Prophet of the Earth, talk about the beast. If you are willing to explain the magic you use, or educate the little orcs I am also very interested in the plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orc Festival sacrificed a lot of instinct, he said coldly: "You killed my child. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone. At least 150,000 elves in the Green Sea are dead in the hands of the orcs?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog smiled and said: "But as far as I know, the orcs have always been the first to attack the elf territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller's eyes are low, low and authentic: "That's because the elves occupy the most abundant forests and occupy the best source of water! The food in the Central Mountains is very limited. Every winter, there will always be hungry orc tribes eating out of food. They have no choice but to choose. Going to attack the Elf territory. Our orcs do have the right to choose, choose the right to die or starve! The orcs have no history of writing, so I don't know whether this situation lasted for hundreds or thousands of years. The great beast god brought us wisdom. It also gave us the opportunity to create an empire and change the fate of the elves by thousands of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Listen to it. Then he asked: "How did the beast gods lower the gods? How did the earth prophet open your wisdom and enable the orcs to use magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god of the beast..." Ogan Heller said half. Suddenly I realized that I had unconsciously regarded Rogge as a good friend for many years. Unconsciously, I have revealed too many secrets to the enemy who is not in the sky. He immediately took his mouth and yelled at Rogge: "You don't want to put any orc secrets out of my mouth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled a little, Stand up and say: "Well, since you don't want to say it, then I will be welcome. In my place, the beast god can't bless you. I will let you fully understand that a necromancer can do it. Before you, I have met many people who believe in piety and determination, but the soul of all people can't stay in the fire of the undead for more than a week. Dear Ogan Heller, I hope that you can break this record. I am very patient. As long as I can dig out all your memories, I don't mind waiting for half a month or a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is holding a large Sacrifice the skull's tray, step into the magic lab, and put it into the magical array on the stage. The invisible and colorless death flame erupted from the three pale gems in the magical array and began to burn Ogan Heller's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the distorted face of Ogan Heller, Rogge faintly said to him: "Dear dear sacrifice. I think there are two things I forgot to tell you." The first is that the beast god you believe does not exist at all. Second, I think that some orcs who have been led by wisdom survived that night. They will naturally become the heads of the remaining orcs, and I will each At some time, the killer will be sent to inspect the orc tribes in the Central Mountains, and to the most gracious greetings to these outstanding leaders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed the experiment Room room door, rushed to the chapel of the Great Shrine, this afternoon. He also personally presided over a religious ceremony for hundreds of special cultists. The reason why these believers are special is not because of their piety. It is because they all have the right, or the power, or the important children of the nobles. There are also many young people who have outstanding talents in some respects, although they are low-ranking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man knows that although these people are yelling at the highest goddess O'Reilly, all the believers are equal, but everyone is very self-conscious, mouth What I said and what I thought was totally different. If they really let them enjoy the same treatment as ordinary believers. I am afraid they will have to make trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty knows how to deal with this guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time, he or Mora will personally preside over a ceremony for these believers. During the ceremony, the furnishings were extremely luxurious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mora and Rogge’s speech sermons are different, but they are very popular. The eternal theme of Mora Cloth is the belief in the goddess, unconditional, absolute faith. Since the combination of the two religions, Mora has become more and more holy and dusty, just like the only clear spring in the world. She is very good at her own appearance. Every time she preaches, she will consciously and unconsciously launch the natural charm, so it is thrilling. Only by personally listening to it, can you deeply understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Pope Rogge, there is no other scene. Northland advocated the use of force. When Rogge took the soldiers, the fierce and fierce military style was very appetizing for these believers. Therefore, what he said would naturally be convincing. What's more, fat people talk about the beliefs of the present in the face of the majority of believers. And in front of this group of people. He has only talked about this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge tirelessly describes the grand blueprint for the future of the Holy Church, and what benefits these core believers will have as the church develops. The fat man is inspiring and extraordinary. After listening to the sermons that he is close to the official wishes, these young people who are ambitions will listen to the blood. However, when you leave, think carefully, there are very few believers. The wise man will find that Rogge did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to dominate this glory, these believers have proposed to raise the threshold for entering this core group of believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the middle of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fat man pushing the boat. Let these believers have the right to use. If you have money, you will sell your wisdom if you don't have the money. Although this small group is not large, it has contributed a lot to the development of the Holy Church in a short period of time. And anyone who can reach the threshold of joining this group has an extraordinary life experience or talent, and can be accepted by other members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the constant guidance of the fat man, these believers have already regarded themselves as indispensable elites of the Holy Church. In order to distinguish them from ordinary believers, they embroidered a silver plaque in the corner of their own conviction. Since then, the name of the sacred church has gone away. In just one month, whether or not you can join the sacred church is already seen by the imperial youth. Is it a symbol of socialism? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evangelism is not all. See you will unexpectedly grow and develop, and the fat man will provide a rare opportunity for members of the club to accept magic or martial arts guidance. Since then, because of the guidance of the great magician and the sanctuary, the proud members of the squad have become more superior, and they have become obsessed with Pope Rogge. The people outside the meeting have put together the blood, and they also want to drill out a way to join the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, if the empire giants are not members of the squad, it is simply no face. In order to let the children join the club, or to make the members of the family more than one, these giants and nobles have shown to Rogge and help the development of the Holy Church. Rogge’s talent is also a small door for those who have no money but no power but talent. Almost every day, there are more than a dozen people with different talents coming to the Holy Church to ask for volunteer work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of giving up worldly rights. Rogge’s status is transcendent, and he has never thought that the 骷髅 will develop to such a degree that it will become a bond that connects the sacred church with the empire’s giants. The fat man then added more privileges to the members of the club, but the threshold for membership did not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the imperial imperial capital of Ludan Port, if there is a member of a new club, then he must hold a grand banquet. To show off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the afternoon sermon. Even though Rogge was energetic, he felt a little tired. He passed through the Great Temple. I came to an unobtrusive second floor. This old building is the pope hall where he usually deals with the sacred church affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge is not interested in the prosperity of the world, and even if it is to deceive the world and declare that the Pope has a high moral character, it is necessary to live in an old building. Every decision of Rogge now involves all aspects of interest, must be done with caution, and the Holy Church is still a start-up, and the glorious image of the Pope is vital to the development of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just sat down at the desk and there was an ice warrior coming over. Speak to him a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the four ice warriors carried a dark black wooden box and came in. Rogge went to the wooden box and opened the lid. Looked inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a female body with a red luo lying in the long wooden box, and the faint hair can be seen under the loose hair. If she is alive, she must be a good girl. But so her red luo's body is full of bruises, teeth and scratches, and there are also whiplashes on the body. The following is a mess, all bloody. Obviously, this is a woman who has been killed to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge leaned over and opened her eyelids and glanced. There is still light in the woman's pupil, which seems to have not died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stood up straight and pulled out a white pa. Wiping the handcuffs: "According to the usual practice, find a new body and let her rise again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four ice warriors took a gift to Rogge, Re-covered the wooden box and lifted the woman's body. Although they wear the ice temple warrior costumes, each person's personal strength is obviously far superior to the ordinary ice temple warriors. These special ice temple warriors were secretly cultivated by Rogge, but the time was too short to train dozens of people. These warriors are mainly based on the original elves, mainly the samurai who survived the dark side of the moon, and selected several newcomers to complement the tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat back at his desk. Pick up the lesson that has just been revised. Start to study carefully. The book has just been opened, and an ice temple warrior will report: "The deputy head of the ice temple warrior group, Mei Daren, asks for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
