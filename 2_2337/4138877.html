			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the tenth chapter under the watch <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stunning woman has a smile Road: "Sounds, you are very dissatisfied with O'Reilly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am just telling a fact." Fat man looked intently In front of you, the pace has not slowed down at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to know more about some of O'Brien's things, can you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man asked inexplicably: "Are you not a friend of the goddess? You should know more about her than the one who can only look up to her light."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world in everyone's eyes is different. The goddess in your heart is very different from the Austrian knows that I know. Since I am her believer and friend, of course I should know her better. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I saw the glory of the goddess, it was in an underground altar in the eyes of wisdom. Ah, no, it was in a small town." In the pub, the eye of wisdom should be the second time I saw the goddess. The eye of wisdom at that time was just a little cult worshipping the unknown Mozu, but they were lucky enough to somehow summon the goddess. O'Reilly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man originally said something with O'Reilly, and of course concealed Some insignificant disrespectful details, such as having barely touched her barefoot...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very honest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In front of you, honesty is the only correct choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who is born with a bright red eyes suddenly screams and then looks like Somewhat annoyed: "I still haven't had time...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally gave her a look and wanted to ask. But still hold back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she seems to have known what Rogge wants to ask, softly: "I promised O'Reilly to help her fight. But I met." You, when you walked and talked, you lost some time. Now that you have finished playing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog has some accidents and can’t help but ask: "The goddess is In front? She is God, who dares to fight with her? Is her opponent also a god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distance between God and man, In fact, it is not as far away as you think. Of course. The guys who dare to challenge O'Reilly are very difficult to deal with. But they all have one thing in common: arrogance because of strength, arrogance and stupidity. Challenge O'Reilly He itself is a very, very stupid thing. Because she is too fucking. You are her follower, you must know this, or how would you say the disrespectful comment that she is just not punishing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is instinctively afraid of O'Reilly. In his impression, only the servant Serrafi was disrespectful to O'Reilly, but now the stunning woman's evaluation of O'Reilly is simply unscrupulous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of power does God have unimaginable? After reading the Holy Scriptures of the Light, the fat man has had a lot of experience with this issue. Therefore, he is absolutely unwilling to take over this disrespectful topic at this moment. It is difficult to guarantee that his words will not be heard by Audrey Reich in some mysterious way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the woman around herself claimed to be a friend of O'Reilly. Does God have other friends besides another god? For the sake of the world of God, it is better to participate less for the time being. This game is too big, and the current strength of the fat man can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continued: "And you just said 'Goddess in front', there is a big problem. Space is actually a very strange thing. For example Say that I am on the road with you now, and you take it for granted that Audrey is in front. But the direction is not meaningful to her. I will be close to her in any direction. You don't need to really understand this, as long as you can remember how to say it. If you tell these to O'Reilly, she will be shocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that deceiving the goddess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She faintly said: "You are just telling a fact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sweat instantly wets the fat man's clothes, he can't be sure whether the mysterious woman around knows He has reservations. In addition to the bloated head, the fat man can't find other ways to solve his inner fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Rogge immediately denied, " You are so too... beautiful. I can't look at it at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a smile in Yan’s eyes, but Rogge can’t see it at all. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked again: "You are desperately trying to improve your strength. Are you thinking about knocking down O'Brien one day?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not!" This taboo topic, Rogge also categorically denied. "My faith is very religious, how can I think about this kind of thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man can’t help but think, this mysterious woman just said, God and The distance between people is actually not as far away as imagined. What happens if I really knock down O'Reilly one day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s heartbeat is a little faster, and his breathing is a little short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft voice said again: "The power you are now is very messy. It is also impossible to use. Well. You are still changing your body. This is a very dangerous thing. You should try more on other people first, and then use it on yourself. If you continue on this road, the strength will grow very fast, but you can challenge it. Before O'Reilly, you will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Her hands were more than an explosive gesture, and she looked very charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty discretion to say every word, half a day said: "You are not a goddess friend, why ... to challenge me to challenge O'Reilly?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chuckle of the fat man’s ear made him full of fear and heart: "I am of course her friend, and often help her." Fighting. But occasionally we will also have one. I am looking forward to you, a mortal, can be defeated to fight the famous Austrian Aure Reich! As I said, in fact, between you The distance is not so far. As for how pious your faith is, it will naturally show up after she is knocked down by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pair is not harmonious The figure of the ground. Talk about it, all the way to the Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance from Moonlight Dragon City, Rogge stopped. He has a faint silver glow on his body that hides the darkness and death of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting ready, he started again, but this time it was much slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the dragon egg and the young dragon in the front dragon city, there are only a few old dragons that can't fly fast. Don't be so careful." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is now listening to this mysterious woman. He removed the protection according to his words. Run at full speed to the battlefield under the Dragon Peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war seems to have just ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the battlefield, a place hundreds of meters away still exudes amazing heat. The ground here is completely different from the surrounding wasteland. There was a blackened lava around, some of which had not yet fully solidified, and occasionally a bubble appeared and blasted a small magma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the ground of the blackened ground, there are more than ten deep gullies criss-crossed, the fractures are neat and smooth, and it looks like someone is using huge weapons to smash the ground. Traces left behind. Although there are traces left after the fierce battle on the battlefield. But Rogge couldn't see a scattered dragon scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up, closed his eyes and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hint of dragon blood in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious woman did not know when it appeared hundreds of meters away, looking at the ground there. Rogge immediately ran over. There is a huge dragon-shaped black shadow on the ground there, and its claws and claws look alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My things here are over. It's time to go back. I... can you go?" asked the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Mysterious woman smiled lightly and said: "I just chat with you on the road, there is no malicious. Not to mention that you are human. The strong, the dark master and the necromancer, and even the silver dragons dare to frame the powerful characters, where can I get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat He smiled stiffly and immediately strode away and ran to the distance. I don't want to stay more than one moment. <br /><br />############################################################################################################ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man ran for a long time before he dared to stop and take a break. But at this moment, the soft voice sounded in his ear again: "My name is Achilles, don't forget it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog The whole body was immediately stiff. He gritted his teeth and forced himself to calm down and sit under the tree for a while. Continue to run to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the distance. The finger that clasped the dragon soul gun finally relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon soul gun with a cool silvery glow is still so clear, and the hand holding it is a blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. It’s finally over. I can’t see it for a while, Achilles has become so boring.” Wella looked relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not normal for all the heavens to come down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner was furious, but she immediately smiled and countered: "Maybe! But you think Achilles’ mouth is in the middle of O'Reilly and Lo Isn't there a place in the middle of the mouth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is a few black hair fluttering in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wei sees the counterattack, she refuses to relax: "When he knocks down O'Reilly, what method will he use to show his piety? Maybe I should help him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner is not willing to face this volcano that is about to explode. Her fuzzy figure flashed and disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they all have a common worry in their hearts, but no one wants to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger in the chest of the Frost Giants is getting more and more fierce! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Moonlight Dragon City, which should have appeared long ago, has never entered his field of vision. In the seemingly endless journey, the anger of the giant leader could not be vented, only accumulated little by little, waiting for the moment of the outbreak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long journey has accumulated the anger of the frosty giants, but it has gradually weakened their power. In the endless wasteland, the frost giants simply could not find enough food. They only brought enough food to the Moonlight Dragon City when they went out, but the Dragon City did not appear at the scheduled time, so the giants have been hungry for two days. Although the Frost Giants will not die if they do not eat for several months. But hunger will inevitably weaken their power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a blurred outline of a mountain appeared on the horizon. The giants who saw hope have stepped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mountain became clearer, the giant leader suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out to be a bluestone mountain! After nearly half a month on the endless wasteland, the Frost Giants went back to the starting Bluestone Mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the giant has not let go of his doubts, and he saw the rising smoke on the Bluestone Mountain. In the camp of the snow-capped peaks, there are many old people and children of the Frost Giants tribe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home of the robbed giants roared, striding up to the Bluestone Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bluestone Peak seems to have experienced a horrible storm. All buildings, whether they are the palace of the leader or the residence of the ordinary giant. They were completely destroyed. The frost giants living on the top of the ice peak have nothing to property, but their few homes have been piled up in the square by the intruders, and then burned a clean fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the corpse was not seen in the ruins. The chief of the giant had some doubts, and his gaze finally fell on the ruins of the hall of the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader's hall is built on a cliff, with a wide cave behind the hall. That is where the giant sacrifices ancestors and gods. But at this moment, the lord's hall built of megaliths has been razed to the ground by powerful enemies, but only a pile of rocks is exposed, and there is no cave at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant leader suddenly rushed over, he waved his giant hammer and squatted on a huge stone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the loud noise, this huge rock of several meters is broken into more than a dozen pieces. The giant leader, regardless of the splash, shoveled the stone, struggling to push, and a large piece of stone rolled down the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other giant warriors also understood. They went forward to help the leader clear the huge pile of stones that blocked the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the dark and deep cave entrance finally revealed. The old children of dozens of frosted giant tribes in the caves seem to be weak, lying or sitting. It seems that they have been in the dark for a short time, and suddenly the light from the hole into the ground stung their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant leader stepped silently into the cave. The old and weak in the tribe are too weak, and they are already unable to express their joy. If the giant warriors come back one or two days later, then the deceased will inevitably appear among these weak people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a warning. It is also a threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural danger of Qingshishan Xuefeng cannot stop these unknown invaders. If the soldiers of the Frost Giants come out again, the next time they are imprisoned in the cave. It will definitely not be a living person, but a corpse. To defend against intruders, at least half of the soldiers must stay. However, it is no different from sending more than forty giant warriors to attack Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant leader stepped out of the cave, looked at the ruins of the ruins, looked at the snowy peaks around him, looked up at the sky with the lead clouds, and he finally pressed live. Roaring in the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His roar. There are endless anger, and there are also a lot of unwillingness and helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowing. The purpose of achieving war without damage is the highest art of the wise, and the ability to pursue life as a leader. Win the war, sometimes There is no need to kill." Gregorian said in a gentle tone of some condescending attitude, said to Cranho. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has two wings, a huge, beautiful and strong body that slid silently in the air. Just a flight attitude, Gregory is obviously much stronger than the surrounding Silver Dragon Warriors. Except for a few dragons, speed and agility have always been the weakest part of the dragons, and Silver Dragon is no exception. Although in a series of battles, Gregory has never shown the heroic attitude of killing the enemy, but no one now dares to doubt the strength of the sacred dragon. Gregory's faint and sacred sacred atmosphere only shows that it has been hiding power, but no silver dragon can see how much it hides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Gregory’s high theory, Cranio does not quite agree. She always believes that it is not a good idea to let the Frost Giant Warrior return to Qingshi Mountain intact without any overwhelming advantage. Although for the guardian's consideration, the Frost Giant Giant tribe will not invade Moonlight Dragon City again in the near future, but hatred always exists. And it will be passed down from generation to generation. Leaving such an enemy is not good for Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the dominance of war is no longer in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Silver Dragon King suddenly felt a sorrow. Why is the noble and powerful Yinlong family falling into this situation today? Not only by the powerful foreign enemies, but also the Golem Legion, which would not even be placed in the silver dragon eye, dare to smash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black dragon family was firmly suppressed by Yinlong, but the silver dragon has fallen to the top three strongest dragons. Moonlight Dragon City is in front of Black Dragon. There is only the ability to passive defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But after a powerful silver dragon warrior was willing to sacrifice and devote himself to his servant, what did Moonlight Dragon City get? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from another point of view, this war Moonlight Dragon City is defeated, and it is very miserable. After paying a heavy price, Moonlight Dragon City is only a period of tranquility, which may be decades. It may also be hundreds of years. However, the enemy of Yinlong has not been solved, and hidden dangers still exist. Moonlight Dragon City won, but it was a breathing time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the breath and the immediate demise, Cranio has no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the Battle of Dragon City and Tang Ke Bakala, she is still vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangk Bakkara finally spit out the last syllable of the spell when the almost heart-stopping moment passed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of nearly completely transparent flames shrouded a silver dragon in the sky, this is a flame beyond imagination! In the eyes of the powerful silver dragon warrior, just a flash of panic, the amber eyes became turbid in a very short time. The color also dimmed until it became a lifeless black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is also like the dragon's eye. After the whole body shines, it instantly turns from bright silver to light brown, dark brown, and pure black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark black silver dragon lost the ability to float, so as to maintain the posture of trying to escape, fell to the ground. The huge dragon body just touched the ground. It burst into a very fine black ash, and it was blown away by the cold wind that never stopped on the wasteland, leaving only a dark shadow on the earth that already existed in the ancient times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It even has a roar in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangke Bakala also fell, but his huge dark red body was poured into the boiling magma. If a huge stone is put into the lake, Don Kebala quickly sinks into the depths of the magma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red lava hell slowly dissipated, and the boiling magma gradually subsided and solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war finally ended with the victory of Silver Dragon, but looking at the dark black shadow on the ground, Cranio could not be happy anyway. The result of only killing a silver dragon should be said to be very good, but it is good, but it is reflected in the abstract figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More, the flame tyrant Donk Bakala was not destroyed at all. He passed through the magma. Has returned to the abyss gap. It’s just that he was hit hard this time and didn’t have a hundred years of dormancy. I want to reply to the original strength. At the end of the war, Cranio finally knew why Donk Bakala dared to challenge the entire Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His original intention is to kill the silver dragon as much as possible in the early battles in a war of attrition, and at the end of the melee, the flame tyrant will be lava Hell drives away the silver dragon that is close to the body, and the 'inflammation soul' that can be triggered in his sight can instantly burn a normal silver dragon, and then move back to the abyss gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangke Bakala gave up the flight, gave up the sensitivity, and switched back to the ability to move back into the gap of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of Donk Bakala, the magic of the display is uninterruptible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of all this is a hundred years of sleep. Maybe for decades, maybe hundreds of years later, Tang Ke Bakakara, who has recovered his strength and woke up from the slumber, will once again embark on the journey to the Moonlight Dragon City! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a senseless war..." Whenever he thought of Nicholas and thought of the dragon shadow on the wilderness, Cranio wanted to cry. Although she has been a silver dragon king for a while, she is too young after all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a wonderful war! Unfortunately, the conversation with Rogge is more exciting, and it’s too late to intervene in the war.” Achilles thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the edge of a stream on a snowy peak, the white feet were immersed in the ice-cold stream, kicking the water and splashing There are countless clear drops of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beam of sunlight shines through the thick clouds, illuminating the water droplets in the air, and refracting into a colorful rainbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanxi, Xuefeng, Iridescent and beautiful, constitute a suffocating picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
