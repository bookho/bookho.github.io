At this time, the elves have already built a thick chest wall at the exit, and hundreds of elf archers are waiting behind the chest wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads of the orcs are standing on the distant hills and pointing to the peaks where the elves’ underground fortress is located. They were very surprised and did not understand why the elves who had always been very disgusted with darkness and dampness would build a fortress in the mountainside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious person headed out took out the crystal plate and looked again. Then the yellow and green light flashed in his eyes and said: "All the elves are in front of us! Start attacking Prepare for natural disasters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commands are passed on to the different orc troops one by one. An unusually tall orc looks at the elves behind the chest wall and screams. The hammer in the hand pointed forward. Two hundred wolves, the trombone, rushed out of the battlefield and rushed to the elves' positions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical longbow in the hand of the elf shooter couldn’t keep flashing. In the blink of an eye, each shooter shot more than three long arrows. The wolves dodge quickly and can't avoid such intensive and precise arrow rain. With a scream of wolf, a few long arrows were inserted into each werewolf. Only the wolf's skin is tough, and the body is covered with well-made plate armor, so the elves' long arrows can only be inserted into their bodies more than ten centimeters. This little injury, for the werewolf who is more than two meters tall, can hardly be said to be painless. The wolves who are in the arrow are still flying. They waved their hands and bent their axe. A big step was a distance of four or five meters, which quickly brought them closer to the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc frontline commander screamed again, and a thousand orcs were running with the axe orc warriors and rushing forward with the werewolf forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Green Sea battle, it has been proven that the well-equipped Werewolf is the natural enemy of the Elf Shooter. It’s just for the elves of the Green Sea. Now these elf shooters are all from the city of gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of a werewolf has several arrows. He rushed, and there was a sudden turbidity in his eyes. One fell to the ground, the large group of white foam could not stop pouring out of the mouth, the limbs helplessly twitching, and stopped all movements in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell to the ground, less than ten meters from the elf shooters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, dozens of werewolves fell down one by one, just twitching on the ground. It will never move again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc warriors behind the werewolf glimpsed that the werewolves who were more agile and fierce than themselves suddenly fell down, and could not help but be amazed and slowed down. It was this hesitant effort. The elf shooters shot two more arrows and then quickly returned to the underground fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc warriors finally circumvented behind the chest wall after paying a hundred lives, and they looked at the deep hole that was several meters high and bottomless. Can't help but stay. At this time, the buzz of the orc's front line behind them was starting again. Then these disciplined soldiers no longer hesitated and rushed into the underground fortress of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc generals and priests on the mountain saw the fiercely capable werewolves and orc warriors as soon as they got the arrow, they immediately fell down and their faces changed. A troll shaman suddenly screamed: "Poison! It is poison! This is a violent poison than the swamp of the swamp arrow frog! Are they really elves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"They are indeed elves!" The mysterious man slowly said: "We orcs can make such a big change under the guidance of the beast, and the elves naturally have some changes. But no matter how they change, Can't escape the fate of destruction! Pass my orders. Prepare and start the natural disaster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long beast rang through the valley, hundreds of fierce troll warriors The fish went up the mountain. In the hands of every troll warrior, there is an elf girl who is completely red. In the cold wind, the beautiful bodies of the elf girls have been frozen and blue, and their lips have completely turned purple. In their beautiful eyes, they are full of shame, shame and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orc generals and priests have stepped back. Only the mysterious man who has been replaced by a red-inlaid robes stands in the middle of many elf girls. His eyes closed. Slowly mourn the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than ten orc shamans at the same time who also began to curse, and their curses are like beasts. The spell is short and powerful. As the shaman's spells were finished one by one, the elf girls began to reveal the bloody red glow of the curse. They no longer trembled because of the cold, the blood temperature of the whole body was rising sharply, and the face began to show great pain. But their necks were tightly held in the hands of the troll warriors behind them, and they struggled helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the summit of the underground fortress, Rogge and Hughes stood in the wind, looking at the distant mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of ritual they are holding. This magical array is very familiar and should be related to some kind of dark spell. Hey, these orcs pull so much. What does the elf do, is it a blood sacrifice? That is to say, the power of this magical ritual should not be small!" Rogge carefully recognized the magical array of orcs built on the mountains, slowly speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has seen the one-hundred-year-old elf girl who was put on the magic circle, his face has already become iron blue. His eyesight is excellent, and it has been seen that these elf girls are quite good in appearance and size. And from the point of view of bones and muscles, the talent for practicing martial arts is also selected. Any one of them, the elf girl, will be exchanged for a small fortune in the slave market, but these rough orcs seem to be planning to take them to do the magic ritual sacrifices. How does the fat man feel bad? The thought of these elf girls should have belonged to him, and the anger in Rogge's chest was burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you don’t use these elves in exchange for wealth, train them well. Will also become a very good shooter. How big is the power of a hundred elf shooters? For this problem, the long-awaited Rogge is no longer clear. Not to mention the elf shooter under his command, the equipment is poison arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it possible to save them?" Rog asked to Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a lot of strong people here, and this is not impossible." Hughes said slowly: "But if you want to do something big, you have to pay some price." Saving them out will affect our entire plan. Their blood...will be repaid with enough orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A murderous. When I saw that the 200,000-year-old elf in the Green Sea only escaped 50,000, when he saw hundreds of elves to be the blood sacrifice of the magic ritual in front of him, his unchanging elegance finally revealed the anger of the sensation. meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the opposite side of the mountain. The elf girls suddenly screamed in unison! The savage claws of the troll warriors have broken their chests and put them under the curse. The heart that has swollen nearly doubled has been smashed out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snowy girl ** fell down, under the snowy skin, the bright red blood flowing out, long along the ground Good dents spread out. The blood of the hundred elf girls is like this, slowly sketching out a huge and horrible magical array! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troll warriors put the heart that is still in the palm of their hands on the back of the elf girls red luo, and the huge heart is like a monster. , explored countless blood vessels. Deeply pierced the pale skin of the elf girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of sacrificial offerings and shamans of all races are in their place and begin to mourn different spells. The mysterious man standing in the center of the circle suddenly snorted and screamed with his hands up! Then the hundred elf girls on the ground looked up and opened their eyes! Their pupils have turned dark red, and if there is thick blood, they are constantly flowing. With the mysterious man's curse, the elf girls opened their mouths one by one, and spewed a dark cloud of dark ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side of the battlefield, Roger looked more and more frowned. He did not think that the orcs who had always been known for their magical roughness would have the surgeons who could drive such horrific magical rituals. After another observation, Rogge suddenly said: "I know! The ceremony they held was a natural disaster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Scourge?" For a moment, I finally said: "...let them let the ceremony be done!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you need some helper?" A slightly hoarse sexy Ringed behind Rogge and Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adeline! It turned out to be you. If you are willing to help, then of course it is better. Just, you will not just want to help me. Say. What are the conditions?" The fat man is not in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne smiled softly and her body was full of emotions. It’s just her face, how it looks is plain. She said: "Conditions? With your land as a person, even if you agree to my conditions, wouldn't you regret it? It seems that you have never regarded the promise as a matter of fact."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just like a hostile talent. In my own life, I have always had a good reputation." The fat man stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne laughed and said: "Well, I believe that you have a good reputation. If you say the conditions, then this time you will help you, even if you change it." The goodwill of your cooperation in the future is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Rogge promised, but he was thinking, if Adelene joined, then How much the elves will lose their casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge promised, Adelene did not poke on the fat man’s heart, she looked at the opposite mountain, faintly said: “The orcs actually Preparing for natural disasters, it saved me a lot of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She danced with her hands and weaved more than ten gestures in the air that made Rogge look dazzling, a space The door is generated as such. After the magical light flashed, Miro stepped out of the space door. There was another new giant hammer in his hand, but it was obviously far worse than the original one. He looked at Rogge with a cold eye. Did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the sky suddenly dimmed. Rog looked up and saw that the air was still a thin cloud, but if the thin clouds were like a layer of gauze, then they are now a completely opaque iron plate. And the dark black of the clouds in the dark red color of the clouds still can't spread, covering most of the sky in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, the dark sky is like a crack. There are lines of light that transmit red light rays from the top. Looking up from the bottom up, there is a huge behemoth in the sky. Its body is huge enough to cover the entire sky. And those bloody lines are the wounds on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky began to burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the bloody red lines actually flow out a thick dark red liquid, such as tears, like blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the drooping strips on the sky, such as bloody viscous liquid, drop. With a slamming sound, it fell on the open space between the Orc Army and the Elven Underground Fortress. Splashed into countless tiny blood drops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can tell if this drop of blood drops in the sky actually exists, but everyone sees that the ground it fell is quickly The ground was dyed dark black. This black, which cannot be turned away, is like life, and it is still spreading out. In the central part of the black, dark red blood lines have appeared faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the orc’s frontline commander did not notice the vision between heaven and earth. His eyes were just staring at the deep entrance of the elk underground fortress, not in the nostrils. The living room was sprayed with white air. The chest walls of the elves have been removed by the orcs, revealing the entrance to the underground fortress, which is high and deep behind. In front of the orc commander. It seems that the entire mountain of the underground fortress has turned into a behemoth, and the entrance to the underground fortress is a giant beak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thousand orcs who went into the underground fortress disappeared into the darkness and there was no response. He also sent a second team of thousands of orcs to go and meet, but this group of orcs also entered the sea like mud, and disappeared silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc frontline commander waited for a while. Finally decided not to wait. He raised his three-headed chain in his hand and screamed, stepping forward! Behind him, 10,000 orc warriors ran up and began to rush to the elves underground fortress! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc commander did not notice that he had embarked on the ground in the black blood. He just suddenly felt a feeling of discomfort and powerlessness under his feet, and of course he was mixed with a little disgusting. But these slight feelings are simply insignificant for the orcs who are physically strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc commander suddenly felt an uncontrollable anger from the bottom of my heart! He snarled in the sky. Flying and rushing into the Elf Fortress. Behind him, the 10,000 orcs also roared, and if they had a nest of wild bees, they rushed into the underground fortress of the elves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the distance, the orc army is still rigorous, but the soldiers’ eyes have gradually become dark red. It is more and more difficult for them to suppress the turmoil in their hearts. It is only under the commander's majesty that they can resist and rush to the Elf Fortress to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mountain, the mysterious figure is heading to the sky, still mourning the incomparably long spell. Around him, the blood of the Elf girls has drawn a complete magical array. They are already dead, but in the hands of this horrible warlock, death is only the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their naked back, the huge deformed heart is madly pulsating. The snowy cock seems to be still suffering from tremendous pain after death, and writhing. And their heads were lifted up desperately, looking at the mysterious figure standing in the center of the magical array, the empty eyes kept shed tears of blood, and kept crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious character slowly turned for a week, suddenly madly spit out the last note of the spell! A bloody red light rises from the thin body of his body and goes straight to the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is completely dark, shining through the world, only the dark red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is silent for a moment, and it reverberates in the wind. Only the elf girls were enlarged and weeped thousands of times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the orcs are boiling! They involuntarily roared into the sky, their eyes were completely occupied by the blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the natural disaster, the natural disaster caused by the blood and soul of the hundred elf girls! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of natural disasters, all the power of darkness, chaos, bloodthirsty and even the dead will increase, and the light and divine power will be suppressed, everything Creatures belonging to the Light and Holy Camp will continue to be invaded by the curse of natural disasters, and power and life will continue to drain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of the natural disaster is so vast. It enveloped the entire elder underground fortress. Although it also affects the discipline of the orcs, but the elves will bear the ground will be weakened by strength and vitality. And the magic that the elves are good at will be greatly suppressed, but the curse and bloodthirsty magic that the orc shaman and the ritual are good at will be enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield where hundreds of thousands of warriors fight for each other, this will be a factor in determining the success or failure of the game, not to mention that the elves are originally in quantity. Absolute disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural disasters that are launched by the blood of the elves will have a special effect on the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of blood descended from the sky and landed on Rogge’s face. Splashing a small blood flower. A thick tongue suddenly stretched out, rolled up the blood flower, and took back his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original...this is a natural disaster!" After the fat man tasted for a long time, he murmured. He spurted a thick stream of blood, which led him to bow his head and his eyes were red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clenched his fists, his muscles squirming in his arms, and there are countless strange and tiny creatures hidden under his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked at the impulsive warriors who couldn’t hold their chest and couldn’t stop screaming. Plainly said: "It’s time to kill..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slammed the clothes on his chest and looked up to the sky, screaming Then, take a big step and jump from the top of the peak to the dense orc warriors below! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unusually tall werewolf suddenly felt some abnormality. He immediately looked up and saw the fat man who was jumping in midair. He opened his mouth and wanted to call the troll hunters to throw the spears to end the unscrupulous guests in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the wolf's sensitive ear suddenly screamed. He just wanted to look around and look for the source of the bowstring sound of the Qing Dynasty. He felt that the blue light flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the werewolf clearly felt that the wind with the power of infinite curse was passing through his mind! Why does the wind pass through his mind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the fat man has been inexhaustible and landed in the beast. The power of his leaping from the summit is so fierce. Unfortunately, the two orcs at his feet were immediately stepped down. The entire chest was stepped down. The fat man's eyes are red and the shot is like electricity. One hand grabbed a big handle with a curved handle from the hand of a werewolf, then hit the backhand with an axe handle and smashed his huge wolf head. The fat man smiled and danced a giant axe, and in a blink of an eye he dismembered several orc warriors around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hurricane suddenly rushed from behind to Rogge! A two-headed monitor lizard with a body length of six meters smashed several orc warriors and rushed over to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man snorted, turned, stepped, and was already set in the two heads of the giant lizard! He raised his hand and had a two-meter long blade concealed by the shadow on his fingertip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long blade swings from the bottom up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands in the same place, one finger day, but the shadow is long and I don’t know when it has disappeared. The two-headed monitor lizard couldn't stop the momentum, and all the way to the fat man stopped dozens of meters behind him. It has just stabilized, it is a sorrow, the huge body is divided into two pieces, slowly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the gap between the orcs around him, the fat man quickly recited a short spell, so within ten meters of his body, everything was dyed. A layer of faint black, the devil's face appears from time to time, and as he moves, this enchantment will follow him. Under the natural disaster, this layer of black can hardly be seen, but all the orcs who enter this area will continue to be invaded by various curses. In the twinkling of an eye, there are dozens of orcs who are in chaos, or In the fear, more orcs are in the midst of a curse of weakness, and the combat power plummets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looks up. Looking towards the mysterious man on the mountain, I laughed a little. The mysterious man was also looking at him, and the yellow-green eyes were filled with anger, and even his body could not tremble under anger. The fat man recognized the natural disaster, and the mysterious figure also recognized the magic that Rogge cast at the moment, the dark enchantment. The dark enchantment will continue to strike the victim within the scope of the sphere with the power of darkness. The orc warriors' magic resistance is good, but it is extremely weak when fighting magic like curses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under natural disasters. All the magic of the dark class has been greatly enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge raised his hand to the mysterious man, and the blood in his eyes faded. Silver mans raised and smiled and said: "You are my land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plain faint sentence, mysteriously spanning a kilometer distance, equally flat It faintly rang in the ear of mysterious people, just as Rogge said to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, the fat man suddenly reached out and grabbed a troll around him. Under his brute force. The skeletons of the trolls were all over the body, and they were bent over by Rogra, and they stretched their necks to the fat man. An invisible air blade crossed the neck of the troll, and the blood of the big stock was marked as an arrow! Rogge opened his mouth and swallowed a few mouthfuls of troll blood, and his eyes were once again bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is furious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man screamed in the sky, and both hands forced him to tear the troll from his body! Under his raging anger. The power of dark enchantment is enhanced by multiples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s figure gradually became blurred and his position was erratic. He slaughtered the orcs of different races and began to attack the hills! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one who has entered the domain of the gods will lose all mortal feelings; those who are about to become gods must first abandon all emotions and open them as The key to the gods." The second page of the book of Hilo said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows. To abandon all emotions, the quickest shortcut is to experience extreme emotional changes first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only after the red dust, you have to wash away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the orc commander who entered the underground fortress of the elves finally came to a place after not knowing how many squats and how many corners were passed. One long and wide ramp, and saw his first enemy, a savvy female magician. But his heart filled with anger could not appreciate this beauty, just thinking of tearing this delicate **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the indescribable magical flame is full of martyrdom! These magical flames are almost colorless and transparent. However, the temperature is surprisingly high, and the atmosphere contained in it is very unique, and it is completely immune to the suppression of natural disasters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a flame from an ectopic face, only the magic gained through the meditation of the plane can be drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the orc pioneer commanded ten meters in the flame, the armor was already red, the green skin began to zoom, and the blisters bulged again under the black. When he ran out of twenty meters, he screamed and sprang a huge fireball in his mouth! He ran out ten meters again, and this was planted down and turned into a huge torch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides him, none of the hundred orc warriors in the martyrdom can cross the distance of twenty meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froah's face was pale, and she fell backwards weakly. A pair of hands stretched out and held her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora lightly smiled at Furo’s ear and said, “The next thing is my business. Go to rest. The goddess said, let me be good. Take care of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Mora did not point to the ground, and vainly drifted away to the still burning flame. Her body seems to be an ice world, and wherever she goes, the flames stand out. Hundreds of fully armed elf warriors emerged from the ramps on both sides, crossed Mora and killed the orc warriors on the opposite side! They shine with a faint sacred radiance, which is light and not scattered, seemingly weak, but can suppress the power of natural disasters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the underground fortress, a bowstring sound suddenly sounded on the battlefield. It’s just that this time the string sounds long and does not live in the peaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this string of sounds, a beautiful green glow is lit up on the top of the peak, which is the light of the bow of the Elf King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes is flying long, and the bow of the Elf King shines in his hands. And his right hand has turned into a virtual shadow, in an instant. I don't know how many magical long arrows poured down from the bow of the Elf King. If a waterfall of beautiful meteor showers broke through the darkness of the natural disaster, it fell to the orc warriors blocked in the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large blockbuster of orcs sneaked down silently, and each victim’s forehead had a hole in the blood hole! Like a miracle, the exit of the underground fortress was suddenly cleared of an open space. The next moment, countless elf warriors surrounded by the dusty Mora swarmed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro's eyes are purple. Just staring at Hughes. He sometimes couldn't understand, and Hughes shot every shot. The land is close to the power of the sanctuary, but he is shooting hundreds of arrows, and the power used on each arrow is not bad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne suddenly smiled and said to Milo: "Don’t look at it, we have to fulfill the contract! The natural disaster is not over yet, fast. Let's get started! Our last collaboration was a hundred years ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment. Her figure has appeared in the beasts of the bee ants. Only Adelene did not cast horrific and lethal magic. She explored her right foot and started dancing slightly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the orc warriors within a few tens of meters of Adelene’s body are suddenly mad, completely forgetting to kill the enemy, but follow her movements, but also Dance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne slowly walks through countless tall and ferocious orcs and dances gracefully. It seems that this world shrouded in natural disasters is also full of vitality due to her dancing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she’s not just a dance, but with her many hands-on and unparalleled gestures, all kinds of, weird, and thoroughly strengthened by natural disasters. The curse of the curse has poured into the surrounding orcs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She danced swaying in front of her, and Miro, who was wrapped around the purple black demon ice flame, followed her behind her, waving her hand The giant hammer, a beast warrior who did not dance with Adelenei into a meat sauce. This battle. It’s really hard for him to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs who dance, this dance will never stop until their end of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the battlefield, it is the other extreme. Between the waves of Mora, there are countless powerful cones of ice, and the power of her spells seems to be completely unaffected by natural disasters. Occasionally, she will also have a slight lip, blowing out an ice that contains endless chill! This range of ice is very wide, although the lethality is not good, but the orc warrior movement within the ice range will become extremely slow, facing the agile extreme elf warrior. It can almost be said to be waiting. And now I follow Mora's Elf Warrior. Almost 10,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those dark corners on the battlefield. There will always be a water Blu-ray or a group of five-color halo flashes. After each brilliance, there will always be many orc warriors falling down inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious man on the mountain has turned from anger to fury, shocked by fury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really can't figure out why this is already a lingering elf suddenly suddenly has so many tyrannical existences. And the pure elf actually colludes with the existence of powerful dark power, which is absolutely beyond his imagination. This is used to deal with the natural disasters of the elves, and has become a weapon in the hands of these powerful darkness. What makes him even more stunned is that many elf wizards have also begun to cast curses under natural disasters, and each curse is both sinister and sinister, and the power is no less than the Dark Master! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you see these wizard wizards are not dark elves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that the world seemed to have become incomprehensible. Of course he didn't know that these were the wizard wizards who followed Rogge for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All he can do is to madly push the Scourge and continue to cast the curse on the heads of the elves. But every time he spurs a curse, the fierce existence of the other will cast several times the curse on the orc warrior. The main points of the two sides have been concentrated on how to weaken the other fighters. However, although the power of the elves has weakened under natural disasters, the extent of the weakening is surprisingly small. The orc warriors are different. Once they have been cursed by the Scourge, their combat power will be reduced by at least half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This curse of the big showdown, the defeat is actually the chaos, bloodthirsty, darkness of the characteristics of the orcs, turned out to be the side of the natural disaster! If the mysterious man's curse is like a rapids, then the curse of the elf's counterattack is the Taotian tsunami! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth suddenly trembled, and the roar of roaring sounded like a dragon, and the orc war behemoth, known as the servant of the beast, rushed into the valley, madly The elves rushed. Only the dark curtain in the sky suddenly opened a big hole, and a large piece of sunshine slid down. Accompanied by the sun, there were bursts of dragons, and the two dragons came out from the sky, and rushed to the orc war behemoth one after the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, Wella sat on the dragon soul gun and looked at the fight between the two sides, and suddenly felt very bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the mysterious man is independent of the center of the Scourge. The orc generals around him were not good at seeing the battle. They had already rushed down the mountain and personally led the orcs to fight the elves. All orc warriors who are close to the elves are greatly reduced in their combat power. They can only switch to the life of an elf by relying on the accumulation of countless bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious man lowered a curse again, and suddenly his heart moved. Where did the first fat man jumped down the mountain and killed a lot of fat people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is there immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of a shadow is quietly drawn from his item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have Achilles's ability, then I will recognize it!" The fat man looked at the rolling head on the ground and sneered. Hundreds of troll warriors in the surrounding guards found it bad. Before coming up to kill, the fat man had already mentioned the head of the mysterious man, and the figure disappeared into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cracks on the sky are getting bigger and bigger, and large swaths of sunlight pass through the dark curtains and fall on the battlefield where the corpses are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the natural disaster of hosting the Master is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the natural disaster over?" All the strong men on the elves looked up at the sky and thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves retreat to the underground fortress as the tide, and the strong have also returned to the battle from the beast. In the center of the battlefield, the two dragons have tore the servants of the beasts into pieces. They looked around and were looking for the next victim. Suddenly they seemed to have received a call from the meditation, and they went all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the natural disaster, the war also came to an end because of the active retreat of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs who lost their princes were at a loss, but their number is still more than 100,000. According to convention, the power is much stronger than the elves. Therefore, they still choose to station the exit of the elder underground fortress. It is a war and a retreat. It is necessary to wait for the sacrifices and the great sacrifice Ogen Heller to ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
