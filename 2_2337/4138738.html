			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion of the city of the gods, the elders are significantly more magnificent than before. The main building floor has been added to the third floor from the second floor, and the courtyard has also expanded a lot. The wide courtyard is decorated with towering trees and many vivid statues. The area of ​​the conference room where Rogge often talks with the elders is also doubled, displaying many fine art works before the millennium war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the atmosphere in the house is incompatible with the elegant environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on here?! Who is doing this big grass in front of the door, the rose flower on the outer wall? Where is the wall to the half of the lake? Now, what is the water mist on the crown of the old tree? Is it a new large-scale war magic?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I not feel a little magic? Fluctuations?" Rogge banged hard on the table, almost roaring! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder elders, look at me, I look at you, I have not spoken. The atmosphere became very embarrassing for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Why don't you talk? When I left, I didn't send a letter back, let you strengthen the city defense at all costs? Where is the city defense strengthened? How can I not see it? Also, how is the study of the large illusion magic? Is there a result?" Rogge asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, no one answered. Rogge’s anger has subsided, and his elders are not afraid, but helpless. Rogge is a bit wrong. He left his seat and began to walk irritably in the house, waiting for the elders to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes stood up and said slowly: "God makes the adults, and now the situation is completely different from when you left. The temple began to take over the original. It belongs to the presbyterian authority. You know that in the tradition of the elves, the status of the great elf temple in Hilo is supreme. Some of your previous orders do not meet the nature and tradition of the elves, for example, Tu The village and the banned elves designed their own armor equipment. Shortly after you left, the Zhaoyu Sacrifice came out to summon all the elves, announced the power to limit the Presbyterian Church, and abolished the ban that did not allow the elves to design their own equipment. Now, the gods The city has fully restored the traditional culture of the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog calmed down and he went to the window and looked at the magnificent Great Elf Temple. Looking at the elves and men and women playing on the lawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what are the elders doing? Do you have any objections? Is the Presbyterian really not doing anything to the temple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled a bit and the status of the temple has always been above the Presbyterian Church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders in the Chamber looked at each other and went out silently. Only Hughes stayed, stood next to Rogge and watched together. The view from the window.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hughes, the elves look happy? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults, indeed. I have to say that these decisions in the temple are very popular. Even some elders have turned to support the temple. You see, nature, warmth, sunshine, carefree, this is the real elf. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sneered at the same face, but carefree and absolutely no match with the current city of gods! The adventurers have begun in Germany Dresden appeared, I think, you must understand the purpose of these adventurers here. These adventurers are just like locusts, only more and more! If not, I have already grasped The military power of the Principality of the Principality, and the use of the law to induce the Grand Duke of Tikke to prescribe the law that allowed the elf to legally reside. Do you think that the meeting will be just an adventurer? At that time, it will appear in front of the city of the gods. It is the coalition of more than a dozen countries of the Holy Alliance! It is so dazzling that the city of the gods is so conspicuous that it is fearful that the adventurers do not know where the elf’s base camp is! These brave sacrifices will not put the human army In your eyes, what are you, Elder Chess? How many human troops do you think we have over 10,000 elves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled: "God makes the adults, your achievements in the Principality of Are really surprised me. I I didn’t think that you could get this status in the Principality in such a short period of time. You really are the best person to lead the Elves. But the halves’ habits of the millennium are not easy to change, as you can see so long. There is no one. Although the Presbyterians have no power now, my influence is still somewhat different. Your 'Dark Side of the Moon' still only accepts your own orders. In addition, although the temple took over the weapons. And the armor workshop, but the Darkmoons have their own craftsmen. I will let these craftsmen come back to the Alai Principality with you, so that there will be no such thing as regenerating 1,600 poison arrows. I can do Yes, that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy for Xiusi to smile and watch the moon guarding the warrior! The younger generation of elf women grow up to guard the warriors, but only six, have already been handed over to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said that the old fox is really bargaining.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the guardian warrior, Rogge suddenly remembered one person, so he asked: "How is Rumsfeld's mission performed? Did he come back? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp eye of Hughes is as straight as the heart of Rogge: "He has returned." During this time, he was under great pressure and needed to talk to the sacrifices from time to time to maintain the integrity of the soul. God makes adults, this child is very talented and will be very useful to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared back, and did not retreat at all: "Elders of Xius, I promise you to bring a new future to the elves." I can only try my best to ensure the realization of this goal. I can't take care of the other things! Moreover, you also know the ego's stubbornness and attachment to feelings. In the face of feelings, it is not surprising that an elf does anything. I am not a risk-loving person, whether I take the future of the elves or take risks with my own safety, I don't like it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes shook his head and sighed, no longer insisted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read At the Great Temple of the Elves, Rogge suddenly said coldly: "We must solve the temple, or we will pay a lot of money." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes fought a cold war. "God makes the relationship between the adults and us and the temple is not yet tense." Let me work harder! The sacrifices will respect the opinions of the elders. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge nodded to let Zhao Wei defend his duty, not to interfere with us, which is of course the best. But I really doubt This point. However, since you have said this, I will wait a second time. But Elder Chess, we have not had much time. It is really a critical moment. Can you make up your mind to help me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes bit his teeth and finally said: "If it is at a critical juncture, I and the Darkmoons will definitely stand on your side!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine." Rogge finally put aside things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint magical light illuminates the city of the gods. From afar, the whole city is shining, like a fairyland on earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is so distressed that the magical power used to illuminate, but has to admit that the city is really the beautiful city he only saw in this life. Even the Green Sea is a bit worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man walked away in the city and returned to the temple of God. Rumsfeld has been waiting for him in his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After placing himself in a large chair, Rogge asked: "Rumsfeld, your looks are much better! Mission completed How is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld briefly describes the completion of the mission. The fat man who has a heart to spur has to admire his seriousness and dedication. These are similar to the short-term exile of general search terrain, the task of detecting minerals, he also seriously and meticulously completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a magic map on the large desk in front of Rogge. Rogge read a spell, a few rays flashed on the magic map, the mountains began to grow, the trees began to appear, and there were flashes of water in the small lakes. The city of the gods is only a few inches in the map, but it can also be divided into three ancient trees. Two hundred kilometers of scenery around the city of the gods are displayed little by little. This magic map is a treasure that the Dark Moon family has inherited for many years. Rogge knows its preciousness, so he finds an excuse, and he is honestly unkind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge carefully adjusted the magic map. The three-dimensional scene displayed on the map slowly shrinks, and large blanks begin to appear around the city of the gods. Rumsfeld handed a green crystal to Rogge. Rogge gently stroked the green crystal and brought out the magic contained in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the northeast of the city of the gods, a large mountain appears slowly. This terrain is very clear and there are almost no dead ends. On this newly added terrain, a dozen magical markers flashed a faint glow. There are ore marks representing various minerals, red marks representing dangerous areas, and swords that represent military significance. What makes Rogge interested in is a not too large copper mine in this area. According to Fiss, the extremely scarce minerals such as twins are only possible in the copper mine. Tungsten iron is an important raw material for making the best flame attack magic weapon. With it made of armor, it can have high flame damage defense properties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked up and looked at Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld looked at him calmly, not arrogant, nor humble. What Rogge saw in the eyes of the elf was exhaustion, melancholy and a little despair. He smiled and wanted to say something and suddenly felt something wrong. The fat man looked at the elf again and finally understood how this feeling came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld is very tired and depressed, and even has some desperation for the current situation, but he has never wavered. Rogge didn't know what the elves had never wavered, but whether it was love, good nature, or dedication to the elves, it meant Rogge's failure. Rogge has not destroyed all the martyrdom and torture of this elf, or even shaken his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge began to re-estimate Rumsfeld. There is no doubt that he is a genius in the elves. He has outstanding martial arts, a strong will, a crisis, and a well-organized manner. But in Rogge's mind, the definition of talent is only applicable to what can be used for him. Because of the existence of the wind butterfly, Rumsfeld has been impossible to be faithful to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you are, the more talented you are, the more dangerous you are. This thought flashed through Rogge's brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rumsfeld, you have done a good job with these few tasks! You have been working very hard during this time, take a rest! After ten days, I am Will give you a new assignment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larsfeld, a little bit, I don’t believe my ears. God made the adult's attempt at the wind butterfly, he knows more or less. Why are these almost martyrdom tasks only to find him, and he also knows. It was only for the consideration of the whole family of the elves, and the obedience of the sacred guardian to the command, which allowed him to complete every order of Rogge without compromise. However, the difficulty in this, he never said to anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the first massacre of the orc village, the blood in his hand had passed the sum of the past. After that, he couldn't sleep for several nights. As soon as he closed his eyes, there would be countless pairs of twin crystal clear orc children's eyes, and his ears would ring their screams before death. Then he will get up, vomit unstoppable, and then sit quietly to Tianming, waiting for the next Tucang mission that may come at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many nights have there been? He can't remember....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue and his voice pulled him back to reality: "I heard that you often go to the temple during this time? Sacrifice Are the solutions of ours effective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld was shocked, and the contradiction between God and the sacrifices of the temples is now nearly open. He carefully considered his own words: "God makes the adults, the tasks you handed over to me are all I have never done or even thought of. So I am under great pressure and even doubt whether I can complete the task you have explained. With the opening and blessings of the sacrificial priests, I regained my confidence and completed several tasks that you explained later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good!" Rogge Smiling and patted Rumsfeld’s shoulder. “You know, I have a lot of opinions about Zhao Wei. But this time she did a good thing! I also know that you are under great pressure, but the elves If the family wants to survive, then no one can live between the blue sea and the blue sky. Only when we walk in the darkness, other elves can live under the sun. Our descendants will grow up in the future without worry. Worried about war and killing. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld’s heart was in turmoil. The changes that Rogge brought to the elves after the arrival were obvious. He still can't understand many of the adult's practices, but the horror of the ‘the dark side of the moon’ is the most clear in his heart. Although he is a genius of martial arts and military in the Darkmoon tribe in the direction of war art, he never imagined that in just a few months, Rogge would be able to swear such a horrible force. Maybe God makes the adults right, only some elves voluntarily walk in the darkness, and the other elves will have a guaranteed future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God made the adult, Ms. Field, didn't even know what to say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nothing to say, I understand. The time of rest is precious, so relax these days! "Fat smiles have always warmed people's hearts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld took a ritual, turned and went out, and Rogge stopped him again:" By the way, when you go to the temple in the future, it is best to go at night and don't let other elves see it. When you are the guardian of the church, let other elves know that you have weakness in your heart, this is not good! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rumsfeld to gently close the door, Rogge smiled coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether you are a Guardian or a sacred rite, you want to be right with me, don't pay a price, but you can't afford it, you can't afford it... "The next day, Rogge went to the temple alone, and he wanted to talk to the three sacrificial priests about the future of the elves." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deepest prayer room of the temple, God made three difficult and strange negotiations with the three sacrifices. The elf rituals of Zhao Zhao’s ancestors let Luo Ge thoroughly understand the arrogant stubbornness of the elves, and the extremely deep fat man of the city was so mad that he smashed the table. Roger, who was thoroughly angered, also let the priests see what is arrogant, rude and rude. The fat man began to threaten and extort the naked land, bargaining in all possible places, and there will be a kindly greeting to the sensitive parts of Zhao Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the elves have seen this type of frame, they are all mad, especially Zhao Zhao, almost fainted. She even wondered if Rogge’s true identity would be the orc’s god? God knows why the natural and elf gods make such a rough and rude person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the rituals are supported by most of the elves, they are not willing to break completely with Rogge. Zhao Qi did not doubt the authenticity of Rogge's identity. In fact, she personally sensed Hilo's purest power in Rogge, and she announced her recognition of Rogge's identity. Rogge also has a trump card in his hand, that is the power of miracles on his body. If the temple and Rogge break apart, Rogge only needs to show miracles again. How many elves are willing to follow the sacrifices is a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge saw the fatal weaknesses of the sacrifices, the more they were arrogant. He simply stood up and stepped onto the chair, arguing with imposing manners and arguing with the three elves. The fat man threatened that if the temple dared to confront him completely, he would split the elves and then introduce the Terran army of the Holy Alliance and return to the city of the gods. At that time, the priests could escape with the elves, and the elves could not run. In this cold northern mountainous region, there is no magical protection of the old trees of the elves, and the elves can't live for long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifices were stunned by Rogge’s rogue face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty sees the upper hand, is even more proud, and even claims that if the elves have perished, then these three sacrifices are the most direct sinners! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rituals were shocked and angry. It is clear that Rogge said that to lead the Terran army to destroy the Elves, how did they become sinners? But the toughest Zhao Qi is now shrinking in the corner. She just rushed up and arguing with Rogge, and she was touched by the rogue! The other two sacrifices were also touched by one face, and one was pinched. The sacrifices were originally weak, and which is the rogue opponent of Rogge's monster body? Now the three elf rituals can only be huddled together, avoiding Rogge's arrogance in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves have a noble spirit of sacrifice. The fat man is getting more and more present, as long as the trade of the elves of the whole family is the future, it is almost unfavorable. But he is not willing to urge these sacrificial people, everything should be appropriate. In the end, the fat man only proposed that the command of the 'dark side of the moon' would not allow the temple to intervene. The weapons, equipment workshops and alchemy laboratories must also give him these two conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large-scale chaos did not expect the fat man’s request to be so simple, they hurriedly promised, so that Rogge would get another inch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rituals just nodded, and Rogge immediately regained his courtesy. In front of Zhao’s eyes, Rogge had sat back in the chair with a sacred look, and the overturned table returned to its original state. At this moment, if there is an elf coming in, the sacrifices that are held in a corner of the house seem to have lost their manners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Rogge’s rogue, Zhao Yu once again recognized the genius of the fat man in disguise. She knew in her heart that this was Rogge's demonstration to her. Just the ugly scene, she just said it, and Rogge would not be recognized. Moreover, the holy saints were touched by God, and the spread of this matter will be a very heavy blow to the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhao Yu’s heart is getting colder and colder. Is there really no way to deal with this rogue? "Maybe assassination is the best way..." The thought flashed through her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhao Wei was shocked and quickly repented to Hilo: Why is there such a sinful idea? Hilo, Lord, please forgive my uncleanness in faith.... God! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
