He obviously has already made it clear that he must fight with Rogge in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft magic light is now very dazzling in the eyes of Rogge. He was troubled and unconscious, and he couldn’t hold a magic scroll on his hand. When Rogge felt it, this precious magic scroll was unknowingly smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cursed in a low voice, throwing the destroyed scroll to the paper basket at the corner. The reel flicked a few times on the edge of the paper basket, jumped out and landed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, only Rogge used his means to deal with his enemies. Now when Nicholas confronted him with the same ruthlessness and shamelessness, Rogge only appeared. How a headache for such an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sacred powers that Rogge knows have their own dignity and principle of doing things, even if they walk in the darkness and harvest life as their death. Classes are no exception. In the eyes of Rogge, dignity and principles are the weaknesses of these powerful people, and at least their actions will always be traced. But Nicholas 挟 almost unmatched strength, and abandoned all principles, and let Rogge deal with it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** and Bone Dragon still have no news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint uneasiness seems to be a shadow that is almost invisible, always lingering in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the Rogge wants to get a headache, the inexplicable fury suddenly rises. He snarled and waved his hand over the table! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his brute force, nearly a hundred pounds of huge stellite iron wooden writing desk is like no weight, slamming On the wall, the wood chips splashed and the paper fluttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes!" A scream suddenly came.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog glanced, staring Nicole's pretty figure slowly appeared. The writing desk almost fell on the wall against her, and it was no wonder that she was scared and shivering.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ge Daren will never enter your room with invisibility. You forgive me..." Nicole was scared to cry almost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was a little dumbfounded. He was upset and didn’t realize the arrival of Nicole. It seems that this little Nizi is very talented as a killer. But on his face, he had a look at everything, and he sighed: "This is just a little lesson. Gossip, do you have any results?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole hesitated a little, and replied: "Rogge, the elders have already responded. It is apologetic, and the task of hitting the Moonlight Dragon City out of the dark night dancers. If If you must kill a silver dragon in Moonlight Dragon City, please pay 3 million gold coins for a period of three years. After the mission is completed, you need to pay another 7 million gold coins. If the task cannot be completed, the three Millions of gold coins will not be returned to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the condition of Roger’s more angry? ! Do you simply give a letter to the enemy of Moonlight Dragon City, such as the Black Dragon? Is such a trivial matter worth doing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole replied: "The elders have considered this possibility." It is said that the Black Dragons attacked Moonlight Dragon City not long ago, but the result was defeated and returned. It seems that for decades, they are unlikely to attack Moonlight Dragon City. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no other enemy in Moonlight Dragon City?" If I only want to report to Black Dragon, can I still use you? Rogge frowned and asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is not a lot of races to dare and Moonlight Dragon City..." Nicole said, his eyes Light up, staring at Rogge: "Speaking, Rogge dare to be the enemy of the entire Silver Dragon, do not say the end of the game ... ah no, what is the result, this is the courage and bravery, look big 6 Can't find a few people too! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was silent for a while, and said: "Nicco, you go back and tell the elders that I am very dissatisfied with the reply of the night dancers, and the price they want is not reasonable. I hope that the next time will not be any more. This unpleasant cooperation has occurred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie wants to say something, but still bears it and leaves silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood still in the mess of a place, moving still, the swaying light of the magic light cast his figure on the wall, it was awesome A demon figure with a claw and a claw! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment later, a shadow in the room suddenly erected, gradually turning into a gray coat wrapped around the body, revealing only two blood red eyes Figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man spoke up, listening to the voice is a man, just the voice is soft and soft, listening to the ear seems to make people feel that there are countless cool and smooth snakes crawling on the body Move, can't tell the uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue Master, 'Shadow' responds to your call. We are happy to have the opportunity to work for you as a potential protagonist."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have seen it just now. Can you 'shadow' be able to do the task that 'Dark Dancer' can't do?" Rogge didn't look back, let alone The gray robe stood behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey robes have been laughing for a few nights. Their organization is huge, but like a coveted old man, it is becoming more conservative and unpredictable, like a businessman who is more than a killer in the dark world. And our ‘shadow’ is different! Adventure is the murderer's vocation, and only if you don't want to die, you may have someone else's life. You will definitely choose ‘shadow’ is a good idea. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what do you think about the mission of ‘moonlight dragon city’? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability to kill a silver dragon in the Moonlight Dragon City is far from the ‘shadow’, not to mention the attack on Moonlight Dragon City. In fact, looking at the entire 6-man ethnic group, perhaps only the Guangming Church has the ability to attack the Moonlight Dragon City. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also knows that the people in the gray robe are telling the truth. On the same day, he led the masses to besiege and weak after the birth of Chris Ferrena, all the damage, if the attack In addition to the equally powerful Black Dragon and Bright Church, Rogge can't really think of any forces that can do this.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Rogge’s goal is not to attack the Moonlight Dragon City. I believe that the Maipao people are also very aware of this, so he is still patiently waiting for the following of the gray robe.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our 'shadow' is very clear that the goal of Rogge adults is Silver Dragon instead of Moonlight Dragon City. Of course, we will never explore why you are dealing with Yinlong and will not reveal your secrets. In these few days, we have carefully thought about the services that can be provided for you. I think there may be something you are interested in on this list. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey robes handed a brown piece of paper to Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog After slowly reading it, the hand flicked, and the brown paper turned into a piece of fly ash. The above listed are some weapons that deal with the dragons, and the price is also considered to be a fair and unreasonable plan for the fair night dancers. The shadow 'is actually much more. Just one of the items listed above is comparable to the artifact that has been destroyed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighs, Thinking about it and asking: "What is this dragon scent? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey robes immediately replied: "This is a special spice that our great alchemist extracted from a female silver dragon tail bone that was accidentally obtained." Its effect is long-lasting and the coverage is large. The dragons who smell this aroma will become uneasy and unconscious, and this fragrance will never be detected by the dragon. You know, although the fighting dragon will rise in combat power, in the eyes of the strong, they will be full of flaws. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog nodded and recognized the statement of the gray robe. If this bottle of dragons is really effective, then it is definitely worth 100,000 gold coins. Price. But he frowned and asked: "Have you tried the effect of dragon scent? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey robes replied calmly: "We have tried it on a blue dragon, and the effect is very obvious." But we have no chance, and we are not likely to experiment on Yinlong. You can decide whether you want to take this risk. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray robe laughed and bowed to Rogge and slowly disappeared into the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Shadow’ is a killer and intelligence organization night dancer who has risen less than a hundred years’, but the strength is obviously worse than that of the night dancers. But the ‘shadow’ is willing to take on the task of many “night dancers”, and the price is far lower than the night dancers. Compared with the dark night dancers who claim to be able to solve all their worries for customers, Rogge feels that the 'shadow' makes people feel real and affectionate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Nicholas turns from a silver dragon to an elf, it is not that Rogge can kill with his current strength. A tyrannical, unscrupulous and calm thinking Nicholas is terrible, and perhaps the horrible thing is when it is in the form of a silver dragon. Rogge now only hopes that Long Xiangxiang will make Nicholas less calm. He didn't know if Long Xiangxiang would be effective for Nicholas who became an elf, but this risk is worth taking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everything is ready, then nothing can be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since contact with the ‘Dark Dancer’, the Rogge’s gold coins flowed out like water. Even if he regards the treasury of the Principality of Ale as a private wallet, he feels that he can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that in the future, they will have to meet each other and kill their own price. The low price party will be able to get my mission." Rogge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, near the dawn, Rogge clap his hands and let the waiter call Horne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for Horn to rush. His white head was slightly messy, his eyes were covered with bloodshot eyes, apparently not sleeping all night. But he did not take it for granted. Horne has not been reused in the Kingdom of Latvia for many years. This time Rogge let go of his work and is naturally motivated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sloppy study of the scene made Horn's eyelids jump a little, but the old fox face was completely silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog asked about the progress of the intelligence network formation and asked about the resistance movement in the occupied area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn carefully selected the wording and said slowly: "There is obviously a lot of people in the occupied area who feel very grateful about your past brilliant achievements... oh. There are also a few people who are instigated in the dark. The time is still short. Although there is no formed resistance organization in the occupied area, there are still sporadic rebellious events everywhere. Of course, there are Charlie adults sitting in the town, and the overall situation is sure to be foolproof. However, the resistance of the people is obviously not as optimistic as we expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog snorted and understood that his so-called brilliant record naturally means The Wright Fortress killed the throat of the 70,000 coalition. This incident is not glorious, and Latvians are sure to hate themselves. The wording of Horne, which has been carefully and carefully passed, shows that the resistance in the occupied area is indeed very strong. There is now Charlie stationed there, and the temporary problem is not too big. But after reading the history and history, Rogge knows that in this case there will often be one or several military geniuses in the rebel army. If you cooperate with the people's strong resistance, Charlie may not be able to cope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has another layer of concern, that is, if Nicholas finds Charlie, the blow to him will be more than killing Hilley. He has been afraid to call Charlie and Frey back together, and even the layout of the strategy in the occupied area in the future can only be done through correspondence. It is precisely because of this consideration. It’s just that this measure is effective, and even Rogge can’t guarantee it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie was born in the sanctuary and had inextricably linked with the Church of Light. Frey’s father was the wrath of the sky in the north, Druid, the sky The city has always been closely related to the Yinlong people. This is an important reason why Rogge placed both of them outside the town. Anyone who wants to play the ideas of these two people must first consider the consequences. But now Nicholas is clearly not subject to these constraints. Rogge only hopes to keep his eyes on his side, and he is best able to follow him to the emperor. The national power of the Asrofik Empire was arrogant, and he did not know how many strong people were hidden. If you can sell Nicholas to the empire as a river, it would be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to guard against Nicholas, Rogge will go to the emperor to bring all the strong people around him. When the fat man didn't want to return from the emperor, Nicholas couldn't figure out what he was doing. The rebel army first overthrew his rule. Before going out, some arrangements are essential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Horne, I asked you to investigate the officials, did you have any results?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
