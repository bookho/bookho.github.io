			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Heaven in Chapter 17 of the Heavens <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Army has marched into the Dark Forest In the next three days, it will reach the last fortress on the imperial border, and the place beyond the fortress is the endless dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night camp was in the night, Rogge’s big account was brightly lit. Outside his camp, two elf warriors patrolled back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi suddenly appeared outside the Rogge camp, and then passed through the two elf warriors and drilled into Rogge’s big account. The elf warrior who perceives it very sharply does not know why, but turned a blind eye to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s big account is very generous and luxurious. It’s not so much a military account, it’s better to say that it’s a camp that will be used when aristocrats travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big account is divided into two. The wind butterfly that had been removed from the heavy armor was draped in a nightgown, lying quietly on the bed that was outside, seemingly already asleep. It’s just that her body’s magic lines are hidden, and her body is surrounded by black air. It seems that she is practicing vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the account, Froya is wrestling with countless bottles in front of a lab table. Her hair was rolled up at random, a silvery tooth biting a strand of hair, and the face had oozing fine sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leprechaun’s sleeves are also high, and they have a desperate frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi came to Fu Luoya’s back, and had a hand in his hand, and there was already a pumpkin-sized Warcraft organ in his hand that looked like a certain The heart of the unlucky guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria took over the heart of this Warcraft and placed it on the lab table. She took out a knife made of fine gold, looked left and right at the heart of Warcraft, and carefully studied where to start the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serrafi smiled. Going into the big account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is meditating inside, but in the deepest sense of his calm and unwavering, suddenly a dreamy beautiful face appears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair and silver enamel that made him unforgettable, once again appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man in meditation breathes immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the sea of ​​consciousness, there is a sudden change in the wind, and the fantasy face is illusory. In the blink of an eye, it becomes the old face of the death class, which is in a very close distance. Facing the fat man. Smiled brilliantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted and slammed from the ground. He only saw Serrafi in front of him. She smiled and smiled very proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and realized that she must have done a good job. Serafi does not become a god servant of the goddess. The means are unpredictable, and he can sneak into his local consciousness and manipulate the scenery inside the sea of ​​consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still figuring out how to deceive this skill from her, Serafi has said: "I want to go back to the goddess immediately. Later you Be careful. I have already looked into the dark forest. If you care about it, you will easily die inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty, he Don't care about the dark forest, just ask: "Ao Leihe? Did she summon you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi shook his head and said: "She didn't Summon, but I know I have to go back. Oh, the goddess is not omnipotent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at Serafi deeply. Meaningful and profound: "You are a god servant, really special!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi snorted and ordered Rogge with his long index finger Chest, said: "This does not need you to control. You still practice well, don't waste time on these boring things in the world! The last time you faced such a good opportunity, you actually waste this way. If I were you, I would have been... Hey! Think about it yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said, she slowly disappeared in front of Rogge It is neither a teleportation nor a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the Imperial Army barracks, Cerafi suddenly appeared in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and the cross sword was in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come out!" With her clear and cold voice, this is a vain night sky suddenly burst into a dull pain. Then a tall figure appeared slightly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing with me?" Serafi said coldly: "Do you think your soul has been around for too long?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tall man shook his head. Along with this movement, a slight chain of collisions came from his hands. Look carefully. It can be seen that he still wears a pair of shackles between his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came here with the intention of tracking a lost lamb. But I did not expect to see a lost person of God. Back to the highest Under the glory of God, the lost angel! You explore alone in the night, you are suffering in despair, all because you have forsaken the glory of the Most High God! Go back, at the moment you turn around You will see that the glory of the Lord has once again shined on you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi was silent for a while, her blonde hair swaying suddenly Straightening slowly, two golden cross stars are gradually appearing in the pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has faded all camouflage, reappearing the angelic eternal majesty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of the golden cross star without emotion, Constantine’s face is filled with tension. He seemed to be overwhelmed, and his hands subconsciously grasped the chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are called Constantine?" Weina asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My things with the heavens, you can't take your time to talk! Now give you two choices, disappear, or destroy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin did not hesitate, turned around, with a gorgeous flame of the flame, disappeared into the night sky in a blink of an eye. The speed is fast, almost straight to repair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a crisp and neat choice, but it is quite unexpected. She shook her head slightly and slowly disappeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dresden, noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main hall of the Eye of Wisdom has been refurbished, and tens of thousands of believers are gathering together, waiting quietly for the beginning of the sacred ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prayer room, Mora, who took a robe, prayed silently before the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, the elders of Carmen walked in. Whispered: "Miss Mola, there are a total of 69,000 believers who can participate in the ceremony, which is much more than we expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moura Don't move, just say: "The goddess will be happy. The ceremony will begin immediately, to tell the believers that any discomfort that occurs will be a test of the goddess' belief in us. As long as they pass the test of the goddess, they will get Goddess's care. It is even possible to gain divine power. At any cost, you must try to get them to the end of the ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not been a while. The giant clock of the main hall of wisdom finally rings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each clock sounds, the whole of Dresden will fade a little color, become darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the twelve bells, this is the noon of Dresden has fallen into a darkness, like a midnight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Dresden citizen came to the street and looked at the vision between heaven and earth with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, I don’t know when it’s covered with thick black clouds. These thick clouds have almost been pushed over the spires of several towers in the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no other noisy voices in the city, only the tens of thousands of believers sing the hymns of the hymns in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds in the sky are swirling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who look up at the sky suddenly have an illusion that it seems that it is not the clouds in the sky, but the earth beneath them. Those who are not determined by their willpower have begun to fall and fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud is spinning faster and faster. Dresden, the city that has fallen into the night world, is close to losing all its colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the vortex speeds up, the central portion of the black cloud gradually becomes thinner. Finally, there was a hollow in the center of the cloud, revealing the sky above the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that it’s not a pleasant blue sky, hidden behind the clouds, it’s a dark bottomlessness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All believers suddenly felt that their body was several times heavier. They tried to compete with this sudden pressure, and their hearts were inexplicably inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believers fell one after another under enormous pressure. Elders Carmon and a group of magicians walked among the believers. While they were fighting the weak and weak believers, they screamed and encouraged the faith of the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prayer room, the raging fire on the altar has reached the top of the ten-meter-high room. Mora stood in front of the altar, her hands reaching out into the sky, her eyes closed, and the sweat was soaked in the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wet gown is tightly attached to Mora’s body, and her trembling and seductive curves are outlined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora has a row of white teeth that have fallen deeply into the lower lip, and she is unaware that several thin blood lines have flowed from her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an unrivaled force in the endless sky. Morah is pulling in the sky. And her feet are firmly nailed to the ground, and they can't move. Two opposing forces ruthlessly tore her body. Even though tens of thousands of believers are behind the scenes, Mora is still on the verge of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there are more than 30,000 believers..." Mora strives to maintain the clarity and uniqueness of the mind, but this thought is unstoppable from her mind. Jumped out. At this moment her body is numb, the power of faith from the earth is gradually weakening, and the gravity in the sky is still huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the hollow of the center of the Black Cloud is already full of Dresden. The swirling clouds, like the giant mouth of an unknown beast, seem to swallow the entire city at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina quietly emerged from behind Mola. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swayed and pushed the completely out-of-the-money Mora to the side and stood on the position of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venna raised his left hand high and held it in the air, as if he had grasped something. Then a strong golden light shines from her, these golden lights are completely substantial, with the power of overwhelming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames that are not extinguished on the altar have been turned to gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina blonde is flying, her left hand is falling one by one, seems to be pulling something down from high school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of Dresden began to scream, they found that the black cloud, which was almost pressed to the roof, was slowly falling again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless void in the center of the whirlpool suddenly illuminates a very large lightning! After the electric light, countless citizens caught their eyes. Falling down in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they opened the red and swollen eyes again, they found that the night had passed, the sky was blue, and the sun in the west was warming the sun. Sprinkle it and dispel the cold just a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the main hall of the Eye of Wisdom, tens of thousands of believers have fallen to the ground, and very few of them have paid the price of their lives for faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of her, the demon lotus armor with a dark black luster and a golden-green double-color pattern, just like a fallen leaf, slowly falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamers on the demon lotus have completely disappeared, and all the nails are closed together to protect the wind and moon in the armor. The demon lotus is everywhere with signs of damage, and I don’t know how violent the storm has gone through. Only then can I come to this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina gently took care of the demon lotus, and then removed the demon mask with the helmet, revealing the dreamy face of Fengyue . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luster of the moon and the silver glory is bleak, it seems that she has exhausted her strength in the process of crossing the plane, so that she can only lean softly at this moment. Wei Na’s arms are too lazy to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time coming across the air. The windy month is much more wolf than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these costs are worthwhile, she has completely got rid of the shackles of abandoned land, and completely in this world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a miracle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪 啪 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一It screamed and squirmed helplessly on the ground. It still looks like a living thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina fiber refers to a hook, this small group of things floated in front of her, to her surprise, the small things can still emit very weak Earth spirits fluctuate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wena...Master, I am...Gregory..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weina looked puzzled at this small group of things. It had heads and tails, four claws, and a pair of fleshy wings, and the milky white body was covered with tiny scales. This small thing, which is at most equivalent to the size of Wella's fist, looks really a small dragon that can't be small. And it has a rare and purely sacred attribute. From this point alone. How can it be a little bit with the sacred dragon, although it is not as big as a sacred dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" asked Weina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was too big. I changed it a bit and brought it together." Feng Yue replied lazily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Weina looked at the sacred 'giant' dragon in front of him, and the strange look scared Gregory to tremble: "So small One thing, what combat power is not there, what is the use of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The person who wants to redeem it, isn't it you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we still have the resources to redeem others?" Weina said, "Redemption is the power possessed by the heavens. I am now... no longer able to redeem any soul." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can now absorb the power of other creatures and grow very fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good.... Wait! When does it have this ability, how can I not know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue saw Wei Na, in tone There is a strange taste, some contempt, and some provocation: "With your poor creation in creation, this kind of thing is said to you, you don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nb Sp; Weina snorted, she slapped a hand, Gregory immediately rolled to fly to Mora, slammed and fell in front of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take this thing outside, then close the door!" Weina told coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora warmly replied: "Listen to your command, Serrafi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She supported the weak body, carefully caught the two fleshy wings of Gregory, walked out of the prayer room, and then exhausted all efforts to close the two heavy doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora has already seen that the servant Serafi does not seem to respect the goddess O'Reilly, and the motives of her and the weak goddess seem to be Not pure. But Mora is just a saint who dedicated all her souls to the goddess. The dispute between the goddess and the servant is not the field she can intervene. So despite the worries in her heart, Mora chose to wait quietly outside the prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was closed, Weina suddenly took a step back. Released the hand holding the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy moon is like a statue, still lazy, leaning against the face of Wella, not moving, just like an invisible Wella is still letting her rely on the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Moon..." Weina’s mouth showed a glimpse of incomprehensible smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Fengyue lazily replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always remember, in the days I came, how did you treat me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon smiled and said: "Do you want to retaliate now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not?" Wella’s voice is getting softer and gentler. . Later, it was as soft as water: "You have no power at all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiting in the heart of the prayer room, Mora suddenly flutters After a while, she was almost out of breath. She didn't know what was going on. But keenly instinctively told her that it must be related to the goddess and the servant in the prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was self-defeating, Gregory in her hand suddenly made a hard earn and broke free from her two long fingers. At the moment of Mora's glimpse, Gregory had already fallen to the ground. It couldn't take care of the pain. Four small claws swiftly followed the fine and silent steps. A smoky rushed under the door, erected a small ear, and listened to the movement inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora was shocked. She thought that this unknown little thing was just an ordinary little Warcraft. I didn’t expect it to have a higher level. The look of wisdom. Mora carefully observed this little thing. If it is a few hundred times bigger, it will be a majestic dragon, but in this world. I have never heard of such a small dragon. What is this big thing, it is not Mora's resolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory suddenly came back with lightning and jumped into Mora’s palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the prayer room suddenly opened, and the windy moon of the demon lotus came out of it, and she wore the helmet of the demon lotus armor. Under the beautiful demon lotus, the windy moon of the black-haired silver enamel is not weak at the moment. Only majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy month glanced at Mora and walked outside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Wella also walked out of the prayer room. Although she was expressionless, her suffocating suffocation showed her anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has round eyes, and it knows that the hall is bound to be filled with the spiritual fluctuations of the two masters at the moment, but unfortunately it can’t be heard at all. Empty and anxious. Gregory has been tortured by curiosity, but it does not dare to let the two masters know their own troubles. When you can't stand the pain in your heart, you can only bite your pain by biting your own small claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fengyue!" Weina's spirit is full of anger and unwillingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has not stopped, only a faint return: "Oh? Have you not been enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's mental fluctuations have become less stable. Obviously already very angry: "If it is not your body and demon. Are you my opponent? Have the ability to take off the devil, we will call again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is in a good mood at the moment. Shallow smile: "Even if there is no demon, your weak body is not my opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not try it?" Wella is almost Roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you want to get rid of the demon? I don't mind hitting you once more, so I won't take it off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Weina was silent for a long time, only to bite her teeth: "When we have recovered our strength, we will fight again. Even if you have this body and a demon, it is not my opponent!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? Let's talk about it later!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the northern part of the continent, Astrophy Empire East The levy army has stopped at the edge of the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
