			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1至高神<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are a chubby little pig, doing nothing all day, suffocating and depressed. When you are bored, you find that there is a piece of white paper on the ground, which is covered with ants. This is a group of hardworking, kind and brave ants who have lived on this white paper for generations. When your heart is upset, you stretch out your chubby hands and kill a few. The ants suddenly became scared, and they were very puzzled by the temper of their partners. From ancient times to today, they only know about the front and rear, and they don’t know how to squat up and down, so that you can kill the ants in the ant world with a volley. The creatures in the two-dimensional space are full of awe, and begin to confess, pray, worship, and call you "the supreme god." You are very cool, full of grievances are on the ants, and the ants are calling and drinking, making a fortune, and disobeying is directly extinguished. You still draw a grid on the paper, stipulating that the ants can't cross the border, can't do it, the ants call it order, but the fart is not used, it's convenient for you to use it, but for a long time, the ants will get used to it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2The gods and the church<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more ants, and there are always some disobedient You've gotten bored with it, and after you've searched for it, you thought about it – use ants to manage ants. You have found some strong and mentally retarded Tyson ants as your spokesperson on the paper (ant), and the name of the wind is called "Bright Church", claiming to save the ants. You have also invented a tactic called "big prophecy" to teach the leading ants. In fact, it is worth noting that you are wearing a money. It is to find a big one. When you have an accident, you are called: "Hey~~~, fat man, someone bullying 咱Come and kill it." You will come over to brighten the pig's trotters and give the younger brothers a face to support the scene. When you are playing with joy, your colleague is coming over. You have to mix it in. You have to face it. You have to let him take some ants. He actually learned that you have some endorsements to manage ants. It’s too fucking. The two of you are embarrassed to face the street, just fight on the paper, keep your ants harassing each other, and have a good time, who is more stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 heresy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your two dogs bite the dog, the ant world is turned upside down, the east is red, the sun is rising There is a rogue ant called "Rodriguez", I don’t know where to smash the knife, the ant colony is not the enemy, you don’t dare to poke him flat, afraid of being slashed by a knife Daughter-in-law. This old hooligan is extremely wicked, and does not put you in your eyes. He does not care about the plaid you paint, and it is extremely arrogant. But the ant is an ant after all, he can't take you anymore, the paper is yours, he will only climb up and climb on it, you can kill him. You can make the paper a Mobius strip, so that the old rogue can't climb the head for a lifetime; you can change the coordinates and let the old rogue turn to the head; you can put the paper into a group and sleep the old rogue. All the old rogue attacks are on the paper, and you are helpless. The old hooligans in the two-dimensional world know your tricks. He is afraid of being stabbed to death by your pig's trotters. He hides in Tibet all day long and shrinks into the ant colony. From time to time, he comes out and chops a few endorsements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4Space Rules<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, you and the spokesperson will finish the meeting and find that they will be given to you. The horse's note was lost, and it was numb and erotic. "Dear sweetie, you are my heart, I am your radius, always turning around you; you are the highest mountain, I am a determined worm , always climb unremittingly." Unfortunately, this note was snatched by the old hooligans who also had the same spring. After a few spit, the old hooligans also wanted to climb a mountain, so he tried to learn to look up and saw the ants never Seeing the sky, and your disgusting fat face, he realized another dimension of the world, 3D was born in the ant world. The old hooligan called this erotic paper a "space law." He leaped from the paper, squatting around with a knife, looking for the fat face that had been disgusting with the ants, and smashed you. At this time, you are finally a little scared, because in addition to knowing that the world is three-dimensional, it is no better than this old rogue. Now this layer of window paper is broken and there is no need to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5Apple<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a dramatic scene appeared, the old hooligans have always lived on paper I found that although I had smashed it out from above, I still only had a flat file before and after, and I couldn’t help you with your little fat hand. The old rogue sighed, "Mom's broken paper gave the buddy's mark too deep", so I had to go back to the paper with a tail and be a man. But after all, people are also a green skin. They are stunned at home, and finally they can’t help but jump out and scream for you. They are stabbed to death by a pig’s hoof. The ants are cheering and screaming that this is the light of judgment. ". After all, I have been mixing on the road for so long. Before the accident, the old hooligans confessed the aftermath to a small green skin. The old rogue has an opening: "Heaven and earth are not benevolent, everything is a puppy", Xiaoqingpi tiger body shock: "Is there such a disgusting person? Less nonsense, there is a fart." So there is a mixture of your scent The old hooligans squirted the so-called space law, and said that the ant world is so chaotic because there is a small quilted eye outside the fat guys to play with us, and the hooligans are tens of thousands of miles, nothing to go out to see, don't look like me It will only flatten the sickle, too damn depressed. This little green skin is also numbered in the rogue world. It is also named Luo. The little nephew on the road is called "Ruo Ge". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
