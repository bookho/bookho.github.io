			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea of ​​Consciousness has already recovered its serenity, and this time the tranquility has come longer than ever before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is no tension in the sea of ​​consciousness, but an indescribable subtle atmosphere. It seems to be a bit embarrassing, and it seems to be a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** is in opposition to Wella in the air, but their eyes are subconsciously avoiding each other. Weina didn't put her to death when she was convinced of her feelings, and it didn't seem to mean revenge for Wei Na's frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea of ​​consciousness, there is only silence, and the golden lake that is moving with micro-microwaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that they stand in the high void in the same place, as if they are farther away from the beautiful lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is passing silently. Finally, *** rarely broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vena is a mess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in peacetime, Wella must not believe it. Ears. But now, she seems to have become a lot slower, just faintly responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** sighed faintly, whispered: "Vena, in addition to competing for the origin of God, is there no other solution between us? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at the void in the distance, faintly said: "The method... actually there is. For example, with our current strength, in this abandoned land." It is also easy to recreate a body. Of course, it is almost impossible to be as perfect as this body. But your body is not completely weak. For example, here..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature of the sea of ​​consciousness suddenly drops, *** has clenched the right fist, and said: "Weina!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena Smile gently! I don't mention this anymore. The other way is to come. ***, you don't understand the nature of the abandoned land, we can't stay here for a long time. But... it is too difficult to find a perfect body in that world. I think that you will definitely not go to other planes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the body now?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina hesitated for a moment and said: "I was... If I destroyed you and absorbed all your strength, then my strength would suffice." At that time, I could start to study how to make this body completely free from the shackles of abandoned land and return to the world. But now... can only be like me, choose to come. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Some doubts: "The world of death has existed for an infinite amount of time, and most of the kings have survived for more than a thousand years." And since we already have the coordinates of that world, we can come and go. Why must we come? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighs and ends, but only sighs and doesn't understand. In short, if there is a chance to come, even if the body is not perfect, we You should also give up this body and choose to come. After the advent, if the strength grows strong enough, we can choose a more perfect body. ***, your will is strong enough, it will not be bound by the new body soul. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" *** almost audibly sighed. She suddenly reached out and there was a golden glow in the palm of her hand that was flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The origin of God? *** Na is very confused, do not know what *** wants to do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Wella was stunned by this sudden change. But regardless of the motivation, if he took it himself, Returning to the control of the origin of God, then the absolute dominance will be mastered in the future. Perhaps the impact of the *** is so great that it is a little confused? Weina thought. Anyway, she does not want to be flat. Let go of this opportunity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wina flies forward, she wants to get back to the source of God.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sea of ​​consciousness suddenly trembled a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Slowly put the source of the god in the right hand into the hand of Weina. Weina only felt that she couldn’t tell the strangeness. She stared at it all, and her consciousness was a little slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that something is out of her understanding, though, she is an invincible light angel of battle instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of God suddenly shines brightly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner only felt that an unbeatable hit hit herself. Her body involuntarily flies higher and farther in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked down at the pure silver enamel and looked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***! You lied to me..." Halfway through the words, Weina sighed. Between her and her ***, it was originally a battle between you and me. Speaking of deception, she cheated *** and cheated less? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of the dead world suddenly caught a touch of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***There was a sudden burst of golden light in the body that has stood still for a long time, and a faint portrait can be seen in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Suddenly moved! There was a wave of volatility in the space around her, and it seemed to be going across the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air crosses a spiritual wave. Weina angered and said: "***! Want to go so simple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden portraits burst into a large group of fog, *** body Suddenly settled! All the gold lines on the demon lotus armor are illuminated with the action of the golden portrait. At the same time, the cyan stripes are also lit up. In the place where the two-color stripes are interlaced, the demon lotus bursts out with a large group of flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire demon lotus is shaking and shaking. *** has done its best, but still can't step into the open space channel. Even her body was pulled back by Wella little by little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Suddenly, the demon lotus armor suddenly spread out! Wei Na was caught off guard, and could only hate to see the delicate figure of the gray robe disappearing into the space channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue lines on the leaves of the devil are all lost. All the leaves are flying around the golden portraits, reassembled into complete armor, and wrapped up in golden portraits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes on the demon mask are gradually lit up. Weina looked at the fading ripples of space, and said coldly: "I see how long you can support there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the anger of her heart can’t be vented . Weina reached out and grabbed the prisoner's gun in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina slowly danced the prison gun, ** a bright blue light belt. These lights can't help but tremble, with a faint pleasing sound. However, for each additional light band, the sound will be a little bigger, just like adding one person to the chorus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Weina has been criss-crossing hundreds of light blue bands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death is quiet first, and then the unprecedented hymn suddenly sounds and runs through the heavens and the earth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost within the reach of Wella, all the undead creatures screamed and mourned in the hymn, and screamed in despair. Powerful undead creatures have rushed out of the ground and desperately fled to the distance, while the weaker ones were directly destroyed by the singer into a fly ash! The hymns seem to be pervasive, and whether it is thick soil or a mountain range, it can only slightly weaken the power of the hymn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the undead creatures hiding under the earth are not spared, in the sound of the sacred songs, the smoke is constantly emerging, slowly Is catalyzed by limbs. In the soil layer, only a few powerful undead creatures can drill deep enough to survive in this unprecedented sacred voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the hymn disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the distance, a figure is struggling to fly to Wina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waina stunned, is there an undead creature who dares to challenge her in this abandoned land? If there is such a creature, then its stupidity must be as rare as its courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This undead creature has obviously suffered a setback in the sound of the hymn, just up and down, it is very difficult to fly. However, it can survive under Weina, it can be regarded as a very powerful undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a great distance, Wella recognized the familiar blue-black color. Is this skull dragon coming to avenge its owner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner feels that it is really difficult to understand. For a bone dragon that has no strength in the land of abandoned land, she can slap it with a random sigh. Give the earthquake. What's more, in the impression of Wella, this skull dragon has always been timid, how suddenly dare to challenge her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory struggled to slap the four thin, thin wings behind him, trying to fly to the majestic and beautiful figure in the distant air. In the past sacred catastrophe, its body has been seriously damaged, and now it is necessary to flap the back of the four wings to regain its flight. In normal times, these four thin wings are just tools that they use to balance and control the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soul contract, the bone dragon already knows that the owner has temporarily expelled Wella from the body and fled to the world. It also knows that under the protection of the demon, Vena will not only be destroyed, but she is still invincible in the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bone dragon still firmly flew to Weiner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been waiting for this day for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner waited patiently until the bone dragon struggled to fly less than a hundred meters away from her. Subsequently, her index finger gently slammed the handle of the prison gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a slamming whistle was transmitted to the bone dragon, Gregory suddenly lost all his strength and planted it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! Gregory's huge body smashed a large pit on the ground, igniting the dust of the sky. Its body can't withstand such a strong collision, broken bones, cracks on the main bones. It turned over hard and looked up, watching Verna standing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you coming to avenge your ***?" Wella was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has aversion to all bone dragons from the depths of her soul, just because she wants to know why this skull dragon has such a bizarre move, she is forced to endure. Did not directly burn Gregory with the flame of heaven to burn into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." This time the bone dragon is very simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you escape, but come back to die?" Wella's fingers were stroking the guns of the prison guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon strives to raise his head and solemnly says: "Because I have to follow the owner of Wella."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What?" Weina was shocked. In fact, there is no second answer at all that would surprise her more than this answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stayed for a while, looking at the bone dragon that stood upright, the instinctual disgust and hatred gradually poured into my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is cold and cold: "When you know my origins, you should know how I will treat you like this dark and dirty creature. Don't you see it?" Going to the end of the unruly rot dragon? You have the rare wisdom to see in the bone dragon and the courage to face me, this is very rare, so I can let you choose a way of destruction. You Do you want to be freed from the flames of heaven, or will you always break into the darkness with the accompanying hymns?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina Master..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not call me this!" Weina yelled: "A skull dragon wants to worship the light angels from heaven? I have never heard of such a thing." Then! Later, even Wella herself felt a little unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon solemnly said: "Master of Wella, my predecessor is a dragon, now a bone dragon, no matter which, in your eyes are dark and humble existence, but I still have a noble soul!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Wella couldn't help it anymore, her crisp laughter resounded throughout the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon looks straight at Wella, and there is no fear of shrinking: "The master of Wella, this is nothing funny. No matter how you look at me, I have at least the same virtue." That is loyalty. The Supreme God once said that this is... this is... anyway, this is an important quality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina put away a smile, When she remembered that she was fighting with the *** in the sea of ​​consciousness, it was this weak bone dragon who rushed to the dragon of the abyss. Although it has little effect on the war situation, but the bone dragon is right, at least it has loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed and whispered: "God said that just because of loyalty, it is enough to constitute a reason for the soul to be redeemed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon seems to have not heard what she is saying, and continues: "If you can't agree with me, then I will wait for your decision. Regardless of the outcome, I will not resist or regret it. You have the power that I cannot measure and the wisdom of insight. I believe that you will give me a fair ruling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and said coldly: "Do you think that you can escape from my hands by pats and flattering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon stunned: "Weina master, you are unfair to say this! I have limited wisdom, but I can tell the difference between the truth and flattery. I have never been flattering. In fact, you can't deny my words. Isn't it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sometimes had some words. Her strength is of course not understood by the bone dragon, and her wisdom is more of a category that the world can accommodate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina finally smiled. She asked, "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" My name is Gregory, the owner of Wella." Bone Dragon obviously does not think that Wella can't remember its name is an insult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Gregorian, what are you following me for? Strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "For redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Redemption?" Wella was taken aback again, and she gradually felt that the skull dragon was a little different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, redemption." Bone Dragon solemnly said: "Under the fate of the fate, I have become a dragon and a bone dragon, but my soul is at the moment. Suffering from suffering! I am powerless to get rid of my destiny, but you can. With your unlimited strength, wisdom and beauty, I will be freed from the river of destiny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Weina laughed and said: "What is redemption and what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up and down the bone dragon. Gregory tried his best to endure the idea of ​​madness, and did not move, letting her golden eyes pass through the soul like water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory..." Wella sank and slowly said: "Creation is not my strength. But try more and have a chance to succeed." Do you want to be a sacred dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s big shock, it didn’t think that Weiner really wanted to transform it. Give it 'redemption'. In the field of creation, Wella is far worse than ***, and can only strengthen the bone dragon little by little. Weina wants to be in one step and transform the bone dragon directly into a sacred dragon! Whether it can be successful and not to mention, at least Gregory knows that in this process he must suffer countlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina asked again, Gregory bit his teeth and finally said, "I am willing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, in the sky of the dead world, the bone dragon and its new owner are flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory..." Weina suddenly called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina Master, what do you have to order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory replied: "With your invincible beauty, wisdom and strength, no matter where I hide, I will be immediately caught by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After careful consideration of the word order, Gregory decided to bring beauty to the forefront. It knows that it is very close now, and any slight mistake can bring destruction to itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina laughed and said: "You are a very smart bone dragon, and very brave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bone Dragon immediately humbly said: "I am just a stupid bone dragon, compared with you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina interrupted it: Ligao You are very smart. In fact, I have never seen a bone dragon that is smarter than you. The play you just played was so good that even I lied. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon suddenly slammed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking away, God in a few days The light of the city is changing all the time, sometimes it is green, sometimes revealing some strange blue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge is standing in the prison hall of Amoro, Staring at the huge and unstoppable thorn ball in front of you, carefully observing the state of Amorro.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro’s tenacity makes Rogge and others startled In the past few days, it has broken through the prison several times, but there are people such as Rogge, Hughes and Death Class. Is it possible to let the exhausted one ran out? It has been escaped for a while, nothing more than being beaten. And then thrown back into the thorns. Rogge then violently doubled the power of the magical power of the extraction power, and draw it until it screams.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to providing magic to the city of the gods, Amorro’s powerful regenerative ability is a good target for experimenting with magic. Rogge tested it on it all day and night. The combination of magic, the magic immediately meditation on the spot. The only pity is that Fu Luoya's magic recovery remedy is too precious, and there are not a few bottles left, these are the things that the little goblins want to take life. Or else Rogge really wants to drink the magic directly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro’s ability to regenerate is very strong, after cutting a small piece of meat, this small The meat will grow indefinitely, and will not die until a few days later. Until this moment, Rogge really feels the lack of magic and alchemy talent at hand. Froya is still young, and it is impossible to do everything. Rogge was eager to know where the Amorro regenerative power originated, so all the elf magicians were sent to study. He ignored the roar and threat of the Amorro, cut a large piece of meat, and then divided it into numbers. Ten small pieces were handed over to the Magic and Alchemy Labs. This process is repeated every few days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic or alchemy research is one The long and arduous process, the talent research of Warcraft is even more The well-known difficult field. Since ancient times, the biggest achievement of Warcraft research is an encyclopedia of Warcraft classification, which details the classification, power, stunts and, most importantly, the various uses of Warcraft body parts. The encyclopedia is made up of a number of great magicians, adventurers and alchemists. Obviously, all of the above are common World of Warcraft. The real valuable information is recorded in the personal notes of these people. If you are willing to show up, even your own disciples will often choose to teach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the regenerative ability of the Amoro, the research on the physical function of the ectopic surface organism is even more difficult. Rogge is just a matter of luck. It is normal to study it. It is luck to study it. Take it to experiment with magic, it is the fat man's business. Since the most critical moment of the day, when *** reappeared in front of him, his heart was set a lot. Although there is still the help of ***, I can't say that I can beat the city of Yunxiao. After all, no one has ever seen the strength of the sky wrath, but at least in the old man's nest, he is not afraid of those Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the adventures of the Amoro Temple have once again stimulated the nerves of the fat man. If the soldier is dead, he can re-raise. If he is dead, he can be cultivated again, but if he is dead? Who can guarantee that no enemy knows how to destroy the fat soul? At least the light church can purify his soul at least. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, there is a stunning glimpse...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really can’t tell The feeling at the time, but a little fat is a very clear personality, one day is not strong enough, one day do not want to completely take off her mask to see what is behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After madly experimenting with the magic of ten days in the city of the gods, Rogge had to go back and deal with the affairs of the Principality. This is the foundation of all his foundations and cannot be neglected. After carefully sorting out the affairs of the Principality, Rogge decided to go to see Frey first. In addition to the special hobbies, the son of the Sky Fury is very rare both in terms of personal strength and talent. The territory of the former Snowy Principality was well organized under his control, and even Latvian resistance organizations could not penetrate. The fat man has now started a full battle with the city of Yunxiao, and it is very important to understand the idea of ​​Frey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered Froya's room, he was seeing the goblins coming in and out of the door of a room in the middle of the room, busy. Roger frowned and frowned. "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya carefully placed a few bottles of magical medicine in various colors. On the ground, wipe the thin sweat on his forehead and smiled: "I have a lot of things inside, and now I just sort it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked Looking at the gate of the lost paradise, sighed: "Is there something so important, can't it be used? I didn't tell you, can you never use it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Froya came to Rogge and smiled. "Why care about me so much? Why, fall in love with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog snorted, I ignored her teasing and just said: "Do you have anything to move? I will work with you and take all the things you want to use. After this time, you must never use Paradise Lost again!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya snorted what could not be used? Anyway, I used a lot of it before. I am not afraid, what are you afraid of? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the little goblin over and angered: "The curse that comes with the fusion of artifacts is much clearer than I am!" The tremendous magic and the powerful power of instant boost are not without cost, and the cost is very heavy! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya was silent, gently said: "It's nothing more than the slow growth of the magic, and... there can be no children!" it's not a big deal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hated to look at the little goblin picked up by himself. Just Froya was almost no shorter than him, and the fat man was holding her collar. Lift up to make this little goblet off the ground. In this way, he is angry again, and the majesty is limited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty anger said: "Don't think about it Lied to me! Every time you lose the park, it will be at the expense of your future vitality, and the vitality of each intake will vary. If you are lucky enough, maybe the next time you start Lost Paradise, you will be finished! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does Froya smile when he chuckles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog snorted In the case of throwing Furoya on the ground, it will not be used again after losing the paradise. As for how I know, you don't have to know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small! "The demon spirit, her eyes turned, and said: "There is a saying that when your enemy is going to die, you have to satisfy his last wish. But dead fat people, you never answer their questions before you kill, why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty Road: "A soul that is too resentful is likely to reincarnate, and there is also a chance to reincarnate with memory." So let them die so well. Besides, there is an old saying in the East that there will be too many unexpected things in the long night. So can you slaughter, avoid accidents, and do anything with them? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you don't tell me how I know the secret of Paradise Lost, but also treat me as an enemy?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still ignoring Fu Luoya's problem, just saying: "Do you know how much time you still have?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's green eyes are dark, and the tone is still easy: "I don't know." Maybe ten years? Twenty years? Regardless of him, the advantage of the integration with the lost paradise is that youth will last forever, until the day of dying will suddenly grow old. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled softly and said: "At that time, I will hide alone, so that you will not let me see how ugly I am." of. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge went in and out, and had moved all the items of Froya out, and filled the whole room. The fat man was endless, every The next time, in addition to holding a large box of things in his hand, there are countless pieces of debris floating around his body. No matter what he is, he is randomly placed on the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"All right! "The fat man clap his hands: "Put away the lost paradise, and don't use it again later." Wait until we find a way to lift the curse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin spread his arms lightly, and Rogge came from the back ring, smirking in his ear: "I seduce me by caring about this old-fashioned way." But it is useless. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't tell you, let you be confused too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog snorted, backhand lightning bolted on the goblin Is it still useful to seduce you? I want to use it directly, do you resist it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is said, the fat man goes away. Froya hates to bite his teeth and swears: "Dead fat!" Except going to bed, you don't know anything else? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, a huge gryphon landed on the square of the city of the gods. The size of this gryphon is larger than the usual gryphon. Many, although the attack power is not strong, as the attacking beast is not very qualified, but the power is much larger, suitable for long-distance load. This is one of the few achievements of the gods in the near future. But the elf responsible for cultivating the griffin himself is not clear.
