			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian woke up from a coma, and the back of the head was still painful. After a while, I gradually saw the surrounding environment. There was no window in the whole room, it was cold and damp. The walls were directly piled up by the bluestone field. There was no decoration, the pieces of moss scattered and the drops on the ceiling. There are large and small instruments in the house, and the blood on the condensate has turned black. It seems that the age is quite long, but the screams of the tortured people seem to be still lingering in their ears. There were two torches on the opposite wall, and the shaking fire shook his eyes with some pain. Everything in the room swayed in the fire, and it looked very embarrassing. The old mayor's hands and feet were hung in the iron ring on the wall and hung in a large shape. He struggled to miss the spell, but was interrupted by a sudden whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked around in the room, staring at Ian in a gloomy mood. The fat man waved his hand and let the mercenaries in the house go out and come to Ian. Ian wisely gave up the attempt to cast a spell. The use of magic requires the power of a spell, with the magic symbols drawn by various gestures, combined with the specific mental fluctuations of the caster to succeed. If Ian can't move with his hands, there are only a few low-level spells that can be cast. But how to see Rogge does not seem to let him finish the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man hates staring at Ian, to be honest, he is still worried about the decomposition of the day. The five-level magic decomposition is not too practical, the main reason is that the success rate is not high, and the general probability is below. However, the probability is lower. For Rogge, it is equal to gambling. If you have not applied the technique beforehand, you have the agility of the warrior. If you are turned into a fly ash, it may not be the yellow dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is this place?" Ian's old voice was exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the cell of the Sallesburg, Mr. Ian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why Don't kill me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I still have a lot to ask you, Mr. Ian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehehe" Ian laughed. "Lord Rogge, do you think I will meet your requirements?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See By the way Rogge had a well-thought-out, Ian’s laughter gradually disappeared. "Mr. Ian, as an adventurer, you are too old. As a magician, you are too orthodox. As the mayor, you have a son and daughter. So I think you may have a hard time understanding, sometimes it is not the most dead. Difficult to accept and the worst result. Maybe you are not afraid of death, but the consequences of death are not necessarily acceptable to you. Just like now, you can die, I will not stop you." Rogge opened a small iron window on the wall, and the screams of the ancient tower passed immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You devil! You should not let my son go to the hell guy!" Ian struggled wildly, and the hoop was pulled by him. It creaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Ian, if you really want me to let go of your son, you shouldn’t use decomposition today. What's more, the more you delay, the ancient Mr. Ta is suffering more. You see, I am not a very hearty person, let's get started soon. I really want to know, what is the real purpose of Snow Fox occupying Sellersburg?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of Guta screamed in Ian’s heart, and the old mayor’s face was distorted and finally began to answer questions. This idea was contributed by Franco, and Ian only heard the torture of the ancient tower, but did not let him see the circumstances of the sentence. "Imagination is the thing that most afflicts the will." Franco summed up the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The snow fox is here to dig the remains of a necromancer. What they are looking for is said to be an angel statue."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This I know!" Rogge said impatiently: "What is the statue used for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The statue It is said that there is a secret about the fallen angels, and there are legends related to a big scandal in the church. I know so much, let them stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge indulged for a moment. The statue of the purgatory angel he had already handed it to Orphee Roque. Since it is such a thing that the snow and silver foxes want to get, it must have something bad. But if you don't come out, you can't keep it. The husband is not guilty, and he is guilty of this crime. The statue was handed over to Orphey Roque, called the East. Everything has its own golden lion to deal with. Several aristocrats have neither changed their ambitions to change their dynasties, nor do they want to become a big six. Although they love wealth, they are not necessary for the rich world, and the rich ones will become. So how does this statue look like a hot potato? Send it out early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian stunned and looked like a big change. He struggled and said: "I don't know what space rule I don't know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat and old man anger, ancient The screams of the tower have been echoing indoors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the fat man said: "What is the secret of the bottom, so that you are more important than your son? It is better to be honest. You Really thought that it will last until the end? I don’t care about the statue or something. The reason why I caught you is because you have colluded with Snow Fox and tried to frame the Laozi. The Laozis have a hatred, you can’t kill it. We have to die. There is another reason for this space rule. Seeing that it is the same as the Master, I will persuade you once, or say it well."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian’s mouth twitched, his teeth clutching his lips, and blood flowed down. His eyes closed and two turbid tears flowed silently, and he refused to speak again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge bites his teeth: See how long can you endure? Lens! Do not come back? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound of the yin and yang of Rens drifted in from the window: "Of course, this little thing, my old man shot, still not coming?" Hahaha, let me try it for the elderly, feel good, big! ! "The cry of a young woman was passed over again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fira! ! "Ian slammed his eyes open, like a beast, "You guys!" ! God will punish you! You will go to hell, and you will always be burned by the fire! ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue looks as usual, I will know the secrets of the law of space sooner or later. Maybe this is a secret to you, but maybe it will become A common sense. Don't you still say it? Say, although you still have to die, at least your son and daughter can keep it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tear from the next door The voice, accompanied by the crying of Fila and the ** of Rens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at Ian quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the fire shook, the more everything in the house seemed to be more ambiguous and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lens’s voice passed again: "Rogge, the old guy still refuses to say yes? Not to say the best, her daughter is really skin Light and fleshy, huh, huh, still a virgin. If you don’t, it’s cheaper for me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fira’s cries almost broke through Rogge The eardrum, then Rennes gasped like a cow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened and Franco came in. He frowned and said: "This Rens is always so beautiful. I can't understand you. For what space law, is it necessary to do so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge said faintly: "I want to be sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco shook his head and sighed: "No matter what, I will help you, It’s just that you don’t get things out of hand.” He turned his head and stared at Ian for a moment, whispering: “Old guy, it’s better to say it now, don’t let us make the last move. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time goes by, only pain and becoming an eternal theme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the scream of screaming by Rens, the silence of the whole, the screams of Guta did not know when it stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three in the cell were deadlocked at one time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and suddenly said: "Old guy! Do you have to watch your children commit a great crime, and die forever in the fire of hell? Burning?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ian was struck by lightning, the white heads fell off, and the old voice seemed incomparably hollow: "Lord, forgive your slaves." I have to deal with the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up, his eyes were murky, no look, but he was already stunned: "I tell you what I know." Everything about the law of space..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next door was quiet, only the low sob of the Fira was echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian’s old voice echoed in the empty chamber, as if the flame could not restrain the pleasure of listening, madly swaying and struggling, it seemed to jump from the torch to the center of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacred priest, Pope Paddick received the instructions of God, and rushed to the bottom of the Bis Mountains, seeing the meteor descending from the sky, as if in the flames There is also a figure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteor falls to the ground, the flames rise to the sky, where the flames pass, the peaks and the ice of the peaks are steamed dry Clean. Everything within the radius of a dozen is turned into nothing, leaving only a deep black pit. The rocks around the ground have been melted, leaving a piece of glassy crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the distance from the falling star is several tens of miles away, the shock wave of space energy still brings Paddick to stand. His heart was astonished. With himself as the pope, the power of the bright mana reached the 16th level, and it was so far apart that it could not stand even after the impact of energy. How big is the energy of this meteor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Padick waited for the energy shock wave before he supported the staff and climbed to the pit. The old pope came alone all the way, and it has been more than half a month in the mountains. Although he has a strong mana, he can fly a flight from time to time, but it is exhausted today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, from the afternoon to the evening, the old pope climbed to the bottom of the sacred church. Although the power is not huge today, there are also millions of believers, and the pope also Already have their own papal kingdom. The life of the old pope on weekdays is not worthy of luxury, but it will not be worse than that of a small king. How have you been so hard? The old pope's red robe has been ragged, the high crown is on one side, and the face is full of bruises. At the end of the day, the footsteps were vain, and one passed over to the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the pit is a very beautiful and gorgeous disc floating in the air, with a substantial golden light band flying around the disc, the center of the disc is engraved The words with meanings are difficult to understand, surrounded by a circle of purple gold, but it looks like a very fine pattern, which seems to be a magical array. The invisible waves of the bursts dissipated from the center of the disc, and the entire space seemed to be slightly distorted. The figure in the flame has left only a few bones at the moment, and I can't see what kind of creature was originally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a wave of fluctuations in the surrounding space, and more than a dozen angels hidden in the dazzling golden light gradually flashed out. Paddick remembered the gods and gritted his teeth to the disc. After the hand undulates into the space around the disc, it begins to senescence and wither with the naked eye. When the disc is caught, the old pope's entire arm is only left. The old pope grabbed the disc and left with the angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was quiet for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog asked: "The disc?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that is the record According to Paddick's notes, the mysterious text engraved in the center of the space wheel is the law of space! It is just that no one can interpret the law of space or why it appears in this world." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about those angels?" Kate asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to me, at least some angels are still offering sacrifices in the Holy Church and providing shelter."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several aristocratic scums understand why the Holy Church has risen so rapidly over the years and has been shown miracles. What bothers the scums is that since the angel is in the sacred church, the supreme god that the church believes naturally exists. It is only from the perspective of what the scums have done, and it is not in accordance with the teachings of God. Doesn't it mean that the scums have only one way to go? Thinking of this, several scums are pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the battle of life and death, Kate’s strength increased greatly, and it was actually vindictive, and it was still sacred. After the samurai strength reaches a certain level, there will be a phenomenon of vindictiveness, and the color of vindictiveness depends on the specific attributes of the samurai. This is also the place where the scums are puzzled. Kate’s heart is definitely not related to the sacred word. The ice-cold temper of his son's blue color is a neutral attribute, and it is nothing. The son actually practiced sacred vindictiveness. This joke is a big step. It can only be said that God also has a time to take a nap. But the benefits are also there. The scums have decided to take Kate when they decide to act. According to the public, the holy knight is bound to stand on the side of justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Rogge knew that angels existed in the Holy Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
