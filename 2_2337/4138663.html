			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a deafening salute sounded, and the whole city of Lille shook slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless fireworks blooming in the night sky, just as the gods opened the door of the heavens and sprinkled endless prosperousness into the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little candlelight, if the stars in the sky are full of dust, the candlelight is a face of ordinary and joyful. Millions of citizens in Lille City have left the house at this moment, thanking God for the past year and praying for a safe new year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sky terrace of the "Elves in the Dark Night", the aristocrats and ladies and ladies who are watching the scenery are crowded.貂裘 brocade, jewels and pearls, and the intersection of each other, is just a picture of human wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who are indispensable to Rogge and other nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who are not in the past, now is the red man in front of the Orpheus, and the hand of the hammer of the god of war, although in the night, "in the dark night One of the most famous aerial gardens in the "Babylon" is worth a hundred gold coins. Several people still have this strength to sit here. At this time, the great aristocrats with status status have enjoyed the "Lion Heart Grand Duke" Rein Hartyan in the Grand Duchy of the Principality, and this "Babylon" has become the best place for small and medium-sized nobles and wealthy businessmen to show their status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower of one flame after another blooms in the night sky, seemingly endless. In the middle of the magical flame, the seven-colored tulips rushed into the sky, leaving a dazzling flame tail on the black curtain for a long time. The change of the sky reflected that Rogge's face was also flickering, and only those eyes were still clear, such as a deep pool, all the colorful, there are in and out, never scored in the pair. Rogge smiled to himself, but no one heard it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This colorful color is a blinded person."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the city of Lille, on the highest platform in the Grand Duchy, the fireworks of the sky can't cover the golden glow. Ophirouk is full of explosives, and the body is rising with a real golden flame. The ground is a huge magical array, and the stunning figure of Elysses is standing in the center of the circle, and the black flame does not rise, but it is sucked in by the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroco's eyebrows are locked and it's all out. When the golden flame rises to a certain height, a strange black shadow will be drawn in the space, and it will be absorbed clean. Occasionally, there is a flowing flame that wants to escape from the building, but it is always blocked by the black flame that comes out of the magical array, and it has to be honestly returned to the rising golden flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is also looking forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the clock of the great clock of the government office even overwhelmed the salute of the earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cheers of millions of mortals, the sacred calendar has finally arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth suddenly vibrates, and the huge and bright hymns ring between heaven and earth. This sound is huge, just like a choir composed of millions of holy women. Sing in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mortal creatures are standing still, and all the voices no longer exist. At this moment, there is only a sacred song of heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes are staring, all souls are waiting, waiting for the sudden arrival...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;神神!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky above the Grand Palace, the clouds are madly accumulating, rolling, creeping, accumulating thicker, more and more low. The invisible pressure is overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentient beings stumbled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s clear eyes turned turbid, as everyone fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, if only Ofiroc is in the big city, it stands like a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses gently pulls Orfirock, the spring-like jade refers to the heavyness of the mountain at this moment. Orphee’s stunned, a little tears falling into the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud stopped tumbling and gradually lit up. Later, the white light reflected the whole city of Lille as bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
