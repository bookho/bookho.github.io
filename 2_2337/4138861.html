			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the two sins and punishments<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Exorcist Wei An led The exorcists who are under the command will surround the city of Yunxiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These exorcists each built a huge magical symbol on the ground in front of them. A few moments later, dozens of exorcists built a great magical array around the city of the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic array is now running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately felt an indescribable breath in the wind, disturbing the magic of his body. He quietly lifted his mental power and kept the breath of the wind out of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that this is the true ability of the exorcist." Rogge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Magic Array built by the Exorcist has a special role in suppressing magic in a wide range. However, the magical array works in a way that is not a common suppression, but an interference. The atmosphere of the magic array is constantly changing. Within its scope, all magic will resonate with it and a corresponding shift will occur. This is of course no problem at ordinary times, at most, it makes the magicians feel that they are physically uncomfortable. However, when casting magic, the slight deviation of the magic is enough to make a magic fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the scope of this magical array, the chance of magical failure is greatly increased. On the other hand, this is equivalent to suppressing and suppressing magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid warriors are sharp and brave, but the real horrible power in the city of the Clouds is the elders who exist as casters and a large number of high-level Druids. Although there are a large number of magicians on the side of the Imperial Army, most of them are good at assisting magic used in battles. Only by Rockefeller and his more than 20 ice and snow mage, there is no power and Druid to fight magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the entire magical city of the Clouds was once completed. It is tantamount to cutting off one of Druid's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of the iron armor, more than ten soldiers were reorganized and began to enter the city of Yunxiao. Each of these fighters consists of several small groups of Poseidon warriors, reloaded warriors of the Glacier Corps, light armored swordsmen, and dwarf slave warriors, and each team is equipped with at least two war priests and a snow and ice mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the smashing sounds in the city of Yunxiao are just awkward and lasting. It didn't take long. There have been several warriors who have said that they have broken through the first line of defense of the Druids, including warriors, beasts and magical institutions, and began to go deep into the center of Yunxiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander immediately ordered. A team of soldiers who have already been ready to go, with a thousand people as a team, along the broken defense line to the depths of Yunxiao City! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these fighters, there are a lot of executioners who have been replaced by ordinary warriors and defenders of the tide whales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than 10,000 new forces entered the city of the Clouds, Druid’s first line of defense collapsed in a blink of an eye. But in the heart of the city, there are an astonishing number of stone giants wandering around. Under the cover of the stone giants, the high-level Druids can carry out magic with ease, even though their magical failure rate is astonishingly high. But once it succeeds, whether it is a thorny rain or a hot ray, it will immediately send more than ten imperial warriors to the field of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Druid’s happy time is short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying ink wheel saw is like a night elf, we are weaving a night landscape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the painter who is painting is enough to eclipse all the scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the ink color masked her face, only to see the long blond hair fluttering in the breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an indescribable elegance and beauty between her gestures. It’s not important to see her face, she is already a symbol of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is also a symbol of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black figure is swimming between the stone giants. The stone fists of the giants could not be flashed, and the high-level Druids were dismembered with a circular saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if it was because of her sake that the soldiers had bloody eyes and thunder, and everyone was not afraid of death. From time to time, there are dwarf slave warriors screaming in unspeakable eulogy and waving huge warhammers. And slammed into the stone giant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, they often end the life of blood and fire, and the reward is the boulder dropped by the stone giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s second line of defense was finally opened. The thundering imperial warriors followed the dancing dark elves and entered the heart of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! The sound of this clear voice is unclear whether it is from the pale gold sword or the ink wheel saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tall golden armor in front of the Dark Elves. The sword in his hand danced into a pale gold light curtain, blocking her from it. Going on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tall and spacious hall that looks great for a battlefield. At least, the huge body of Elvis is completely arrogant. He holds a giant sickle in his hands. The dark elves and the golden armor who bypassed the central deathmatch. I rushed into the emperor's warrior and slashed it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark elf only feels that the blood in his body is boiling. The sad burning sensation made her thirsty. The ink-colored wheel saw has not been able to tell how many times it has been attacked, but it has been blocked by the pale gold sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been unable to suppress the blazing black flames in the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Elf suddenly made a crisp and sharp scream, and the wheel saw in his hand suddenly accelerated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous metal collisions are intertwined and merged into a long, clear and clear crash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound echoed in the hall, the pale gold sword had already flown in the air, and then blasted open, and the tiny sharp metal pieces spattered like rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall gold armored warrior is crumbling. His helmet has been gently removed by the Dark Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Elves are tightly placed behind the samurai, just like a couple who are never lingering enough. Her slender hand gently stroked the warrior's face, and the huge wheel saw in her right hand trembled slightly, leaving a trace of undetectable blood on the warrior's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Dark Elves gently put the body of the Golden Armor completely lost to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That moment. She saw his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! The huge wheel saw fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Elves squatted at the samurai's side and shivered and took off their helmets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical pattern on her face full of strange dark beauty has not faded, but this silk does not detract from her unparalleled beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked the face of the warrior with a faint golden hair. He is still so handsome and resolute, just like when he was in the Green Sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes passed a trace of anger, his eyes fell on the face of the dark elf, and the bloody lips showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lips are slightly open and closed, each movement. It will cause a small pool of blood bubbles to flow from the wound in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Elves listened attentively, only to hear the words that he used his last strength to spit out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Wind butterfly...you still...so beautiful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lafie..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the eyes he has lost. Wind Butterfly does not know, in the moment, what kind of wind butterfly did he see? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that elf girl riding a white tiger that year? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no tears in her eyes, and her pupils were clear and turbid. Her thoughts are also in the midst of extreme chaos, which has been raging in the depths of memory for a long time, and bursting like a blisters on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint black fog suddenly enveloped the wind butterfly. The strong dark atmosphere immediately enhanced the power of the dark curse, and the various pictures seen by the wind butterfly in memory broke down and gradually disappeared into the depths of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor child, wake up from the darkest nightmare!" An old voice suddenly sounded, and then a pale green light column fell from the sky , covering the lost wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Roger’s roar came from the door of the hall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light green light temporarily suppressed all the dark power of the wind butterfly, under the mighty magic of Druid elders, the wind butterfly. It changed back to the pure elf in the green sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although only for a short while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All past events flashed in her heart like lightning and thunder...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around The soldier who died in the dead, looked at the elders of Druid, who seemed to be unable to move on the other side of the hall, looked at Elvis, who was roaring in battle, and the door of the hall, trying to rush to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly lowered his head and saw the samurai in front of his knees. His lips still have the last smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off the fine gold hand on her right hand. Showing a hand like ice and snow. Each fingertip is dotted with a nail that is dyed dark purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one of the tail fingers, silently swept over the cold throat...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind butterfly, the most beautiful elf in the green sea, finally fell on her former lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge strode to the wind butterfly and stared at the elf who was sleeping. There was only a hint of black lines on the neck of the wind butterfly, and even a drop of blood had not leaked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has more than just sharpness in her nails, and she has an unbeatable viciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the natural purification of Druid, all the dark forces in her body are suppressed, and the pure and weak body of the elf can no longer resist such poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why..." Rogge's eyes were red. Staring at the old Druid on the other side of the hall. He asked in a low voice: "Why are you trying to dispel my dark fog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid old and pitifully watched the butterfly and Rams of Yongmian Field, sighing heavily: "They have restored the holiness and elegance of the elves. For them. This is a good ending..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not you That damn natural purification, she will not commit suicide!" Rogge snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death in freedom and lucidity is better than losing and sinking in the darkness of life!" Druid elders slowly and authentically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a little and said: "You killed the murder and came out... very good!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pause, Rogge suddenly said: "Then you will give me freedom and waking to death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Suddenly picked up the wind-colored butterfly wheel saw, so that the full force is sticking out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheel saw whirls forward, and the whistling sound is screaming, and the sound is so fierce that it is completely different from the feeling of being in the air. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All objects on the path of the wheel saw, whether it is stone pillars, weapons or human legs. They were cut into two halves silently. Those martial arts masters who are extremely agile are already scared and leaping. The elder Druid was far away, but he looked at the black brilliance that gradually extended around the spinning saw, and he had to jump high into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Druid snorted, and the thin blood line was shot in the ear and nose, and the body apparently lost control. But he is a magical elder Druid, and getting out of control is only a very short thing. He knew that the situation was not good. Just ready to cast an instant magic shield, a magical missile that has been condensed by the magical black flame has been attached to his nose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another enhanced magic missiles flew out around Rogge. Under the impact and burning of countless missiles, the helpless body of Druid elders continued to fly in the air, getting higher and higher, and finally put it on the top of the hall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A large demon pillar appeared quietly in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the blast column was dispersed, there was only one black manned shape at the top of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Roger’s instructions, several elf warriors stepped forward to raise the body of the butterfly. They saw the body of Rumsfeld again, and they could not help but hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge never looked back. He was silent for a moment, but he said, "Take it back!", then passed through the hall and disappeared at the other end of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial warriors flooded into the hall, and there were dozens of dragons and warriors in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only Elvis in the hall to fight alone. In his roar, the painful roar is gradually increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked along a long corridor. At the end of the promenade is a gorgeous and quaint gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the gate for a moment, lifted his foot and stumbled the door up to four meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the door is the central hall of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby is extremely grand. In the halls where Rogge was born, I am afraid that only the hall of the Lich Elgara is a little bigger than here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main hall is engraved with mountains and rivers, and the top of the temple is decorated with gale ice clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a boulder-carved seat in the direction of Rogge, with a majestic Grand Druid sitting on the top of the chair. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked up to the Druid boulder image as high as ten meters, and the stone in the eyes of the stone tumbling, seems to be watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone statue is on the ground. Five bodies were fallen. Look at their suits, it should be at least the level of the Druid elders. They are like a new death, the blood still can't keep flowing, and the river etched along the ground slowly flows. After watching it for a long time, people will think that in the world carved on the ground of the main hall, the river is not the water, but the thick blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at the bodies for a while and concluded that they had been dead for many days. All the bloody rivers are brought into the sea. No matter how much blood is injected, the sea surface is not as high as the milliliters. It seems that there is a bottomless abyss on the bottom of the sea that absorbs all the newly injected blood. But the sea has not fallen. Xindi blood can't stop pouring from the body. Imported into the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world on the ground is in a delicate balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is finally sure. This is a magical array of sacrifices. Since it is in the city of Yunxiao, the object of sacrifice is naturally the goddess of nature. Just for the blood sacrifice at such a price, what do they get? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge once again looked at the stone statue and said: "The wrath of the sky, what kind of gift have you prepared for us?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thunderous voice in the stone statue: "The gift has been shown to you. But it is a pity that you can't see the whole picture of the gift from this hall. Although you will get a very important part of the gift. Cherish it, this is a gift from the natural goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge coldly: " The wrath of the sky, you are the great Druid of the North, one of the most devout believers of the natural goddess, actually will put so many goddess believers in life and death, and run away alone? If this thing is said, I am afraid there is no People will believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sneered: "I have stood here. You are the great Druid of the North. Isn't it difficult to kill me? Why bother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky: "Young Necromancer. In front of me, put away your arrogance and fraud. I am indeed the great Druid of the North, but I don't think that I can be four Take your life in front of the strong. Besides, your sin, the natural goddess has decided to punish in person, of course I can't pass the goddess. However, the young mage, you should not be proud. That gift, and Not only for you, but you have not yet qualified for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud in the eyes of the stone has disappeared. The sound of killing in the city of Yunxiao has gradually stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small doors on both sides of the hall opened almost simultaneously, and Rockefeller and Androni walked into the hall. The three looked at the bloody river and the sea, which suddenly flowed wildly on the ground, and they frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the city, nearly 100,000 soldiers subconsciously clenched their weapons and silently watched the city of clouds that suddenly revealed a strong green light. However, the soldiers in the city are still unaware of the changes. Still busy cleaning up the last enemy and cleaning the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exclamation of tens of thousands of soldiers, a graceful woman image slowly stood up from the city of Yunxiao. When she finally stood up, her height exceeded 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the strong light that is enough to illuminate the blind, you can glimpse her beauty and majesty beyond the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the 100,000 soldiers, her arms were raised high, and then between the intertwined fingers, a little blue water blew down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between breaths, this blue wave has turned into a storm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to ten meters of high waves have swallowed up all the warriors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment. The flood peaks have completely disappeared, and the green brilliance and the goddess of up to 100 meters have never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of fighters are still standing, their souls are still immersed in the fear of the peak of the peak. A moment later, a scream broke the silence of the battlefield. It was a young warrior. He suddenly found that four or five comrades around him fell to the ground. It seems to sleep peacefully, but no matter how he calls, he can't wake them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He discovered that these comrades had stopped breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey and Alexander looked up and saw that although most of the soldiers stood in the same place intact, the corpses in one place were still shocking. They still don't know how the fate of the soldiers in the city is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is pale, he has received the special gift, the wrath of the natural goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Androni’s worried eyes, Rogge smiled weakly. Road: "Don't worry. People like me. It should have been punished for a long time. But even if the goddess of nature wants my life, it is not so easy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But..." Androni sighed. Did not continue to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and said: "What sigh? I can handle it myself. Even if you want to help me, how can you help? Do you sleep every day?" "Is it with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge’s back, Androni bit his lower lip and sighed for a long time, followed him and left the central hall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander, Pompey rode on the horse, silently watching Rogge, Androni and Rockefeller from the city of the clouds. Behind them, they only followed hundreds of the most elite and powerful fighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about other people?" asked Pompey. The smile on his face has disappeared all the year round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alive... all came out," Rogge replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey’s face twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander and Pompey frowned at the same time, and they all discovered Rogge's abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Rogge, what's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge replied indifferently: The goddess of nature cares more about me, so I am in her punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander immediately called the sacred exorcist Wei An. But she repeatedly looked at Rogge, but couldn't find any abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the helpless Wei An, faintly said: "This is the goddess of goddess launched by the gods, completely different from ordinary magic. Later slow Slow down and think of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three people gathered in the army, the next few days are naturally cleaning the battlefield, the cremation of the death of the soldiers. As for the thousands of soldiers and Druid's bodies in Yunxiao City, they were burned to ash by Alexander, and then thrown into the gale of the wilderness, and there was no trace left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the city of the Clouds of the North, finally fell to the end of the finale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the city of the Clouds, the world of death also ushered in its end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead clouds in the sky don’t know when to start burning, and in a twinkling of an eye, they turn into the sky and the fire falls on the ground. For the first time in the world of death, the endless voids in the clouds and the gates of heaven that shine on everything are revealed in front of the big ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bright music, the door of heaven opens again, and the golden light casts the ladder down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, there are not a few flying out of the gates of heaven, but hundreds of angels in groups! These angels danced around the gates of heaven, throwing the petals of pure holy power, and sang hymns to God in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of heaven are quiet for a moment, and they fly out of the six-and-four-winged angels. They are either robes or robes, and they are different in their hands. Weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the six angels, there is finally a strong light in the door of the heavens! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful and unimaginable sacred breath immediately suppresses all deaths to the deepest part of the earth, while the filthy undead remains on the ground are extremely hot. The burning of the Holy Light is exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an extremely large body that floats out of the door of heaven, which is up to 100 meters high. His lower body is a stream of countless lights, three majestic faces on his head, and a sacred flame that is 100 meters long from the back. It looks like a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has three eyes on his face. After stepping out of the gates of heaven, the seven eyes opened at the same time, enough to transmit all the gaze of the moment has seen the past and future of the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is one of the main gods of the heavens, and judges the seven main sins of the Lord God with seven eyes, Frian Mill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, another god stepped out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is slightly smaller than Fleet Mill, and looks like an ordinary human being, with only one robes on his body. On his back, he was flying a little angel with golden wings. Of course, this angel will only appear small compared to the previous gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleam Mill finally spoke up: "Tiratemis, now all the causes and effects are clear. O'Reilly has indeed committed too much forgiveness. The sin, my servant, Tereders, there is no place where there is no justice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramis has been through for a while, then: "All the things that O'Brien did at the time were to accomplish the task that I gave her, in order to be able to return to the glory of heaven as soon as possible. Teredes tried her crimes without my permission. Is this not there? Is it unfair? Didn’t he despise the dignity of the Lord God and commit the sin of arrogance?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fryan Mill replied: “There is a penalty for guilty In the face of absolute justice, all sin is just sin, and no excuse can defend sin. Therefore, Thaledes has no mistakes. Tiratemis, are you going to question the law of the Supreme God? I even seized my godhead and stole my little power. How to redeem such a crime?! <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
