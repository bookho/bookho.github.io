			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of iron rides on the first morning of dawn, and rushed to the direction of the emperor. There were several carriages in the center of the team. Roger sat in one of the cars, holding the magic notes that recorded the miracles of the goddess of ice and snow, and studied them with heart. Froya crouched like a kitten on the velvet seat opposite him, and was sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her clean face swept away the enchanting charm of the waking, revealing a trace of childish innocence. Long eyelashes occasionally twitch, as if the butterfly lifted its wings lightly. The light pink slightly transparent underwear reveals a side from the round neck of the robe, and with her slight breathing, the rounded chest is undulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a note, licking a bit sour eyes, looking at the sleepy kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, a ray of sunshine quietly penetrated the thick clouds, shining on the carriage in progress, and sprinkled from the window without the curtain The carriage. Froya, who was thrown into the face by the light, was obviously dissatisfied. She muttered a few times with her eyes closed, pulled the brocade blanket, covered her head tightly, and then continued with peace of mind. Go to sleep. Unexpectedly, such a change of posture, but the slender left leg extended out of the robe. The toes are exquisite, and the toenails are also painted with red, and the gesture is extremely horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sees her like this, and she can’t help but laugh, and her heart grows into pity. He is very clear about Fu Luoya's life experience. She is a world-famous, highly magical, and she is both beautiful and intelligent. It seems that fate has all her care for women. However, she can be said to be extremely unfortunate. In a sense, this sinister little goblin does not have a true loved one. The only great magister, Jero, who was better for her, was also killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and leaned over to cover the blankets for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the North Kingdom has entered the deep winter. The Wanlishan River is discolored outside the window, becoming a world of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was hundreds of years ago, this season is the favorite and active of the goddess of ice. According to the magic notes. The miracle of the goddess of ice and snow, and her power can be perceived and believed by mortals, but it was a thousand years ago, and the goddess of ice and snow has existed in the world when the world of silver was not claimed. The magic notes have a lot of information and legends, and there are dozens of research articles on magical props with the goddess of ice and snow. It can be seen that the person who took notes is a great magician and has profound theology.诣 诣. It is a pity that the great magician was on the same boat as the adventure team of Etna when he visited the ancient glaciers in the northern part of the Longines. It coincided with the fact that the adventurous team decided to temporarily transfer to work as a pirate. As a result, the talented magister was in the dark, and even a magic has not been released, and he has died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of this great magician’s investigation is not limited to the classics of the Silver St., but also includes the vast landforms of the Northland, the weather and any related to the goddess of ice and snow. Legends and magic items. The purpose of his investigation was to find out why the goddess of ice and ice no longer displayed miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about three hundred years ago, the miracle of the goddess of ice and snow reached its peak, and she even showed miracles in response to the request of believers! At that time, the sacred sects of the silver sects emerged in an endless stream, and the magic of the snow and ice masters leaps forward, and new powerful magic is constantly being researched, and the powerful magical items with the goddess of ice and snow are even beginning to be created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with other gods recorded at the time, the goddess of ice, although she is purely single because of her power, cannot be said to be the most powerful god, but she was indeed The most active god. The result was the rapid expansion of the silver sacred religion, which eventually ignited an unprecedented religious war with the bright church that had risen for a hundred years and had established a foothold in the northern country, and defeated the bright church known as the High God and the Supreme God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for some reason, after the expulsion of the Church of Light, the activity of the goddess of ice and snow gradually weakened. The sacrifices that can sense and use her gods are increasingly rare, and in recent decades there has been no more miracle of the goddess of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final record of the note is an amazing guess. After many researches, the great magician thought that the miracle of the goddess of ice and snow was not gradually weakened, but suddenly fell into silence after a big explosion of divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he suspects that the goddess of ice may have something. Although the devout faith made the great magician reluctant to write too direct and pessimistic, the strong uneasiness between his lines has revealed enough information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and seemed to be listening to something. But to his disappointment, there was no sound in the carriage behind. Not only that, the two people in the car are like sculptures, except for occasionally squinting their eyes and not even moving their fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage behind Rogge, it is Relo and Rose. Most of Relo’s ban has been cancelled, and he can move freely except that he can’t use vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a kind and generous person, always willing to give people a chance." Before he left, Rogge smiled and said to Relo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Mei again and said: "You and Relo are in a car. He doesn't care for you, and his heart is rare! By the way, persuade him, as long as he is willing to work for me, everything that happened in the past will be counted. And I can fulfill and protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merry obedience to the ground The carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the progress of the situation was greater than that of Rogge, and there was nothing to say about Relo and Rose along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Rogge’s understanding, Relo’s genital playboy, since he is willing to assassinate himself for the sake of his death, must be against I have already loved the depths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Relo and Rose wanted to pretend that they didn’t know each other, the source of their power couldn’t fool the fat, it’s all natural forces. What's more, when Relo was shackled and looked at Mei's eyes when he was dying, he was sad and sad, and almost all the entanglements between the two were clearly written on his face. Rogge is very slippery and skeptical, knowing the human nature, and knowing the deep feelings between Relo and Rose. But he still doesn't know if Relo has other purposes. Or simply want to kill yourself and save the rose. However, from the current point of view, Relo is more likely to save the rose. Although his ability is good, but he wants to assassinate Rogge alone, it is a bit unreasonable. How can I have several accomplices to meet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the beauty is flat, the more I love Relo. Rogge is determined to make good use of the Leroy card to force the true purpose of the day's strange action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the car is snowy and snowy, the car is warm and spring, and the small magical devices under the seat are constantly supplying heat. The carriage arrangement was extremely comfortable and extravagant. It was originally a Rogge-specific carriage, and now it was given to them. In such an environment, two couples who are in love and are in desperate situations suddenly have a moment of solitude. If they don’t give birth, it’s too much to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the birth of something, when the two depend on each other, they have to confide in what they are. It is this moment that Rogge waits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world is not as good as Rogge, and nothing is born in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they only use gestures to communicate silently, they can't escape the detection of Rogge's mental power. But these two people are just like the inanimate stone statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Relo and Rose show themselves in secret? Rogge shook his head and immediately ruled out this possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has already appeared, and most of the strong people's understanding and use of mental power is still quite shallow. For example, Androni, she could not detect the position of Rogge who used her spiritual power to cover her breath, and she did not know anything about Rogge’s exploration of her mentally. Although her strength is still immature, it is clear that Pross is not good at doing things in one area. Otherwise, Androni should have been involved in the defense and exploration of spiritual skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s hide even O'Reilly and the sky wrath have passed. How can it be possible to rely on Relo and Rose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is Relo and Rose communicating in a way that Rogge didn’t know? This is also impossible. Rogge did not show any signs of magic, vindictiveness or even the goddess of nature, and neither of them had any action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did they be in the eyebrows?" The fat man thought wickedly that the original clever arrangement was deadlocked and he had some patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rio's vindictiveness is also derived from the power system of the natural goddess, but it is still different from the city of the sky under the wrath of the sky. According to Rogge, Relo is likely to be born in other big Druids. The fat man really wants to know a little more about the information of other big Druids, especially the skin that is very strange with Mei's skin. It is always a lingering heart disease. Therefore, it will be so painstaking to arrange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not expect the close combat of the sky wrath to be so fierce, only a tiny opportunity between life and death, let Rogge kill the sky wrath. If the wrath of the sky does not cherish his life like that, then it will be replaced by Rogge on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the sky wrath is the strongest of the four Druids, the other three great Druids are not necessarily good to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage behind is still completely unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s anger is getting higher, if it’s not that his death magic is not at home, the memory extracted from the soul is riddled with holes. Is Gudello so so happy? Can bear the present, Rogge has recognized that the cultivation of Kung Fu is very home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved a smooth, mirror-like thin ice and tried to squeeze a smile against the shadow on the ice, constantly saying to himself: Don't be angry, relax, relax. Be patient, learn to wait, wait is also a kind of wisdom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria poked his head out of the blanket. I looked at Rogge in a confused way and sighed: "I am practicing and pretending to be a good person. Is it late?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not too late Rogge finally succeeded in maintaining an amiable smile and turned to her: "Why, I am a good person, where can I use it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He works hard The result was a big white eye for the little goblin. "You are a good person? That is really a hell." After that, the little goblins stretched out lazily and retracted into the blanket to continue her good dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there was a faint glimpse of the window. Rogra took the curtains and looked out, seeing passing by a village of considerable size. The villagers gathered in the open space outside the village, noisy and noisy. There was a wooden stake on the open space with a man tied up. There was a small team in the cavalry guarding Rogge. Enclose the open space. One of the villagers is talking to the captain of the cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Rogge asked the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Rogge, the eye of wisdom and the believers of the silver saints in the dispute. The one tied to the stake is the believer of the eye of wisdom, the villagers They are going to burn him. The villain has sent people to stop it in time and asked them to let go." Although the knight leader was born in the Chaoshan Legion, he knew that he was going forward. He knows that Prince Rogge is the biggest supporter of the Eye of Wisdom. So instead of waiting for Rogge, he will prepare first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded with satisfaction and closed the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At noon, the carriage suddenly stopped. This time, Rogge took the initiative to ask, the cavalry led himself to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ruling adult, there is a group of thousands of silver saints in front of them. They are said to destroy the Cathedral of Wisdom in Zolamu. What do you think we should do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zolamu City is not far from the territory of the Principality of Layton, where the cathedral is the last eye of the eye in the Empire. church. In a short period of time, this religious war has burned the thirteen churches of the Eye of Wisdom in the Empire, turning thousands of believers into a wandering soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pondered for a moment, faintly said: "Let them pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers command a glimpse Although he did not understand, he still ordered the withdrawal of the cavalry of the saints who were besieged in silver, and guarded Rogge to continue to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a week ago, the church in Zolamu City will inevitably burn in the fire. But now everything is different. Mora and dozens of mad believers have come to Zolamucheng to appease believers. To meet the thousands of silver saints, it will be a magical flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, after a morning of tug-of-war, the sun finally drove away the thick clouds, and the majestic red sun re-entered the land of the North. The compartment was filled with golden warm light, which made people sleepy. Froya, who had eaten the delicious lunch, sat for a while and then yawned with two yawns. The beautiful green eyes became blurred again. She simply plunged into the blanket and continued to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A magic book with a lambskin cover slipped from her hand and fell silently on a thick carpet. Rogge grabbed his hand and opened it. It turned out to be a book explaining the principles of natural power movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one day's journey, Rogge has fully witnessed the tragic war of religion. In remote border areas where state power is difficult to reach. Because of the lack of restraint, the self-defense between believers is even more unscrupulous. He saw the man who had been burnt to death, the believer who had been inserted on the stake and had not yet died, and the girl who had been insulted to death. Of course, most of these people are believers in the eyes of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is the territory of this place?" In the evening, Rogge finally asked the cavalry commander about the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This band should be the territory of the Marquis of Pontiac." The cavalry commander replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded and closed the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a kitten like a kitten. Perhaps because she was too tired in the past, she slept soundly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have seen the situation on this road, what are you going to do next?" I don't know when, the white white condensed by the pale golden light appeared in the compartment. Inside, sit next to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For any believer, faith is unique. It is either this god or the god. So for us to expand the power of faith People, the result is only two, get or lose. I can never like to lose this person." Rogge replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth said: "There may be a second road between getting and losing. Unfortunately, most of my memory is left in heaven. Now there is only a little fuzzy memory. My body is going to the north soon, hoping to gain something. I can't protect you during this time, so you have to spend more time to strengthen your strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp He looked at Rogge and frowned. "Wait, there seems to be some change in the natural goddess in your body... But where is the specific change, I can't see it, you don't have to be too much." Worried, I will remember this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight fluctuation in the space, and Wella appeared in the carriage. She took off the helmet of the demon lotus, the waterfall-like straight gold spilled, and the entire carriage was illuminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena’s eyes glowed with a touch of gold, staring at Macbeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe smiled and owed a debt: "I am not a good choice for you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true." Wella said, "When you go to the North, help me to pay attention to the existence of those forces that are still visible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mike White said: "When swallowing will make power grow fast, the power it brings is not pure, and it is not good for your ultimate strength improvement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is cold and cold: "Is it better for me than you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have stayed with the Lord God for a long time..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You get the second pair of wings because you have been singing the Lord God for a long time, not to say that your strength really reaches the level of the four wings." The word sharp is like a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth helplessly smiles, he knows that the understanding of the power of the light angels is just asking for trouble, so he is determined to avoid, and his body shape is gradually disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at Wella, his face was very strange, after a while he said: "***, your change is really big..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly smiled, glimpsed and swept away to the ear and there was a change? In fact, everything is the same as before, but you only noticed it now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plain sentence made Rogge stay in place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;威Na looked at the sleeping Froya, took off the devil's gloves, and reached out and licked the golden gossip of the little goblin. The little goblin who was disturbed by the sleep had a very bad temper, she did not wake up completely, only blurred Unclear angrily muttering, then screaming and covering his head with a blanket.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina smiled and said: "She can really sleep! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, the setting sun melts gold, and the mountains and the mountains flow golden. Inside the car, Xinfang darkly crossed. The two beautiful women are absolutely beautiful. Faced with this situation, I don’t know why, Rogge is not happy at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, your strength..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a way. You must always remember that only the power is the ground, it is the whole world." Wella finished, reorganized the devil, but also fell into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night, Rogge finally got on the carriage behind him. He looked at Relo and Rose, who were sitting opposite each other, and smiled: "You really admire me! I want to ask, have you considered it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Relo and Rose looked at Rogge calmly, and it seemed as if the strong expression carved out of a mold made Roger's anger rise again unstoppable. The fat man nodded very well! It seems that you have made a decision. My only hope is that you will not regret it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ripped open Relo’s clothes, revealing his body-building body, and then taking out the soul-stricken scorpion from his arms, so that it was cold. The blade edge slides on the raised chest muscles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Mr. Relo, the time for forgiveness has passed, now it’s time to liquidate between us. The problem is. You are the first to play the Princess Marika who is destined to marry me, and I almost lost the title of the prince. You let me lose my face in front of the people in Dresden. But I can't care about these, but do you remember that you used this sting to stab an elf! I once promised to take care of this elf, but in order to keep her life, I have to turn her into a more evil existence than the Dark Elves, but even then, I still can't keep her life and it is I am not saying that I am a good person. On the contrary, you will soon be present, how cruel and evil I am. Now, do you want to taste the taste of this cockroach yourself? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Rogge, the wind butterfly is of course killed by Druid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Please! "Relo is indifferent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and laughed at this hatred. How good is this so cheap?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man put a paralysis on his hand, sealed all the actions of Relo, and then it was a silence, so that he could not even call out. After being properly arranged, Rogge ripped open Relo’s trousers and glanced at him, praising him: “It’s good! Unfortunately, your dear rose is still in my hands, Marika’s hatred. That's it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and looked up at Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is pale and the body trembles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess what would I do with Relo? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary smiled very reluctantly, bitterly and eloquently: "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stroking With the perfect body of Relojian, he slowly said: "This body is perfect, of course, can not be arbitrarily damaged, so I will not use corporal punishment on him. Of course, this thing is excluded."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger used the ecstasy to provoke the majestic face of Relo, the best doctor in the emperor, I will let them take the most blunt knife, reward this thing every day. Small pieces, then heal the wound. The moment we arrive at the gate of the Imperial Capital, we must just give the last remaining remnant. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Rose is completely bloodless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge continues: "To you One of the unfortunate things to say is that the level of the soul is probably stronger than the average big magician. I don't plan to ask anything from Relo now, so I will take his memory once a day and know how much. Still at the moment I arrived at the Imperial Capital, I would completely extract his soul from the body. As for this body that has lost its soul, it will be a good material for making dolls. Those lonely ladies will love it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose lowered his head and had already bitten his lip.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly shouted: "Speak everything you know, I will let him go!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
