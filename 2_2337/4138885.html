On the wasteland, only Macbeth stood in the same place, looking up and looking at the once red day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the red ocean of Fanghua has become the focus of the whole world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus, standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, sighed for a long time and took back his gaze watching the sky. He looked back, the old pope's pope was leaning against the chair, his eyes were half-closed and half-closed, and he was sleeping, as if he could not afford to sleep at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the far north of the country, in a small courtyard in the corner of the Imperial Palace, the boss always slowly closed the window and separated the cold winds of the early winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s the center of the continent or the edge, those eyes that look at the red ocean across time and space are taken back, they sigh, or shake their heads, or think thoughtfully . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fibrinous hand suddenly appeared in front of Rogge, the one The thick magic book is closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat! You have seen this magic book for three days. How come it is not finished? Don’t you remember a seventh-order magic? You learned it. How long should I learn?" Androni sat on the table in front of Rogge and stared at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She changed the common dress of a noble young man today, the shirt is solemn and noble black, the long-lasting tall collar and the lotus sleeves are decorated with complicated The beautifully-made Alna hand-made lace, the same-color tight-fitting trousers have no smudges, just the right tailoring, outlines the legs of her legs full of strength but without losing the soft lines. The only thing that can reflect her old preferences. It is a sapphire brooch on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This classic aristocratic costume is on Androni, exuding the deadly charm of the British and feminine. Especially under the black laces that overlap in the neck, the long neck, the delicate clavicle and the white skin are looming, and the strong contrast between black and white creates a dazzling visual effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man's eyes are shining, staring at the large, white and faint curves of the skin between the collars, amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, you really have to change your clothes. However, it’s so good to wear such cheap clothes on you. It looks like the clothes look good. It doesn't matter, it's important for people who wear clothes to look good!" Rogge sighed, his eyes slammed down from the neckline, and he swayed along the peaks and valleys that followed the rhythm of the breathing, reaching the fullness of the shoulders that could not be increased or decreased by half an inch. Finally, along the elegant jade arm, I saw the slender finger on the magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, he remembered Androni’s question. Then he replied: "I am learning the way of magical casting. From the first-order magic, I will see the fifth-order magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ander Ronnie frowned: "Dead fat, have you already been able to instantly send fourth-order magic? Do you still need to see this kind of magic book?" If it is a big magician's notes, it's almost the same."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated and finally said: "Annie, there is no shortcut to the growth of power, the magic world is the same. I used to be too easy to cast magic. So the foundation laid. It's not good. I can't really understand the mysteries of the magic world without re-learning the most basic orthodox magic casts. These casting methods are the result of the magical wisdom of the past magicians. I am the greatest genius in the history of magic, and it is impossible to compare. I have had the collective wisdom of so many magicians in the previous generation. Not to mention that I am not a genius, I can have today's achievements, because I have opportunities that others have not encountered. If there is a special opportunity, get a little small. As a result, I regard myself as a genius, then I am a real fool. So I am determined to make up the most basic things before I can go further."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at Rogge and said: "You are quite self-aware! However, you are in this small building every day, do not go to the headquarters of the Legion, completely ignore the military affairs of the Chaoshan Legion. Is that okay? You are not trying to fight back to the South, do you look at Wallace's guys?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni frowned and said: "I am not interested in listening to your struggle for power. This way, I am very kind, and now I will help you test the results of magical learning. You accompany me to walk outside the city. Let’s go and see the scenery.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge understands what she meant by looking at the scenery, so she smiled: “It’s OK to go, but this If you lose, what are you going to lose me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was furious and immediately said: "If I lose again, then...just... ..." She just had to let go of her swearing, and suddenly she felt a little guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatny smiles very badly: "Let me handle it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni face Red and white, biting silver teeth, and the eyebrows unknowingly picked up, but this swearword can not spit out anyway. In any case, her sacred swordsman should never be afraid of Rogge, not to mention the artifacts in her hands. Don't say that Rogge can only use the seventh-order magic, that is, he succeeded in releasing an eighth-order magic, touched the door of the big magician, and should also be more than a few wins against Androni. But Androni had no courage and Roger gambled on her last time. She was not afraid of Rogge's power. She was just afraid of Rogge's endless stream of inexplicable patterns. Lost to the fat man, it is impossible to feel convinced orally, there will be endless depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less nonsense, let me go!" Androni bit her lower lip, licking the fat man from behind the table and jumping out of the window . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside of the city of Sidde, it is still a wasteland. The endless red land has been quiet since ancient times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is surprisingly not violent today, like a lazy shepherd boy, occasionally wielding a whip, driving a little light dust close to the ground to make a few whirlpools, the air is rare The clean, the vision has also become wider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the day and night. The sun converges to the glory of the earth during the day, and the blushing sunset glows instead of the warm golden mansions to become the main color of the sky. The wilderness is also the same heavy red, as if carrying the sorrow of all the undead in the 100-year battle. The endless sight of the uninhabited, only the last golden awn, which has not faded, hangs on the walls, towers, red clay and vegetation, becoming the only vivid color in this monotonously deep red world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure passed like a comet, and Androni, carrying a fat man, flew on the wilderness. She has a little bit of toes. It will flatten out more than ten meters. Although she can already fly by her own power, it consumes too much vindictiveness and cannot support long-distance flights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a long-distance flight, the Sanctuary flight cannot be compared to the magician's flight. However, the magical flight is not as fast as the power of the Sanctuary in the speed and agility of the moment, so the power in close combat cannot be compared with the flight of the Sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Annie, haven't you said that you are going to lose to me?" The fat man safely enjoys a free journey and still does not forget to ask for a bet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Even if I promise you now, wouldn’t it be regrettable?" Androni said. Her face is also red and red, she really can't understand, how can such a rogue language say from her mouth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and just wanted to say something, suddenly his face changed. Androni also felt abnormal, and she stretched her hand. Holding a light blue shield in front of you, the body in the fly is fixed in the same place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a splendid golden glow in the sky, as if the bleak red sun has revived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground in front of them suddenly bulged upwards, and then in the huge roar, the earth and stone flew, and the columnar smoke rose into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was dignified and backhanded out the stars. Rogge was not idle, and immediately began to busy adding various auxiliary magic to himself. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the smoke and dust dispersed, the ground in front of the two appeared a deep ditch that was more than ten meters long and nearly one meter deep. It is like the sword of the gods left on the ground. In the rear air of the sword mark. A middle-aged man with a long-haired shawl and a majestic face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this middle-aged man only wore an ordinary robes, he looked at him with the golden light that could not be circulated. A pair of white wings behind the high stretch, and the majesty of the shape, Rogge only felt a bit bitter in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is holding a giant sword burning. Roger is no stranger to the burning flame attached to the blade, it is the flame of heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred atmosphere of the other person’s body is not very strong, but it contains the pressure of it, the vastness of the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This middle-aged man only swept through Androni, his eyes straight on Rogge. His voice was cold and cold: "Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded and then tentatively asked: "You are..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man is cold and authentic: "My name is Macbeth! Dirty Necromancer, honestly surrender, do you still need me to do it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took a deep breath, a little blue light illuminates from the stars, and quickly bursts into the sky and stars, and protects the whole body. She shouted: "Who are you? Want us to surrender, is it so easy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbee has turned into a golden pupil, he looks to Ander Ronnie, said: "You are very beautiful young woman. Although I am not as fascinated with the study of aesthetics as MGM, I am very kind, so I am also unwilling to destroy the existence of beauty. I will give you a lesson. After seeing the majesty of heaven, I hope that you will not be stupid enough to anger me again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth holds a sword and looks up to heaven. Start whispering prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood still, but secretly listened to the contents of Macbeth’s prayer. But what makes him hate is that Macbeth is praying in a language he doesn't understand. I just don't know that the old fox of Xiusi does not understand the language of the heavens. It seems that it is necessary to learn the language of the heavens in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is not as easy as Rogge. At this moment, Macbeth’s full attention was placed on her, and every word he prayed was like a loud bell, and he slammed on her soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a prayer is completed, Macbeth’s power will increase by one point! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the burning giant sword is close to transparency. The space around Macbeth also slightly distorted, and the small sandstone on the ground like the orphans abandoned by gravity fluttered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni shouted. Gather up your body and fly to Macbeth like a blue meteor! But Macbeth has already laid a guardian enchantment that is condensed by the flames of heaven. Her starry spirit is sinister and sinister, and the power is absolutely in the top position in all kinds of attributes. However, for the pure heavenly flame, the power of starry vindictiveness can not be fully exerted. As for her sacred attributes, how can it compare with the pure flames of heaven? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni instantly stabbed dozens of swords, and Macbeth’s Heavenly Flames enchantment swayed under her mad attack. But it just doesn't fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gasped for a moment, and was about to give her a full blow to the flames, and Macbeth’s eyes suddenly opened! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An indescribably powerful force began to gather on Macbeth. This power is so powerful that the space around tens of meters around Macbeth can’t stand it. The field is unattractive and becomes extremely unstable. The various scenes seen through the force field are suddenly elongated, and they are flattened, like a projection of a crazy alien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s maroon long hair flutters uncontrollably. She was shocked and the lightning back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth slowly raised his hand and pointed a finger at Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky in the sky does not know where the lead clouds are rapidly gathering and tumbling, eventually forming a huge cloud vortex. The center of the cloud vortex turns from gray to red, then red to white, and then a bright and thick flame tower descends from the cloud. Instantly drown Androni! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white sword in the hands of Mike White has a slanted cross, and two cross-flame blades that are several meters long appear out of thin air. They fly silently. In a flash, the flame column that is still burning is flying, and it flies for dozens of meters before it gradually disappears. Only the two deep black ditch left on the ground where the flame blade flies can witness their horrible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The celestial flame of heaven is gradually extinguished, Androni knees on one knee and barely supports the body with a starry sky. She was pale, her lips were bloody, and there was a thin bloodline flowing out of her mouth. Her long hair has curled up and there are many burning marks on her black clothes. But it seems that the power of Macbeth is a terrible attack. She is just a force and a minor injury, this is a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But!" Macbeth's cold golden eyes stared at Rogge, and his tone suddenly became murder: "With your ridiculous magic, I dare to intervene in my battle. Do you really want to resist me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Flame Sword is lifted up again, and Macbeth will not have the slightest pity for the ugly Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the complexity of this world is clearly far beyond his imagination, even though he is a high-ranking angel with powerful power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Rogge fell to the ground, his hands reaching out to the white Macbeth, with a high aria, with the most sincere feelings: "Revolt How can I resist? You have asked me to surrender. I really want to keep my opinion. No, I will not surrender! I will return, follow, and worship you, I will be your faithful believer! Please accept my faith. In the world, I am a powerful mage. I have a passionate power and a lot of followers. I will not tarnish your reputation in the world! Ah, look, you look down on the majesty of all beings, see, you Ze is radiant by the glory, look, your power beyond all humble existence! You must be the main god of heaven! Please tell me your name, this is the request of the most humble believer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a strange scene made Macbeth unprepared, and a Necromancer actually yelled to become a high-ranking angel believer? But Macbeth pays more attention to the other content. He replied coldly: "The humble necromancer, I am not the main god of the heavens, but the angel who serves the Lord God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! Seeing the angels who came, how can an angel have such power, so majestic?" The fat man slammed the earth: "The Lord God should not deceive a mortal land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Bai Dao: "The Necromancer, I am not the Lord God. The angels you can see are only the angels of the lowest heavens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone Unconsciously, it has been much milder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Macbeth has served in the front of the god of the order, Fleet Mill, and does not know how many times, where are the inferior nine-order eight-order angels can match? It seems that this necromancer can't do anything else. Eyesight is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s unbelievable look, swearing: “Well, I admit that I am wrong. Are you the Holy Angels recorded in the Holy Scriptures... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s feeling was extremely sharp. After a sentence was not finished, he immediately sensed the murderous murder in the air. He immediately changed his mind: “No! Light Angel They are all arrogant guys, you are so generous and kind. How can they be related to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth's face suddenly eased. Although his face was hidden behind the flaming flame, the flame could not stop Rogge's silver eyes, so the change of Macbeth's expression was received by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mother of Necromancer, say everything you know about O'Reilly!" Macbeth said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart was shocked, how is it again? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that an invisible vortex has formed around the mysterious goddess. In a short period of time, two mysterious and powerful presences have been asked to ask him about O'Reilly. The Macbeth that I met today is not an ordinary angel. The second pair of wings hidden behind it can fully explain his identity. Think of the accounts of the four-winged angels in the Holy Scriptures. Rogge's forehead oozes through the fine sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Holy Scriptures. The glory of the four wings is only the highest angel, or the messenger of the Lord God. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Macbeth did not fully exert his power, but the golden glory of the air has already made the death and darkness of Rogge very hard. He did not dare to use his mental strength to resist, letting the golden glow of the earth devour his dark magic and the spirit of the dead. Only the mental organs have protected the most vital organs in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden brilliance is clearly different from the sacred power that Rogge has ever touched or seen before. Whether it is an advent angel like Kara Yang. It is still the Master of Light in the Church of Light, even the mighty of the Blood Angel Augustus. Although the divine power used has an advantage over the darkness and death, it is mainly determined by the absolute size of power. However, although the golden brilliance of Macbeth is weak, it contains a little strange power. Therefore, this seemingly weak sacred power is like a warm spring, flowing through the snowy field of darkness and death. Where the spring water passes, the snow and ice melt and merge into the hot springs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s power quickly eroded and his heart was loose. A rock next to him suddenly showed a thick green light. Immediately turned into a wolf-sized animal! This exotic animal has a slender body and is bamboo-shaped. The lower part is supported by slender but extremely powerful four-legged long legs, and the upper limbs are two extremely sharp sickles. It seems that this strange animal is like a huge cockroach, but it has no eyes, and it is completely locked in the sense of the goddess of the natural goddess in Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four legs of the beast are together, and they appear on the top of Rogge as lightning, and the two knife-shaped forelimbs are forced into the back of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge seems to be over-powered and completely unresponsive to this attack. Androni, although Rogge gave her a flame protection, she was not seriously injured, but her vindictiveness has been exhausted in the attack against Macbeth. At this point she was powerless and could only watch the beast attacking Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth ‘咦’, the giant sword arbitrarily pointed, a group of holy flames appeared in nowhere, and burned the alien volley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Necromancer, why are you guilty of the natural goddess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respect Macbeth, how can I disrespect the natural goddess of heaven? This magic is a conspiracy of the fallen goddess of nature..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature The goddess is not a heaven." Macbeth corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s heart is happy, he immediately speaks honestly, and the source comes from local Ale’s power. How to deal with the Druid's cruelty. Ten minutes passed in a blink of an eye, and Rogge’s long story was only opened. Macbeth was really impatient, not to mention that almost all of Roger’s information experiences were documented in the Church of Light. Before this trip, Macbeth had already read these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately interrupted Rogge impatiently and said: "These will be said later! Rogge, what you know. Everything about O'Reilly." Said it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty immediately noticed that Macbeth’s title for himself had changed from the Necromancer to Rogge, and his heart quietly breathed a sigh of relief. . And from the reaction of Macbeth. He obviously knows the past experience of his own, and as far as the source of information is concerned, it is from the Church of Light. It seems that although the Church of Light is in the South, their eyes have never overlooked the largest empire in the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a good idea in the moment, knowing that he must not lie at will, or that the last chance to get back on the edge of life and death will be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge will confess everything to Achilles on the same day. They were all transferred to Macbeth as they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Macbeth was very patient and kept listening to Rogge to finish everything. He pondered for a moment, finally sneer, and thought to himself: "Ao Rulei, now the evidence is solid, I see how you should return to heaven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Macbe suddenly bowed his head and asked: "I just said this to you, have you said anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue thought for a moment, the language trembled Authentic: "I was surprised by a very strange. But very powerful guy, he...he also asked about O'Reilly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike was very tight, and immediately interrogated the person's appearance. Rogge only said a few words. He frowned and slowly said: "Achilles..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth has dispersed his body's flame protection. Falling on the ground, said: "Rog, you are very honest, but also changed my view of the Necromancer, very good. Just the Necromancer should serve the dark gods, why do you want to follow the angels of heaven?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can the weak power of the dark gods compare with the glory of the heavenly god? Hey, the respected Macbeth, if there is a choice, who wants Every day dealing with wet, dark and stinking dead bodies? Today you met with glory and even surpassed the Lord God. I... actually have a little selfishness. That is to hope for redemption!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Rescue?" Macbeth raised his eyebrows and said: "Your things about heaven. It seems that there is a lot of knowledge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
