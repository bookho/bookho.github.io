			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gloomy, heavy forest stretches in the Central Mountains and does not see the end. The forest shimmered in the deep, and then the thick fog and night again covered everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses climbed up from Rogge’s belly and stretched his body. He smiled and said: “Fortunately, nothing hurts.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge grinned from the ground and couldn’t help but blame: "Miss! Of course you have nothing to do! But I am from ten meters high. It’s really luck to fall down without a broken bone!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses smiles this body is far stronger than ordinary humans, simple and advanced The demons are comparable. Don't say ten meters, it is the place where you can jump down and you can't kill you. If you have no way to go in the future, suicide by jumping off the cliff is also a good choice for death! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has a physical scroll. Isn't it true that you can see Artest? How is it here, there is no trace of the Mozu activity? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses closed his eyes, after a moment, pointing to the distance, the Taisten adults were in that direction... Distance, about About fifty kilometers. Usually I can teleport, but now my magic is burned out and I can only go. "[< /> /> </ br> </ br> What are you doing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Back you! Can you get five kilometers away from your body now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses did not hesitate and fell on the back of Rogge. She only wore a coat from Rogge, so it was almost the same as the skin. Rogge was somewhat uncontrollable on the spot, and his body was obviously inflated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people walked silently in the forest. In this virgin forest, there seems to be no such thing as a far-fetched World of Warcraft. Even if there is, it feels the darkness that Elysses can no longer restrain, and how far it can hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge easily pushed down a small tree that was blocked, and compared to a simple gesture, five magic missiles. Five flying bullets with pink light fluttered and found a poisonous snake. This kind of magical control, even Elysses is a little admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to call me Miss again, just call me Elysses. I ask you, do you know what the price of your choice is?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was silent, and he walked silently for a while, whispering: "I know. This time, everything goes over there, Rights, status, money...and women...have no. If I go to the devil world, I will not be truly trusted by a human being..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Little Rogge, you actually have a good future. Although it made Orphee angry, you took the same note to the church. If you don’t have an accident, you won’t be able to use it for ten years. If you want to be a strong, you have a unique talent. What's more... I heard that the Roscio family is also interested in marrying you. This is not only good for you, but also for secular power. . They family, martial art and magic esoteric collection of very rich "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Roger sighed some things are thing of the past, and now regret what use is it? What's more... I am a person, I have already thought about it before, and I will not regret it after I have done it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses was a little tired, she leaned her head against Rogge and gently said: "But, Rogge...we It is impossible between the two, no matter what you do for me, how much is done, it is impossible. There is only one person in my heart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge shakes his body and then walks forward if nothing happens.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people Silence for a long time, Rogge said slowly: "This time, you have been much better for me, I did not want to get so much, just want to have a hope. If you don’t even have a hope, why bother to do this to me? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sighed secretly, and he had seen the strength of Orphey Roque. If you say genius, then the golden lion is a model of martial arts genius! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s mouth turned and tried to test: “So, you and Orpheq, as if... there is some conflict in position?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the silence is Elysses, she gently said: "I know, I knew from the beginning. I never want to ask him. I don’t want to go to the Devil World. I also know that there will probably be a day when I have to break up. I just didn’t expect this day to come so fast... What is the use of the big magic? Even one’s heart can’t be recovered.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Rogge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sleepy, I have to sleep first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked, could she not support it? But in this damn forest, he has no way to be faster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted the name of Elysses, and her response was getting weaker. Rogge suddenly thought of a way. He recovered it with one hand and squeezed it on the hips of Elysses. But Elysses is completely silent. He didn't have the privilege of being able to take advantage of it. He only felt that his heart was getting cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently put her on the ground and stared at the sleepy Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly seems to be aware of it, looking back, a looming figure is standing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog did not pay attention to this figure, but kept whispering: "Is she dying?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure stood quietly for a while, patted Rogge's shoulder gently. Rog looked up and saw only the hand-colored glazed color in the night, but the face was hidden in a very beautiful helmet. From a physical point of view, this seems to be a woman, or, is a dark banshee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has burst into tears, but he does not know. He looked at the figure, but his eyes focused on the endless distance, whispering: "You said, will she die? Will she die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figure raised his left hand and pointed out the back neck of Rogge! Then Rogge felt that the whole body's mental power was like being opened, and the all-in-one finger rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to struggle, wants to call, but can’t call it, and he can’t move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, his huge mental power is only a small half. A dark ball of light slowly condensed at the tip of her right finger, and the powerful dark waves made Rogge surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark black light ball broke away from her fingers and slowly flew into the eyebrows of Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, the black luster of the figure seems to be dim, and the almost dried Rogge is also on the ground. The figure turned and left, slowly immersed in the night, no matter how Roger called, did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses stretched out and stood up. Gently said: "I haven’t slept so well for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was ecstatic, rushed over and hugged Elysses, tears Uncontrollable, rolling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses smiled and wiped out Rogge’s tears, softly: "Little Rogge, want to be a strong, always crying I feel a lot more comfortable. I didn't expect you to convert your mental power into dark energy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger wants to stop, he doesn't Knowing who the figure is, why did you suddenly help him? However, the atmosphere is very familiar...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people are beginning to wander in the forest again. This time Rogge has accelerated a lot, he doesn’t know that The dark energy of the group can also support the long time of Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge smiled bitterly: "How can you be interested in this? I am a strong embryo, that is the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses Laughing: "The princess will also have vanity, come quickly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact... I may like it when I first saw you. You are here. In my heart... you are perfect and unattainable. So all the time, you are hiding in my heart as a dream. Until today when the angel appeared, ... I know that this dream has How important it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses put a ring on Rogge's neck and sighed: "Even if it is a dream, you don't have to give up everything. Devil world, even if I am taken care of by my father, as a human being, it is up to you to get power and status. What's more, you will not like the enjoyment of the devil world."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed: "Elysses, I am only twenty-four years old this year, and still have some money to pursue My dreams are also the courage to break the boat and push back. Maybe in a few years, I will never have this kind of courage. This time, no matter what I lost, I will not regret it! Life is alive, I have to bet on my dreams. Once!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses knocked on Rogge’s head humans, that is to say! She opened a small mouth and spit out a black crystal of size and handed it to Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a collection of some magical magical knowledge, as well as the doll spells you have always wanted to learn." Get it done, don't lose it. When I have time, I will learn, so I won’t go to the Devil World. I have no face on my face. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and thought about it, threw the crystal into the mouth and swallowed it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ericis remembered that the crystal was just spit out from his mouth, his face was red, and he was chiseling on Rogge’s head. He said: "You dare to change the law to occupy me." Cheap! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet night, Rogge’s crying voice is obviously obvious: "The princess is alive!" ... Anyway, it is not the first time to take advantage of you. If you are a large number of adults, why bother? Hey! ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a loud noise, 'Night Return' Inn's The two doors were kicked off in disgust, and they were still stunned by a guest who couldn't escape. In fact, the two doors were open, and the reason why they had to kick down was that the intention was nothing more than Liwei.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilys is very calm, since she came to Lille with Rogge, it seems that trouble has never been broken. But she is not afraid of these troubles, no matter how much trouble, as long as It’s worthwhile to stay with him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guests who were still stunned saw the people coming in from the gate and immediately stopped talking. The bruised guests gnawed their teeth and ran from the back door. There was only one drunken guest in the store who was still asleep at the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen silver armor The knight rushed into the store, and the white cloak was decorated with a bloody cross. For a glance at the entire store, the two maids were scared to hide behind Lilith. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Who is Lilith? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am! Lilith stepped forward and looked at the holy knight, and did not give up at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but different ordinary women!" The holy knight sighed, and Road: "You go with me! I haven't seen anyone else in your store."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you going back with you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the law enforcer of the religious trial. The lower-level nobleman Rogge has been ruled as a heresy, and the people associated with him are going to the religious trial to be examined. Miss, you The courage makes me admire, so I just have to take you back." The holy knight said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith's face became pale. Thousands of people have entered the religious trials every year, but have not heard of any ones that have been released. However, the news that Rogge was ruled as heresy shocked her even more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graceful smile of the holy knight solidified, and then a little angry, watching the fearless girl, he sighed that the character such as Mr. Rogge was not a trivial matter, and the above must be justified. As for me, I am only ordered to act, because you have the courage to let others go. If you refuse to cooperate, I have to bring back the people in the store. Miss, you know, just because of these few words, you have already become a big crime, you can get on the fire column. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith asked: "Rogge! Where are you keeping him? Even if he is heresy! Why don't you believe that your religion will be judged and you will be on fire! If you are spreading the truth, why force others! Does the supreme god like to send people to the prison column? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy knight was somewhat difficult to answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a lazy voice sounded: "If they are reasonable with you, can they still be mixed in the final jury?" In the matter of heresy, the church never makes sense. But you can rest assured that there is me, and whoever can take you today! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Knights were furious and showed their swords. They stared at the voice, the guest on the table.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked up, the beautiful and almost fascinating face made all the people stunned. He just gathered the forehead and stood swaying. Up. Although the drunkenness is awkward, every movement of his eyes makes people's eyes shine. The feeling is actually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mei!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Knight shook his head, which drove out ridiculous thoughts from his mind. He tried to remember who would dare to challenge the authority of the Doomsday Judgment. Even if he did not Enemy, but now the three giants of the Judiciary will gather in the city of Lille, and who will be afraid of it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person with such a look should not be a nameless person. He suddenly thought of one person, was shocked, and suddenly felt that riding a tiger was difficult.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre! Marshal Rosio, young son, Juggernaut Rossis closes disciples! Marshal Rosherio and the high-level leaders of the church have been very close, and they are all big men who can't reach them. And Procis, one of the Big Six and Three Great Juggernauts, is even more offensive. Compared with the three giants, Prossis is also the winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels embarrassed and hard-headed: "You are an Andrea." In the next is also ordered to act, please do not bother us to do things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre frowned, and two cold eyes stared at his face, and he saw him sweating coldly. "Since you already know me Who is it, not fast? Do you want me to do it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andre, this order was personally issued by Master Chrisma. Are you thinking about it again? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre suddenly smiled and his eyes waved. Even though he knew that he was a man, he still felt dizzy in his head. Andre’s blue eyes Suddenly spilled out, and then the whole house was turned into a dreamy blue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Knights were lost in the dream for a while, when they suddenly woke up Only now, the armor and the long sword in the hand have turned into Yingying blue. A light breeze has passed, and the blue swords are turned into a little bit of stardust, which flies with the wind. Only a dozen of them are covered with coarse hemp. The knight of the clothes is staying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to roll again, do you want to try the taste of the slap!" Andre screamed and stunned the sacred knights to leave the emperor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre looked at the direction of the Holy Knight’s departure, his brow was locked. Called Lilith, handed a book and a small purse to her, she could only stop them for a while, and they will come back later. This is some money, and there are some ways to get started with the swordsmanship. Re-administer this shop, and quickly ride my horse to leave Lille City! Rest assured, on the treacherous sinister, teach those people is definitely not the opponent of the dead fat, where is it easy to catch him? You just need to protect yourself, naturally there will be Seeing his chances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith still hesitated: "But what do you do? It is not a trivial matter to offend the church!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre is a little laughter and not an ordinary person, just because the last day of the jury has no way to move me! If you don't leave, you will probably be taken by the church as a bait to trap Rogge. You have to be a little self-protected, remember to read the book I gave you! Go ahead... go! How is this mother-in-law, not like you! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre smiled a little and thought to himself: After leaving me to break, but for the fat man who dared to collide with the church, it was really different, this is a dead girl! I will get better after you wait. Last time, it shouldn’t be so easy to let you go! Froya, if you are... If you are willing to let go of everything for me, how good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have seen the beautiful figure again, and heard the words that are absolutely determined.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The figure greeted him with his sword's tip, and with his soft chest, he greeted the sharp edge of the sword with a soft sword!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end For a moment, he suddenly stopped. Fu Luoya's proud, unconventional figure passed him and gradually disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why! This program is not only good for us, but also does not hurt anyone on both sides! Why can't you accept it? Is your principle more important than our feelings? Andrei almost hysterically yelled at the back of Fu Luoya.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stopped, she suddenly covered her face and sobbed : "This is not a principle. This is an honor. It is the pride flowing in the blood of the family!" This pride in the depths of the soul made me have to reject your plan. Andre, don't doubt my love for you. If you have the slightest doubt, you will stab your sword and I will prove my love for you with my blood. Andrea, I have no choice, maybe you have no other choice, or let me go, or kill me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre whispered: "You know, I would rather stab myself and never hurt you." You go, I love, hope... everything has a result before... Don't meet again..." The Starry Star Sword finally slipped from his powerless hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We... why are you born in the royal family!" Froya burst into tears, and she suddenly turned and threw herself into Andre’s arms, and the two madly kissed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fool Ya’s figure gradually became transparent, and finally she entered another space, leaving only a little salty tears on Andre’s lips.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An De Lie woke up from his memory. He poured a large bowl of wine and smiled bitterly: "Offended the church?" I am now... will you care about this? I don't care about anything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A low voice came in from the door: "Andre is not a sage of the Juggernaut, but also ask your sword skills." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith returned to the store step by step, and the back door also flooded into several holy knights.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Andre's face changed and calmed down. He said coldly: "Crisma, you have this Yaxing, how can I not let you do it!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another person entered the store, this is a 30-year-old knight, with a beard, a dark armor, and a serious kill. He angered when he entered the door: "What are you talking about! The person named in the religious trial, can you let it go? Still not apologizing to Chris Ma! Are you still suffering from a disaster? I will go back later, if I am a big brother, if you don’t teach you well, you really don’t know how thick it is! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre was shocked and stood up, but he was a little helpless. "Big brother!" ? You are not the head of the Knights in the Principality of Carin, how come here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers angered: "Now is the key time, how can I not come?" If I don't come, don't you still have to go on! ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma advised: "Gossards, your brother, after all, is young and young." This little girl is named above, I must take it away. I don’t know anything else that is born today. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But" Crisma’s tone went to me just after the day. But today, if you are here, Augustus is an adult. There is trouble. In the future, Gonzalez will have to restrain more of Andre’s talents.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gonzalez nodded: “Then It’s natural, it’s natural. Andre! But I’m sorry to apologize to Chrisma!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre coldly: "Big brother, you and My father is a man of great talent. I don't have much to say in some words. But you are too disregarding the feelings of others!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
