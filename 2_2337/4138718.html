			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep hall is flickering, and occasionally there is milky white or dark green light sweeping through. The ghosts who usually patrol the hall are now desperately hiding in the shadow of the corner of the hall, fearing that it will be illuminated by the light. It is only because of the enchantment set by the *** that these ghosts have no way to leave the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***With the hand of the jaw, leaning against the high throne, silently watching the three light groups floating in front of the eyes. Two of the light groups are scattered with a milky white halo. Through the light ball, it can be seen that there are countless feathers floating in it. The white ball of light suddenly lights up and bursts into a small flame. A burst of sacred breath came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-green ball is much quieter. There are countless green clouds in it. After a long time, there will be an electric light exploding in the green cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory squats in the shadow beside the stone seat, fearing two white light groups, but seeing the dark green light group At the time, its eyes were full of greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, can you move the flames of the two angels a little, I really can't stand those holy lights! Master, your power now It’s too unfathomable! You’re not afraid that these lights are too adoring you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flashing light reflects the face of *** Ming and dark. She slowly opened her eyes and the soft silver light blew from her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, are you trying to make a hard fight, is the soul energy of the green dragon Trillen Hugh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory got a head down and tweaked and said: "Master, you see, I am too weak now, it really can't help you. You clean up the two idiot angels. At that time, I can only look at it and help you with weapons. If you continue this way, you are not in a hurry, and I am in a hurry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Idiot Angel?" *** The mouth is gently rising upwards. Her fingers were like orchids, and a blisters rose from her hands. There are two small figures in the blisters, and they are struggling to get out of the blisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fingertips gently stroked the blisters and smiled and said: "The two angels were originally the lowest-order nine-order angels. Obviously, on the advent After arriving in the world, they failed to conquer the new body, but they were conquered by the new body and became low-level slaves. Otherwise, how can I clean them up? Because they can retain most of the power, they think that This is a good opportunity. But Gregory, if a person does not have enough strength to seize the opportunity, the opportunity will often become a trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! You are so great! Too wise! Even the things in heaven know so clearly! How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did I know? "There is some confusion in the silver eyes. "I don't know. I naturally know this, as if these things have always been in my heart, but I have never thought of it before."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, what are you going to do? ? These two idiots reason angels in it, "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *** looked at two small blisters struggling and sighs loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, they are not idiots. In this world, their power is not weak, but they are far less powerful than they think they are. They think that they can solve all the troubles with their own strength, which is like an idiot. If they move their brains, the green dragon Trill Hught will definitely not be their opponent. Now these two angels should already Understand this truth? Unfortunately, they have no chance to regret it. In this world, the dissipation of souls is their best result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp *** 檀口 micro-张, a faint silvery scent blows out, blowing the blisters. The two little men fluttered in the air, fluttering, struggling, and eventually turned into helpless drops of water and fell into the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A turn around and see Gregorian staring at the dark green light group, the color of greed overflowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, do you really want the soul of the Green Dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The clever Gregory saw a small group of storms condensing in the eyebrows of the ***, and immediately closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, when you were born or a dragon, the power is stronger than I am now. Are you still clear about the memory at that time? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly remember. It feels so wonderful to have power! You can fly freely in the endless sky of the Devil, ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, do you think that you have more power than you are now, which one is happier?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...owner, I really can't tell. At that time, I thought about how to get more powerful power, get more power, and soak more devils. Now, as long as there is a master with you, you can't solve it. So there is no need for me to think about anything, that is, what is dangerous in the battle, and the master will reinvent the body afterwards. It seems that I am still happy now. But I still really want to have strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Sigh and know why, It seems to have been a very powerful time, but that time, I do not know what is happiness. Is that the memory of my previous life? Gregory, do you know? In fact, the more powerful, the more powerful you are, the more unhappy you will be. Moreover, a powerful force for an unprepared individual is likely to be devastating. Now, let me ask you, do you still want the power of the Green Dragon? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory seriously thought for a long time, raised his head and shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Master! I want strength! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, because I don't want to live humble! I am a noble dragon, not a dog! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** snorted, widened the silver eyes, and looked at the vain bone dragon that had always been active.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't think that Gregory had a proud heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, really didn't I thought that you still have such a proud heart. Your respect for me before seems to be fake. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory hurried and swayed his tail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! Absolutely not like this! For you, it is the same as the existence of the Most High God! Ah no, what is the highest god, you are truly supreme! My loyalty to you is simply not expressable! Although I am a noble dragon, but in front of you, I am a loyal dog! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Gregory, your loyalty, I naturally understand." Although I get only a small part of the green dragon's soul energy, it is still too strong for you, I am worried that you can't bear such powerful energy. After a while I absorbed the power of the two idiot angels, we went to take the black warrior's stone fort, the keel altar inside, since it may be a little useful for you. I hope that the altar is really made of keel, so that you can have a new body, and you can withstand the power of the green dragon soul. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is a little bit smirking, but since the owner said so, it must be justified. The owner has always been right.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, this power that comes out of nowhere is not really yours. In the future, you will have to rely on your own efforts to strengthen your strength. Remember? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon nodded quickly, and did not really think about the meaning of the words, its heart has been completely flooded with the green dragon energy that is about to be obtained. The bone dragon tides, it seems that it has restored the glory of the devil world, countless delicious food was sent to it in front of it, numerous, ethnic and ethnic devils surrounded by it, desperately exerting means to get it Happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the absent-minded, smirking bone dragon on the ground, *** is really helpless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Whoever has weaknesses?" "She thought helplessly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! *** The body immediately burned a blazing white sacred fire, the flame continued to spurt out of her body, and the dazzling white light illumined the entire hall! She has completely turned into a burning torch! Dozens of ghosts that could not be avoided were illuminated by light, turning into smoky smoke in the sharp shouts. Even Gregory had a few white smokes on his body, scared it to hurriedly put away his thoughts, hiding behind the throne, and shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The eyes are closed and quietly suspended in the air. The power of the two descending angels is too large and the body can not withstand such a powerful force! In the Holy Flame, her body armor, scales and bone spurs slowly retracted into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames of the flames are getting more and more prosperous, and there are already fire tongues at the top of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Starting to tremble, it seems to have endured the burning of the flames, his face full of painful look. Suddenly, she silently shouted, and the invisible shock wave immediately filled the entire hall. One ghost after another could not withstand the terrorist forces contained in the shock wave, and it exploded into a group of smoke. Every time a ghost is blown up, it will lead to some force of the flames, and the face of the *** will be soothed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the coming angels surged out. The ghosts in the hall have been turned into fly ash under the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The whistling sound is sharper and stronger, gradually overflowing the hall and extending throughout the tomb. In addition to the lowest-level ghosts responsible for vigilance, the tombs are where the undead creatures can enter and exit. It is only a zombie warrior who can enter here. However, these undead creatures are just like no flies, running around, avoiding the whistling sound of ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The eyes burst open and the entire hall was immediately coated with a layer of silver! Her wings stretched to the limit, and blood was sprayed from the wings. The whole tomb was shaken heavily, and all the undead creatures suddenly became more than a thousand pounds, and they were firmly nailed to the ground. It was very difficult to climb one step at a time. The tomb trembled under the influence of gravity, and countless stucco fragments fell from the zenith, and cracks began to appear on the walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silvery ripple is accompanied by the whistling sound of the ***. The ancient tomb is filled with these silver, like a living thing. As soon as they touch the undead, these ripples will be immediately wrapped tightly. A layer of flames will be shocked and repeated, and their prey will be layered into fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The whistle screamed, and one of the undead creatures smouldering under her whistle. After these men shared the pressure on her, the flames on her body became weaker and weaker, and only a thin layer of pale white flame was left. *** Finally, a long shout in the sky, the undead creatures in the ancient tomb fell in batches, and even the powerful zombie lords and black warriors exploded one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame bones are shrouded in a dark red flame, struggling with the whistling sound of the ***. Gregory has the advantage of the soul contract, and is much less affected by the howling, but its strength is much worse than the flame bones. The few bone spurs on Gregory's body have burst one by one, and the thick bones have begun to crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! Master! It is me! It is Gregory! Forgiveness!" Bone Dragon is desperate for mercy, but its mind wave is on the body. The flames came back and there was no way to penetrate them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon is completely desperate, and the earth is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Flame is back in the body of the ***, the natural armor appears on her, and then like a lotus flower, all the pages are Stretched out, there are many new nails generated, countless delicate, fine magic symbols appear on the nails, and there are a magical symbol flashing with various colors floating from the nails, around the *** Flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of silvery water droplets appeared in the air. The six-bone spear of the *** flew to the water droplets. Miraculously, the bone spear has been integrated into the tiny water droplets. Suddenly, the water droplets are like life, creeping, expanding, and rapidly becoming bigger. There will always be a holy flame coming out of the water droplets. It is like a living creature that grows desperately, but the length of life is really amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, this drop of silver water has grown. It has become a huge, three-meter-long death sickle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a crying number in the hall, and the souls of the undead creatures are rushing toward the ***, a layer of ink from the bottom up. The earth was soaked throughout her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The black armor suddenly spreads out, like the petals of the sky, blending into the darkness of the surrounding. Her body, like a statue of black glass, has a soft luster that flows slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly slammed the mouth and spit out a black and dark ink, and the body color faded like a tide, leaving only white A body that is dazzling and tender. A long, windless sky slowly descended and turned into a mirror-like black silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black mist floated over the scythe of death and completely dyed it black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as the big dream begins to wake up, *** opens his eyes, and the silver light that dazzles blindly flashes past, like there is a lightning The hall is lit. Her silver eyes were confused, slowly looking around, and raised her hands. In front of her eyes was a pair of petite palms like spring and green, and ten small whirlpools dotted around the base of the palm of the hand. The nails are white with pink, and they look at them, and they flash with seven colors of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master...Master..." A weak wave of thought passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Left hand forward to the void, Gregory was pulled up by an invisible force, automatically flew to the *** seems to be blowing Broken little hand. There was a trace of doubt in her silver eyes. Looking at the ragged bones and the cracked bone dragon on the bones, it seemed familiar, but I couldn’t remember what the skeleton was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master....Master! It's me....Gregory..." The bones of the dragon are as weak as the candle in the wind, always May go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are... Gurley...Gori?"*** is very hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! It’s me, you think of it? Master, can your hand be light, the flame in your hand can burn me directly? The soul! Master! The little is dying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The little hand is loose, and the bone dragon slams into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Two thin curved eyebrows wrinkled together and murmured: "You are Gregory... So, who am I?" Well, I am ***......***? How did the name come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master...Save me..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Looking down at the bone dragon. Gregory's hind legs and tails have disappeared, and even the most sturdy skull has several huge cracks, and the other bones are even more ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small blisters floated out of the hands of the *** and landed on the head of the bone dragon. The faint water light quickly spread to Gregory's body, and the large cracks on the bones slowly gathered, and the small cracks healed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am ***, I remembered." The voice of *** became cold. "Gregory, my men? Are you left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, it seems that the flames are still alive. Others, You are .... are all you..." Gregory did not know how to word it. Can you say that you have been taken to be a ghost? With the owner's unpredictable temper, maybe he will dismantle his own bones to show punishment. Gregory can now have few bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Nodded, the silver awns in her eyes flickered, and the entire tomb was scanned in an instant. The tomb is now truly dead, and there is no soul reaction any more than the soul energy that the two groups are weak at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The tenderness of the spring shoots to the side of a stone wall, a white halo flashed in front of her fingertips, the stone wall immediately silent He slammed down without a break, revealing the dying flames of the wall. It fell to the ground, and only half of the body still existed. The huge warhammer is full of rust and gaps, just as it has been through thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only you two?... It doesn't matter, wait for us to clean up the black warriors and grab the keel altar, you will all have new bodies." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***When Wen’s little face is full of no expression, her white body looks so dazzling in the dark and gray hall. In the eyes of Gregory, the master has never been so soft as before, it seems that it can bite into two in one bite; but *** has never been so terrible, the bone dragon is now trembled, the atmosphere is not dare, but not Say the classic "too great! Too wise!" Two straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Both hands danced in the air, bringing a band of gray light. The light belts fluttered and entwined with each other, covering her body. In a twinkling of an eye, she had a gray robes on her body, and a headless woman with her wings on her chest. This robes also covered the wings of the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory This is a bit strange. What it just saw, the wings of the *** seem to be somewhat different. What is the difference? The bone dragon thought hard. It suddenly understood what was different. The wings of the *** are not the common bones of the undead, nor the wings that shine with metallic luster in the past. Now, that is a pair of wings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White wings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory wants to confirm again, but the gray robe has covered the wings. After wearing the gray robes, *** can't see that there have been wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Looking down, I am very satisfied. She had a pair of white clasped hands in the chest sleeves, and did not point to the ground, drifting out of the hall. The bone dragon and the flame bone demon who recovered a little bit quickly climbed up and followed the owner to find the black warriors' suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and Androni turned over the last mountain and came to an empty valley. The green grass in the valley, but the most attractive, but that is a tall tree nearly 100 meters high, growing proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flipped through the parchment and looked like an old tree. The place we were looking for should be here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and the whole person was immersed in the spiritual world. All the scenery around him dimmed and gradually became dark. A glimmer of light hits Rogge's spiritual world. Then, one after another, the light illuminates, forming a huge magical symbol of light. Finally, a huge magical array of ten kilometers is present. In the spiritual world of Rogge!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can only be described as miraculous!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Array Rotating slowly, Rogge in the center of the squad only felt that he was extremely small. In front of this miracle, his heart was always full of fear when he despised the gods. The miracle of Lille in the day was far more than this magic. The array was more ambitious, more direct, and more powerful. However, Rogge was mixed in the crowd, but at the moment he was alone in the miracle!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is an empty space, no one cares, no fear of the gods!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Grid, how do you? Is this the place we are looking for? "Androni's extremely sweet voice pulled Rogge out of the spiritual world in a timely manner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is already sweating, he just likes to just It was a great war, from the heart to the spirit, it was extremely exhausted, and even the mental power was wilting. He looked up and his voice was hoared a lot: "Yes, it is here." I am going to take a break now. When the words were not finished, he fell to the ground and the personnel did not know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Rogge shouted: "Green Dragon!" Androni, you are going to escape, let me come! He sat up in a hurry, and he was lying under the huge old tree in the valley, and he was still wearing the coat of Androni. At the moment she was sitting next to Rogge, and her eyes were a little different.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, that day...the battle of the Dragon Cave that day, I always have a lot of places to understand, especially after I got the Dragon Magic, how did you come to the Dragon Cave? ? How to kill the green dragon? How is the poison of the green dragon? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge looked at Androni with a deep look, and both remembered what happened to Andreoni’s coma that day. I thought of it in Ander. Rooney was unscrupulous for hours, and Rog couldn’t help but feel turbulent. Androni had a white face and tried to suppress vomiting. She immediately decided not to ask Rogge in the Dragon Cave that day. The birth of things, anyway, there are indications that Rogge saved her life, and the precious tears of angels have swallowed up in their own stomachs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And, from the fate's nightmare, he saved himself on the same day. Recalling Rogge's struggle in the dragon's breath, Androni suddenly had some sadness. Why is a selfish, sinister villain? The tears of the angel of life are fed to myself? As for the fat man who miraculously recovers from the poison of the dragon, it may be attributed to the good man who is not long-lived, and the worst fortune.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge barely supported standing up. He did not dare to delay the inspection of the surrounding terrain with Andre. God knows when the real God will come, and must rush to arrange everything before God makes it. Although the information from the two unlucky angels has been seen, it takes a dozen days for the gods to arrive here, but anything in the world is likely to be born, or it is well prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can’t kill you, give me ten days, it’s enough for me to fool a lot from the elf. What’s more, it gave me so much time. Activities in the Elves, maybe you can turn this true God into a false god by the time. Use the elf's knife to kill the elf's god, hehe." Rogge thought overcast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This check is two days. In the spirit world of Rogge, there are ancient trees, shrubs, boulders, and even mud. Obviously, this is a piece of natural terrain. This huge magical array does not know how to engrave it on this vast land. And the elf old tree that has been growing for thousands of years is the hub of this magical array. Rogge couldn't help but sigh the magic of this magnificent magical array. After thousands of years, the ancient tree of the elves has grown completely. It has accumulated enough magic power in the millennium. Until the last year, this magical array is likely to be start up. This method of controlling the start time of the magic array, let Rogge admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the horn of the genie is just the beginning, and there is a series of arrangements and arrangements. He and Androni repeatedly discussed the details and feasibility of all actions, and this discussion opened up Androni's vision. Although she was born in the giants, and the giants have always been the base camp of conspiracy. However, since she was young, she has followed her personality and has been following Pross for more than ten years. In addition to her heart and soul, she is still quite a simple woman. The series of poisons that Rogge had set for her thoughts made her feel a little shuddering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In private, Androni has also doubted more than once, with Rogge’s hazy personality, why would he be a life-saving angel in the Dragon Cave? Tears are fed to myself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Androni is not a good man or a woman. She wants to see how much Rogge has the talent, to bear the burden of humiliation and let go of the opportunity to kill him. In exchange for forcing him to work for the family, is it worth it? Therefore, Rogge is all planning, she is all listening to and acting from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the early morning of the third day, Rogge arranged everything. After the arrangement was stopped, he finally took out the horn of the elf, holding it in both hands, slowly lifting the spirit, and the horn of the white jade began to glow with soft white light. He turned his head and gestured to Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni began to emit blue flames, starry and vindictive operation is close to the peak. She came sideways and leaned down slightly to blow the horn of the elf, but now Rogge kept recycling the horn of the elf, waiting for her little mouth to pluck the horn of the elf, almost covering her face with Roger's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn of the elf is only able to sing with a powerful special temper. Rogge is a magician and does not have any vindictiveness. However, his psychic skill is so skillful that after scanning the horn of the elf, he has mastered the special pulsation of how to make it play, and uses his mental power to change it so that he can adapt to Androni's starry spirit. And Androni is very powerful and plays the horn without any difficulty. Originally, the horn of the elf has some taste of artifacts. Except for the gods, it is impossible for the average person to play it. Only Rogge has a low magical power, but his spiritual power is extremely large. He also glimpsed the way the world's natural forces operate. It is not difficult to grasp the special pulse of the horn. But I am afraid that there are not many people in the world who can do this. Even if they are the top ten magisters, the magic power is strong. When it comes to the use of mental power, there are several that are not as good as Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger sniffs the faint aroma of Androni, watching her skin like ice, feeling a few chestnuts sweeping across the cheeks, in my heart D. It is also sneaked into the inside of her tall neckline to see the beauty of the peaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge! Can't you lift the horn out?" Androni was very dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge! How did the horn retract? "Androni is so cold as ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue! Where are you looking?" It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge screams, the three or four stars deflated, and sneaked into the thick, thick arms of his arms, **, thighs, etc. Even if his skin is thick and thick, he can't resist the sinister starry air. For a time, the sallow and swollen, all kinds of feelings, tortured his tears to come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two finally matched the horn of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole valley is like a behemoth that has been sleeping for a thousand years, woke up at this moment. The boulder, the ancient wood, the flowers and plants are gently shaken, the elves and old trees slowly glow green, and the invisible waves are transmitted to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni and Rogge are standing on the back of the behemoth and looking at it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave spread throughout the Central Mountain Range, which aroused the tranquility of more than a dozen forests and also alerted many mysterious existences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Lille, in the prayer hall of St. James's Cathedral, the Pope was sitting on the throne and was sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Augustus is an adult!" The waiter outside the hall sings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the attendance of the advisor, Augustus, who is in a bloody red cloak, has come in. As the head of the Holy Knights, he is the only one who has the right to go directly to the pope's prayer hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s prayer hall is always dark and full of years, or filled with the taste of an old man. Any cathedral, as long as the pope lives in, will be filled with this taste. Whenever Augustus walks into the Pope's prayer hall, the taste of this time will make him extremely uncomfortable. Perhaps what really makes him uncomfortable is the pope. As long as he closes his eyes, Augustus can't completely feel the existence of the pope. It seems that what exists in front of him is just a void. But the power has reached the realm of Augustus and has been able to feel the true power of the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the Pope is a vain existence, vast and boundless. Even the people who touched the edge of the gods, such as Augustus, can only sense a rough range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at the sleepy pope, Augustus smiled a bit. His true strength has reached the 20th level, enough to disdain the so-called Juggernaut or the Paladins on the Big 6. However, Orphey Roker is more powerful than him. He chose the fallen golden lion to stand on the peak of this world power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Pope, this seemingly weak old man, knocked down Orfey Roque so easily. The contest between the same level, the warrior is not the opponent of the magician. The later, the more obvious this gap is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, the Supreme God is a favorite of the magician. Augustus thought involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, you are so rushed to call me, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Agus is an adult, how is your body recovering?" The Pope is always the candle in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you Lord, I have recovered 80% of my ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is good This is good! Augustus is an adult, just now, someone played the elf horn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus was shocked, "Kara Yang and Ke Didn't Lisma die before he found the gods? Is it that God made himself find the horn of the elf? It's too clever. It's not right from time to time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope smiles that it is not a god. Kara Yang was still a month away from the meeting with the gods when they died. It is now, there are still twenty days before the gods should meet with the gods. The horn of the elf must be another person, maybe it is the pagan Rogge who is chased by Kara Yang and Chris. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge? He shouldn't have the ability to blow the horn of the elf, and even you and me can't play it. I can't imagine anyone in the world who can blow the horn. It is a pity that Kara Yang and so many of them did not have a living back. I don’t know if Rogge was killed. The spirit of the boy is unusually powerful, a magical genius, and a haze. Since he refuses to return to us, it can be a little troublesome to become a climate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope said: "I feel that Rogge is still not dead, and that the elf horn is likely to be related to him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, I am incompetent, this thing is not done well." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
