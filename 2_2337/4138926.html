She blinked a little, and for a time her eyes were full of shining magical light, and nothing could be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly made a force on her waist and suddenly bounced, but her shoulders came with a soft force, and she took her in the air for more than ten laps, then heavier The ground fell to the ground, and Sue fell so dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su did not dare to move freely, opened his eyes and carefully observed the surroundings. She suddenly felt that her body was full of chills, looked down and found that she was completely red! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I see your chest is quite big! Why do you want to be so tight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Su looked up and saw Androni sitting very mad, looking at her with interest. Compared with Androni's unscrupulous, upstream and downstream gaze, Su is even more afraid of the strength of her sanctuary, so Su slowly sits up and dare not have any action that will cause suspicion. Just facing Androni's question, she didn't know how to answer. Su looked at Androni’s eyes and suddenly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su stood up. She was a long-lasting person. After removing all obstacles, the most striking thing was two long, elastic and elastic, almost two-thirds of the height of her whole body. Her skin is delicate and compact, shining under the moon, like a beautiful female leopard full of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You won't kill me?" Su asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled, and her smile made Su’s eyes shine: “Not for the time being, but if you’re going to be like this next time, I can't guarantee that others will kill you. After all, there are many people on our side who are not afraid of your father who is the prime minister of the empire. Nor are you afraid of your teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Su smiled and said: "Since I don't kill me, can I leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled very embarrassedly "You are called Su? Well, you are still good, and you are very good. You think, can you go so easily?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Su gathered a hair. Also laughed. She smiled and went to the cold and murderous. It became a charming woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know what you want and know what you want to do." Su smiled and went to Androni: "But I don't mind." I have had a lot of men and a lot of women. I am afraid that you will mind it! Seriously, I never thought that one day I would go to bed with someone like you. I can treat you as a man. You can also treat you as a woman! Heaven. How wonderful it should be! Can you tell me your name..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni Hey, then the handsome face of the unbelievable face was aversion. Although she likes beautiful girls, she is very clean and has no interest in women like Su. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su still wants to continue, and the result is interrupted by the clothes and long knife thrown on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you let me go like this?" Su lightly bite his lip, his eyes waved like water, and he looked at Androni very resentfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll! Don't leave me to kill you!" Androni was murderous and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su gently sighed. Wearing clothes in silence, and looking back with a sorrowful look, this bite his teeth and disappear into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni only felt that his chest seemed to block something, and he was very depressed. She recalled the situation just now and was suddenly shocked. Then I woke up and angered: "Be fooled! Su, you are amazing, don't fall into my hands next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far apart At the office, Froya was busy at the big experiment table. Her eyes suddenly reached a gleaming thing on the corner of the table. I picked it up and saw it, it was the blue ice that sealed the rose. Under the magical light, the rose in the ice is as beautiful as her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the goblin's current mind is not on this. She throws it away, and the frozen rose draws a beautiful arc and falls into the trash can in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side of the Imperial City, Miro’s identical frozen rose burst into tears. His face was dark, then he laughed again and said: "There is a taste! I like it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The samurai who is inseparable from him is helpless: "Miro "The big thing is heavy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro said: "That is, of course, how can I forget my big things?" He said so, eyes Still staring at the frozen rose in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior had to sigh and said: "Miro, you are advocating, want to use Adelaide to exchange the woman, in case she knows I am afraid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro smiled and said: "This is my own way. Just say that Rogge is the person that Princess Elyssey looks at, no.愁 Aide Renee, she is not hooked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the room of Xius, the gnome holding a short sword is sweating and practicing swordsmanship. With his height and matching this short sword like a dagger, the sword skills he practiced were originally bright and straight, and they must be sinister and sinister. What's more, the underground gnomes practiced the sword skills at the moment, and then cooperated with the physique that he fluttered and swiftly moved, flickered, and the paralyzed medicinal medicinal smear on the dagger. Now Gregory It is already a very difficult role to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The martial arts of the underground gnomes have not yet taken shape. Xiusi carefully observed its movements at the side, and dialed from time to time. With more than four hundred years of killer experience, the things that Xius taught the underground gnomes are simple, practical, vicious and insidious. In addition, in front of a ground gnome who can speak the dragon language and can make Longwei, even if it is a vulgar warrior, it is difficult to escape its calculations under the general idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s stiletto sword tip occasionally floats a few stars, and the chilly atmosphere is weak. But it can also tell that it belongs to the starry spirit. It is a pity that the talent of the gnome is too poor, and the entry into the temper is extremely slow. This makes Gregory, who has become accustomed to let the two masters transform their bodies and gain strength without any effort, is very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it doesn’t care, the ambition of the gnome, the heart of the gnome has long been restless, especially after seeing the owner of the master of Vera Everything is even more so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not willing to be an ordinary voyeur, it has to be a behind-the-scenes hand to push history! Of course. As for the direction of history, Gregory has not considered so much. For the long-serving Gregory. It needs land, but it leaves its paw prints on the books of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the form of the underground gnome is very insecure. Although it has the superior ability of hiding and stealth, at this moment, the emperor of Richelieu is exactly the time when the wind and the clouds meet. The strong ones are like ants. They are all ghosts and go around. Maybe one who is sensitive will find the whereabouts of the underground gnomes. A ground gnome. From the darkness to the result of the light, nature is to be slaughtered. This is not the end of Gregory's favorite, but also to work hard for safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when the power gap is too big, all the skills become meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory looked at a pale chill, appeared to it, turned into ice and sealed it, but it was Can't escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon waved, and the ice of the gnome was sealed out of the window and flew into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feng Yue adults, ah no. The great goddess of the wind, you are not in the floating city to accept the worship of believers, how come suddenly to my simple place? "Hughes asked reverently. On the surface, no one can pick out the place where the old fox has any disrespect. The pie on his face is almost devout, and it will almost emit the light of faith. of course. No one knows what he really thinks in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon stand quietly in the room, the candle has just melted a thin circle, and the temperature has been rapidly reduced. The bright and warm fireplace flames have become dull, the flames have shrunk a lot, and they are violently pulsating in the cold, seemingly likely to go out at any time. All the glass or ceramic utensils in the room were quietly covered with a layer of frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of the wind and the moon. The devout smile of Hughes slowly solidified. It finally became awkward. He coughed and straightened his body. The face is solemn and authentic: "Feng Yue adults, you come to me specifically, I think there is something!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Shusi, I have been receiving some... ... emotional trouble, but I don't know what it is. In addition, I found that I am forgetting these... mood." Every word of Fengyue seems to add a little chill to this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Hughes gradually became dignified. He pondered for a long time, and slowly said: "Feng Yue, I have lived for four hundred years, not too short. But after all, the field of God is too far away from me. I may not be able to help you. All I can do now is to infer some things about the realms of the gods based on some of the legacy of the elves of the elves. Among them, the most powerful elves of the Elven Empire have had the power to be comparable to God. Perhaps they have seen a new world since then, and these great elves have gradually lost their emotions. Just immersed in your own field, no longer have the care of the elf empire. But they are different from you, they are not gods after all, they will gradually age and die. Fengyue adults, I think you are now with them. At the same stage, because your eyes look too far away, everything in the dust will gradually become insignificant, so your feelings for all of this will be indifferent. This is what I asked you later. Guess. But what are the moods that bother you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a confusion in the wind and moon, she slowly said: "I don't know But I don't want to forget."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't want to forget a certain mood, then follow its guidelines and don't worry any more. Only then, this The mood will last as long as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... does this affect strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Should not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy month nodded slightly and the figure gradually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just left. Wella appeared in front of Hughes, the pair of golden cross stars are getting brighter and brighter, and finally the sharp torch is like a burning torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have not reached an agreement, I will help you deal with Fengyue adults, will you not use insights for me? We have already done what we have done, now Only waiting for the results." Xiusi smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's eyes are a little bit unwilling to darken. She looked at the direction of the wind and the moon, saying: "You can rest assured. It will definitely be effective. At least most of the books say so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Xius was speechless, but only smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is unaware that he has become the target of many people with ulterior motives. His whole mind was on a magic scroll. This magic scroll is so amazing that Rogge can only lay it on the ground to study. The already-expanded part is covered with dense magical symbols, and various magical powers are subtly maintained in a weak balance, forming a whirlpool, and the center of the vortex is a vacuum of magic. This is the elf matrix that Rogge exchanged from the hands of Xius, and the magic vacuum zone in the center of the circle is used to isolate and store the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought for a long time. I finally picked up a pen, licked a bit of fresh green ink, and carefully changed one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fighting a green smoke, Rogge quickly got up and stepped back. The smoke dissipated and the magic scroll was turned into a ash fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head, he was not discouraged, and pulled out an identical scroll and unfolded. Study it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Failed again?" I don't know when, Wella appeared next to Roger, and looked at the magic scroll in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah! There are still a few places that don't understand. But once I succeed, this magic array can store the magic of any attribute, not just the sacred The power of the property. At that time, I will let my opponents be shocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is a little tired. Reached for the forehead. He looked up at Wella and suddenly added with a smile: "It also includes you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s gaze has turned back to the magic scroll, and he is absent-minded: “Now it’s just that you will be hit back by you. I’m better off trying to improve my strength. When I’m sure I’ll fight you, it’s not too late... It is here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has three cyan threads of pure magical energy on his left finger tip that stretches out onto the magic scroll. The three wires are slightly dithered. Several magic symbols on the reel slowly change color. Turn from dark red to orange. They suddenly squirted a small bright yellow hot magic flame and then melted into several new magic symbols. Re-condense on the magic scroll. The process seemed to be simple, and Rogge almost didn't move too much with his fingers, but it seemed very hard to see him breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at the magic scroll and said: "These magical flames are very unstable. You should add a little sacred power in their center to form Solid structure. Otherwise, if you have a slight shock, your scroll will be destroyed again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge doesn’t return, after a moment of contemplation, he finally starts to gather. Magic, in the blink of an eye, the magical energy of various attributes has gathered around him to form a colorful light rain. Just look at this type of frame, I am afraid that the fat man is not so dignified when he tries to kill the eighth-order magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic scroll became hot, and the high-altitude yellow flame that spurted out seemed to be attracted by the sacred glory of the center, and finally condensed back before burning the reel . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge breathed a sigh of relief, and it was already sweating unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of Rog’s eyes, a hand like an ice-like jade suddenly appeared on the magic scroll, and the cold voice said: "There is still a need Add some ice magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the adjustment was unexpectedly easy, until Rogge added several new magic symbols to the magic array, the entire scroll suddenly There is a dazzling array of magical flames. The flame rose slowly and finally dissipated in the room. On the reel, a brand new, extremely complex magical array quietly appeared in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the true face of the Elf Array that supports the magical civilization of the entire Elven Empire before the Millennium War!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was so excited that his hands were shaking. He stroked the elf matrix in front of him and probed the structure of the array with his mental strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This elf is still flawless, not perfect. But it can accommodate a huge amount of magic, and is no longer limited to divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the real elf matrix? No wonder the Elf Empire had so many great wizards before the millennium! Haha, with this, let alone You fight, even if it is a goddess, it is no longer possible to knock down! Hahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and turned, his eyes immediately rounded . The laughter came to an abrupt end!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina traces nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one standing behind him turned out to be O'Reilly who had just said that he would be defeated!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Look at the goddess who stands like an iceberg. Rogge involuntarily took a big step back, and his eyes turned into silver, and a strip of magical light band spread around. Rogge has condensed all his strength, waiting to resist the punishment that is enough to cause the tsunami to landslide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your courage is really big." The sound of Fengyue was cold, but Rogge heard a warmth: "If you think you can knock down In my words, I can come to the floating city to find me at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the shadow of Fengyue disappeared for a long time, Rogge recovered from the loss. He carefully put away the scrolls that were painted with the Elf. Hurry to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the third magical candle was burned out, Froya finally redraws the Elf Flip on a blank magic scroll. After she had painted it twice in the snow, she had completely engraved the complex elf matrix in her heart. She and Rogge checked again and confirmed that they had completely recorded the Elf Array. Rogge picked up the scrolls with the Elf Array and burned them with the Black Flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" The fat man's gaze suddenly fell on the trash can in the corner of the room. He is now keenly aware and finds a faint but very strange magical atmosphere. Rogge reached out and grabbed the ice rose in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
