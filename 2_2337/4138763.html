			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of Yinlong’s battle were surprisingly fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkest of the month, the most melee hundred melee warriors have killed more than 80, and the elf magician and elf magic apprentices have also damaged more than half. If it wasn't for Fu Luoya who had used the Lost Paradise to transfer some of the magicians in time, waiting for the Elf Master to end the battle, only the entire army was wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has been unconscious, and the butterfly has been seriously injured. In contrast, the elders of Xiusi were hit by the silver dragon's dragon, and they were still able to walk down the ground. If Rogge woke up to see this scene, I don’t know what to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Froya and Androni are lucky enough to be harmless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this war, the horror of Silver Dragon Kryss Ferrena was deeply rooted in the heart of every survivor. If it wasn’t for Hughes’s successful exploration of the terrain of the dragon, Rogge would use the silver dragon to kill the weak points of the dragon egg and use a lot of shameless tactics to summon the earth elements for the wheel battle. The result of this campaign must be the whole of the dragon slaughter. Slaughter. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first time Rogge has tried to treat the free magicians as a special unit to unify the command and concentrate on the command, and received amazing results. If this is not the most efficient method of warfare, the degree of summoning of the earth elements by these magicians will never catch up with the degree of silver dragons destroying earth elements. At that time, the Dragon Slayer’s end was only a way to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought that with the help of Froya and Androni, he could already fight with Silver Dragon, but he still underestimated the silver dragon. Terror ability. Cris Ferrena just gave birth to the dragon egg, and she was in a period of extreme weakness. Her degree of slaying the earth element was just slightly weaker than that of the elf magician. If she was in full strength, this battle I don't have to fight at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s other mistake is to assume that Silver Dragon will kill the Dragon Egg from start to finish. He never thought of desperate Cristian Ferrena In the end, I will throw away the dragon egg, and directly rush into the intruder's brigade to fight for life! When the angry silver dragons charged, under her huge body shape, what kind of elite soldiers or summoned beasts were so fragile that they could not stop Chris Ferrena from ignoring all the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong’s last dying struggle almost destroyed all the invaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Rogge in the coma still does not know, there is a deeper crisis waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the precious original dew, Rogge’s injury did not deteriorate, but it could not be better. Fu Luoya herself is a master of pharmacy. She has a large amount of blood of Yinlong to make raw materials for her. She soon prepared a few doses of 'blood dragon', which is a very strong healing agent. Ordinary people have been seriously injured. As soon as a dose of 'blood dragon' goes down, they will heal immediately, but Rogge drank a dose, and the injury was a little better. Froya sighed and gave these precious medicines to Rogge like sugar and water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took care of Jin’s healing potion and finally woke up two days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man opened his eyes and saw that he was next to him, and he couldn’t help but be a little surprised: "Froya? How could it be you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria immediately became furious: "Dead fat! Not who I am, who do you want to see your wife?" Droni is still your little fairy, hurt? In this way, I still want to steal it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog couldn’t help but laugh, he wants to sit up, But now the body is completely numb from the chest. His face immediately sagged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat! Don't worry so much, you are lucky, there is such a master of pharmacy, there are so many silver dragon blood, silver dragon bone marrow or something, Your life can't be lost. You see, I have a lot of benefits? Now your body is anesthetized with my medicine, lest you wake up and smash the wound."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sorted out the thoughts and asked: "Is there a wound in Androni? Is the silver dragon recycled? How many people are we left?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's face was cold, and he said: "It turns out that you still think about Androni, oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"She hasn't hurt a cold hair, but your little fairy is very hurt. It is very likely that the martial arts will be greatly discounted in the future. Only twelve of your elf warriors are alive and come back. The elf mage is half preserved. Yinlong is now in the lost paradise, and it has been brought back. You can feel good about it, and all the plans are now implemented well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge A smile, thank you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To marry you, you are reluctant, thank you for what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Paradise lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya snorted and asked why he was hurt. I don't know who it is, what hurts you with anything, it's terrible! Having said that, Froya’s face was a little pale, apparently recalling the sudden and unstoppable blow of the day’s ***.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed his eyes. After a moment, he slowly opened his eyes, and the silver light in his eyes flickered and flickered, just like a weak candle in a strong wind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, he scanned his body, and the silver awns in his eyes slowly smashed. Rogge reluctantly smiled and didn’t want to kill me. She wants to kill only the silver dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya looked at Rogge’s eyes in confusion: "How are you so sure? You know that it hurts you. Who?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just guess...” A huge pain suddenly came from the wound, and Rogge yelled and fainted on the spot.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya immediately panicked and opened the quilt of Rogge. Rogge’s wound was still a blackened corner, but the blackness was cracked and the blood could not escape. Froya took out a silver bottle and poured out a few drops of silver with a purple liquid. These drops of liquid touched the skin of Rogge's black skin, and immediately screamed out loud and numerous. The foam, the cracked wound is firmly sealed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opens, I heard Roger’s screaming Androni and Hughes The elders rushed in. They saw that Rogge’s injury did not deteriorate too much, and that he was relieved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Roger’s horrible wounds, Froya also Some panic: "Elder Sister, even the most healing effect of the silver dragon spinal cord can only make his wounds temporarily not deteriorate, what should I do? This is not always the way to go, Yinlong that point of the spinal cord will always be useful. By then I have nothing to control his injury. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes carefully examined the wounds of Rogge and said: "His injury is really troublesome!" God makes the adult's physique a little special. Silver dragon blood, bone marrow, and anything are very effective for ordinary people, but the effect on him is limited. His people are very harmful. Now even my old man has no good way. . However, these silver dragon blood and bone marrow can not be said to be useless, they at least control the exhibition of injuries. I remember that the Elf has borrowed a way to use the sacred attribute of the vindictive energy to treat the injury. Although the effect is very slow, there is always no mistake. Although the divine energy is not very good for God to make the body of the adult, but it is better than nothing. As long as it can eliminate the erosion of the flame power in his body, he will slowly get better. It’s just that Androni’s child’s vindictiveness is good, and there are sacred attributes, and our luck is not too bad. Time is tight, my old man is going to check it out, hehe. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Xiusi limped out, leaving only Androni and Froya in the room.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly quieted down, except for Rogge's heavy, fast and slow breathing, no other sounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sky outside the window is gradually darkening, and slowly the whole room is stuck in the darkness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria, why do you care about him so much! "Androni's cold voice with a hint of anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, Anne Baby, are you jealous?" You want to marry him too, you see, I have forgotten that you have been discussing the issue of marriage contract! But now, this husband is robbed! "Floria's voice is as soft and charming as usual, but listen carefully, but faintly carries a flame.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria, you Good point is good! I know that you are blaming me, but you can't make yourself so bad! "Androni's hand holding the starry sky is so hard, even with a long sword, it trembles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sat down and held her head in her hands, almost pleading: "Froya, don't you do this? You know that I saw you and Rogge together that day, how painful my heart is!" We are all the same people, how can I not know what you felt at that time? After you grabbed you back, what did you look like? Go back, okay? Don't be arrogant again! I beg you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sighed faintly. "Annie Baby, I have seen her, I know that you are no longer able to come back. Then I What is the use of a person coming back? As for me and Rogge, you don't have to worry, there is nothing you can't overcome. I just have to try several times with him, I think I can bear it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is trying to persuade, suddenly felt something, turned to stare at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** of a gray robe is like a ghost, floating in without a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***!..." Androni exclaimed with a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria also stood up and stared at the cockroaches, and all of them were shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***If the smoke-like eyebrows are slightly wrinkled, faintly said: "Who do you want to resist?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria and Androni looked at each other and shook their heads. In the face of the *** that has entered the sanctuary, the resistance is indeed useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the two women have different moods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s eyes are burning with an unwilling and helpless flame, and Androni’s deep blue eyes are like a pair of deep waves Tan, looking at the *** just watching it. She knows that this will only hurt the heart of Fu Luoya, but God knows when the mysterious *** will reappear. It is good to see more at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** blew into the sleepy Rogge, opened his quilt and looked at his wound quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An invisible pressure suddenly emerged from the body, and Androni and Froya felt as if they were suddenly facing a hidden body. Like the infinitely dangerous sea, it is a little shake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***It’s cold and cold: “Go all over!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second woman has no choice but to Turn around. They all feel faintly, if they don't, *** will immediately kill them. Androni had given up all resistance in front of the ***. Fu Luoya is also a smart woman who is snow and ice, even if she wants to pounce on her back and fight hard, this loss is not willing to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A raging holy force suddenly appeared in the room, and the dazzling light was so strong that even Androni and Froya were back Yes, but the eyes are all white, and nothing can be seen at one time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Light flashed twice in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***It seems to sigh...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flashed, the man has arrived at the door . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***!" Androni could no longer control himself, suddenly turned around and shouted at the back of the ***: "I will How do you find you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The back of the *** seems to be shocking, and then it doesn’t stop flashing, it seems to be a little wolverine, and it disappears in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at the door in a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Androni..." Froya screamed softly. "I have figured it out, I give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria stood in front of Androni, looked at her affectionately, and finally kissed her lips gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dronie screamed, her lips had been bitten by Froya! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** I froze for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in the air and slowly turned around, a pair of silver eyes without expression, calmly watching Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Hughes fell on the sleek, right hand of the ***, and the eyelids jumped. He coughed two light people, don't be so unsettled! I am not malicious. Moreover, I am so old, and now it is a wound, how can you survive the toss of the Sanctuary! My old man calls you, I want to give you something. In fact, did you just want to find my old man? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The silver awn in the eyes suddenly lights up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hius from the arms Pulling out a beautiful line of deep black nails, this is the petal that pierced Rogge and Silver Dragon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people just don't care for things ! This look will be a good thing, it is hard to get it, so I am willing to throw it! Ha ha. "Speaking, Hughes raised his hand, and the sorcerer slowly flew to the ***.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he is not too close to ** *.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***There was a pick-up of the demon, and it was thrown into the void.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hughes coughed twice: "Young people are unsettled!" How can I fight with my old man to kill the silver dragon? Is it fun to face the revenge of the 'silver miracle' Nicholas? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Silence for a moment, finally opened: "Nicholas may not be able to catch up with me. Why do you dare to face it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled: "My old man is a killer and has lived in the Central Mountain for more than four hundred years." As a last resort, my old man can't stand alone in the deep forest, and will not be tired of my elf children. That Nicholas is huge, but to say that it is better than the drill hole, is my old man still afraid of it? It is even more powerful, and can't flatten the Central Mountain Range? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Cold and authentic: "But now Rogge killed Kris Felena!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed and didn't speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The cold sound improved Some: "You know the dragon language. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes nodded and looked sad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he doesn't understand the dragon language . He is afraid that the elf will die too much and will do it himself. "The voice of *** is still calm, but there is already a little bit of light on the right finger tip that starts to flash.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rogge is a good boy. I didn't think it would be like this. You should know that your attack is a step slower than me. If Rogge didn't do it, Nicholas should put the account on my head. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Surprisingly, she knows the truth. But the light on her fingertips is getting brighter and brighter.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled a bit and the old man was not omnipotent! If I had this ability, would I still have to hide in the Central Mountain Range for four hundred years? Now that the matter is here, we both Only by joining hands can it stop Nicholas. What is the use of your old bones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The flash of the fingertips flashes A few times, I finally dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her silver eyes flickered and finally said: "He is not a tool for the elves. Now it is not, not in the future!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Silver eyes suddenly reveal a few golden lights, her hand designation of Xius, the sound is cold like a cold ice: "I can't help you." But you may not stop me! If he has anything, I will kill all the elves of the 'Green Sea'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiles! When did the old man do bad things, he was unsettled! Such a big temper can be a good thing for you! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***No longer pays attention to Hughes, and turns to prepare to enter the void.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
