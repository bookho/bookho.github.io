			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Charlie and the Spartan Cavaliers, within a few days, Rogge received the news of the attack of Wisdom. However, this time is good news, although the loss of the eyes of the eyes of wisdom is not small, but they are not only the enemy to fight, but also captured a Druid elder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately sent the most urgent message to Mora, let her send the Druid elder to herself as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Rogge happy is not only that Androni’s cultivation has been completed, re-emergence, but also O'Brien's coming at a crucial moment. This is like letting the troubled Rogge see the hope again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the mysterious and eccentric O'Reilly couldn't count on it, Androni would always help more or less? More than one strong sanctuary helped, and some impossible things in the past immediately turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, Roger’s strong people gathered, even to the point of surprise. *** and the strength of the death class need not be said, Xiusi has never let people see the details. Now there is another Androni, and Rogge can almost say that there are four Sanctuary strongmen. The fat man is calculating, if you count O'Brien in, then at least five Sanctuary strong, even six. It’s a pity that none of these people put Rogge in their eyes. . For example, the Death Class, he would have been ignorant of Rogge. If it weren’t for Ai Luolu’s wishes, he would not pay attention to the fate’s life and death. The understanding of the mission of the Death Class is that as long as Silver Dragon Nicholas is not allowed to kill Rogge, he will be diligent. So don't say that he won't help Rogge deal with Druid, even if Druid wants to kill the fat, he will probably stand by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***And regardless of the old fox, the fat man is also self-confident. To put it bluntly, only Androni, who is entangled with him, is the most obedient one. However, this singularly acclaimed Missy is also saying that she will come and say that she will leave. I will not pay attention to when Rogge will need her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make these people's direction consistent with themselves, the fat man really spent a lot of brains. He is like a farmer who leads a group of reluctant and different tastes, and has to put all kinds of things that are worthy of these appetites to the destination, so that they can drive them to where they need them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these 倔驴 tastes are too high, and what they want is often not affordable. In addition, their tastes are always changing. It is very tiring to try to figure out the temperament of a cockroach. Not to mention that Rogge wants to try to figure out the four heads at the same time. In this case, it may not be easier to deal with the city of Yunxiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, now that Miss Andronie is re-appearing, and obviously has the strength of the sanctuary, but until now she has not yet arrived Dresden came to find a fat man, God knows where she went again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge put down the report in his hand and smiled a little bit. Now he has experienced the feeling of helplessness of some great kings. For those in the sanctuary, no matter how good or serious they are, they are also likely to leave at any time. For the big business, their role is actually very limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down the documents in his hand and came to the window, quietly watching the scenery outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the defeat of Charlie, the resistance of the Rebels flourished. The Bauhinia Butterfly publicly called on all the people of Latvia to stand up and overthrow Rogge's tyranny. Without the command of Charlie and the temptation of Xia Shang, the squad was defeated in the battle against the Rebels and had lost several small towns in the border area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown situation Xia Shang also said to Rogge, asking to take over the remaining army, to eliminate the resistance. Rogge angered and gave him a harshly worded letter and transferred most of his power into Horn's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the real headache for Rogge is the city of clouds and the silver miracle Nicholas, but the growth of the Rebels has reached the point where he can not tolerate. Nicholas, who has a high strength and is erratic, is not easy to deal with, but the goal of the city of Yunxiao is obvious. Although the strength of the sky is strong, other Druids are not in the eyes of Rogge. It’s just that there are so many people in the city of Yunxiao, who knows if there will be another person like Death Class. Moreover, the wrath of the sky is only the 'Druid of the North'. What kind of characters are the other three Druids? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the silver miracle, there is no good way to do it for the time being. In fact, this confidant is basically delayed, and almost no one in Rogge can stop Nicholas's blow. This time he killed Charlie, and his next goal is not necessarily aimed at who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thinks over and over again, the immediate priority is to understand the origins of the Bauhinia butterfly. This mysterious young woman has become the spiritual leader of the Rebels, and her Majesty's soldiers are close to half of the entire Rebels. Now she is colluding with the silver dragon Nicholas, which means that the warrior has a warrior, the general will be led, and the strong will have a strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has scolded Horn several times, but he still can't make the bottom of the Bauhinia butterfly. The fat man also knows that he has tried his best, and he has to think about his way. However, Horn successfully bought a guard around the Bauhinia Butterfly and learned that Nicholas had never appeared since the First World War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge handled the day’s official duties, and the pile of documents at hand still only went down a little. He smiled a little bit. In the past, most of these documents were not placed on his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the window and it was already dark. At this time his door was pushed open, and Froya walked in and swayed. She smacked her hand and yawned, a pair of sleepy eyes, apparently ‘nap’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead fat, how do you eat at this Grand Duchy? I have ordered a few things at random. The manager actually said that it is too expensive, so Not prepared! You can't do it. How do you say that you are also the prince of the empire? It is worse than the count of a remote area. I don't know, you can always treat the treasury of the Principality as your own pocket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog stood up and smiled: "There is no money in the treasury of the Principality. There are now more than 300,000 gold coins, which can barely keep running. In the fall, all kinds of taxes can be collected. If I don’t take the lead in cutting expenses from the Grand Duke, how can other departments also reduce spending? Now the anti-military activities are rampant, and military spending is very big. You, for the time being, will be a little bit "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria yawned again, still confused: "You have no money? Where are the millions of gold coins?" I heard that Xia Shang and his men are very corrupt, should It’s time to kill them? After destroying their families, and then confiscating the family, you will have more money. Their money is from civilians, and you are not the equivalent of a tax. Then, can the citizens think that you are a good person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiles, nothing can beat you. You should sit down first, and there will be two guests coming in. You will know how I spent all my money. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing that a guest was coming, Froya’s ear immediately erected and immediately woke up. She dropped the phrase 'Return immediately', Disappeared at the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, a little goblin dressed up and came in, she was beautiful, and she was with a sacred sacredness. Temptation, straight to see the fat eyes bright. Rogge especially admired her lightning-like dress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat behind Roger, it was It is perfect, and it is inextricably linked to the temptation, danger, wayward and sultry little goblin in Rogge's memory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When night falls, it is in the dark world When people are active.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, two soft slamming sounds. But not knocking on the door, but knocking on the window.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come in! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window opened quietly. The pretty Nico jumped into the adult, you haven't summoned us for a long time! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Froya at a glance, and she was very focused on it for a while, and finally she was slightly discouraged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the two new silver plaques on her cuffs and smiled: "Nicone, you are promoted!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole smiled and said: "This is the care of Rogge adults! For VIPs like you, our dark night dancers have always been served by special people, such as me. Listen to your call at any time. Your task of investigating the Bauhinia Butterfly, the elders have decided, because the mission is likely to involve the Sanctuary's strong, so the price is set at 50,000 gold coins. How do you see?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole nodded and lasted specifically, so I brought a magic communication device. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "Very good, we have to wait for someone to decide the price." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, the window was filled with fog, and a figure slowly formed from the darkness. The man stepped into the window, Rogge took a picture and listened to your instructions." His eyes swept over Froya, and he instantly heated up, then he bowed his head and did not dare to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow?" Nicole lost his voice: "Why are Roger adults, why are they here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge did not answer, just smiled and said: "You have come a lot this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nico and the gray-haired people in the shadow organization All are slightly embarrassing. A few times ago, they had already eaten the bitterness that appeared in the room of Rogge. The gray-clothed people were almost killed, but dare to play with fire again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray-dressed humanity: "The task of Rogge, the butterfly of purple, we are willing to take over 40,000 gold coins!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole is very nervous, she immediately said: "Roger adults, this price has passed my authority, you wait a moment, I will go to the elders!" Then she went through the window Out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-clothed person seems to have anticipated this situation long ago. He gave Rogge a courtesy, took the room out, and found a hidden place and boss. Contacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the two returned to the study and began to kill the price. However, when the 30,000 gold coins were killed, they would not be able to cut the price again, and instead made a fuss about the time limit for completing the task. Finally, when Nicole spit out the phrase 'week', the gray man finally silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the emerging shadows are still not as deep as the dark night dancers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task is set. In the heart of Rogge, he suddenly moved, and said: "You wait, I have a reward for the task to be distributed through your channels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked: "What is the reward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole asks: "How much is the reward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge slowly said: "I want to reward a dragon that has recently appeared in the territory of the Principality! It is familiar with the level of deformation, usually turned into a silver skin of the elf, the most obvious feature is the body is covered with silver magic This dragon is a human being, killing a large number of civilians in the territory of the Principality, so any adventurer or hunter can find and kill this dragon, will receive a million gold coins!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this number, Nicole and the Greys are all moved. Nicole calmed down and asked: "Do you have anything to add to this task? I personally recommend that you keep your identity confidential, and our night dancers can guarantee the reliability of the mission. Of course, this is I charge some fees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog’s indulging in it is still unclear which dragon is belonging to this dragon, but some people have seen its deformation, according to that Description, maybe it is a silver dragon. Also, if you can't kill this dragon, you can get a tenth of the bounty by taking back part of his body. This task, you can help me out at the same time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole has counted a task... The cost of providing cloth and guarantees is a total of 60,000 gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray clothing interface: "The same service, only 40,000 gold coins are required for the shadows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nico immediately Retorted: "Can the channel of shadow compare with the night dancers? How many top hunters can you contact, and have long-term contacts with several big mercenaries? How many of your own sanctuaries are strong? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-haired people are cold and authentic: "Our strength is certainly not as good as the night dancers, but providing services at the right price is the reason for our shadow. Although we are weak, we have experienced two dark wars that have not been eliminated by your dark night dancers. Our existence has been recognized by the dark night dancers. You can’t help the shadows. Can we eliminate us now? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-coated man pulled out a dark, dull cockroach and slowly swallowed: "It seems that I have to accept your challenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Not a suitable battlefield!" said, Fu Luoya Yingying stood up, his hands slightly raised, two bright red light balls hit the two killers of the sword. Their bodies are stiff and can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two killers looked at Froya with horror. They didn’t think that this dignified and beautiful woman was such a powerful magician! Of course, before the paralyzed magic effect is lifted, they can only look at Fu Luoya with the lingering corners of their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblins whispered something at Rogge's ear, and Rogge's eyes swelled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to the two killers who stood like sculptures: "There is also a very important addition to the task of rewarding the dragon, that is, this deformation becomes The last place where a silver elf dragon appeared was to lead the Rebel's Bauhinia butterfly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two killers finally waited for the magic effect to be lifted, immediately Leaving away. The two have had another jealousy since then, don't fight in Rogge's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two killers were sent away, and Rogge called Hoon over and told him: "It’s time to close the net. I will inform you that you are in the Rebels. The two people in the middle, let them leave the site of the Bauhinia butterfly with their team, the farther the better. At the same time let them break with the Bauhinia butterfly publicly, for the reason, she said that she colluded with the evil creatures, fighting with the power of the devil "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horne has some doubts that the soldiers in our hands only account for one-third of the resistance, and the soldiers with the Bauhinia, not only can know them in advance. The arrangement can also prevent some of her action plans. It is a good time for us to defeat the Bauhinia butterfly in one fell swoop. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head. "It’s just a small matter to pack up the bauhinia butterfly. I am really worried about it." You don't have to ask more, just go ahead. After a long time, the camp of the Bauhinia Butterfly will become very lively, and I will let the rebels know to betray me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the night dancers is indeed very high. On the sixth night of the night, Nicole responded with a thin sheet of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thin piece of paper, Rogge flipped over and read seven or eight times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly grew up in the city of Yunxiao, and after more than ten years of training in the cold moon camp, and secretly followed Frederick in the southeastern border of the Asrofik Empire for more than two years, accumulated Rich combat experience. This time she was secretly sent to the Alai Principality by the Yunxiao City and led the rebellion movement in the Principality. It can be said that it has achieved remarkable results. In a short time, she not only gathered a thousand people. The troops also encircled one of Rogge’s most elite troops.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night dancers specifically mentioned that the Bauhinia butterfly was secretly cultivated in the city of Yunxiao. One of the few moon-night knights. The Moon Knight’s personal combat power is not strong, but like Charlie, they are specialized in military politicians. The sacred people focus on the different skills of the sacred system. The moonlight knights are involved in all kinds of magic and combat techniques. The cost of mastering such a complicated and complicated knowledge system is that all aspects are understood, but none of them are proficient. However, the Moon Knight does not value the improvement of individual combat effectiveness. According to the dark night dancers, mastering so much knowledge, the main purpose is to let the Knights of the Moon and Nights to examine and think about the problem from a very comprehensive angle. Therefore, after more than ten years After the rigorous training, every night of the night knights are rare generals and strategists. With the support of the imperial prime minister Straw and the 'tidal' army, the moonlit night knight has enough practical opportunities to gain growth. The experience required.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report also mentioned that the Bauhinia butterfly and the coalition general Du Lin, who is currently being held in the Wright Fortress, are brothers and sisters, but she has been young It was chosen by the city of Yunxiao, and it has been nearly two decades since then.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge secretly admire the strength of the night dancers, so secretive and trivial They can all be investigated in a short period of time. However, he is also secretly vigilant. It is impossible for a dark night dancer to have only one of his VIPs. Maybe his death is also spending money to investigate his whereabouts. Previous hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed the report and thought about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this report It seems that the Cold Moon Camp in the Cloud City is an organization similar to the Church of the Light, and it has been in business for quite some time. There is such an organization in the city of Yunxiao, which shows that the hearts of the Druids are not only in the balance of nature. A long time ago, they began to prepare for the political economy of the empire. Druid, who has always been hidden and peaceful, will be so deliberately trying to seize power. There must be another reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Rogge secretly afraid is that Nicholas has already taken the line with the city of the Clouds. If these two major rivals are joined together, it will be enough for the fat man to linger at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report concludes with a brief mention that the Bauhinia butterfly has a high personality, a firm belief, and a sacrifice of sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will be useful." Rogge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just six days, several high-level hunters and adventurers have entered the Principality of Aray. They apparently came for the huge bounty of the dragon. Although these people's skills are good, but any Sanctuary strong can kill them a small team, to kill Nicholas, it is impossible. They also don't want to think about the silver dragon that can use the final metamorphosis, which is comparable to the ordinary sanctuary. But the power of gold coins is endless, and the sweet sound of Ding Ding, the soft golden light, is enough to make them forget what Yinlong means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxonomy of the dragon is a very advanced study. Among the adventurers of the Big 6 races, the knowledge about dragons is very poor and not accurate enough. It is no wonder that there are several people who can be powerful enough to probe the dragon's living conditions. The adventurers can be subdued, only some of the lowest dragons. Those who can kill the tall dragons will not take their own lives to take the risk unless there are special reasons. For these people, gold coins have long lost their appeal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Roger, despite spending more than 300,000 gold coins in the national treasury, spent more than 100,000 for these two tasks, but he still safely opened A reward for a million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, those who can earn this million will never be tempted by money. If you want to earn one million, you will definitely not have the ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All as Rogge expected, although the hunters have not yet arrived on a large scale, but the Bauhinia Butterfly’s military camp is already a chicken jump. Every night, a batch of hunters will try to sneak into the military camp of the Bauhinia Butterfly and explore where the deformed dragon is hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many hunters are good at stealth, but there are also people who are not so good at activities in the dark. In either case, most of the time the hunters are going to get rid of the sentinel of the Bauhinia butterfly. The Bauhinia Butterfly added several times to the sentry. It doesn't matter. In the eyes of these high-powered hunters, there are no differences between a few and a dozen sentinels. However, if a team of dozens of people is sent to the whistle, because there are many places to be guarded, the Bauhinia butterfly needs at least a thousand sentinels. How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the adventurers and mercenaries who were hired to help also heard the rewards of the dragon, and began to move. Many of them saw Nicholas in the battle of the day, and they remembered the extremely conspicuous silver magic pattern. Although Nicholas's strength is absolute, but these adventurers still have a little luck for the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the prestigious leaders of the Rebels, Jonathan and Gujar, suddenly declared that the Bauhinia Butterfly was collaborating with the devil and fighting with the power of the devil. victory. They also said that they would never be a tool for the devil, so the soldiers who led their men were evacuated to the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden split of the rebel army immediately cast a shadow over the already good situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, the town where the Rebels are located, Cliff Town, is more lively than any other night. On the edge of the town, the screams and screams came from time to time, and at almost every moment, there were several battles at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small building in the center of the town, a purple-brown armored Bauhinia butterfly opened the door and came to the terrace. She stared at the fire everywhere, and her eyebrows wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to stop the hunter’s increasingly rampant activities, her direct Druid and Icewind Warriors have been dispatched tonight to hunt all the dare to commit crimes. Hunters. Bauhinia knows that this will only provoke endless hatred, but she has no other way. Now ordinary warriors are already at risk, and sometimes they rely on lottery to decide who should go to the whistle. In this way, entangled with the bounty hunters, it will not take long for Rogge to attack, and perhaps the rebel army will collapse first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia Butterfly has heard about the millions of rewards recently circulated in the Dark World and Bounty Hunter. But she knew that even if she came out to clarify, no one would believe her. The hunters that are now appearing are only the first troops, and the real threat is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, the most outstanding Bauhinia butterfly among the younger generation of the moonlight knights began to feel the thorny situation. If she is wrong, it is that she underestimates the greed and madness in human nature. With the huge power of the city of the Clouds, the Bauhinia Butterfly is very aware of the financial situation of the Principality of Aray. She knows that Rogge can't pay a reward of a million gold coins. But what about it? This million gold coins originally did not need to be paid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, she would rather have a million coins in exchange for Nicholas’s help. However, this powerful elf only helped her once in that battle, and has never appeared since. Nicholas can help, and is the result of the Presbyterian activities, she can not make this level of strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was indeed a big win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie was suddenly killed, causing a brief panic and confusion in the army, and the Druids and Icewind Warriors she had always hidden were both strength and quantity. The material of the host, coupled with her multi-faceted enemies, had the advantage of the number of people, and finally smashed Charlie’s troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the attack on Rogge is extremely heavy. But when Rogge came back from the emperor, he began to fight back. It is only a prelude to let the rebels split, spread the rumors that she colludes with the devil, and the adventurers who are attracted by huge rewards and locusts. There is a lot of strength that Rogge hides, and no one can say it. The city of Yunxiao originally wanted to smash the eyes of the fat ally of the fat man when Rogge was not there, but Wan did not expect that not only the whole army would be wiped out, but the elders were still caught alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly sighs and feels that the burden on the shoulder is extremely heavy. She was looking at the direction of the Wright Fortress, where she was holding her brother who had not seen her for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When can she lead the army to attack the Kleite Fortress and rescue her brother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly has no confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge would not give her any breathing space. The troops of the Principality of Ale in the occupied area have begun to assemble, and Rogge will personally lead the troops to collect the Bauhinia butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, the fat man must first guard against Nicholas. Dealing with the silver miracle, it is not enough to have a death class and a repairs, and Androni does not know where to go, then the role of *** is crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this night, Rogge began to try to summon *** and Gregorian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of death, the flame in the bones of the dragon suddenly jumped a little. It then floated in the air if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bone dragon squats in the high-powered Wella, after deep struggle in the heart, it finally flew to the face of Wella, respectfully said: The owner of Wella, he was calling me again. I think it is up to you to decide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faint smiles, you More and more smart. Why don't you stare at me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina Master, you are already a god. Under your insight, what can I hide? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina Pin refers to a light pick, a golden light emerges from the body of the bone dragon, and she jumps to her fingertips. I gently stroked this invisible gold thread, sneered and said to myself: "***, although you took away all the coordinates, but you must not think, the most important coordinates will be sent to the door yourself? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze turned to the bone dragon Ligaoli, *** has a soul contract, can know all your thoughts. And now I have insight into the field, you Don't think about what I am doing anymore. You are not very easy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But not!..." Gregory was excited. Said that he left his mouth. It looked at Weina's cold demon mask, and the fire of the soul gradually sank into the ice lake. It knows that after being forced to choose the path of degeneration, Wella's mood must be extremely poor now, and the role that he has helped in this process is really not very glorious. If it was before, it would have been possible to win the Weina, but now, its strategy is never possible to shape the field of insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the loyalty and fearlessness that Bone Dragon showed when he announced his allegiance was all installed. How could Wella not know now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he waited for a long time and didn't wait for anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly asked: "Gregory, you sold him to me, how do you prepare to face your *** master?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought of *** that expressionless silver eyes, bone dragon could not help but jump a few times, hesitantly said: "only ... when to say Besides, the owner of Wella will not kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you think I will not kill him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and the owner of the owner have no enmity"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the contrary, there is hatred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon reacted very quickly and immediately said: "Aha! Dare to enmity with God, his brain must have been smashed by the rot! But the owner of the master is still a bit used. Temporarily not busy killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina is quietly saying: "What use is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The spirit of the bone dragon is alive. You are already a god. How can you have no believers? The number of his men can be quite a lot, and they can force them to become your most loyal followers. Which one dares not to, and immediately cuts. By the way, it is best to let you be the guardian goddess of his country, let all people believe in you, those who do not believe immediately thrown into prison. In this way, the power of your faith will be much larger? Listen to that Thaledes said that the power of this belief should be very powerful, or why the main gods are not used? They must be selfish! I know that they are afraid that others will become gods and steal their position! If you have millions of believers, how can you increase your strength by three or five times? Then you will bring me with me. Let's go to other places and slash a few gods..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! "The huge plan of the bone dragon has not finished yet, and Weiner, who is crying and laughing, interrupted it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina was silent for a moment, suddenly smiled With the coordinates, let's go to the world and see it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boring bone dragon is overjoyed, shaking his head and following Weina across the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger, who had been waiting in the courtyard for a long time, thought it would be a disappointing night tonight. He turned to just return to the room, suddenly trembled and slowly turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night sky, the familiar and strange demon lotus is slowly emerging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no excitement in his heart for a moment, and I don’t know how long it’s been. This is still the first time that *** is not to save his life, but just to him. Summoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the power of *** has made him completely invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did you start, how many times have you ever had a strange feeling between the master and the servant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***..." Rogge swayed, stepping forward, but the devil's mask was only cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence in the courtyard, all the sounds disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly had a strange feeling, he couldn’t think about it, and immediately tried his best to defend himself. In an instant, Roger was covered with a layer of faint silver light, followed by countless fireworks bursting on the silver hood. The beautiful sparks contained a terrible force in every single flower. No matter what you touched, Blow it out of a small pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, all the sounds have been taken away from this space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the scenes in Rogge’s body are not naturally distorted. He only feels that the pressure around him is soaring, it seems to never end! He slammed a bit, squirting a blood, and the silver mask was finally broken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s forehead is violent, his fists are clenched, his eyes are bright and silvery, and he is desperate to compete with the endless pressures around him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked coldly at Rogge, who was desperately resisting, and asked Rogge in the left hand, still unable to lift the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
