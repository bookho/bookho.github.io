He threw a leg on the large office desk and looked up at the ceiling, wondering what he was thinking. There were a few high-profile files piled up on the office desk, which seemed to have never been opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This office is originally owned by General Wallace. It is small in size and very simple in layout. The only advantage is that the orientation is not bad, most of the day. Can see the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, Wallace disregarded the opposition of the generals, prepared another house for Rogge, and gave up his office. The Rogge family was determined not to move, and the office accepted it with difficulty. Because the Bauhinia butterfly reminded Rogge that he is the highest leader of the entire Western Front, if he does not stay at the Legion headquarters, it will be provoked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a crisp leather boots was far and near, and with the permission of Rogge, the frosty rose came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge’s uncomfortable sitting posture, Rose’s brow wrinkled tightly. She came to the desk and examined the documents on the table one by one, only to find that these files were not seen at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May finally couldn’t help but say: "Roger, how do you say it is also the highest sergeant of the 'tidal' corps, what you are now... really hurts the legion Image!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled lazily, absent-mindedly: "In any case, my army leader is just a name, even if you don't want to be named, you also Don't do it! So I said that the image of the 'Tide's Army is good or bad. What does it have to do with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a frosty face, she is cold and cold: "Rogue Master! As your adjutant, I know your past glory very well. So the look of a rogue is not suitable for your identity and strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not enough for her, Roger smiled and said: "My past glory? Doesn't the package include the city that digs the clouds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May is calm and good The face can't help but change a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and continued: "But that is the credit of Alexander. He is worthy of the title of Emperor God, and he is returning to the emperor." When I took the 50,000 Dwarf slaves, I was really farsighted! I dare not take the merits of Alexander adults in this matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Face, no answer. She just silently sorted out the documents on the table and hugged her arms out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he reached the door, Mei suddenly stopped. She did not look back, but gently asked: "Rogge, 153 lives, are you really so heartfelt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rose, the emperor's rules are above everything else. I have no choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But according to the rules of the emperor, you have the right to forgive!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a good reason for pardoning, but now I don't see the reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save lives Isn't it a reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May still tried to make a final effort, because in a few moments, one hundred and fifty-three fighters would fall on the execution ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge yawned and said: "The true meaning of nature lies in balance. Life is less imbalance, and more is imbalance. In my opinion, 'tidal' There is still a long way to go to restore the balance of the legion! The life is really too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be seen. Rose's shoulders shivered slightly. She still seems to want to say something, but at this time the door opened, Fu Luoya Yingying came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little demon holds a thick book in his arms and walks straight to Rogge, his hands loose, throwing thick books on Rogge’s belly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the unscrupulous and brazen two guys, Rose's face was extremely ugly, and she snorted and severely closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria struggled out of Rogge’s arms and smiled and said: “Dead fat! If you are noisy again, I will think that I will come to you in the future! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took care of the chaotic hair, then picked up the book on the desk and stuffed it into Rogge's hand. Dao: "Do you really have so much time? This book, "From Hell to Heaven" is the work of the third Pope of the Guangming Church. It tells how a demon transforms his faith and converts to the light. Redemption and eventually become a heavenly apostle. I think this will be useful to you. Hey! Dead fat! I managed to find this book, you give me a serious point, take your hand out!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened "From Hell to Heaven", only after reading a few pages, he was refreshed and whispered: "The description in the book is really heaven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin also lowered his voice and said: "People are the pope of the Church of Light! How can it have nothing to do with the heavens? Anyway, you must be careful now, the power of Macbeth is terrible. Hey, Xiusi’s old things don’t know where to hide, Annie? How have you not seen her in the past few days?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Frowning: "She only left a note saying that there is something to leave for a while, other I didn't say anything, I didn't even know when she left. In fact, even if she is not useful here, the two of us are not the opponents of Macbeth. Hey, he has almost no weakness, he is familiar every day. The body and strength are completely different from the low-level angels I have met before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya smiled and said: "Who said that Mike White did not Weakness? He is very intoxicated by powerful forces, and I feel that he has a strong desire for power. Isn't this a **, not a weakness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗The eyes were bright and said: "That's true! I never thought of it before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya smiled: "Because you guys never put The power of preference is weak! Well, you look slowly, I have to experiment with a new formula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya covered the Rogge office The door, just turned around, saw Rose standing on the other side of the gallery. She has a knife-like golden short hair and a half-mask. The blue eyes were staring at Froya and looking down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has the little goblin been afraid of this scene? She immediately went to the front of the floor and smiled. "You are Rogge's beautiful aide who is called Mei? It looks good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coldly said: "It seems that you are one of the many women of Rogge. The person who is mixed with him is really not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Fairy Laughter, the style of the moment, let Mei feel that the eyes are bright. Froya looked at Mei, and smiled lightly: "It doesn't matter if you have another difference, just be nice than you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Ying Ting Military uniforms. Also added: "Of course, the figure is better than you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!......" The frosty face is extremely ugly. Obviously being mad at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about me? Don't forget, you just disrespected Rogge's export, which is absolutely against the rules of the emperor?" The green eyes began to flash in the unwelcome flame: "Your skin is so good, he must be willing to take off your clothes, hang it up and use a whip to smack!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mui Wei is panic, then sneer again: "Is the evidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin laughed and said: "I am a Magician! Evidence? Isn't this easy?" She drew a few magic symbols in the air. Then recite the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a brown light shining in the corridor, a voice coming out of the light: "It seems that you are one of the many women of Rogge..." The sound is a little erratic, but you can still tell which is the voice of the rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya was proud of her, she snorted, using her fingers to sneak a sneak peek on the top of the mair, and then grow away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just at this time, Rose came in and put a document on the Rogge desk, saying: "You can't look at this document."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What content, let's talk about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We sent several teams to scout the cavalry. To detect the surroundings of the Delaware Empire. The defense situation, and the camera harassed the other's supply line. But... our two reconnaissance cavalry in the other's trap, lost a total of 32 reconnaissance cavalry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge sighed, said: "The reconnaissance cavalry of the 'tidal' regiment can be hit to this point, it seems that the other commander has some skill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;'The Scout's Reconnaissance Cavalry consists of twenty riders, all of which are composed of experienced veterans. They come and go like the wind, they are powerful and extremely difficult to deal with. This time, the two teams only fled back to eight people, and the Chaoshan Legion was not a small one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May again said: "General Wallace is preparing for a retaliatory massive offensive against the Delaware Empire. He will lead five thousand light cavalry to attack and knock Drop the supply point around Solato. General Wallace wants to ask when you have time. He is coming to discuss with you the plan for the action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge waved his hand. Dao: "Come with him, as long as you don't violate the rules of the emperor. You don't have to negotiate with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May still want to say something, but see Luo The grid looked at the book intently and had to retreat. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is flipping through to the abyss when Devil Graefa has just fallen to the abyss, relying on instinct to hunt other demons in the middle of blood and lava. His heart suddenly moved, his eyes crossed the pages, the floor, and the hard rock floor...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze even crossed the space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just facing the gorgeous colors on the infinite background, Rogge is really aimless. He has forever lost contact with the world of death, the world that once made him fearful, curious, confused, excited, and the windy moon that turned from a sly to a black demon and a white wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Moon...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man used to have a feeling that it seems that Fengyue has come to this world. However, no matter how he called, he never got a half-point response. Even at the most critical moment of his life, Fengyue did not respond to his call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue, what happened to you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue looked at the endless stream of space, never felt so stunned for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silvery light in Rogge's eyes gradually converges. He comes to the window and looks at the light cavalry that is gathering in the square outside. He suddenly feels tired. The power is so powerful that he can easily decide whether 153 soldiers will die or die. But the power is so fragile, and the higher powers have left the willingness to obey. It will also become worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty smiles. He can even master the life and death of thousands of people, but he can't find the road sign to the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looks south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day he really hit the South and stepped into the temple of the Pope. What about it? Can he beat the big prophecy, can he resurrect Elysses and Orphee? Even if everything is as he wishes, how should he treat the princess and the golden lion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, is it really what he wants to end? Rogge felt his hand tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be as Ajani said. Pay more attention to some people around you? Suddenly, Rog remembered the night he was killed by the Death Class. The moment before death. In addition to the black flame, there was a pair of silver eyes in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly has an intuition. In Fengyue, he has always neglected something, something very important. At this moment, his fingertips seem to recall the soft touch of the wings of the windy day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge closed his eyes for a long time, and when he opened it again, his eyes were silver. He took a deep breath and couldn't believe the room in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is lingering with a dreamy silver band, and there is a faint music that can’t keep reverberating. It sounds like a deep-hearted girl confiding when the night is strongest. Rogge heard his heartbeat again, and the heartbeat couldn't keep expanding, and eventually it became a deep drum sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drums gradually became louder, and the bass trembled in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the drums sounded, the white feathers that flashed softly in the sky fell. Just like the heavy snow that will appear in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reached out to pick up, but each piece of feathers passed through his palms and then turned into countless shatters before landing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the white feathers, the windy moon wearing the black demon lotus and slashing the death slasher is looming. She turned back slightly and even picked up the corner of the mask...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s chest was hot and his brain was roaring! His hands trembled forward, but when the fingertips touched a falling white feather, music, scorn, light, white feathers, drums, everything, all disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge set the god. In the eyes, the silver light suddenly flourished. In the twinkling of an eye, the surrounding space was detected several times with spiritual power, but nothing was obtained. There is no magic, vindictiveness or traces of some unknown power in the room. So it is impossible to be the illusion of what people are laying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it true that everything is just a dream? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, all the memories of the wind and moon are swept through Rogge's heart like lightning and lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sneak sneak out of the 'Tide's Legion headquarters, looked around and then flashed like a ghost Once, it appeared in a dark alley in the distance, and this slowly emerged. The man in a gray robes looked back and determined that no one was tracking, and then he went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he is really cautious over the head, not to mention that the cavalry is gathering in the square in front of the headquarters of the Chaoshan Legion, and there is a lot of chaos in the whole headquarters. He also has a way to sneak out quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he is a killer in his 400s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes erected a tall collar and covered his clear face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, if Rogge adults meet another person, they will be stalked, and they will never give up without knowing it. Hey, this way, Feng Yue adults should not dare to show up in the city of Sidde? As long as she does not come, the hardship will not fall on the head of my old man! Oh, haha! I want to fight with my old man..." The more proud, the more brisk the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the northern border of the Astrophy Empire, ice and snow cover the land all year round. Crossing the endless snowfield is the legendary ice world, the source of all cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice of the ice is a thick ice cover that has never been seen. Legend has it that in the center of the ice world, ice caps can reach several thousand thick! It’s just the truth of this legend, no one can confirm it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment on the inaccessible ice sheet, there are actually four figures standing. Three of them are dressed in black robes and the other is wrapped in the most common dark gray trench coat in the North. They stood still and seemed to be waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not far from the top of the four people, there is a dragon floating in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small crack suddenly appeared on the ice cover in the distance. In the snoring of the Kazakh, the arachnoid cracks spread rapidly and extended to nearly a hundred meters in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a deep roar in the sky, and at that moment, it seemed that the entire ice sheet was shaking! Suddenly, a thunder was rang, and a water column with a thickness of several tens of meters was filled with countless huge ice cubes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy moon in the demon lotus rises slowly in the water column, her right hand lifts the death sickle, and the huge blade is actually hanging a few tens of meters. Sea dragon! Hailong tumbling and struggling with extreme pain, but in any case, he couldn’t get rid of the slashing knife that almost completely fell into its jaw! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
