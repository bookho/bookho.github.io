Just by purifying it from the ore to metal, it has already stumped a large alchemist like Fiss. To make this metal into various magic guides, and often need several stars, magicians, magicians and great alchemists to cooperate, in order to slowly bring out the power contained in it. Not to mention how difficult it is to gather the top figures in many of the magical worlds, that is, to get together, and success is only in the fifth and fifth. In the artifacts of the world, as long as it involves the use of space, more or less will contain some stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s heart is a problem. How to get this thing to hand is a problem. It’s a problem to get rid of it. Although odd goods can live, but the world that can know the goods and is willing to buy can not find a few. If you don't sell, they don't buy it. Ten years and eight years are not necessarily able to find the next buyer. Although it can't be ruined, it can't be broken, but this kind of baby is placed on the hand. It is to make people feel worried and sleepy at all times. I thought that at the beginning, the old sacred springs provoked the thieves to flock, and several aristocratic youths were spending money in the backyard, and they would not have a thousand gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, buying and selling this kind of thing, although rich is a rich overnight, but the risk is also proportional to foreign wealth. After thinking about it, he still felt that giving up this thing and changing a few slaves would be more stable. Although hundreds of dwarf slaves don't look as much as one-tenth of the price of this star gold, it is a real gold coin. Moreover, with the permission to provide weapons and armaments for the Principality, the value of these dwarves must be far beyond their market prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Jinge and Benjamin also came together and stared at this little mysterious metal with a fascinating look. Gold, the gold of the stars, the golden color with shining stars, and the golden and pure gold of the gold coins, slowly flowing in everyone's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three looked at each other, and Rogge first said: "The value of this piece of gold, we all know that this thing is of no use to me, you Who are interested in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin and Jinge are also carefully calculating. After many years of business, Benjamin knows that the value of gold coins in his hands is much higher than the income of the future. Moreover, he is more optimistic about the underground veins of the Dwarf City, the only thing that bothers him is the sudden abyss devourer. The dwarfs are known for their magical talents. Why can they summon such a large number of abyss creatures? This matter is not resolved, Benjamin can not reap the benefits of the veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Benjamin turned to think that the life of the miners is not so valuable compared to the mineral deposits. Nowadays, the people living in the countries around the Principality of Ron are not as good as one day. Many farmers have lost their land and become displaced people. It is estimated that it will not be able to recruit a lot of refugees with much money, and even some people can go to mine to sell their lives as long as they are in control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jing Ge is unexpectedly interested in this star Jin Da. In any case, the purchase of this piece must represent a huge resource and network in the field of magic, which makes Rogge curious about Jing Ge's identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three are all savage and savvy, and they are more conscientious and dare to break the character. Jing Ge won the gold, Benjamin still obtained all the underground veins, Rogge won all the dwarves, and Benjamin agreed with the future supply of various scarce metals at a low price to supply the hammer of the god of war, and the "Helen" hotel under the jurisdiction of Jingo Half of the annual proceeds are paid to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a certainty, Jing Ge immediately took the gold, and put it into an unremarkable leather bag. The magical fluctuations of Star Gold immediately disappeared, which surprised Rogge. This small bag can make a big difference at some point! Of course, the role at the moment is to prevent the vampire from having such a thing. Jing Ge took a piece of amber jade from his body and placed it in the box. This piece of amber jade is very strange, with a huge eye of an unknown creature condensed, and the slight wrinkles in the pale yellow hazelnut are clearly visible. A trace of magical fluctuations passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sees a lot, and the recognition is quite wide, which is also due to the fact that the fat man has read countless books in the weekdays. But he doesn't know what this thing is. Before he even asked him, a small hand took the amber jade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this? It's weird!" Froya turned over and studied the amber jade, but she did not want it. So I put it in my own small pocket and lazily said: "This thing belongs to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three sized foxes glanced at each other, both It is a faint and painful color, but the flattering face is not afraid to lose a half. Froya was very proud and picked up a little song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a hunter knocked down a slow-moving old dwarf and violently whipped with a whip. At this time, a dozen or so dwarfs who were originally warriors suddenly rushed up and knocked the hunter down to the ground. The three nearby hunters saw this scene, and they rushed to the knife and cut down several dwarves on the periphery. However, more dwarves rushed up and drowned the four hunters in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, more than a hundred dwarves escaped from the brigade and fled to the depths of the forest. Rogge, who was at the forefront of the team, knew the incident and was surprised and angry. The fat man and Kate and Franco immediately led a dozen individuals to catch up. Because of the precautionary measures, all the dwarves, except the sick number, the elderly and the children, were all hungry for more than three days, so Rogge easily intercepted the escaped slaves in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still very easy to deal with these unarmed, hungry, green eyes. In order to prevent the dwarf from escaping, Rogge first cast a few spider webs or vines around him, and then Kate and Franco were following the mountain tigers, and they went in and out of the dwarves. Although the dwarves all have a desperate heart, they are hungry and unable to do so, and they are knocked down to the ground one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, more than a hundred escaped dwarves were taken back. Rogge, Kate and Jingo spoke for a little while, and Jinge stood up. He gave a command and immediately grabbed ten dwarf children. Seven or eight dwarves immediately cried, it seems that these are their children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now let me see you! I want to resist, I want to run away! What are you doing? You are still hungry for three days, still running. Can kill my four men! You can rest assured, I will not kill you, will not kill those who run away! However, these children! To give my men's life! These children, you guys who run away from harm Dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior holding the dwarf child took off his knife and four heads fell to the ground. The dwarves suddenly cried, snorted, and even quarreled with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop!" Rogge shouted and ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped the warrior who wanted to continue, and quarreled with Jing Ge. After a moment, Rogge returned to the dwarf queue and screamed: "The lives of these six children are temporarily staying! However, if someone escapes or riots in the future, I can't keep you. Just do it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are still a small number of strong dwarves whose eyes are full of hatred, Rogge is pleased to see that most of the strong dwarves are helpless and frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is extremely toxic, and as a result, which dwarf wants to escape again, it becomes a heart to kill these children. Not to mention that most of the time will be caught back, the parents and relatives of these children will certainly not let him go. Although the people who really harm the dwarfs are Rogge and Kate, in this case, most people will transfer hatred more or less to the direct cause: the dwarf who fled. Really long-term vision, can think of the key, and think too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock will face these dwarves directly, and they will need to make their gold coins pile up so high, naturally they have to seize this opportunity to sell. . As for this victim and the character that makes the dwarf hate, Jing Ge is a perfect fit. The slaves who passed through him every year don’t know how many, and don’t care about these two or three thousand enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small riots quickly subsided. Rogge also constrained his men, and he can do it, but he must be careful, especially not to insult the beliefs and customs of the dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere. On this day, Flora suddenly found Rogge and gave him a notebook that was big and thick. It was a long-time notebook. It was very interesting. Let him take a closer look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, nothing is going on, Rogge is studying in the carriage. This turned out to be the eye of the eye! It describes the major events of the dwarf tribe for more than 150 years and the experience of the heavenly eye on magic. The description uses the big 6 general text, although the dwarf's calligraphy is not worthy of compliment, Rogge is still barely searching in the scribbled handwriting. Dwarves, elves, dragons, and other races are full of mystery to humans, and it is quite rare to have access to first-hand historical materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More," Rog thought, "Learn more about the dwarf's habits and let them make more money for me in the future." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick notebook opened, and a thrilling history was resurrected from the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of War was in October 1979. It is already the fifth cold and dry winter. Perhaps this is what the "Seven Years of Absurdity" in the "Great Prophecy" was dug up in the ground last month. The water source, otherwise I really don’t know how to go this winter. It’s just that the water source was dug down more than four hundred meters to find out. How many people died for this water source? Ten, or eleven? Anyway We all have to keep going here, as long as two years are just fine! The greatest prophet of the dwarves, Kladrik Momo, is omniscient. He wrote the "Great Prophecy" at the expense of his last life. It's right. Just keep it for two years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of war is in April and April. There is still no sign of the past in this winter. There are no animals in the mountains, and the forest is dead in pieces. The greatest God of War, do you really want to abandon your people? Two small tribes in the nearby mountains have begun to migrate. May God of War bless them, don't go on the big pre- The Devil's Road, which is called by the Words.... It really misses the taste of ale..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of War is September, September, the whole five months. In the past, there was only one light rain in five months. The only source of groundwater was the deepest one. The great wizards in the tribe have been casting spells for ten days, but the flames in the altar have never changed. God of war, Have you been reluctant to give us any more inspiration? The workers have already dug up to a depth of 1,100 meters, but they have no hope of finding any water source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of War is in November of the 1990s. The fifth tribe has moved away and headed for the road of no return to the East. The scope of the misty forests that isolated the alpine dwarves and the hilly dwarf kingdom in the West has expanded. The first starving child has appeared in the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of War is in April 1981. And the last year is in the prophecy It’s time for the 'seven years of ridiculousness' to end. Only two dwarf tribes still insist on staying here, the Tangkuri Mountains, The source of the alpine dwarves. But we have not been able to continue, the anger and flame hammer finally decided to move the family, the elders also agreed, what can I use for my own opposition? Although the devil is in front and so on We are, but according to the Great Prophecy, there will still be a tribe lucky to escape this disaster. God of War, I am not cursing our brothers and tribes. But the number of tribes is less than 7,000. There were 20,000 people three years ago!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of war was in 1983. The whole two years of trek is finally over, Only 3,000 people have arrived at their destination. This place is really good, rich in veins, forests, food and water. The only thing that is disturbing is that it is closer to greedy, deceitful human beings. Just, why is my heart so full of anxiety and fear? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of War was in January 1988. Since the roots here, the population of the family has finally begun to recover. But the flames of the altar have never changed in any way, and I can't feel the breath of the sacred warrior, the holy martial artist. For more than ten years, I have been unable to communicate with the God of War and to receive the metaphor. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of War is in February and February. Is this the same nightmare for the first time? Dreaming that we are building the city on the heart of the devil, and the evil in the distance is peeking at the wealth of the dwarf. It seems that the lucky tribe in The Great Prophecy may not be us. Perhaps it is time for us to move again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of War is in April and April. Our king once again rejected my proposal. Now the sentinel suddenly disappeared, and the tribe began to be inexplicably sick. The devil is here! We have been abandoned by the God of War in the prophecy, and the devil will be born in the dwarf's blood and wealth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has turned over another page.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are few elites in the family." Warrior. The devil's blackmail and fierceness have all imagined! Maybe only that magic can save... is salvation, fate is immutable. But I want the demons to pay some price! Even if it is at the cost of my soul, even if I can no longer return to the glory of God of War, I have to let the demons pay the price! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Rogge couldn’t help but give the most vicious curse to the dwarf wizard. It is estimated that this magic called the old thing of the eye is The magic that summoned the abyss devourer, who almost killed himself. He continued to flip through the notes as he groaned, hoping to find some clues about the magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In any case, this summoning magic is a bit too powerful. And the dwarfs who have always been known for their low magical energy (the reason why they are not idiots, because the dwarf sorcerers can still produce some auxiliary spells) can be used. How come out, how can I not use my talent in magic? Although Rogge knows that he is not extraordinary in magic, the magic level is still far worse, but it is always stronger than the dwarf? Summon evil creatures, and the number of ways to his Necromancer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Rogge, however, was that the record was ambiguous, especially with regard to the part of the spell. It can be seen that even the eye is in the stage of discussion. For this advanced magic, the use of spells, magic gestures, and magic is a bit wrong, and Rogge knows what will happen. In his heart, he even secretly concealed this old thing. There are not many dwarves who will magic. If the eye is not dead, he is not going to treat him as a guest. Maybe he can give him a free identity for two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, "Advanced evil call"? It seems that there is no such magic in the big 6 orthodox magic system? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the dwarf’s level of magic is not so good, this “senior evil call” is still stumped by Rogge. In particular, the eyes of the sky are inconsistent in the discussion of the spell, mixing the carriers of three magic spells: lingua franca, elf language and divine language. The magic of the magic left by the eye is really giving Rogge an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hard day, the fat man finally went to see his own big nemesis, Princess Froya. The desire for magic still overwhelmed the fear of Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Froya placed the "Paradise Lost" in a buggy. Although he said that he had stayed in Paradise Lost three or four times, Rogge never saw what the artifact was like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria likes gorgeous, her study also fully reflects her preferences. The princess lazily leaned against a reclining chair and frowned slightly, looking carefully at the magical description of the heavenly eye. Rogge stood behind him and explained in detail the circumstances in which the eyes of the eye cast magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Ya sighed a magic note, a little half is wrong, it is too ugly. Wait... You say what happened to his spell that day? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the curse of the day is so great that Rogge is still impressive, not to mention the spell, it seems that it is not difficult to understand.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge repeats little by little, and the color of Froya’s face is constantly changing, and finally she can’t help it, laughing and laughing. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that Flora laughed and swayed, Rogge did not understand what it was for. But the fat man is not an honest person, and Froya is lying on the back of the chair. When the tears came out, the fat man's eyes slid from the low-necked neckline from time to time, gazing staring at the snowy, swelled skin.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, Froya was only finished laughing, and she looked up to the fat thief’s gaze as soon as she looked up. Rogge immediately went cold and sweated, and bowed his head in guilt. Froya floated a sly smile, reaching out and slowly picking up Rogge's chin, and the long blue nails gently stroked Rogge's skin. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge only feels dry and heart-wrenching.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria The fingers point to Rogge's skin, and all the way slowly down. Her eyes are slowly becoming blurred. The fat soul does not know where to fly, and the throat screams like: "Princess..." Her cold, soft fingers touched the skin, and each of them made Rogge shudder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A small electric fire flashed, and Rogge screamed and jumped up. The man had already become a shrimp in the air, and fell heavily on the ground. Then the fat man slammed his hands and screamed in pain. Rolling away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s fingertips still carry a trace of electric fire, crisp, clear, slightly evil laughter filled the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Rogge climbed up and his face was a little distorted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty also I want to install it for me! This princess knows you. How strong is the magic resistance. It is just to make you hurt. This weak expression is still gone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger smiles, He: "His Royal Highness, what happened so funny?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mentioning this topic, Froya smiled again and suspected that the magic used by the dwarf was 'the door of the high-level alien,' but the magic described The spell is not at all, and the summoned creature is also an abyss creature that has nothing to do with the demons of the demon world. Listening to what you just said, I realized that the dwarf actually used the big 6 idiom to recite the spell! Presumably he Can't read the gods, specifically looking for people to translate into the big 6 lingua franca. Ha ha, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog smiled and thought that his luck was really not good. This kind of thing can be hit. He immediately remembered something and asked: "His Royal Highness, since you have found this note, then what can the "Great Prophecy" let the villain look at it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prophecy" I also want to see it, but unfortunately not in this tribe. However, the magic level of the dwarf division is also like this, this prophecy is not expected to be good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Your Highness," Rogge thought for a while before saying, "This prophecy seems to be quite accurate." You said, is it true that there is a prophecy? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Rogge really cares about. The prophecy is almost always a bright attribute, it is the natural enemy of Rogge, the necromancer. Originally Fat man's understanding, this department mage is able to cast prophetic magic. But if they really have any predictive ability, their future situation can be absolutely not good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's pair of slender eyebrows wrinkled slightly, slowly said: "If you want to say prophecy, you may have to talk about fate first. I remember a long time ago, the teacher once said that fate is like a big river running through, there are countless tributaries, and it has been vented from countless rivers. Human beings are like countless creatures in the big river. They are washed by rivers from one river channel into another. The water in this river is fate. Unfortunately, most fish do not know the existence of water. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought for a while and asked: "If fate is really like this, isn’t it true that the prophet will see countless futures?" ? So which future is true? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prophet is like a fish, a fish that can jump out of the water. They can see the road ahead, but it is just a short moment. What they can see is often the two or three tributaries in front of them. Their future may or may not be in these tributaries. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the princess, if the prophet can see the future, then they can be prepared to escape the bad fate and welcome the coming of luck." . Is the future they foresee not the future? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya smiled at the beginning and I once asked this question to the teacher. His answer is that in a river, the vast majority are sediments. And duckweed, there is no ignorance and ignorance. Only a few people are awakened, and they feel that there are some invisible forces that are affecting themselves. So they struggle and struggle, but they often have no results. A few lucky people are Brought to a lucky river, they thought it was their own power, so they appeared as a strong conquering fate. In fact, they are just a small shrimp in the river. Once the fate changes, these so-called 'electors 'It will sink to the bottom again. There is a very small amount of power in the small fish and shrimp that will continue to grow and become a relatively large fish. Some of the big fish will jump out of the water inadvertently, then some front will be seen. The river."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya paused, and Rogge immediately passed a plate of fruit with great interest. The princess smiled and was very satisfied with the fate's knowledge. She filled a few grapes into her mouth and continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some of the big fish that will continue to jump out of the water for some reason. See the direction of the river ahead. I think, the dwarf who wrote the "Great Prophecy" should be such a fish. But the fish is not a bird, jumping more often from the river of fate, the price is his life. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and praised: "The master of Jero is really a man of heaven, and he has such a deep insight into the prophecy!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smirked. "This is his opinion. This is the view of prophecy and destiny that the first generation of the Church of the Light Church described in his manuscript." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge cautiously asked: "How can the Master of the Jero have the Pope's manuscript? Is there any deep relationship between the old man and the Bright Church?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can old things that are old and not repaired have a relationship with the Church of Light? When he was young, he loved to venture into the grave. Unfortunately, it included the pope's mausoleum. This manuscript is one of the funerary objects. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge puts a heart on himself, as a Necromancer, he is particularly sensitive to anything related to the Church of Light.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, can the person really change his fate? Isn't there an old saying that makes people decide to win the day? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge said: "This is like having a large reef in the water. I want to swim to it. Instead, I will be rushed to the sides by the water. I will try to hide on the side. Maybe it will be rolled up on the reef."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess smiled softly. "You are a fat man. It’s really not stupid. In fact, every river of fate is very wide, a fish, even if it is Big fish, wanting to change a river is actually very difficult. However, many times, even if you know that you don't want to swim to another river, you always try your best. 唉!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, a little bit of sneak sneaked up on the face of Fu Luoya, she looked at the magical flame in front of her, and the clear face was flickering in the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart is moving, what makes Froya so helpless? She was born noble, exquisite, and studied under Jero, one of the ten great wizards. Talent, just look at her little age is actually a 14th-level magician can be imagined, at least ten times more than their own. On the means of scheming, this millennium demon has been carefully crafted, and there are few people who are insidious and insidious. The richness of the family is not the same as that of ordinary ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What troubles does she have? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the princess’s troubles are the troubles of the Bourbon dynasty, the Bavarian Grand Duke of the Rhine League and his son, the youngest Paladin Orfey Roque . Rebellion and conquest are the subject of royal power. For thousands of years, countless dynasties have stepped on the throne of the old royal family. However, more ambitious families have failed, and their blood has made the royal family's medals and titles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Bavarian Principality is at most rebellious. But miracles are the heaviest topic in everyone's mind. Isn’t Princess Froya in front of me a fish struggling in the river of destiny? What she wants to fight is not only the old god of war, the young paladin, but also the opponents behind the bright church and miracles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heavenly Gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s instant grief is very incomparable, and Rogge’s heart is also a pain. But the fat man who is still a bit awake knows that if Froya is a fish that fights hard, then he is at most a small river shrimp. Destiny gave him a broader vision than fish, but it was caused by the weakness of the body. He could only choose to follow the tide. The fish can't get out of the head. What is the use of this little shrimp? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess, your troubles can only be solved by yourself, the villain is powerless!" Rogge silently recited in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s sorrow passed away, and before she turned her eyes, she was the charming fairy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fat, you have killed the golden lion knight, how do you go back and prepare for it?" The princess looked at Rogge's eyes. Not laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart jumped a few times. This is exactly what he has been worried about. Fifty knights in the general Knights are nothing, and their own more than three hundred dragons and beautiful knights are not only more than thirty live back? However, in the Golden Lion Knights with only 500 people, this is definitely not a small amount. Every golden lion knight is at least a tenth-level knight. Such a big battle is in his own hands.
