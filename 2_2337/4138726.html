			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter one encounters<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already the season of snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than two months of migration, the elves finally came to the place where Rogge was ideal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a quiet valley with forests and green lakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley is surrounded by mountains, surrounded by steep and slow, and there are many living springs. It is a good place to be easy to defend. More importantly, turning over a mountain ridge, it entered the territory of the human kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the snow in the sky is flying, but the valley of a hundred miles is obviously warm, the lake is still not frozen, and it is still slightly Warmth. It’s a strange thing that such a good piece of land has not yet been humanized. Perhaps the steep mountain walls, the harsh climate and the beasts in the virgin forests have blocked the human footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf of the brigade entered this valley, which seems to be specially prepared for the elves, and was stationed, but Rogge still refused to build a city here. Similar places have been found, but the most important thing about the new territory of the Elf is to be close enough to human society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most elite scouts of the Elves were sent out, over the mountains, jungles and rivers to understand the world around the valley. The Griffin warriors were asked to fly over the mountain ridges to see the distance of the Terran settlement. If possible, grab a few more live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After many days of scouting, and secretly caught a few hunters and cowards, Rogge finally figured out the surrounding situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, there are more than ten small ethnic groups in the mountains, the largest square is only 100,000 square kilometers, and the population is five million. Small but with hundreds of thousands of people, the local area is several thousand square kilometers. Most Principal rulers have a relatively long family history. Rogge learned from the History of the Big 6 that these countries were formed in the era of the Great Expedition of the Guangming Church during the second miracle of the year. On that expedition, the church believers finally defeated the barbarian in the northern prairie and plateau, forming the largest military empire: the Asrofik Empire. Some great adventurers, great aristocrats and church knights are reluctant to return to the south, and more than a dozen small principalities have been established near the central mountain range, forming a political pattern for the small countries in the north. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a hundred years later, a strange religion rose in Asrofic, and their strength expanded rapidly, expelling the power of the Church of Light, almost occupying Asro Fick's entire territory. The Church of Light has organized three expeditions, but they all lost in the face of the mighty Asrofik Empire. However, many of the defeated soldiers of the three expeditions have remained in the small countries of the north, making them strong. Most of these small country-opening nationals were comrades-in-arms who fought side by side in the same year, and they maintained close ties through marriage. Whenever Astrafik wants to swallow this fat, because of the fear of being ruled by the infidels, the small countries are united and desperate. After several battles in which both sides suffered heavy losses, Astrafik finally put aside his thoughts on this fat. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of small countries, the ancient and elegant hereditary aristocratic system, the land is sparsely populated, the folk style is strong and simple, this is the settlement of Rogge's ideal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ‘Longevity Tree’ tribe, which specializes in architecture, has designed the wisdom of the whole family. After ten days of design, it finally came up with a plan for an elf city. After the Sara people's artistic beauty and the dark moons complemented their military functions, the city's plan was settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning three days later, after paying homage to Hilo, the three elves sacrificed three golden elves to the lake. The quiet lake immediately rolled up violently. At noon, three verdant treetops poked their heads out of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves have continued to grow with the naked eye, and after two days they have grown into giant trees of up to tens of meters. The three elves are growing together, and the raging magic is stirring in the valley, making the lake bluer, the grass greener, and even the snow and ice that originally covered it melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole valley suddenly became a beautiful place for the four seasons like spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, countless vines grew wildly under the urging of elf rituals and magicians, forming a layer of vines on the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day, the tree wall began to build around the small lake, encircling a large open space on the lake, initially forming a silhouette of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sixth day, at the heart of the lake, surrounded by three ancient elves, a small-scale elf temple and elders were built, and there is a building next to the temple and the elders: the temple of God. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the seventh day, the Griffin rested at the peak, and the Shadow Devil crouched in the valley. All the beasts have found their own habitat. Only the emperor of the Darkmoon tribe died because they did not adapt to the cold northern climate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth day. The miracle of an elf city has been formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole city is mostly built on the shore of the lake. The small half is on the top of Bihu Lake. It overlooks from a high altitude, such as a huge green elliptical goose. Bihu is like a curved long and thin crescent moon, holding the elf city softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you have to do now is wait and wait for the city to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the valley of the valley surrounded by the snow-capped peaks, three ancient trees that existed as the mythological era have been pulled up from the lake, straight into the clouds Oh, the blossoming white clouds drifted over the treetops. Like a fairy-tale city, half of it falls on the shore, half of it is on the lake, lush and lively. The four wild birds are fragrant, green grass, and there is no trace of the northern winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city was finally named ‘God City’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this paradise on earth, Rogge and elder elders are frowning. This glorious scene in front of the eyes relies on the magical support of the three elves of ancient trees, which is by no means a long-term solution. The current city size is just enough to hold the elves of the four tribes, but the magic of the three elves is not able to support such a big city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate in the northern countries is cold, and the elves are hard to adapt to such severe cold. The magic of the ancient trees of the elves is spent on regulating the climate of the entire valley. Rogge himself is also a magician. During this time, he has been learning natural magic with the elf rituals, and he can also appreciate the magic of the elves. The magical regeneration of the elves' ancient trees is far from the extent of consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man knows that in three months, the three elves will be withered by the magic. At that time, the cold winter had not passed, and the days of the elves could be sad. It is imperative that the entire Elf be run immediately, find new sources of magic, and support the three elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the establishment of the City of God, Rogge secretly summoned all elder elders to discuss the crisis and discuss where the elves will go in the future. The elder elders spent their entire lives in the forest, and they deal very little with the Terran. In this respect, it is natural that Rogge is a vision, and Rogge is also doing his part. With the help of the elders of Xius, he took the opportunity to monopolize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man knows deeply that in this troubled world, whoever masters the army has the power to grasp the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has compiled the elite warrior of the Elf to a standing army of 800 people, including the 200 killers of the Darkmoon tribe. In the other tribes, two hundred elf archers, two hundred swordsmen, two hundred elf knights, and ten magicians were selected. This elf army was on the way to the north, and was forced by Rogge. Everyone was stained with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adult elves are almost all warriors, and Rogge estimates roughly, if in an emergency, there are five thousand elf warriors available for him to call. This is a very terrible force, but the elves have a lot of war habits that need to be changed. In addition to the blood-stained eight hundred elves, Rogge does not trust the combat power of ordinary elf warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty has accumulated a wealth of leading experience and 'combat' experience while commanding the Dragon and the Beauty Knight. At the same time, the dragon and the beautiful knights also let him absorb a lot of blood. There are enough lessons. Now surrounded by small ethnic groups, only with these eight hundred elf warriors, Rogge has the confidence to make a fuss. At least, this collection of four elite elves, all elite troops, at least one hundred elves are equivalent to the level of the Golden Lion Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this elders meeting, Rogge’s greatest achievement was to gain full power in the war, and to arbitrarily mobilize the power of all elf warriors without going through the Presbyterian Church. . This power is terrible, but he also knows that the greater the power behind, the more responsibility he needs to carry. The cold eyes of Hughes seemed to be watching behind him all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes and Rogge made it very clear that the fat man can prefetch the pre-question in the elves, including any elves, including the wind butterfly, if Luo Looked at the grid, he will help Rogge. But the condition is that Rogge will try his best to plan for the entire elves, and let the elves go out of the millennium for nothing to show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next best thing, he also wants to find a way to smash the sinister old man of Xius. This matter needs to be considered from a long time. Androni is not there, he can't help killing a 16-level killer. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was in charge of Sellers, although there were several friends who shared their concerns, in order to take care of the food, clothing, and shelter of less than 1,000 people, several noble youths were also Tired and half dead. Now the elf city ‘the city of gods’ is more than ten times larger, and there is no advantage that Selesburg can communicate with other parts of the Bavarian Principality. This hard work has really ruined Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food and equipment are essential for a city to exhibit. The elves are proficient in natural magic, and the food is not for the time being. But to protect yourself, well-equipped is crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge assigned five hundred elves to explore the veins. At the same time, scouting nearby terrain to detect whether there is any fierce World of Warcraft living nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also set up a magic laboratory in the first time, and rushed all the elves’ dozen magicians into the study, using the ancient trees of the elves. Magic to carry out a wide range of offense and defense magic. This is crucial in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the three Elf Alchemists, two magical equipment responsible for the top quality, and the other, was forced to become a pharmacist by Rogge . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing the poor elf pharmacist is going to study is the poison, the most poisonous and fierce. This of course does not correspond to the rules of the elves, but Rogge told him that this is the spirit of Hilo. As for why God wants to study poison, it is not that these elves should know. As a believer, the poor elf pharmacist just obeys him as a god. The elves are naturally sensitive to plants, which is not a small advantage in refining poisons. Rogge does not expect this Elven alchemist to reach the level of Furoya, but as long as it can develop some chemicals that are easy to produce and suitable for large-scale use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the study of magic, Rogge also looked at the three elf sacrifices. Their magic is not weak, and it will be a good help to immerse themselves in the magic for a long time. Unexpectedly, the fat man's proposal for the next magic study was simply rejected by Zhao Wei. The proud elf female sacrifice pointed out to the fat man that they were serving the great god of Hilo instead of doing some boring magic research. The precious time of the sacrifices is to pray and study the teachings of Hilo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These words blocked Rogge’s face, and he wanted to say that he was more qualified to hide in the quiet room to shrine to Hilo. Oh. Later, I thought that this god is also impersonating, and I have to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s appearance is mediocre, and it’s ugly in the beautiful elves. The elves are ugly and beautiful, and the sacrifices are highly accustomed, so Zhao Zhao looked at Rogge's eyes and revealed a disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smiled, staring at the glamorous Zhao Yan, and wishing to catch her beautiful pointed ear twist, listen to her The painful groaning sound. He would like to see how long these arrogant and beautiful sacrifices can fight with themselves. Before leaving, he glanced at the beautiful and plump curves, the undulating chest and the hips, and secretly countless obscene thoughts in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranger can be an expert in weapons and equipment. He bluntly stipulated that in the future armor of all elves, if it is not used for magic symbols, no decoration will be allowed. The armor of all ordinary Elf warriors is in uniform format. Only Elf Warriors who have reached Level 10 or above are eligible to make minor modifications to the armor according to the characteristics of their martial arts. When this rule came out, the elves who loved the United States suddenly complained. But the fat man has the full support of the Presbyterian Church and does not listen to any objections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule that is widely reviled by the elves soon showed results. The light breastplate that used to require seven elf craftsmen to work for ten days, now only three craftsmen can do it for five days. The fat man's plan is to arm all the elf warriors to the teeth. The quality of the equipment is directly related to the combat effectiveness of the soldiers, especially for low-level fighters. Elf equipment is sophisticated, but the biggest problem in the past is that it does not produce energy. Each elf's equipment is different. Although it is beautiful, it does not help to form an overall combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is also worried about the low fertility of the elves. This means that after the soldiers are damaged, it is difficult to get supplements. One thousand four thousand elves, this group is implemented a little smaller. Because of this, Rogge only wants to cherish every elf warrior in his hand, only to use the fine equipment as much as possible to exchange the opportunity for the elf warriors to survive a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What worries him more is the great value of the entire elves. The value of the 14,000 Elf slaves will excite the monarchs of any country. Therefore, it is conceivable that once in contact with the human state, the elves must have a few evils to fight. Not only must we win, but we must also hurt the enemies of the crimes, in order to maintain the peace of the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has now gradually envisioned the future, and what he has to do now is to implement this huge concept step by step. During this time, the fat man handled the elf's eating and drinking Lazar, working day and night, almost lost a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Rogge understands how difficult it is to be a top person. How do you manage this tens of thousands of elves has become so tired, how do those who manage a city and a country come over? It is in this position that Rogge really has some understanding of Orphee's life, and he really knows that being an invincible commander is far more difficult than being an invincible knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A busy day, the city of the gods finally got on track. Everything can still satisfy Rogge. The only thing that makes him unhappy is that the deep feelings of Rumsfeld and Wind Butterfly are obviously beyond his expectations. Rogge used up threats and lure, and the stunning butterfly was unmoved. They did not obey Rogge's orders, but Rogge had no way to make Rumsfeld go to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld is a 14th-level Elf Swordsman. Without Androni, it is impossible for Rogge to kill him alone. It is not easy to send a 14th-level Elf Swordsman to death when performing a mission. This incident made Rogge hurt his brain. But there is nothing powerful in the vicinity of Warcraft, and there is no big orc tribe or something. Even if there is, then it will not be the first to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge once sent Rumsfeld to bring ten Elf warriors to the resurrection of the four wilderness. Then he called *** and wanted her to secretly kill the squad. According to Rogge’s estimation, the original strength of the *** is no less than the fifteenth-level warrior. Now he has swallowed the benefits of two angels, as well as the bone dragon, the flame bone demon and many of his men’s helpers. God unconsciously cleaned up the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, *** did not come, only Gregory. The bone dragon also only found a huge skull and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The owner said, she refused!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depressed fat man has no other way to think about it, only use the power in his hands, first to turn Rumsfeld away from the wind butterfly. Although he said that he had the full support of the Presbyterian Church, he also knew that things could not be done too much. If Ramsfeld grabbed the handle and ran to ask for a duel with himself, it would be a hassle. This kind of thing, *** is bound to be ignored, the flame bones and Gregory can combine to clean up this unsightly elf, but *** will not let go, Rogge is not a little bit grasped. It seems that Rumsfeld’s red-skinned sword knows that it is a magic sword. Although the fat man is as thick as Warcraft, he has no confidence to compete with this magic sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the armor reincarnation and the battle axe, Rogge is definitely not going to be singled out with any fighter. But fortunately, it seems that Wind Butterfly did not tell Rumsfeld about the day he was teasing her. The shy wind butterfly must be difficult to say about this matter? Rogge reminisced about the delicate touch of the wind butterfly, while laughing insidiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat this time to take advantage of his authority to get a very beautiful dark green body armor. The elf's craftsmanship is well-deserved. Although the protective body is far worse than the 'reincarnation', it can only be achieved without any special materials. It can only be said that it is the master's craft. What makes all the elves angry is that Rogge has made the Sarahs make a full set of gorgeous decorations for his armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge is in power and ignores these opposing voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, everything in the city of the gods is on the right track. After reporting all the things to the elder elders on this day, Rogge finally began the first step of pursuing his huge concept: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the fat idea of ​​the fat man is four words: random strain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to add four more words, that is, fish in troubled waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you still want to add, it is his best skill: the trend of inflammation, the struggle for power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Rumsfeld, a team of elf warriors guarded the elf smelting experts to explore the mountains in the east. Rogge pointed at the map with five fingers. Even if the elves are proficient in natural magic, it is absolutely efficient to detect the earth's veins, but such a vast area, no one month, this mine is absolutely inexhaustible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the rights in his hands to match Rumsfeld in disguise, Rogge felt a big sigh of relief and went on the road with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, the Elf Griffin Knights have scouted and understood that there is a small city of the Terran, Sayi, not far from the mountain. From afar, the size of the small town is not large, that is, the appearance of more than 10,000 people. There is no solid city defense, just a castle built on the hillside of the city. In the distance, there have been knights coming in and out. There is a small barracks in front of the castle, and the people entering and leaving are also sparse. According to the judges of the Elf Griffins, the training of these soldiers is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the description of the elves, Rogge initially estimated that there were more than a dozen knights in the castle, and less than one hundred infantry. It seems that this is the count of the count, and it is still not the kind of ambition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty think about it, it feels like this is a very good goal. Because of the cold weather, the small countries in the north are all local people, although individual fighters are powerful, but the number is insufficient, and the power is limited. Moreover, the personal combat power of the eight hundred elf warriors in Rogge’s hands is far stronger than the militia in these frontier areas. As for how to punish those little nobles, Rogge can have a solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four words of randomness are not just what anyone can say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man carries a bag of jewels from the genre treasure house, with the wind butterfly and five 12-level elf guardian warriors, let that Eight hundred elf warriors stand by in the mountains. All life-saving measures are ready, and Rogge is heading to the human territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sayi City is a plain, monotonous and boring town. In the winter of five months each year, the two things that residents of the small town can best spend time on are drinking and sleeping at home. Occasionally, young people will fight because of girls, which is simply a big event in the city. The people of the Northland are very refreshing, even if they have a bad nose and a swollen face during the day, they will be reconciled in the evening with a few large glasses of spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sayi City is close to the Central Mountain Range. There are no specialties, no wealth, and no hungry in the winter. The old lord Luck Earl is very generous to the people in the small town. His life is simple and he does not pay attention to the arranging. There are only a dozen knights under his command. The role is to defend the thieves who have never appeared before. As for the 200 infantry, they are usually farmers and cowards, and they only concentrate on training during the slack season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the winter, Sayi City is very quiet and comfortable. Although the sun has risen high, there are still few people on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of travellers broke the calm of the small town, and in this season, visitors and business travellers are very few. There are seven people in this team, and they are wearing a luxurious black cloak. They are a fat man with a face and a temper. The other six seem to be his followers, all wearing beautiful dark green cloaks, and their faces are hidden in deep cloak hats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious traveler immediately attracted the attention of residents in the small town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pedestrian path came to the largest pub in the small town, and the fat followers took the hat and immediately caused a commotion in the tavern. Although the special helmet blocked the ears of the elves, they could not hide their beauty. Only the wind butterfly is a half-faced helmet, covering the big half of the face, but the small mouth and chin are still beautiful and thrilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the pub also ran out. He looked at the style of this pedestrian, apparently a big man, so he told the maid to pick the best wine and ran attentively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This adult, are you coming to Sai City for the first time? Then you must try the whisky brewed in the store, which is already in the kiln. Twenty years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "Okay, let's take five bottles first. There is something good to cook. However, it must be light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was five bottles, and the boss immediately laughed. He eagerly told the maid to pick up the wine, for fear of Rogge's remorse. Then I smiled and asked to come over and ask: "Adult, look at your momentum, you must be a nobleman! How come you come to our city in this season? We have no special products here, nor is it a traffic artery? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub is now crowded with people, and when he hears Rogge, he suddenly talks. "Someone wants to summon demons? God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of demon, will it kill us?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the devil is going to sacrifice with a child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud voice suddenly sounded: "It’s just a rumor! Don’t be so Panic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall young man came out and stood in front of Rogge and others. He was born with a bit of momentum and his face was arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Ketu, the captain of the warrior under the count of Luck. This adult, although you are a guest, I still want to pay attention to you. The words and deeds! Someone in the city of Sayi summons the demon, this is by no means a trivial matter! Do you have any evidence? If you can't convince me, then let me explain it to the military camp! The crime of confusing the public is to whipping thirty. Next! You must follow along with these entourages!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keto tried to pretend to be majestic, while his eyes involuntarily sneaked at several elf women warrior. Obviously, he is more concerned that these elves have taken a look with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and whispered with the wind butterfly, and did not see Ketu this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice in the surrounding crowd screamed: "Keto! Put away your tricks! It looks like this gentleman is a big man, if you offend He, your brother who is a knight can't even cover you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ketu was squeezed by the man, and immediately could not get off the stage. He suddenly pulled out the short sword and inserted it on the table in front of Rogge and said, "I said, you guys are very suspicious to take a trip with me! Laozi is a five-level swordsman, don't give me any bad ideas! ***, are you fat pig ears smashed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly was lifted, but was pressed by Rogge and touched her hand. A few. This is cheaper and always takes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge extended his left hand and smiled and said: "It turns out that you have already become a five-level vindictive. It is really disrespectful. Look, what is strange about my hand? Is there a place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s hand is slowly moving in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ketu left and right, in addition to the meat more, I really can't see the fat hand this point is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knew it right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of dazzling electro-optic lights illuminate in the hands of Rogge, the people in the pub are white, nothing can be seen, followed by Ketu screamed and filled the entire pub with a scorching smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone’s vision recovered, Ketu’s upper body was black and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who suddenly called: “It’s magic! He’s a magician!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The pub immediately boils! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary people, the magician is an extremely powerful and mysterious figure. In the hundreds of years of the city of Sayi, there are only ten magicians who have been there. The people in the pub pushed each other and rushed to the front to see the traces of the magic and see the real magician. People are extremely excited, and many people have figured out how to brag about their wife or lover. Magician! What is the concept of a magician? Think about it, Ketu has always been rampant in the city of Sayi, but it was stunned by this magician with a magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people have regretted not seeing how Rogge casts magic. The owner of the pub was so happy that he had to faint. He had decided to change the signboard of the pub to a pub where the magician had stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat is very happy with this effect. He picked up the glass and poured the iced wine onto Ketu's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah!" Ketu took a chill and woke up. Soon, he learned from the loud talk of the people around him what he had just born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
