			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not in a hurry to move forward, and his leisurely eyes are on the front, as if he has not noticed that there is such a mysterious knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you have improved." The Cavaliers applauded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spiritual fluctuations are erratic, if not, even if Gregory is present, there is no way to intercept it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is completely different on the surface, but the spiritual fluctuations of communication with the Cavaliers are beginning to become high and low, trying to imitate the knight, but more knight There is obviously still a considerable gap in the realm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Macbeth, your appearance has changed a lot! It seems that your strength is more of my understanding. What happened? You Did you beat O'Reilly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbec has no choice but to smile? You also saw that I didn't even have the courage to fight with her. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a moment, then said bitterly and proudly: "...the end of the situation, that is, my failure, also It can be said that my victory! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s mental strength suddenly rose, then slowly fell, and between the ups and downs, he had already seen through Macbeth’s fascinating light golden flame. The true meaning behind it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he understood many things and said: "Congratulations to Macbeth! You already know how to use the power of faith. However, although this power feels very powerful, what role does it have? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth was silent for a long time before he sighed: "Faith is the glory of God." The power of faith should only belong to the realm of God. If you have enough power of faith... then mortals may also create a godhead from nothingness and become a new god! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s heart was shocked and immediately a joy. Carefully said: "Macbee, forgive me to ask, you do this... it is necessary Not allowed by the heavens? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe's smile is more bitter, but there is also a pride that cannot be concealed: "Yes." I have fallen. "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth sighed and continued: "Olympus is really the perfect angel of light. She knows how to use the weakness of the enemy. The power to lure me! Seal God..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then my redemption..." Rogge continued to test.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Macbeth snorted this most hypocritical letter-breaker, redemption? Only the eternal burning purgatory is the place for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled Macbeth is still in heaven, and I certainly want to be redeemed. But now that you have become a fallen angel, then I am willing to live forever in the fire of purgatory. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden light that makes up Macbeth's body is slightly beating, and his heart is an accident, and some are moved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Rogge asked: "Macbee, you come to me, I think there must be something else? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth nodded and cleaned up the matter here, and returned to the North as soon as possible. The secular power of the hegemony is a passing sight, only the spread of faith It is really important to increase the number of believers. Because of the religious war, the number of believers in the eye of wisdom has recently been very slow. If you think about O'Reilly, you should first solve those obstacles that hinder the wisdom of the North. Talent is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asks: "Adult, is it... Are you also drawing strength from the believers of the Eye of Wisdom?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth shook his head and only needed a little faith to understand what it was. The next thing, I can completely explore it myself. The power of O'Reilly is unmatched, and the art of using power is close to the peak, but if you understand the field of the gods. I don't necessarily miss her much. I don't need to ask for the power of faith in the Eye of Wisdom. What's more, it is really too little. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly remembered how many things about the heavens had not been set out from Macbeth. So: "Macbeth, now that you have become Fallen angels, can you give me a detailed explanation of the heavens, especially about the light of judgment? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, you said that there is also an angel MGM who is coming with you at the same time. What are your duties in heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We The only duty is to sing the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still in the air, Macbeth has turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While his golden figure is gradually dissipating, Macbeth suddenly turned back to the feelings of the world and still do not understand. But I think, you should find a way to go to the floating city once. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has not yet risen to the horizon, the twilight has not completely receded, the rays of light are flowing, and the bright blue sky is stained with a delightful carmine.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at the sky and thought about Macbeth’s words without a word. He suddenly eagerly wanted to return to Tiffany. At this moment, the floating city still stays there. In the sky, there is no reason for this urgency. It is purely an instinct from the heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge took a deep breath, raised his right hand, attacked immediately Before the policy, he turned to the front and slammed his hand and said: "Transfer, plus. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the urging of Rogge, thousands of light rides speeded up the progress and arrived at Crawford at noon.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crawford is on the side of the mountain, the right side is the forest, the scale is very small, and even can not be called the town, at most it is a large village. She has not yet completed, from the highway to the gram The road to Laofu can be seen as a new pad of soil, with a large pile of logs and stones piled up on both sides of the road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crawford is located on the three roads At the meeting point, the position is very strong. However, perhaps the Hailar people do not want to be too irritating to the Asrofic Empire, Crawford is built according to the size and configuration of the commercial town. Originally in this Warcraft and thieves group Once and for all, it should be built according to the plan of the military fortress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nearly a thousand craftsmen and coolies in Crawford, and hundreds of Hailar hires. Army. When they saw the empire iron ride from the other side of the road like a tide, the face It became pale.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crawford suddenly became a mess.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries quickly grabbed His own weapons. He was busy looking for a partner. He rushed to Crawford's only completely built central small square, forming a defensive formation in three or five groups. The craftsman stopped his words and fled into the back. The woods, if you can't run away, retreat to the unfinished building, stick to the wall roots, and hold your head with your hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire of the empire is in an orderly manner Shape, slowly advancing. They are not the most elite tidal light cavalry. After the long-distance attack, the soldiers not only did not have the slightest fatigue, but the sweat mixed with the dusty face revealed a wild sly, it seems to have put the Hailar in front. It is regarded as a hearty and delicious lunch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encirclement of the Imperial Iron Rider has been completed, and the archers of the Hailar mercenary are not ready to take the lead even if the arrow is already on the line. Attack. They just looked at the two flags flying in the wind. The bloody double flag that hunted in the cold wind!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empire Iron Rider remained silent from beginning to end. The oppressive atmosphere enveloped the audience, like an invisible hand to put This new town was crushed into powder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a middle-aged man dressed as a Hailar mercenary leader stood up, "Astrofic Empire..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reached out and the flag bearer behind him immediately handed a bloody battle flag decorated with Rogge's coat of arms to his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man exhaled and shouted. The bloody battle flag screamed at the wind and thunder and flew to the man. Screaming and screaming through the sky, the flagpole passed through the chest, and the momentum was not reduced. The man’s body was deeply inserted into the bluestone paved in the square! The blood quickly formed a shallow rise on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From now on, this is the territory of the Asrofic Empire!" Rogge shouted, his voice was not high, but it was rumbled. It was spread throughout Crawford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly turned the horse's head and galloped in the direction of Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Haier people looked at the bloody battle flag that fluttered in the wind, and all of them were gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge became more and more anxious, and led thousands of sprinters to sprint one day and one night. Later, even the elite cavalry of the Chaoshan Legion supported it. Living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger simply opened the brigade and fled to Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war horse has already been exhausted on the road, the fat man greeted the cold wind blowing like a knife, and the heavy snow on the sky, just like the day when he rushed to the city of the gods. . Only the last one was streaking, this time he was finally able to keep his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his feelings of madness are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he rushed to the city of the gods, he thought about the little fairies that charmed all living beings, and his heart was full of joy. This time, every moment of time, his heart is even heavier. Rogge couldn't call ***, nor could he find Macbeth. He only knew that the city of floating still stayed in the sky of Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, he suddenly remembered the *** of the world of death. If it wasn't for him to wake up early, maybe *** has forever been part of the grey sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge doesn't know why he will connect these two things unreasonably. He was frightened by the fear of no cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not alone. From the beginning to the end, Mei was biting his teeth and following him. In the two days and two nights of rushing, there was no half step behind. However, her face is gradually pale and her lips have turned into a dead gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Rogge, who is looking at Tiffany’s direction, didn’t notice this, and the attack did not say anything, just follow Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning, Rogge had let her stay, followed the army back to Tiffany. But Rose said nothing, she just said that as an adjutant of Rogge, he should follow him all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After crossing a mountain, Mei finally fell silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stopped suddenly and turned back to help Rose. Her face showed a lifeless grayish white, but her body was very hot, and it seemed to be very ill. Rogge did not move, just watching Rose quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the rose is getting hotter and hotter, and the breath is getting weaker, and life is moving away from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally sighed and picked up the rose. Looking around for a while, I quickly found a sheltered cave, placed her inside, and gave birth to a bunch of bonfires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge puts the unconscious rose on the side of the fire and begins to close his eyes. For a long time, he opened his eyes. With a slight spell, Rose's body has already illuminated the light of healing. However, the healing effect of the treatment is good, and the treatment is not good. Moreover, Rogge casts a therapeutic treatment with a sacred power that is temporarily converted, and a further discount is required. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a few treatments, Rose still woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t help but say to me, why is it hard to ring? Rogge was the first time to talk to Mei with a pleasant color.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merma struggled to sit up, but immediately felt a whirlwind and fell down. The fingertips bounced, and several magical flames were thrown into the campfire, which made the fire burn more. Until this time he remembered. He could not eat or drink for a long time, it seems that it is difficult for others to do this. At least Mei has not eaten for two days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flew out of the hole, and in a twinkling of an eye, he returned to a deer and grilled it directly on the fire. Rogge was too slow to roast, his fingers flicked, and the body of the deer suddenly rose and shrank. It turned out to be a tiny fireball that exploded in the deer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking at Roger's hustle and bustle, Mei finally couldn't help but laugh out loud. She was always cold and iceberg, and suddenly she smiled at the moment, under the cover of the bonfire, she was not glamorous. , silk rags, clothes and messy, do not have a pitiful taste.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei's face was slightly red, and then maybe she couldn't control her emotions in her illness. There were two lines of tears in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Rogge asked, a little more concern in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May bit his lower lip, shake his head hard, then wipe the tears away. But the more she wipes, the more tears she has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wrath of the sky... is it dead?" Rose finally whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silently looked at the beating bonfire, then faintly said: "Yes, I personally killed him."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May covered his mouth with one hand, tears poured out like a spring, choked and said: It is the wrath of the sky to raise the **. I think... you have already noticed it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighs, why do you want to say this, do you want revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I want to avenge the wrath of the sky! But... I can't do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was a little surprised and looked up at Rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rightly sighed for the understanding of nature, our Druid is also very proficient in using poison. But I can't...use them on you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her palm has two short blades of ten centimeters long, and the blue light flashing on the blade edge is obviously poisonous. Refers to the bounce, the short blade draws two blue trajectories, falls into the bonfire, and emerges two beautiful blue smoke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The body leaned against Rogge, and the beautiful eyes were still shining with tears. She suddenly plunged into Rogge's arms and said lowly: "Rogge, hug me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was taken aback, he was the first to see the other side of this cold, rigorous and sultry rose.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger took a photo of Mei’s back and lifted her up, then smiled: When I am sick, I will always be particularly vulnerable. When you are sick, everything will be fine. Obedient, now go to sleep honestly. It will be good to wake up and wake up. I should meditate now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose looked up and looked Rogge bites his teeth: "Rogge I should know ... Why can not you start it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Roger smiled and I think I know, but everything up to say hello and so on, okay? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May whispered: "But the beauty around you is like a cloud, and where is my position?" I don't want to ask for anything else, just..." She bit her teeth and finally squeezed out what she wanted to say: "Just do it once!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly felt a little strange. He thought it was clear that he had only awkward eyes and no love at all. His heart was slightly sneer." The physical condition of Mei is invisible under the scan of his mental power. Her vindictiveness has long been consumed, and she is in serious illness, and she has not eaten anything. Even those who are strong in the sanctuary, in this state, do not I want to count the Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the rose is poisonous. But Rogge’s body is now more resistant to the dragon than the dragon poison in the hands of Froya. Other poisons are in the eyes of fat people, and there is not much difference with mosquito bites.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach sighs, sighs can’t tell the sadness and unwillingness She fell on the back of Rogge, seemingly very sad, and then gently said: "I'm sorry, Rogge adults. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly felt that the back of the neck was numb, and then the body was stiff and could no longer move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rose retracted the fiber around the back of Rogge, and the nail on her index finger was still stained with some blood. Under the mapping of the fire, the nail was floating on an unimaginable precision magic array. With the magic array When Roger's body is locked by countless chains, the stiffness is getting deeper and deeper, but the feelings of other parts of the body are completely preserved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The soul is imprisoned? Rogge’s eyes were cold, and he sneered: “It turns out that your real card is this magic! Although I don't think it is a good idea to use the soul to imprison. But the only way, can you deceive me? But I have to see how long you can support! Even the wrath of the sky is in my hands, just because you want to kill me? I can't move now, you come to kill me! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no fierceness in the eyes of Rose. Some are just mourning, and I can see that Rogge’s heart is slightly shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose slowly opened Rogge’s robes, reached into it and untied his belt a little bit, and her face was obviously struggling. But in the end, he made up his mind, slowly lowered his head, his face close to his lower body, slowly groaning over Rogge's weapon. Her movements are extremely green, but with a strange rhythm that fits the deepest instinct of Rogge's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May use the teeth to bite the last layer of obstacles, and the mouth contains the hot. The snoring sounded from the mouth of Rose and Rogge at the same time. The tail of the rose trembled, and the sparkling liquid oozes out along the corner of the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted, only to feel a hot air rushing to the brain, a low humming sound in his ears. There is a hot stream under the lower abdomen, and the violent pulsating dragon head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May propped up and slowly untied his clothes, biting his teeth and sitting on Rogge. Her face suddenly became pale, and she rushed, but she immediately bit her right fist. The left hand was unable to press Rogge's shoulder, but she could not support it, softly leaned against his chest, and then closed. The eyes, tears and silent flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of blue water oozes from the body of the rose, blends with the red, dazzling blood, and then travels intimately from the two After that, it eventually disappeared into the power of the wrath of the natural goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the gods began to swell, the body was soft, and they were on the body of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rogge is still not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire was nearly extinguished at this time, and the cold wind screamed into the cave. The low temperature has no effect on Rogge, but it is enough to take away the whole body temperature of Rose. It’s just that she didn’t know why, she didn’t escape, she just fell on Rogge and waited quietly for the moment when the blood was cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly sighed softly. The effective time of this magic is shorter than what you expected! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly shouted, his eyes were all silver!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A string of strings The flashing magic symbol was forced out of Rogge's body, and then it was blown into a beautiful and beautiful fireworks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog stood up and held the rose in one hand. The neck, she picked her up and shouted: "You want to die after casting, let the soul dissipate, I am afraid it is not so easy. If you commit suicide, the soul can't escape my hand." what? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did Rose smile? I gave it to you and then wanted to die. That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned. He just felt that an inexplicable force was passed from the body of the rose, but he repeatedly probed the whole body up and down, and could not see any abnormalities at all. Even the wrath of the natural goddess was quietly crouching. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is thinking hard. Although his magic is not high, but the magic of knowledge and accomplishment is no small matter, no matter what kind of magic effect is difficult to escape his exploration. But this time, he couldn't even find a trace of magic or other strange forces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at the eyes of Mary that had no life, that was the heart of death, the eyes of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that she said that she gave her body and then wanted to die, so that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge never believes. He waved his hand and applied several treatments to Rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faintly said: Since I dare to do it right with me, I must have thought it clearly beforehand. It is not so easy for people who fall into my hands to die. But you can rest assured that no matter what you have just done, I will understand it sooner or later. By the way, seeing that you have followed me for a while, I advise you to survive and live well. How painful the torture is, it is better to struggle in the flame of death. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not willing to delay the time. He will pick up the rose, jump out of the cave, and rush to Tiffany.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
