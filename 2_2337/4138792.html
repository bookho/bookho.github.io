			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter III Dusk<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small town two mile from the Wright Fortress, 50,000 Layton The army of the kingdom is stationed there. After several days of rest, the wounded soldiers have been escorted back to the Leiden Kingdom to recuperate, and the broken sword armor has also been repaired. These warriors who have fought in battle have restored their military posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, King Romon’s mood is very low at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All important generals are sitting quietly. Just now they have finished saying what they said. All they can do now is to wait for Romon to make a decision. Perhaps waiting for the anger of the old king, may be waiting for Luomen's awakening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king’s eyes are full of bloodshot eyes, staring at the two battle reports in front of him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is Rogge’s newspaper article, saying that he has already defeated the Astrofiks with the coalition forces and is now pursuing it. The rear reinforcements can be slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another battle report came from the front line of the coalition forces, claiming that Rogge colluded with the Astrofiks, refused to assist the troops, and had already broken the coalition’s retreat. The coalition forces have now retreated to the Pancala Valley, and there are not many surpluses. Please ask the Holy Alliance reinforcements to reopen the supply line of the Wright Fortress. At this moment, the coalition forces are not the Duke of Dolly, but the Poseidon’s Poseidon Corps and Rockefeller’s Storm Masters. Please be careful with the Holy Alliance reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition’s battle report was that the city of Levi was eagerly sent to the hands of King Romon, almost at the same time as Rogge’s good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two battle reports have been compared and what happened on the front line is actually self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Romon still looked at the two battle reports repeatedly and repeatedly. The old king’s heart was in chaos, and he only hoped that it was not true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this amazing fact, all the generals have already expressed their views. The slightly experienced generals understood that the most important thing in front was to attack the Kleite Fortress and then rescue the 50,000 coalition forces trapped in the valley. Pompeii’s Poseidon Corps’s fighting power is terrible, but it has not yet reached the point of invincibility in the world. This is not enough for the generals of the Leiden Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge can have today’s power to be able to make a sword-and-throat betrayal at a critical time, for a great reason to have King Romon support. The old king’s support for Rogge is also derived from his love for Iker. Many of the rebellious generals in the Kingdom of Layton finally seized the opportunity and attacked Ikerel in a desperate manner. They strongly urged the old king to drive her out of the palace, or to execute, at least to become a slave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king knows very well what it means if he attacks the Wright Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of elves in the Wright Fortress now. These elves will surely follow Rogge and fight the army that attacked the Wright Fortress!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you really want to start with the elf? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Icelle’s sad face always swayed in front of Romon’s eyes and could not be lingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the old king raised his head, his voice was completely hoarse, and he said with great difficulty: "They have decided! We are now..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and used all his strength to get the last few words: "Enter the Wright Fortress!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most generals are relieved, only the head of the Emmaus is slightly wrinkled. Clark stood behind the marshal, and he also captured the marshal's sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a sudden pace of footsteps is far and near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the conference room was suddenly pushed open, and the king’s personal guards ignored the generals’ blame for his rude gaze and rushed to the front of King Romon. In the urgent report, I hurried: "Your Majesty! It is the most urgent message from Wang Cheng!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king fell into his chair and buried his face in his hand in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now every decision is so difficult for him, so cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which choice, he will let him fall into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Romon raised his head. In an instant, he seemed to be ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king’s gaze swept the generals who had attacked Ikerel one by one, and suddenly threw the urgent report to the generals, roaring Road: "Now you are satisfied!! Give me a horse! I want to go back to Wangcheng! From now on, the army is commanded by Marshal Erams!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romon watched Arams, meaning profoundly: "We grew up together, I believe in any decisions you make."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arams Standing up, talking and stopping, just sighed secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old king’s figure went out of the meeting room like a wind, and the hooves in the blink of an eye went all the way. The guardian remembered that the old king had no protection on the road and hurriedly chased it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, the emergency report slowly fell from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a very simple line: "Ikerel commits suicide and falls dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams looked at the door slyly, and only came back for a long time, and all the generals’ eyes fell on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams slowly raised his hand and then waved and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Into the Wright Fortress!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the Wright Fortress is getting more and more tense, and the new recruits of the Principality of Are are urging the sergeant Nothing to repair the fortifications. Nearly 10,000 soldiers kept digging the trench in front of the city wall, and a bag of earth and stone was transported to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s easy to reinforce a thin fortress in just a few days? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is uneasy from the early morning. The crystal plate that was connected with Ikerel suddenly broke, leaving his heart a shadow. He immediately ordered that all the soldiers immediately divided into three classes, taking turns to strengthen the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, Rogge’s unpredictable hunch finally came true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reconnaissance cavalry of the coalition began to appear around the Wright Fortress 66. Obviously, the Holy Alliance already knows the facts of Rogge’s betrayal and is very aware of the importance of the Wright Fortress. Following these detectives, it is the army of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don’t know if the army of the Layton Kingdom will appear in front of the Wright Fortress. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Rogge’s prediction, the coalition retreating in the Pancala Valley was at least five days old. Can he hold the fortress for five days? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of reconnaissance cavalry, that is, the dark side of the moon can only kill a small part of it, and it cannot prevent the reconnaissance cavalry from passing back the wit of the Wright Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it all, Rogge, standing in the city, smiled coldly. Wait until tomorrow, what will appear in front of the coalition forces will be a brand new fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, the killer of the dark side of the moon finally brought back a message that made Rogge laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of the Layton Kingdom is marching into the Wright Fortress and is expected to arrive at the Wright Fortress at dusk tomorrow. In the direction of the city of Levi, the 20,000-strong reserve army of the coalition forces also opened to the fortress. It is expected that the army will arrive at the fortress earlier than the army of the Layton Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes Rogge see the bright light in the dark is that from the banner, the current commander of the Layton army is Marshal Alams, not King Romon, things are not all turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She completed the task, and although this did not completely prevent the Layton army, Rogge knew that she had tried her best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning that the two armies were all coming to the fortress, Rogge called an elf guardian warrior and told him: "Notify our engineering team, press Planned action!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, a team of soldiers unloaded countless squares of wood from the rigorous heavy-duty wagon Boxes, buried them under the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of elves came under the wall, and they directed the Aray soldiers to pour a bucket of water into a place where wooden boxes were buried. Not long after, countless green shoots broke out. Under the control of the elves, these green shoots quickly grew taller and thicker and became vines that spread over the walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves of the original Changsheng Tree tribe continually urged the soldiers to add water. Indeed, the growth of these vines is really too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours later, the vines have covered the entire wall. The sounds urged by the elves are even bigger. With a bucket of water pouring down, the vines no longer extend to the heights, but gradually thicken, and they are coiled together, twisted, entangled, filled with each other. The gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was dawn, the entire Wright Fortress had put on a thick, sturdy coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are extremely tired, but they still insist. Although the Alei soldiers can't wait to fall asleep in the same place immediately, they know that they have embarked on a road of no return. At this moment, they have worked harder. After the war begins, they will have more hope of living. So they still glared at the red eyes, still moving the difficult steps, dragging a bucket of water from under the carriage, then dragging it under the wall and pouring it in the designated position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is already bright, and the vines that cover the walls are already one meter thick. Under the control of the elves, they are no longer thickened, but the color gradually becomes darker, gradually turning from dark green to dark brown, and becoming harder and harder, and at the end it is harder than iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day was bright, a Tikton warrior took a giant axe and chopped it off a giant vine with a diameter of nearly twenty centimeters. When the sound was loud, the axe almost cut the giant vine into two segments, but the tomahawk that had been magically blessed also had a full roll and the handle of the axe was twisted. The tall Tikton warrior was pale and apparently suffered a bit of injury after a severe earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves nodded with satisfaction. Although this level of hardness is not comparable to real stone, it is enough to deal with the heavy infantry of the Terran. The unique elasticity of the winding vines is a good protection for the siege equipment such as the trebuchet and the hitwood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final work started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vines began to produce a single protrusion, slowly, a sharp tip of a long ruler formed. The color of the vines began to turn into a fairy blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves began to drink the water-stricken Are soldiers who were careful not to encounter these horrible spikes. But there are still a few soldiers who are too tired, their feet are vain, and they fall on the vines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the wounds they were pierced were not fatal, the soldiers quickly twitched and fell to the ground, and the skin turned into a strange blue-violet. The foam of the mouth continued to rise, and in a blink of an eye, it was poisoned and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the elves explained that not all spikes are poisonous, although they look exactly the same. But the Aray soldiers were careful to avoid these spikes. After all, even these elves don't know which thorn is poisonous. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, these soldiers are now in the city do not know when there have been three tens of meters high huge elf war ancient trees. The canopy of the old tree is like a natural arrow, enough to overlook the entire battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most leisurely and unharmonious person in a busy fortress at the moment is Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried about the progress of the game at all, and he said to Rogge that there is no top-ranking power in the Holy Alliance, even if the war is unfavorable, at least Rogge can still run away. The most is to drop tens of thousands of soldiers no matter what. With his old man, Rogge doesn't have to worry about being assassinated by the Holy Alliance's assassin or a special elf on the way to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the death class that has always been a ghost, it has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, the smoky smoke began to emerge from all the woods around the fortress. Rogge sent thousands of soldiers to set fire to the forest early in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition forces that arrived in the fire did not carry large siege equipment for their convenience. At this moment, Rogge counts the time, and a fire points to the nearby woods. Although it can't stop the coalition from finding wood-making equipment, it always creates trouble for them. Moreover, once the forest fire is burned up, it is not arbitrarily extinguishable. At that time, there are several fire obstacles behind the coalition forces. Any force transfer will bring great inconvenience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After setting fire to the forest, all the faces of the elves are very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near dusk, 20,000 reserve troops and 50,000 Layton troops came to the fortress of Wright. For a time, all the soldiers were taken aback!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the Wright Fortress in their memory!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wright Fortress at this moment has completely disappeared from the ruined scene of the past, but turned into a behemoth with a shimmering blue, purple, and horrible thorns, smirking Looking at the coalition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams led the generals to the front and carefully observed the new Wright Fortress until the sky was dark, and this was a gloomy command. I rushed to attack the city equipment overnight, and attacked the city the next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment all the coalition soldiers are in a very heavy mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the Wright Fortress, who suddenly put on the thick armor and gave birth to barbs, although they still have the confidence to break it, no one knows how many will be needed now. The body can be used to complement a road leading to the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the night when the hurricane blows and there is no moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the night, a knight sneaked to the Wright Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fortress is still a kilometer away, he was immediately shot down by several black shadows that suddenly appeared. The black shadows were very clean and neat, and the knight was tied up in a moment, and then he rushed to the fortress with him. Looking at their delicate figure, I can't imagine a knight carrying such a heavy weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the knight sat in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Clark, long time no see." Rogge smiled and greeted. Although facing the tens of thousands of troops under the city, Rogge could not see any tension on his face. Clark watched Rogge for a while, and he really couldn’t think of the fat man he had been looking down on in the past. In a short period of time, he actually had the ability to hold it. The throat of the entire Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My uncle wants to see you alone. Time is half an hour later, see you under the fortress city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Marshal Arams? He is not afraid that I kidnapped him and created some confusion for the Layton army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Uncle said, You won't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled! Time is almost the same, let's go out of town!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fortress of Wright, Arams has only been there with a few of the most accommodating followers. Rogge only brought Androni. There has not been a sacred alliance yet. The sanctuary is strong, so no one is her opponent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many days, Marshal Elams appears to be thinner and more severe. He asked directly: "Master Rogge, my army is already under the city. Where do you want to go?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "You also saw the current Wright Fortress, I have the confidence to keep it for five days." Now I should ask you, where do you want to go between the country and the family? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roghaha smiled and told you something. I have a bow of the Elf King in my hand, dozens of Hell bursting magic arrows, and a shooter who can shoot these arrows out of the 1500 meters. How many siege machines do you think you want to make? Or do you plan to attack the city without siege equipment? What's more, even if you attack the Wright Fortress, it will be good for your 50,000 army to have 20,000 left. With these two thousand people, can you rescue the besieged coalition forces from Pompei’s Poseidon Corps? "[[ /> /> </ /> </ br> "" So!" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arams was silent for a moment before slowly saying: "After the demise of the Holy Alliance, the Astrofiks will not let you go." You don't think you can enjoy the fat under the watchful eyes of this wolf? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "Of course not." So I hope that you can give up attacking the Wright Fortress. Only the people of Layton’s army are intact, and Astrafik’s talents are not arrogant. If we fight for both sides, what else would we take to stop the army of Astrafik, and what should we bargain with them? Is a crown more important than the survival of all the nobles of Layton? Or is it more noble, is it really more important than the lives of countless soldiers and civilians? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alams snorted and said slowly: "So, Astrofic, or what are your conditions?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple. Dividing the Holy Alliance into three, Livi was merged into Layton, Latvia was merged into the Principality of Aray, and the rest of the land was placed under the jurisdiction of the Empire. Layton and Alei swear allegiance to Feuerbach, and thus became the empire of the Empire and merged into the Empire. Layton wants to cancel the title of the royal family and become a duchy. The rulers of our two countries will receive the prince’s seal through the marriage with the emperor. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams pondered for a moment, and said: "And let me think about it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alright!" Rogge replied cheerfully: "I think the next morning, I can see the results of your consideration." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Marshal turned the horse back and walked to the big camp.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned back: "Rogge, the Holy Alliance is not a piece of fat, but a bone that is extremely hard. If you eat too fast, it will pierce your stomach." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Marshal Arams, it will pierce the stomach of the Astrofic. So you have to think about my proposal. Although this bone is hard enough, it can make it a few more thorns, always good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old marshal did not say anything more, he silently followed the entourage and disappeared into the night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the following day, the soldiers in the Wright Fortress took time to rest. The soldiers outside the fortress smashed the siege equipment in the smoke and the fire. Especially the reserve soldiers of the coalition were almost desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the protection of a thousand reserve soldiers, several newly-built Petrified Rocks approached a few hundred meters from the Wright Fortress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to test the drop point and throw distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but have not waited for the catapult to shoot even if It was a stone, a high-war war tree in the fortress flashed, and a fast-changing magical arrow with a long red tail, hit the front of a catapult. Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent explosion with a raging flame not only blasted the catapult into pieces, but also sent dozens of soldiers around to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few catapults have not yet entered the range, and they have been blown into pieces by more than ten magical fireballs shot from the ancient war trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the watchtower of Layton’s camp, Marshal Emams looked at the scene gloomyly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magician under his command is too much. "Clark's face is equally ugly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because he has the support of the elf." Just think about how many magicians there are in the Elven Empire before the Millennium War, and you won't be surprised now. "Marshal Arams is cold and fluent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Generals, you are all warriors who have fought a hundred wars. I saw the current Wright Fortress. I think all the people have already understood that the Holy Alliance has come to an end. I just got the news that we are covering the Kampaas. The 20,000-strong army was also dragged down by 50,000 Astrofiks. Although our warriors repeatedly defeated the enemy's defense, they did not count the losses, and we could not do this."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is sitting quietly, waiting for the marshal's below. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I have decided to cancel the attack Wright tomorrow fortress plan!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; account in immediate uproar A general stood up in anger and roared: "Arams! You are betrayal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams’s chilly face Expressionless: "Generals! The army in my hands assembled the most elite soldiers of Layton. The blood and life of these soldiers should be used to defend the land of Layton from the embarrassment of outsiders, and should not be thrown unnecessarily. Under the wall of the Wright Fortress! Now even if we attack the Wright Fortress, it will not help, and it will not save the demise of the Holy Alliance. But as long as this army is intact, the Astrofiks will be scrupulous. I won’t burn the war to Layton’s land. What I really need to pay is that Lomon’s majesty, he has to pay his own crown! My decision is the final decision, no objection. And all the consequences of this decision, I will bear it by myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals interact with each other." Looking, anger slowly accumulate. The marshals of several marshals were very nervous, and they held the hilt in their hands and did not dare to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a commander came to the barracks in the camp, Lord Rams, the reserve army has already had a reply, they said that they will never sit back and look at the 60,000 comrades Desperate. Even without the support of the Layton army, they will attack the Wright Fortress tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals are all moved, everyone knows that 20,000 under-trained reserve soldiers go What kind of ending would it be to attack the Wright Fortress?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several generals glanced at each other and stood up and said to Arams: "Marshal Adults, please allow us to join the reserve army! We will fight to death, not surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several generals who stand up and are equally passionate: "We also To join the reserve army, to fight for death, not to surrender!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams’s eyelids jumped a few times, coldly: "If you quit now If I am a military officer and join the reserve army in the name of an individual, then I will approve it. But all the warriors, including your guards, must stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several generals silently removed the mark of Layton on the armor and placed it On the table in front of Marshal Arams, and then did not return to the big account.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A general will suddenly go out when he is about to go out. He looked at Marshal Alams and hesitated. He said for a long time: "Marshal, since you canceled the plan to attack the city, then those siege devices that have already been made can be taken away? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Arams looked at the old man who had followed his own for many years, sighed and said coldly: "I don't remember having made Have any siege equipment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general was very happy, and he bowed to Marshal Elamas and hurried away.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is suddenly big.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, the North is surprisingly cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When the day is not yet bright, Rogge has already stood in the city. Here, his sharp eyes are enough to capture any details on the entire battlefield. The precious space on the war tree should be left as much as possible. Elf shooters and magicians.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint morning light is falling, and the morning fog of the smoke is getting thinner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A vague horn sound suddenly spurred Rogge's eardrum, and his brows were tightly locked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Layton's army is still here. ? Rogge thought for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was eagerly looking at the Leiden Barracks in the distance. But the darkness there was still calm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leiden military camp is still dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned and said to Charlie: "It’s weird! They don’t want to rely on the 20,000 reserve army to attack the Wright Fortress?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie observed for a while to be convinced! But Layton’s army has not moved yet, it seems that they are really ready to attack the city with 20,000 reserve troops. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's gaze searched in the camp under the city, his face suddenly showed a happy color.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie, I saw a few generals of Layton, but they all took the emblem, it seems to have left the military. So that Marshal Arams has made a choice, the Layton army will not be dispatched!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does..." Rogge couldn't understand more. : "They really thought that by relying on the 20,000 reserve army, they could attack the Wright Fortress?" Do we look so bully? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie looks very big, these people are real warriors. In their hearts, there is something more important than life, that is faith! A fight for a while I think it will be very difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s face was a few times, cold and cold: I will give them a good lesson! I want Let them know that courage and faith alone cannot bring victory!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reserve army has already had a mighty battlefield in the fortress.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the horrible Wright Fortress and the densely guarded army on the city, the 20,000-strong team looks so thin, even the hundreds of huge siege devices It’s as ridiculous as a child’s toy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A former Layton’s general walked out of the array, and he suddenly took out his sword and screamed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Freedom!" 20,000 people screamed together to make the whole earth All Trembling!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s pupils shrank, giving orders to Raphael on the war tree.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world seems to suddenly light up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general has just led a few tens of meters, and a bowl suddenly appeared on his chest. Big blood hole!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still gasps and struggles to move forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another flash of light flashed, and a transparent blood hole appeared in his abdomen again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the general finally couldn’t support it, he snarled unwillingly Struggling with the last strength, throwing the sword in the hand to the fortress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword flutters, over a long distance, tens of thousands under the city Under the gaze of the man, a slamming sound was inserted at the edge of the moat, and the hilt was still shaking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For freedom!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of madness shocked Rogge All eardrum fortress defenders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pulled the elf guardian warrior around him. In the cries of the reserve army, he only had the big shackles to let the elf hear his orders: "Go to the Dungeon guards, and all the exits of the dungeons in the squadrons will be blown up, leaving only two hundred people to monitor. The rest are transferred here! Also, turn the guards of Dongcheng into half! Be fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hellish battlefield... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless rockets and burning stone bullets flew to the Wright Fortress. Obviously after two days of consideration, the coalition forces are prepared to use fire to strip the thorn armor of the Wright Fortress. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the rocket does not shine through the sturdy vines, and the burning stone is often bounced back by the elastic vine armor. However, the reserve army was well prepared, and they quickly threw the jars filled with fire oil with a catapult, and the flames began to ignite one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame on the vines kept burning, but it was only because of the fire. The vines themselves are extremely non-flammable and suck up enough water, so these flaming oils can only leave more than a dozen black holes on this thorn armor, but they cannot ignite as a whole as the coalition expected. Burn the Wright Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge spent several months gathering the power of the elves to make this thorny armor, if people give a fire, Isn't it a joke? Fire protection is a factor to consider when cultivating these thorny vines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a ray of red in the sky, and every light flashes, and a catapult will turn into a ash in a fierce flame. After shooting more than twenty arrows, Raphael’s vindictiveness was finally exhausted, but an elf guardian warrior immediately took over the bow of the Elf King in his hand. Now that the siege devices are approaching the Wright Fortress, they are within their range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder ladder was on the wall and was pushed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many reserve soldiers who fell from the city's head and fell on the thorns and vines, and were immediately pierced by countless spikes. Some soldiers were immediately poisoned, and those who were not poisoned struggled in vain, screaming, trying to struggle from the huge spikes that penetrated the body, but the result would only be to get more spikes into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the cockroach dyed the thorns of the Wright Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke, fire, roaring, screaming, flesh and blood, intertwined, is everything on this battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flashed a fascinating red in front of his eyes, and a few pieces of blood flew over a small piece of meat and ran on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few meters before Rogge, a very young reserve soldier has just been cut off his arm, but he still screams, with only One hand grabbed the opponent's face and dug one of his eyes! In a blink of an eye, more than a dozen swords pierced his body, but he still struggled to climb over to Rogge until one The tomahawk cut his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier’s head rolled all the way to Rogge’s feet before stopping. Rogge lowered his head and saw that the eyes burning with inexplicable flames were staring at him. In an instant, this pair of eyes full of anger and unwillingness has been branded in the heart of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence around, and all eyes fell on Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s mouth is not consciously **. But it seems that his face seems to have no emotional fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his foot and slowly stepped down, smashing the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors around Rogge’s morale, roaring, finally cut down more than ten reserve soldiers still on the city’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, at the beginning of the war, Rogge couldn’t think of the 20,000-year reserve army not only to attack the city, but also to climb the city of Wright Fortress several times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a severely wounded dying reserve soldier screams and smashes in the same way, it will scare dozens of Aley fighters to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are’s warriors are often caught in the ankles after passing through a body that has been thought to have been dead. The mistakes and panic of the moment often make These rookies on the battlefield pay the price of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the Aray soldiers who had been strengthened from the beginning, they might have collapsed at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, whether it is the Spartan Knight, the Darkness of the Moon or the Tickton Reload Warrior, they will be determined, no matter what the situation, they Will not hesitate to end the life of the opponent. Charlie had to go into battle personally. He led these most elite warriors to appear in the most critical places again and again, struggling to repel the reserve army from the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the reserve soldiers on the city were killed and never repelled...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's face is iron and blue, standing with his hands on his head. Even if he fights and is a few meters in front of him, he will not step back and will not do it. Extreme anger, incomprehension, uneasiness, and even fear made his body tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there aren't so many if...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 20,000 Reserve Army is likely to create a miracle that breaks through the Wright Fortress, which is stationed by 40,000 troops!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is starting to get dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody Zachul screamed with the tomahawk and opened the head of the last reserve soldier on the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around for his enemies with bloody eyes, but for a moment, he could no longer find any reserve soldiers. The tall and mighty Tickton collar was loose, and suddenly felt dizzy and almost fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting from early morning to dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bleak horn sounding, the reserve army finally retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of bleak and tragic figures slowly retreated to the distance in the twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the entire Wright Fortress is dyed dark red. The 15,000 soldiers of the reserve army have always fallen on this land. Accompanied by them are over 10,000 Aley warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roger, chase?" asked a general of Aley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s face was gloomy, his eyes swept over the horrified Aley warriors on the city’s head, the almost collapsed Tickton collar, and those who were far away. The tragic back is finally in the still quiet Leiden military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has deep uneasiness in his heart. Although he is extremely reluctant to put these thousands of reserve troops back to the sea, he does not want to stimulate the Layton army. He is gnawing his teeth: "Do not chase!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half Mountain In the Leiden military camp, Marshal Alams has stood still in the cold for hours. Clark and the more than a dozen generals stood still and shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50,000 Layton warriors, together with their generals, sat quietly watching the entire war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the figure of the reserve army disappeared into the twilight, Marshal Alams sighed and whispered: "It seems that I am really old." Hesitation and reason have made me lose the only chance... Hey!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and patted Clark’s shoulder, and said: "But you are different, Clark! You are still young, there are still many things to bear! Even if you are in despair, you can't forget that there is a miracle in this world!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark seems to understand and nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is quietly covering up the bloody fortress...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咣当!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of Hughes was kicked rudely, and a drunken Rogge staggered in. He said nothing, picked up a bottle of spirits and took a headache for a while before putting the bottle on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Hughes! You said how these reserve troops would be so stupid! Only 20,000 people, even dare to attack my fortress is not to die? Really I don't know the so-called fool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But God made the adults, they almost succeeded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, I know! But I don't understand why this is!" Rogge snorted and reached for the bottle on the table. His hand shook very badly and almost knocked the bottle over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge swayed annoyedly, and he wanted to anesthetize himself, no longer thinking about it. But the physique of Warcraft is so strong that after he drank more than a dozen bottles of spirits, his mind was still very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes adults, you are afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to admit, but... Hell! Yes, I am afraid! These people are crazy!" Rogge cursed. The unwilling eyes of the young reserve soldiers always lingered in his heart. Rogge has always been very afraid of death. Even if he is a Necromancer, even if he is now difficult to completely eliminate, he is still not willing to risk to die. Therefore, he has no way of understanding the ideas of these reserve soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
