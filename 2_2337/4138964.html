			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如如梦章章下下下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full ten minutes, Rogge I left my ears from the smooth, smooth belly of Mei. He did hear the pulsating sound of life, and the feeling of connecting with his blood is not wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this little life is still very, very young, it should be less than a month, it has not even formed. However, the strength and vitality of life has surprised the fat man. He still has no heartbeat and no blood circulation, but the ups and downs of life in Rogge's induction, like the sound of the wild tribes, every record is so vigorous, so passionate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog almost immediately fell in love with this little thing. He has been so overbearing at such a young age that he will grow up in the future and will be among the best in the world. In contrast, Lilith's son, born to him, has little difference from ordinary children, except for the signs of mental development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days, Rogge has been too busy, and everything about the ice warrior has let go of his hand. He just looks at the results every once in a while. Only. So he hasn't touched Rose in the last month, but he didn't expect Rose to have his child. And Rogge has already seen that this child's talent is extremely extraordinary, and will become a big tool in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Rogge is nearly 30, and his footprints have traveled all over the continent, and his heart has already been vicissitudes. Suddenly a son was added, as if in a gloomy world in his heart, a warm and bright sunshine was cast. How to make him not happy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a head down, no words, if a prisoner awaits the fate of the sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reached up and raised her face, staring at her eyes with the same short hair. This is always a woman who is always cold. At the moment, there are some panic in the eyes, some uneasiness, and some expectations. Rogge asked slowly: "May, you originally wanted to take this child off, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is gently trembled, softly Answer: "Yes...Yes. However, I really can't bear it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said quietly: "Yes. You use children as a conditional exchange. Relo’s sleep is really the right choice.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rose suddenly looked up. Staring at Rogge, he shouted: "Not like this! I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the fat man has a penetrating gaze, the head of the rose is slow. Slowly down, her voice suddenly had an endless bleak, sighing: "Is it really like this. But I... I don't know what to say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mary suddenly screamed, the already bloodless face suddenly flew a blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at her and smiled sadly: "Since you don't know what to say. Then you are ready!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stood up, picked up the rose, put her on the desk, and killed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has stopped re-dressing and will leave Ground rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merry turned and waited quietly for Rogge’s instructions. She is still cold at the moment, if there is a rose inserted in the thousand-year-old ice wall, but when it comes in, it is a white rose, and when it leaves, it is already a red rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will incinerate the body of Relo. Let him be completely free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you, Rogge." Although her wish has been paid, there is not much joy in her tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge indulged, Wen Yan said to the road: "The ice temple warriors do not have to worry about things, you should not be too tired, the body is tight. As for the cold moon camp The thing... just forget it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary slowly lowered her head, she did not thank this time. Just leaving silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the door that was lightly closed, Rogge fell into his desk and fell into meditation. After a moment, he slammed a small golden bell on the table, a light smoke-like figure oozing out of the wall and floating in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Rogge, what do you have to order?" He condensed himself into Rogge's consciousness in a way similar to magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To monitor the woman who just left, report it to me once a day. If she has a change, please notify me immediately."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure smiled two times low. There was a bit of excitement in the voice, saying: "I feel it. Her mood is not stable, and her soul is full of shadows. It seems to hide a lot of secrets. If she wants to escape, and I can't find you, then What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Block her. If it can't stop, kill the ground." Rogge faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure made a groaning sound, like a wolf smelling the blood: "I know, hey. She doesn't look like it looks like it." It’s that simple. It’s easy to stop her, but it’s easy to kill her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s closed eyes suddenly slammed open, and the silver awns suddenly lit up like silver The needle, the shadow-like person quickly retreated and shrunk to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said coldly: "If you dare to abuse my trust, it is not only for you, I am afraid that it is not good news for your whole family. Live, if you have to kill her, don't hurt her belly. Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge voice fell, the spiritual world door immediately closed. The figure still wants to say something, but the mental fluctuations hit the spiritual door that has suddenly closed. In an instant, he only felt that if he was riding a running horse and suddenly hit a hard wall, he couldn’t tell the uncomfortable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shadow disappeared slowly, Rogge fell into meditation, and the magical flame of the beating reflected his face flickering. In an instant, under the influence of light and shadow, Rogge’s plain fat face suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame leaps to the left, reflecting the face of angelic holiness and elegance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame jumps to the right, it is a smirking devil face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly seemed to feel it, slowly opened his eyes and repeatedly scanned the entire study. After a while, he finally regained his gaze, and his face was slightly confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena is standing in the void, overlooking the Great Temple of the Holy Church, and the heartbeat is slightly accelerated. For a moment, she suddenly felt a bad feeling. Immediately moved out of the room of Rogge. Until now she was wondering why she made that decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the power and space mastery, even if she is standing face to face in the void in front of Rogge, the fat man should never discover her existence. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why should she avoid it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena does not understand. It’s just that she has always been arrogant, and she refuses to admit it anyway. Until now, her heartbeat has not been calmed down, it is derived from the faint guilty conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory!" Weina shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dragon appeared behind her, humbly lowering his faucet in front of the most beautiful owner. Gregory is extremely acquainted, since Wella vowed to temper it into the first powerful gnome of the past. Every call comes in the form of a sacred dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at it. Frowning: "Become a gnome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory stunned and almost planted it. However, the master's order was against the blame. It faltered for a long time and finally became a gnome. However, the owner's next order surprised him, and even overjoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are going to stare at the woman called Rose, and you are not allowed to leave for a moment! If she has something wrong, tell me immediately."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory from Hell to Heaven is afraid of any change. I rushed in a hurry and immediately slipped away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is destined to be an eventful early summer night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her prophecy did not receive any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if Constantine saw her practicing the prophetic technique before, she would almost certainly have a situation, maybe the red-collar church went to a collision. dead. With Constantine's sacred power of the sea, the prophecy is displayed. At most, one or two of the ten times can get a little response from the heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie is facing the delicate magic crystal plate in front of him, gnashing his teeth and swearing at the spell. The spell she prayed was so great: "In the name of any god, tell me why the woman can have a child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie silently looked at the crystal plate, finally exhaled a long breath, put on a pair of pure sweet smiles, and said: "All the planes in the sky Gods. When will the child in the woman’s belly fall?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal plate finally reacted, and the moment is changing, the seasons are changing. Finally, it was fixed on a doomsday scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie’s face was a bit ugly, she thought for a moment, remembering the experience of using the prophetic technique to transform the larvae of the royal bee on the day, so she pointed to the crystal plate and said: "God said that Effie will have children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the crystal plate is unpredictable, representing the symbol of countless gods flashing instantly, but the last result. It is a blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal disk smashed on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie fell to the ground. I cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other corner of the temple, there was a big quarrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me in!" Androni pressed his hand on the handle of the blue sky. Drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora in a robe opened her arms and held it in front of her, faintly said: "The inside is the sacred place of the goddess O'Reilly and the Holy Ghost. It is also the forbidden place of the church. No one can enter without the permission of the Pope and I."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Rogge that let me go!" Androni Angry. Unfortunately, she is not good at lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let the pope come and tell me personally! You can rush in, kill me first."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't think I dare not!" Androni cried, and the blue sky was already on the snowy neck of Mora. In the past, this holy and beautiful Mora will inevitably become the object of Androni's coveted. If Mora does not resist at the moment, it is very likely that Anne will eat it. But now Androni can't think of this anymore, she is quite a day of unresolved lovesickness. She wants to see the windy month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora looked at Androni, and her eyes were full of pity. She sighed: "I just let you in, you can't see the goddess. Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni tears out, She said nothing, suddenly turned and left as electricity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another room in the temple, the death class looked at the position of the blue moon in the night sky, and spent another day on the calendar in the hand. On the calendar. There was not much space on the day when the distance was marked with a fine sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, but in Dresden, thousands of miles away, there are still many sleepless people at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous local pub in Dresden is bustling with almost no extra seats for late-nights. However, the female warrior with a helmet in the corner of the pub has a table, facing the wall, drinking a glass of spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she occupied the entire table. However, the natural momentum of the excitement made the wine drinkers rather stand up and drink, and did not dare to share a seat with her desk. Even a few of the most fierce mercenaries. After the pub owner warned a few words with his ears, he also saw the cat and mouse, and honestly shrank to the corner of the pub, and even the sound of laughter was much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ears of the Bauhinia butterfly, at this moment, the hustle and noise in the pub have the noise of the sky. Far from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just poured a cup of the most powerful wine, because her heart is hurting, and her heart is sore! Every time a glass of wine goes down, it will pour this pain a little, but the painful spin will have a fire like oil, which will burn more fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pain is inexplicable. She didn't know why she suddenly got hurt tonight, and she didn't want to live. The rigorous training of the camp in the cold month for many years failed to bring her a terrible personal strength. But she has brought her keen intuition and intuition about what she really cares about. This kind of intuition is used on the battlefield, and it often plays an amazing role. This is one of the secrets of the generals who came out of the cold moon camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she knows that the pain at the moment is by no means unreasonable. This is the emotion she has been suppressing at the deepest part of her heart, but it suddenly bursts out at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She drank too much. So that everything I heard and saw began to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when she has one more person opposite. The handsome face, tall figure and concerned eyes are so familiar, she even recognized his gorgeous two-handed sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You drink too much!" Etter sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am at all...not drunk." Bauhinia Butterfly Road. She suddenly smiled inexplicably, saying: "Ete, I know you... you and Rogge were good friends, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features nodded, said: "Yes. You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated for a long time and suddenly asked: "Do you like Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia Butterfly did not answer, she drank a cup of spirits before she smiled: "Of course not! I...have hatred with him. It was forced to be helpless." He works. Oh, how can I like him? How could it be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and wept. I poured a glass of wine for myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the glass of Etter’s hand was broken, and the blood rushed out of the fingertips. He stretched out his left hand and tried to stop the Bauhinia butterfly from drinking, but the hand reached halfway and finally stopped there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly is unaware of this, she just wants to put out the pain from the deepest bottom of my heart, like a volcanic eruption. She can't talk, and she knows that this relationship is bound to have no results. More importantly, she never wants to give in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Rogge’s figure always lingers in front of her eyes. Such a man, whether it is power, strength, or status, will leave her behind. Even on her most proud military strategy, she admired his decisiveness and cold blood in the Battle of Delaware. The proud Bauhinia butterfly never thought that he would lose so thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be the source of her pain? She doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guards! Send me... Go back." The Bauhinia butterfly finally fell to the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete stood up and swayed the unconventional Bauhinia butterfly and walked outside the pub. Everyone in the pub knows that the magic swordsman is the adjutant of the Bauhinia butterfly, so no one blocks it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Etter’s face is blue and his hands are faintly shaking. Although his pace is steady, he doesn't know why. He has a feeling when he looks at the people he left, feeling that he is struggling every step of the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a thousand miles away, Rogge has no idea, his whole mind is only in front of the pieces of different sizes, emitting khaki On the crystal. These crystals are the last traces left by the Prophet of the Earth. The crystal fragments are half a meter square, and the small ones are palm-sized. Most of the crystals have only a negligible amount of strength at this moment. But Rogge doesn't care, he doesn't need to draw strength from these crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s hands stretched out, and a piece of broken crystal on the experimental table slowly floated between his hands. In the heart of Rogge, there was a silvery ray of smoke, which shrouded the crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long it took, Roger was shocked. Opened his eyes. The broken crystals floating in his palms have long lost all the luster and turned into fly ash. It is annihilated. Rogge shook his head and took another piece of broken crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You do this by using up all the crystals, and it is impossible to find out the power of the prophet of the earth."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do?" Rogge turned his head and asked Adelene, who suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Magic Lab Guard is the most rigorous place in the entire Great Temple, but this defense can only be targeted at the general strong. For Adrienne, the existence of a space that can be positioned in a turbulent stream and can be freely shuttled between planes, the general defense is simply useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne walked to Rogge. I took a piece of broken crystal and smiled and said: "Your dark magic is obviously learned from Elysses. Since you can even curse the law, then she should teach you everything. In fact, the curse is It consists of three separate parts. As you can see, by simply extracting this part and making a small change, you can display the magical properties and power distribution contained in these broken crystals..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne's soft voice quietly presents a brand new world in front of Rogge. He never thought about it. The world of dark magic is so far and wide! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses pursues a variety of powerful and powerful high-level magic, cursing is her original creation, fully demonstrating that she has no magic The talent of Ellenby. And Adrienne is different, she is the secret behind all the magic, studying the essence of all the dark magic can be cast. So in her magic system, there are only a handful of magic that need to be shaped by the power of the Dark Gods. For example, the dark order. Most of the time, she catalyzes her opponents to nothingness with pure, powerful, overwhelming magical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, from the back, the two figures immersed in the secrets of the magic world seem so harmonious and harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is roughly the case, I am leaving." Adrienne smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge didn’t want her to say go and leave, some wrongly said: "Are you leaving?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are over, I am not going, what are you doing?" Adrienne looked at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge somehow, the heartbeat is a little faster, and it is getting faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he wanted to say something, Adrienne’s figure suddenly became blurred. The blink of an eye disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her soft laughter came from the other end of the space. In Rogge's ear, "I don't want to leave, but I have no life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge again. Adrienne’s strength has already exceeded his expectations. Even today he has not been able to understand all of her details. And Milo’s skillful fat man has been roughly aware of it. Although the absolute strength of Rogge is not so good, his vision and control of power have always far exceeded his own level of strength. As for other Sanctuary powerhouses, the fat people can now be said to be clear at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are a few exceptions to this. Such as Xius, Sara Wenger, such as the death class. The boss and Hughes are mysterious, and the Death Class is one of the must-have skills because it is a killer. Therefore, when Rogge looks at him, he always feels vague and unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Wella and Fengyue, Rogner is worried. The existence of these two horrors is an automatic counterattack that will attract their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of these two guys, Rogge couldn’t help but smile and shook his head. In contrast, Adelaide is gentle and generous, with both good teachers and good friends, and even some confidantes, so that he does not feel more and more want to be close to her. Although her looks are unremarkable, but Rogge has already read the world, and has long ignored this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark magic that Adelene explained for him has flowed through the heart one by one. She did not teach Roger what new magic, just told him to control the power of the main. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when all colors fade, the power contained in the ball of light is like a reborn. Suddenly jumped a level, emitting a dazzling white brilliance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All magic items in the magic lab, shaking up uncomfortably, seem to echo the energy ball with this powerful magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this purely magical energy without attributes, Rogge couldn’t help but be secretly proud. The magic power contained in this group of light balls can completely drive an eighth-order magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure, all without tricks. The power that exists completely independent of the level of manipulation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the moment when the magic energy ball broke through, Rogge really stepped into the forest of the Great Magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he also launched eight-order magic many times, according to the general understanding of the magic world, he can already join the ranks of the big magician. However, magic casting can reduce the difficulty as the caster gradually understands the magic. Rogge has a variety of methods to temporarily improve the magic. The subtle magic control can ensure that he will not be able to cast spells. problem. So the minimum magic he needs to cast eighth-order magic is much lower than the average big magister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the energy ball of light floating in front of his eyes, for a while. Emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a decade since he touched the magic and officially stepped into the big magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has always relied on metamorphosis, power and understanding of power and many powerful forces who are far stronger than their own, and at this moment When his absolute power is no longer lost to the strong. Just look at the world, how many people are his rivals? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in a state of turmoil, a hero is born, and he wants to scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a negligible airflow came silently, hitting Rogge’s magical energy ball on the ground. In an instant, the balance of the magical energy ball is completely destroyed by this airflow, and the pure magical energy loses its constraint, and instantly transforms into the magical energy of various attributes in the influence of the external environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical energies of different attributes provoke each other and cancel each other out. In the blink of an eye. This group of powerful and horrible energy that can destroy the entire magic laboratory turned into a blue smoke and dissipated with the wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple hit. What kind of power control is there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s face was gray and his hands were shaking. He can't believe everything he sees in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so exciting to have such a negligible power? Hey, look at the whole plane and be able to pack your presence!" Weina chilly The voice came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man turned around and smiled bitterly: "I only used it for ten years to become a big magician. Why not be slow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is always a storm in the eyebrows between the two eyebrows, she is cold and cold: "Not slow? That is the standard of the Terran! If you are not in the Mozu Those inexplicably magically wasted time, you should become a big magician as early as five years ago! Hey, the threshold of the Terran's Magister is so low, what's so strange when you get on it? Just think about it, the year is the first One...the damn necromancer is enough to bring the last five or six big devils together and you should know that the big magic guide is not surprising."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rodriguez was re-introduced by Wella, Rogge was silent. Every time he gains a point, he will re-recognize this unprecedented necromancer. At first he thought that Rodriguez was just a powerful lich. After seeing other big magic guides, the fat man found that the number one Necromancer was very different from other magisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today, when he himself became a big magical guide, he discovered that Rodriguez was still a mountain in the distant clouds. I don't know what year and month to go, he can go to the foot of the mountain and look up to the peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The way the Mozu uses power, although it is much stronger than your Terran... Well, you can't be alone. But if those demons are really powerful, how can they fight in the plane for thousands of years? Awkward, 艾, although Adrienne is stronger than Elysses, it is far from understanding the true nature of power, for example, she just taught you...”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s mouth tells that the brilliance of the different power attributes in her hands is flickering between her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Adelaide’s use of magical methods for Rogge was broken by Wella. The use of all kinds of supreme skills in this plane is awesome in that pair of hands with destructive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in a moment, Rogge has a transcendental existence, quietly watching the centuries-old history of this plane condensed into a short moment , flashing in the hands of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, these skills are amazing, but they are all that Rogge can’t use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally sighed and said: "Werner, you said that Adelaide taught me all kinds of flaws, but she taught me, I can understand and use it, and it is aimed at my use of power defects, purposeful. Your strength is far stronger than her, the devil's cultivation methods will naturally not be in your eyes, But from the beginning to the end, in addition to occasionally elated, you will explain to me the use of power, and why have you taught me as much as she did? The skills you show now, I believe are all human Peak, but what is the same thing I can use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waina stunned, then angered, a pair of golden crosses slowly floated. Under her inexhaustible pressure, Rogge suddenly realized that he was completely unable to move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he did not back down, staring at Wella, said: "You can only say that she can't do this, that won't work. But you can take out some of the things I can use." Something comes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina is extremely angry, the silver light flashes in the hand, the dragon soul gun has been in the throat of Rogge, and the anger is already a bit No words: "You don't know anything about pigs! I don't teach you how to use strength. It's for you! Why don't you think about it, that damn, dirty, should be cursed by all the world." Why doesn't the Necromancer leave his magical knowledge to you? You...you know now that Adrienne is good to you, then the windy month, what are you doing during this time, have thought about her situation? No?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes suddenly lit up. He looked up and greeted Weina's gaze, faintly said: "I will never forget. Weina, in this matter, you don't know everything..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not finish, Wei Na suddenly put away the dragon soul gun, flew forward, staring carefully at Rogge's pupil, watching endlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowns and asks: "What are you looking at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!" Weina shouted, then she gently covered her left hand with Rogge's forehead and said, "Let go of your spiritual world! There seems to be something strange in your memory."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;;nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was a little bit stunned by Wella, he had to let go of his spirit, let her explore his messy memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly snorted coldly, and she turned to the glamorous battle that Rogge and Rose had just happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow-up, the image of countless women rushed out of the water, and the images they had with Rogge almost filled the vision of Weina! Wella just wanted to attack, and an image in the field of vision suddenly enlarged, and finally occupied the sea of ​​consciousness. That was the lingering of Rogge and Mora. In Rogge’s memory, after Mora’s sly face, two other figures were faintly revealed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina gripped on the spot! Then a blush of red rose quietly on her skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wei is silent, she wants to quietly erase this memory. But before she started, all the memories in the sea of ​​consciousness suddenly disappeared and became empty and empty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the endless darkness, the unknown god of the body up to 10,000 meters and three million eyes quietly surfaced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
