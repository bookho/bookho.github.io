How can he choose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe only he knows in his own heart, at the moment he just has, he has had room for choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, at the moment he walked out of the imperial palace, Rogge finally felt a touch of ease. At least in front of me, an uneasiness that has always hanged in his heart has finally been eliminated, albeit at the same expense. He can't even tell if the price paid is worth it. Until Rogge sat in his own study, the voice of the Emperor still echoed back and forth in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, I heard that the Eye of Wisdom and the Holy Faith of Silver are going to merge. Is there such a thing?" Feuerbach’s low voice In the dimly lit little study, I couldn’t help but reverberate, as if a beast was roaring in faintness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty." Rogge replied graciously. A chill was faint in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the eyes of wisdom and the teachings of silver are already the same goddess? The original goddess of ice and ice, should be defeated by the goddess of wisdom. Is that true?" the emperor asked slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s forehead began to ooze fine cold sweat. He knew that his current answer was very crucial. One was not good, and I am afraid that it would immediately provoke a murder. At least the boss, Sarah Wenger, is on the sidelines. He has no chance to choose whether to assassinate the Emperor or to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The goddess of wisdom, O'Reilly, showed the power of God and defeated the goddess of ice enshrined in the silver saint. She did not know what way Let the believers of the silver sacred believe that she is the goddess of ice and snow. Your Majesty. I know so much about this matter. The field of God is not something that a mortal can understand." Rogge chose to tell the truth. At least part of the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great nodded and said, "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog feels, behind The sharp feeling of a bunch of needles finally disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach again said: "Rogge, since you arrived in the empire. Experience the battle, open up the territory. Made a lot of great achievements for the Empire. I heard that you are familiar with history, then you must know that for an outsider like you, you can be sealed by a duchy, a prince and a prince, and you can command a 100,000 army. What does this mean? I treat each other like this. Don't you treat your credit badly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to work for my Majesty, there is no requirement at all. Of course... if it is a little small Small selfish words, it is also hope that the war horses will be able to embark on the rich southern land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor is expressionless, indifferent to Rogge’s declaration of loyalty, slow Slowly: "After the integration of the two religions, the influence of the empire will exceed that of the original silver sacred religion, and your power in politics today, except Alexander and Pompey. No one can match you. The situation will continue to develop, what kind of ending do you think will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue cold sweat rolled down, slammed into the ground, and hurriedly said: "I have never had any jealousy about my majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Get up, our Asrofic empire is not as good as the southerners. You have done great deeds. You have always been faithful, so you can rest assured that I will still appoint you." The situation can no longer continue, and the struggle between you and Alexander and Pompey should come to an end. Between secular rights and the right to teach, you choose the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge's thoughts and this are finally coming to an end. He stood up and slowly stepped out of the room and looked up at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is as always, with a thin cloud like a curtain. But today's clouds are taller than in the past, and people feel a bit refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the cloud. It is a high and cold day. Behind the sky. It is an endless void. Beyond the void, is it in the restricted area of ​​the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sighed and secretly screamed: "Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you have to order?" The fat voice did not fall, and Robsky did not know Where did it come out? Generally, as long as Rogge returns home, he will be called, and this guy will inevitably appear, and the fat man can handle the things he has done properly. It seems that in these years, Roberts has grown a lot in basic things, and his visionary ability far exceeds that time as the leader of the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get the car, you go with me to the Holy Bible Cathedral," Rogge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Cathedral of the Silver Religion has been refurbished and appears more sacred, solemn, solemn and luxurious. According to Gregory's suggestion, the statue of the goddess of ice and snow in front of the main hall has been pushed down. With the help of fanatics and the help of countless mages, a new goddess is being built at an extremely fast pace. The only place where there is no dispute is the face of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the solemn but rigid image of the original goddess of ice and snow, the newly erected goddess looks lifelike. In order to highlight the majesty of the goddess, Gregory proposed that a dragon should be added in front of the goddess to show that the goddess' power has overwhelmed the dragon's most powerful creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is self-sufficient in it, but it is well known. But the results of things are often not satisfactory. In the design of the sketch, Mora adopted Gregory's suggestion, but she actually let the designer design the statue of the dragon according to the image of Silverron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This next move hit the key to Gregory. No matter how the sacred dragon threatens the lure, Mora is not giving in. Gregory himself has a special identity, and people who know it exist can be said to be few and far between. Even if you want to go to the designer to modify the sketch, you can't listen to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's style is extremely rigorous, usually not prayer or cultivation. As a godsman of Fengyue, her own strength has also increased sharply with the improvement of Fengyue's power. Therefore, the sneak Gregory is very difficult to approach her in the dark, even if he occasionally succeeds several times, he has not caught enough to threaten her topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Gregory finally found Mora privately. After pleading for a painful price, after paying a terrible price, I finally got this long-term statue in front of the goddess and accepted the opportunity of worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the plain, there was a big loss in Mora, how can Gregory be willing? The sacred dragon of wisdom, as it is thinking today, should find a chance to sue her in front of the two goddesses and pull back the disadvantages in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Gregory, I don’t know where to hide and count the revenge of it. Rogge's carriage has stopped at the gate of the main hall of the Silver Church. He stepped out of the carriage and took a deep, cold air. Looking uplessly at the statue of God, which is tens of meters high and unfinished, after a while, he walked to the main hall of the Great Snow Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are busy craftsmen, technicians and mages, and sacrifices in the courtyard. The layers of scaffolding are not only placed around the Statue of Ice, but also around the Great Snow Temple. The magnificent walls of the Great Snow and Ice Temple were originally engraved with the miracles of the goddess of ice and snow. Now many of these sculptures have to be taken down and replaced with the statue of the lyrics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a mess in the hall. The original altar in the main hall has been removed and the new altar has not yet been completed. Only a magical array of graphics has been laid. Dozens of craftsmen, under the command of several mages, carefully cast the smelted mercury into the grooves engraved on the surface of the jade stone. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many heavily armed Ice Palace warriors in the temple. Their eyes are not overwhelmed by busy craftsmen, beware of every possible destruction of the hall. People. Now the relationship within the silver sacred religion is very tense and sensitive. Mora is completely relying on iron fists and bloody to suppress the voice of opposition. But the internal resistance of the church is almost always there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ice palace warriors recognized Rogge, and after the ceremony, they immediately gave Rogge a way. Rogge passed through the crowd and strode to the prayer room behind the temple. In addition to some major ceremonies or conferences, Mora usually stays there alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger let Robsky wait outside, and he pushed the door into the prayer room, and then gently closed the heavy ice iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora long hair scatters. Like a waterfall, scattered on the side of the face, shoulders, looks very moving. She kneels in front of the small altar and is praying piously. When she heard the door behind her, she stood up and turned around, and looked at Rogge with a pair of eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment she looks soft and moving, but the fat man knows that these are all illusions. At this moment her strength is growing stronger with the growth of the goddess, and the natural charm is still amazing. Moreover, the saint is in the name of the goddess, the means are getting more and more bloody. It is not a character that can be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog asked: "Mora. How is your business here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's not very smooth." Mora took a piece of parchment from the side of the altar and handed it to Rogge. Dao: "I have arrested more than a dozen people who hold different opinions, but there will always be new people standing up against the two religions. This is the next batch of people who are expected to be sent to a heretic prison. You see, the distance from the last time. It took only a week to catch the arrest, and there were more than a hundred people on the list."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the long list, the fat man frowned: "Mora Have you checked that these people have no background in their homes? And I heard that your heresy is not a good place to stay, it is often dead, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do not be kind to the heresy." Mora was cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighed: "The secular world is very complicated. It is not simply divided into black and white depending on whether it is faith or not. Your current practice is very Lack of consideration, you must know that the iron fist is not the only way to achieve the goal. So, let Robsky help you in this matter. Go back and give this list to him, let him see who can move, who No one else can belong to someone who can win. How is the organization of the Ice and Snow Masters and the New Ice Warrior organized?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora turned and took out Two thin books were handed to Rogge. "The Ice and Snow Masters have initially selected 51 people, but some of them have to be carefully tested. The final official should be 40. Around the ice hall, there are only about 400 people in the ice temple. There is a rudiment in general, and they have to continue to recruit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened two books and looked at it. A book details the background and magic level of each ice and snow mage. The other is the selection of the Ice Temple Samurai and the draft regulations of the Samurai. He turned it over at random and put them aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora hangs a huge canvas of plain color, and then gently blows a sip of ice to the canvas, so on the empty canvas Beginning to appear in a row of lines with a little bit of chill in the font. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora turned and said to Rogge: "This is the structural chart of the reorganization of the silver saint that I just developed. You have a look What is not satisfied with the place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is very serious this time, he repeatedly looked at the canvas several times. This nodded and looked at Mora. Just want to say something, the corner of the eye suddenly reached the altar on the altar and placed a neat number of magic books. Rogge walked over and took these books and looked at them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These books are plain and elegant, but they are very general. Most of the content inside is how to enhance the belief in the goddess of ice and snow, to reach the stage of blind faith in the shortest time, and then a short paragraph is to tell when the faith is enough. How to sense the existence of O'Reilly, and how to correctly understand her power. In the last part of the book, there are several powerful spells that are not in the magic system. Mora can cause a wide range of enemies to slow down and be hurt by the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty carefully read these books from beginning to end carefully. Mora, like an ice sculpture, stood quietly beside him, waiting quietly for him to finish reading. Finally, Rogge flipped through the last page of these books. He is now completely certain that these books are a complete collection of training for the Olympian gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up. Looking at Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mola faintly smiled and said: "Yes, these books are all written by me. The above method has proved to be very effective. Now silver There are already four goddess of the gods in the holy religion. If there is enough mana power, but the faith is not particularly pious, I will also consider using my charm to help them through the final difficulties. The goddess has a vast power, and I believe that the Holy Church has more and more gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
