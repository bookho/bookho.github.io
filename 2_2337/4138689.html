			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is in a very bad mood today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took more than a month to find a place to live, but in this damn world, there was no place to find a dry and warm spot. It is cold and humid everywhere, and there is always oozing out of the rock. If you are perched on the top of the mountain, the wind blowing will be mixed with countless cobwebs, and in a short time, a thick layer will be applied to the body. This makes it even more uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It blew a whirlwind impatiently, and rolled the turbid, stinking water on the ground outside the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory squatted on the ground and stood up to shake. Water drops, mucus and a few pieces of broken carrion shake off the body. It lamented and looked at his short limbs silently, his tail sweeping away boring. Now, how can there be the slightest prestige? It’s a crocodile!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sincerely misses the hometown. It’s warm everywhere, squatting on hot, black rocks, bathing in a gale filled with sulphur, what a pleasant thing! The lava flame ejected from the cracks in the rock will pass through its body from time to time, and the heat will infiltrate the bone marrow!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind hits, it involuntarily I sneezed and spewed a pale green dragonfly from my mouth. This makes it even worse. I thought that I was also the best race in the devil world: a member of the Abyssal Dragon! Although the strength is counted down in the adult dragons of the family, but as The noble and demon dragon family, Gregory's strength is considered to be strong in any other race. It is a pity that the abyss of the Demon Dragon is powerful, but the number is rare. The whole family is only a hundred dragons, and the adult dragon is only more than 30 heads. Otherwise, the demon kings have long since become a deep dragon. What makes the Demon Dragons feel shameful is that they are tied to the top five races with the shameless, sly, and unconventional Devils! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Boars have a blackmail and insidiousness that is not commensurate with their stupid appearance, the reason why they can become the five major races is that the magic pig is a kind of pole. Will multiply creatures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the dragon is powerful, but the Dragon King will not think that he can fight over 20,000 first-class war pigs, and the dragon dragon 30 adult dragons Correspondingly, it turned out to be a million warrior warriors! As for the number of the whole family of the magic pig, no one has ever said it clearly. Therefore, although not ashamed to be juxtaposed with the magic pigs, and extremely disgusted with them, the Abyss Dragon King will not be stupid enough to open the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a demon dragon, although the strength is relatively low, Gregory can also be reused by the Emperor of the Mozu to become a demon emperor. First class guard. However, it was fainted by these glory. It has never been seen in the Heilongjiang Valley of the Hellfire Basin. It was once blinded by the beauty of the Mozu Palace, and tried to personally protect the emperor’s favorite. Dark banshee. As a result, the Emperor of the Mozu under the wrath put Gregory into the Holy Land of the Devil, the dark magic. The fire of the reincarnation in the magical era has instantly burned its body, but its soul has been miraculously preserved and floated into this space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is the most powerful dragon member of the predecessor. He quickly reorganized his body and became an ugly bone in the outside world. Dragon. What makes it even more dissatisfied is that although its original acid dragon interest is considered to be inferior in the middle of the dragon, but in any case, it is hundreds of times stronger than the wind-toxic property that has no power in front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the devil world or this alien world full of dead objects, poison is useless. Especially in the outside world, can you poison a zombie again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a demon known as a natural and powerful magic, (although that is a predecessor), Gregory actually relies on teeth and claws to go and Zombies, jealousy, ghosts wrestle, which makes it feel extremely shame! Although the weak in the devil world is not qualified for shame, but here is the outside world, it is a shame, no one will have any objection? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes it even more dissatisfied is that in the devil world, the mighty shape and the natural dragon power of the dragon will make other ethnic creatures shun Not too much, but there are always some undead creatures in the outside world to challenge their authority. No, there are two troubles to find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory rushed out of the cave, his wings rushed, but the windy wing only flew with it for dozens of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory puts on a dragon model that he considers to be very powerful. He has two hind legs and a tail support. The upper body rises high and the wings open, welcoming the unwelcome guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its posture is a very prestige fighting posture in the dragon, but Gregory has forgotten that after becoming a bone dragon, its shape has changed. A lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incarnation of the corpse of the corpse, Roger, two thousand kilometers away, the ridiculous undead creature on the far peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange thing like a dragon like a snake. It is obviously short and long legs, but it is hard to use only a quarter of the lower body to land, and the rest is raised high. It is crumbling in the strong winds of the outside world. The wings of it are still wide open, so that it is like a reed in the wind, and it seems to be able to go with the wind at any time. Rogge couldn't help but laughed in his heart, and the gloomy mood was diluted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** There is no sense of humor in Rogge. The powerful fighting instinct allows her to instantly reveal the weakness of this vanity bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Two wings, a strong wind formed in front of her, rushing to Gregorian. The vanity of Gregory's vision is not good at all. When it comes to the outside world, it does not use the spirit to sense the world. It’s hard to see that the two embarrassing sins seem to be not so low-level, especially in memory that seems to have never seen a flying cockroach. But before the poor vanity bone dragon has figured out the situation, a strong wind will pull it up on the spot and throw it away from the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legoli was heavily planted in the rock pile at the bottom of the mountain, and almost broke it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to turn over and sway the dizzy head, and the magical fluctuations from the summit make it heartbreaking! Rog Xun completed several small spells, and several desktop-sized stones floated on the peak and went to the strange bone dragon that had just climbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! Gregory was buried under the boulder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was angry, it finally got angry! The blood of the dragon's pride made Gregory angry. Soaring!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dragon, how can it be stunned by two low-level, squatting, dirty screams! , the rocks are flying, Gregory is flying in the fog and stone!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It just hovered in the air proudly, the mean corpse Just reach out and point it at it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, mean! Unbeatable despicable! They didn’t even say hello, they sneaked up! At least this time Not waiting for Gregory to prepare for the battle, or even waiting for it to complete the elegant, mighty battle in the air! The corpse used the spell on it! Or the most shameless gravity!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory's body space fluctuated in a week, and it immediately doubled every bone. The bone dragon threw a few wings in despair. The head was planted in the ground. When it was still in the air, the fierce sorcerer who chased the emperor’s emperor appeared inexplicably in front of it. ***There was a round of sickle in the hand, and the bone dragon was taken with a knife handle. Go out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! Gregory is proud of just a minute, and he is planted back into its rushing pile of stones.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor bone dragon just poked his head out of the stone pile, and the neck bone was pinched, and an irresistible force drove it out of the stone pile.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***There will be a few laps of the Gregory that are much larger than their own, and then fall heavily on the ground. Rogge begins to hold a spell, a purple The fire of the soul floated to Gregory, ready to use this rare tonic. However, the slashing knife wiped out the purple fire. *** Then he took the bone dragon that was preparing to escape. The neck bone, lift it up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil and the poor bone dragon communicated face to face in this way. Obviously the bone dragon is not full of demons. Intention, *** swayed Gregory from time to time, shaking it and smashing the carrion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride of the genie is in horrible *** Nothing is in front of me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Gregory fully realized this. It looked at the right hand with a little Venus and explored his mouth. Even if it knows that Venus represents the most unequal soul contract, it is helpless. If it bites down, it will definitely not matter if the devil's right hand shines with a metallic luster. Instead, it will crush his skull with his backhand. Gregory has already understood this from the exchanges he has just made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract was completed, and the hand was loose, and Gregory fell to the ground. It climbed up and fell to the feet of the cock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at it all. Although Gregory's strength of this bone dragon is too weak, even worse than the millennium zombie lord once met, the scene is obviously far beyond the scope of Rogge's understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***!" Rogge tried to communicate the *** that was taking the bone dragon away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Returned over and passed on a "Today is here" idea, jumping on the back of the bone dragon, all the way away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge. After a while, I scatter the skeleton and leave the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vase was smashed on the luxurious star stone fireplace. Next to the tragic fate are several crystal goblets, a Renaissance plate and a half bottle of elegant vintage wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre gasped, and after a series of falling things, his mood finally calmed down. Even though there are already a number of strong players, it is still a good way to smash things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want Froya to take risks alone, but keep me here?! I really doubt that my father gives you full responsibility for the affairs of the Bavarian Principality. Is it correct? I decided, if you stop me, don't blame me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David obviously does not put Andrea's threat in the heart On the sand, I sat on the sand and tasted the black tea. I slowly said, "My dear brother, you can of course knock me down and step out of the hall. I only know the temper of my father, since I am responsible for it. Everything in the Principality, and you are assigned to my management, these impulsive practices will only bring you trouble. You don't want to go back to the Skyfire Forest for three years?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the words "Tianhuo Forest", Andrei's obvious expression is somewhat unnatural. He grabbed a thick empire encyclopedia and sneaked at David. David's toes are a little bit, and even people with sand are like sliding on the water, and they easily escape. But the encyclopedia suddenly shot a few pages of paper, smashed on David's head and sprinkled confetti on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David smiled and calmly sorted out the clothes. Since Andre has already obeyed himself in disguise, there is no need to care about this younger brother in small matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to worry about Froya, catching a few dwarves to actually send such a huge force, how can she be in danger? What's more, on the strength of her, but Is a senior magician, but on the sinister....On the cleverness, there are really few people who can be her opponents. Besides, she also has a small team of gold lion knights and Rogge guards, this lineup, even if you go to robbery, no see "It's a success!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre suddenly looked up at the ugly fat man and looked at Froya’s eyes. If you stopped, I really want to kill. he! I don't understand why you value such a waste! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waste, waste? David meditated twice, and he was serious and solemn. He said: "My dear brother, with your 16th-level vindictiveness, is only inferior to Orphee in our generation. There is no limit to the starry sky, and you should always be the only one who stops the water. Why do you and Froya want to kill an insignificant Rogge? In love, you should have more important things! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre mused up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David cleared his clothes and started tea again. "Dear brother, is there anything that is hard to think about?" You and Furoya are rare geniuses, not mortals like brothers and me. Correspondingly, you are more sensitive to the world around you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David paused and said: "You want to kill him because your instincts tell you that Rogge threatens your life." ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derre's face has changed somewhat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is reasonable to say that with his strength, There are dozens of them, and there is no threat to you. But there are only two reasons why you can perceive the threat: one is that he is too embarrassed and hides his strength; the other is that he may have huge potential, which makes you feel uneasy. From the information I have at hand, the first reason is unlikely, then there is only a second reason: he has enough potential to threaten you! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre silent for a moment, faintly said: "There is no potential for the dead. Killing is why, so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David smiles Road: "Even if your master is here, how much do we have to clean up Orpheq and Elysses? It is easy to kill Rogge now, but how do you deal with Orpheq's revenge? Not to mention Bavarian Grand Duke Young It was the generation of the gods of the Alliance. He had run the Principality for 20 years. How many killers were hidden in the dark, we don’t know yet. Dear brother, if you are indiscriminate, if you have broken your father’s affairs, you can Don't blame your brother for not talking about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although David smiled, the sternness in the words made Andrea shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear brother, in fact, with your skills, even if the strength is less than Orfey Roque, but at least his rival. But in Rogge On this small matter, you have gone back and forth several times. In the end, it is just that your arrogance is blaming. Your arrogance and vanity make you refuse to admit the strength of your opponent. Your perverted perfectionism makes you get used to appearance. Judging a person. You feel the threat of Rogge, but you are not willing to admit it. These factors are the key to hinder you from going further. Otherwise, with your talent in martial arts, you may have already reached the sword. St. level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David said a lot in one breath, only sighed and whispered a poem: "Vanity, you are my favorite." The original sin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre slowly stood up and restored calm. He raised his hand, and the broken porcelain and crystals on the ground flew up, gathered in his palm, and turned into a transparent crystal of blue and blue under the stars. He played with this crystal and asked: "What should we do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to do, wait for the father's order."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the fat pig handled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is for me!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Apply? What will the fat pigs do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he refuses, I will The father recruited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" With a bang, the blue crystals smashed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clarke Chamber of Commerce team went all the way west. On the way, a small town secretly unloaded the goods and traveled southwest again. One day later, it finally reached the mine of the Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only after the mines of the Principality of Ron, will you know why Ron has the title of the country of mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clark Chamber of Commerce’s mine stretches across the valley, with more than 3,000 miners, counting women, old people and children, forming a bustling town. . Like most miners and villages, the largest towns in the town are large and small pubs. When the team entered the city, it was already at night, and the pub was the most noisy time. The road has already begun to have drunkards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team entered the city and caused a small sensation. A group of children shouted, jumped, and ran for a long time behind the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Rogge very uneasy is that this small town is a defensive task that is actually a snow and silver fox mercenary group! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ice and snow silver fox mercenaries who had been with Rogge and the 'Dragon and Beauty' knights had been killed, then All the main forces of the ice and snow silver fox were killed by Orpheq, and the ice fox died on the spot. The silver fox and the wind fox are still struggling in the dark prison of Lille. But even if it lost a few thousand elite, the ice and snow silver fox mercenaries still have a huge force of 7,000. Once the identity is exposed, even if the manpower is doubled, it will be dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ice and Snow Silver Fox Mercenary has faded away from Rogge’s memory. I didn’t expect it to come out hunting, but I slammed into the fox nest. coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War through a small team of mercenaries, although Rogge’s seemingly nothing to do, his heart is extremely nervous. The dragons and the beauty and the golden lion knights are also secretly guarded. Well, all the way to safety, the team passed through most of the town, and finally arrived at the headquarters of the Clark Chamber of Commerce in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large hill in the sandbox was painted red, which Jing Ge had just painted. The hills are surrounded by mountains on three sides, and this side of the Clark Mine is covered by a dense forest. The low-lying area between the hills is covered with swamps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo began to introduce this terrain, not the local snake Benjamin. As a big slave trader, Jingo clearly has its own unique source of intelligence. I don't know if it is a tacit agreement between the two old foxes. Benjamin is not very surprised that Jing Ge is so familiar with the terrain of his old nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulus brows, although he already knew that the dwarves would not live on any plains, but the terrain that is completely unsuitable for cavalry operations is obviously large. Out of his expectations. He protested a few words with dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you say that the knights under your command can only fight at once? This is not the quality that a first-class knight should have! Jingo smiled and said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the scornful look of Flora, Paulus was furious. "Nonsense! We are the best, and the best fighter! Do you want to see my sword skills? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slain warriors were long in the battle, and the "Dragon and Beauty" knights who came from the city were immediately able to get down. In the forest The action is not a problem, but the problem is that the kingdom of the dwarves has always gone deep into the ground. No one knows how deep their underground kingdom will be dug and where it will extend. It is really easy to surround the blockade until the net is exhausted.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo said: "The reconnaissance and the warriors on the ground can be competent, but the question is how much the dwarf tribes are in the underground, and we have no way of knowing. He said that he looked at Rogge and Froja.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This underground reconnaissance would have been difficult, but the magicians were all in a variety of ways, at least Most mage pets are reconnaissance type. Powerful as Froya, no one knows how many mysterious spells and magic weapons she has.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria Frowning, said: "I don't have any good way to do this. Perhaps a wide range of ground fissures or even earthquakes will be a solution. They will have tunnels leading to the outside world and will also be shaken. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who face each other. If the witches say that there are several magnitude 7 earthquakes, the dwarves can’t escape, but everyone doesn’t want to take slaves. It’s good to collect the corpse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sneaked a sneak peek at Rogge, and Rogge had no choice but to take a step forward and find a beautifully colored glass. The bottle is also engraved with a lifelike wolf. The bottle is full of pale gold, unable to hold the rushing liquid. Even through the bottle, you can clearly feel the powerful magic contained in this bottle of medicine.<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighs: "The dwarfs are as dense as a spider web. I don't think it's easy to block them all." However, they always have to drink water. I have some ‘the curse of the fallen gods’ here, which can make the people who drink it extremely weak and weak, and the effect is particularly long lasting! As long as the bottle of medicine can be underwater to the water source of the dwarves, oh... as long as the potion is drunk, even if the dwarves run away, they will never escape far, and they will catch up with them in five days! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," Rogge added: "This thing is colorless and tasteless, forgive the dwarves are not aware of it!" Once they get a little bit, the infinite dwarfs will become more vulnerable than the young elves! "There is nothing more than a small bottle in this hand, but it can be almost Infinite dilution without affecting the effect! This bottle will go down and fill the groundwater veins of the dwarf hills in three days! At that time, no dwarf could escape our palms! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people looked at Rogge’s green and shining bottle, and the mood was extremely complicated. This thing is worthy of "the curse of the fallen god is that it is a little bit, and the ending can be Imagine it! With Rogge some festivals such as Paulus's heart, he made up his mind and decided not to eat anything that Rogge had ever touched. He had a good relationship with the fat man. For example, the old fox Benjamin was thinking about how to get one or two bottles to himself. Hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that everyone doesn’t understand that such a bottle of things can be said to be worthless, how did it get to Rogge’s hands? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate is the deepest and most intelligent in the aristocratic youth. He looked at Froya with thoughtful thought. The little goblins immediately noticed, laughing back and looking back, but the chill in his eyes made Kate shudder, and hurriedly moved his eyes to the side, desperately mourning the name of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
