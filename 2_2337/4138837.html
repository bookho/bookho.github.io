			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Heaven in Heaven, Chapter 10 Life is like a play<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 10 Life is like a play<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked up at the sky and the tumultuous Weina and the Silver Dragon King, and the mystery of the heart was always lingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his poor knowledge of the dragon, he also knows that the most dangerous places of the dragon are the tyrannical power and nearness of the super-sized body. Abnormal defense, as well as breath and dragon magic. The previous points will gradually decline with the age of the old, only the dragon language magic will not. Think about it too. Which of the big mentors in the Terran is not the old man who is trembled? If it is melee, then no one is a fat opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina and the Dragon King fight until now, they just can't stop trying each other. The Silver Dragon King only relied on the most primitive attack methods of the Dragons, such as biting, clawing and tail sweeping, to deal with Wella, while Wella continued to work hard with the Silver Dragon King. Under the giant force of Yinlong, her seemingly delicate figure was shot and hit again and again. But after flying dozens of meters, Wella will stabilize his body and rush to the Silver Dragon King again if nothing happens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly, Wella’s defense is not much worse than the Silver Dragon King. The Silver Dragon King’s attack is enough to easily tear a heavy cavalry. On the face of Wella, it is completely painless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the dragons watching the battle, and the uneasiness in my heart was even stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not think that the act of ‘the pure red anger’ is just an accident, just as the Terrans look down on the dwarves and the orcs, and the Dragons also look down on the Terran. If the Silver Dragon King is really defeated, it is hard to say whether these dragons can abide by the agreement and not leave them difficult. Even the high dragons such as Yinlong, Black Dragon and Colorful Dragon are really very particular about their status. It is enough for them to sit down and watch the lesser-minded inferior dragons and Roger and others. The fat man estimates that if there are three dragons together, they will have to escape immediately, and they may not be able to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He succeeded in reinventing a red dragon with a carefully prepared 'Hell Envoy's Fury' The situation is really dangerous. The violent dragons will not be so scared by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is close to Hughes, whispering: "Elders of Shusi. In your opinion, these dragons really only watch the battle?" Is there any dispute, is it possible to pull the black dragon to our side? Also, what kind of dragon species are the three-headed dragon Istarazze and the colorful dragon tedreia? I have never heard of this. Weird dragon?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Hughes to answer, the beautiful colorful dragon and the horrible three-headed dragon turned their heads and stared at Rogge . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are eight dragon heads of different colors on the top of the gaze, this pressure is not experienced by Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man laughed a few times. The voice couldn’t tell the ugly, and I didn’t know that these two strange dragons understood what he meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point the entire rift suddenly dimmed, a strange feeling of passing the soul of all creatures, countless tiny gravel have flowed into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Wind and Rift, heaven and earth seem to have turned upside down at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green dragon flapped a few fleshy wings, which stopped the body from floating upwards, and other dragons and humans stood in the same place. . Focus on the battle in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge now has all the power consumed, and the whole person is weak. It was only by the darkness that Androni secretly sent him that he could resist the upward buoyancy and not be ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge shadow shrouded the entire 'wind anger and rift', and the sun hanging high in the sky was dull at the moment. But in the shadows, a new golden sun rose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dazzling golden glow. Viva is a vague figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared and saw that the golden patterns on the demon lotus floated away from the armor as if they were life, instead of slowing around Weina Rotate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower dragons were a little nervous and moved. Now gravity does not change very strongly. Under this level of gravity, all the dragons can move freely. The problem is that now Verna's attack is just the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire rift is shrouded under the control of Wella, just the kind of pressure that does not contain. It is enough to make these low-level dragons panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention. Fighting in a space of gravitational uncertainty, it is already awkward to move and move more powerfully. If there is no restraint, the ordinary dragon will only be beaten in front of the unpredictable Weina. Although the dragon's defense is strong, it can withstand several attacks by the light angels? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon king wings have been unfolded, its huge body steadily parked in the air, and the long screams began to sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After tempting each other, Wella finally gave up gravity control, and Silver Dragon King began to use Dragon language magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina, completely enveloped in the golden light, still seems to be still in place, but a little golden light above the Silver Dragon King suddenly lights up, and another Wella appears there. In the golden light, then the prison gun flashed a little electric mans, and hit the silver dragon king who was launching the dragon language magic. Then, dozens of golden light one by one lit up around the Silver Dragon King, every point of the golden light appeared the figure of Wella, a little bit of electric mans almost indefinitely hit the silver dragon king! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that this is the speed at which Weina’s movement is too fast, and it will make people feel like she is appearing in dozens of places at the same time. It's just that the speed is so fast that Rogge's eyes can also have the illusion that it can't be done by ordinary strong people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Dragon King completely ignores the attack of Wella, but is concentrating on the dragon language magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong’s body is almost immune to magic, and the dozens of electric fires that Weina waved are numerous, but they are still compared with the body of the Silver Dragon King. Insignificant, an electric fire is not even as big as a scale of the Silver Dragon King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge’s eyes were so powerful that he discovered that when the first electric fire floated close to the body of the Silver Dragon King. The silver dragon scales around the drop point were stunned by the powerful energy contained in the electric fire! Then the electric fire saw the thick and hard dragon scales as if there was no real illusion, and directly fell into the body of the Silver Dragon King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the place where the electric fire did not enter suddenly burst, the flesh and blood with a few dragon scales squirting far! Not only was Rogge and others stunned, but the dragons watching the battlefield began to whisper uneasy, and even the three black dragons could not help but swing the huge dragon tail. If the magical defense power, the black dragons are stronger than the silver dragon. But the strength is also strong and limited. Wei Na slammed the electric fire and did not know what the nature was, the amazing lethality and did not say. Their most horrible place seems to completely ignore the dragon's defense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the silver dragon king burst into a bloody fog, and hundreds of scales flew out! Only for the first time to play hard, the Silver Dragon King was actually hit by Wei Na! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost unbearable pain caused the huge body of the Silver Dragon King to tremble in the air, but its sound of dragon magic is still stable and gentle, completely Not affected by dozens of traumas on the body, just as this body is not it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wella’s wave of attacks ended, Silver Dragon King also completed its Dragon Language Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena also took a trip. She did not think that the Silver Dragon King would hardly attack her attack in order to complete the Dragon language magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at the faint silver mask that hangs over the silver dragon king, the dragons shake again! The three faucets of the three-headed dragon Istarazze gathered together and seemed to be whispering something. The Black Dragons also quietly stepped back a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly discovered that his own mental power could not penetrate the layer of light silver mask. He saw that the rubble that fluttered in the sky touched the seemingly inconspicuous mask, and it fell silently and silently until it came out of the scope of the mask, and then floated back into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you say it is within this reticle range. Is Weina’s gravity attack ineffective? Rogge was shocked by his conclusion. You know that there is no magic that can effectively block gravity control, whether in the black crystal of Elysian or in the memory of Elgera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is one of the three spells that represent the highest achievement of Dragon's magic and is at the top of the Dragon Pyramid. Absolute defense enchantment. It is said that in the enchantment range, all magic effects will be eliminated."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That means..." Rogge said slowly: "After releasing this magic, the opponent can only fight with the dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Hughes nodded. "And within the enchantment, magic or skills such as enhanced defense will be invalidated. That is, you can only use the most primitive form. Fight with the dragon. Of course, the solution is not without. It is the most powerful dragon in history. I heard that the time to maintain this magic will not exceed three days. So the best way is to hide aside and wait for this. Magic is invalid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's face is ugly. In the original form and the dragon fight? In addition to the dragon, there are only legendary ancient giants who can do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe as Hughes said. It’s also a good idea to hide and wait for the magic to fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But." Rogge suddenly asked: "How did you know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The elders of Xiusi did not change their minds and calmly said: "In the glory days, the Elf Empire had captured four dragon cities before and after, and had faced several ancient dragons that could use the absolute defense enchantment. These deeds were detailed. Recorded and kept to this day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned and asked: "So what method did the elves use to defeat these dragons?" He did not ask the results of the war. Because of course, the Dragon City has been captured, and these ancient dragons must be the losers of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes brought a trace of fascination: "The elf empire at that time was extremely powerful, and the power of the country was created, and the artifacts that had special effects on the dragons were far more than Pieces, the dragon-throwing arrow that can kill the dragon is even more tens of thousands. Several great elves, Wang Heli, are enough to defeat any dragon, not to mention the thousands of elves' most elite marksman assisted. Wait until the magic of the empire The teachers succeeded in creating the Lacalas Crystal Wars, which is just melee, and we are not afraid of these ancient dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is... ..." Rogge said: "Before the Lacalas Crystal Wars were created, the elves must combine the power of all the great elves to defeat the ancient dragons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is the case. Dealing with such monsters can only be swarmed up. According to historical records, the most powerful ancient dragon has a total of more than 7,000 dragons and dragons before and after, which fell to the ground."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the sky, Weina’s hands are cited, and her left hand is again Erratic space pranced number of cutting lines. She turned around the Silver Dragon King several times in a flash, waving the space cutting line and not attacking the Silver Dragon King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these thin lines disappeared without being traced once they were put into absolute defensive enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner lightning back hundreds of meters. With a wave of prison guns, dozens of gravity are accompanied by a faint wave of light to the Silver Dragon King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all her attacks. They all melted in the silver mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon King is gentle and authentic: "Our battle, now we can really start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;威Na is cold and cold: "Do you think that the absolute defense will really be the same as its name? Is it absolutely not broken? Very good, I will let you see, what you are proud of, the best dragon language magic can Can't help me! Since you want to fight, then we will fight well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden volatility in the sky: "Weina, only power It’s the supreme. Let me come!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted quietly. Dao: "It's a lot of trouble to clean up this old dragon, but I can do it! You take the opportunity to learn how the light angels fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Power It's enough to overwhelm everything! You let!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner angered: "I have never lost in the face of any opponent with the same strength! Combat is art It is not possible to rely on barbarism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, I was limited by the body and could not exert my strength! If he still exists, try again. Fengyue, this time you are not allowed to intervene!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although you didn't answer. But our decisive battle has already begun." The silver dragon king's wings spread to the sky without results. Weina in the middle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes on the mask of the demon lotus suddenly illuminate, and the small mouth is one more, giving a burst of shocking soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loosened her hand and threw the jail gun back into the alien space, then the fiber pointed to the silver dragon king volley! The dark space that had shrouded the entire 'wind anger and rift' suddenly shrank. Finally, it becomes a thin layer, which is tightly attached to the Silver Mask of Silver Dragon King! Numerous madly attacked the defensive enchantment of the Silver Dragon King. The body of the Silver Dragon King trembled, and dozens of wounds and wounds all over the body spewed dozens of blood lines at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long, clear and screaming, the beautiful demon lotus rushed into the defensive enchantment of the Silver Dragon King, fighting with the Silver Dragon King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of gravitational aid, although the action of the demon lotus is still incredibly fast, but it is no longer the time when it is hidden and completely unmeasurable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the air and the madness of the body and the size of the dragon against the dozens of times, Rogge only feels the chest is getting more and more stagnation, It seems that there is a huge stone weighing more than 10,000 pounds pressed on it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye. The fierce battle has come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large dragon blood, dozens of dragon scales have fallen from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just. With the falling, there are several pieces of broken demon lotus leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's face is white. Reaching out and taking out a small magic scroll from his arms, he is ready to unfold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger Master! Don't be impulsive!" Hughes held Rogge's hand, but the latter half seemed to be against Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Androni’s body floated in the air, and suddenly it seemed to be possible to rush to the sky at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the beautiful figure has been unable to fall from the air. On her body, a large piece of silver flame is still burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a drop of about 100 meters, and the demon lotus turned a little and once again stood in the air. She clenched her hands and shouted again and again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another golden light is transmitted through the broken demon, and the black ribbon once again protrudes from the nail, and the broken nail is slow. Slowly re-grow intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon king who is far away from her has been breathing through this period, and the state is much better, but the resilience is obviously worse than that of a rival like a rebirth. Far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful eyes on the mask of the demon lotus light up again, and she screams and rushes into the silver mask of the Silver Dragon King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the fight is even more tragic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon King let her tear open two pieces of dragon scales, and then take the opportunity to bite the demon lotus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rows of sharp giant teeth rubbed the leaves of the demon lotus, making a bitter sound, and then a large piece of dragon flame came out of the gap, Like a burning fireworks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver mouth of the Dragon King, even more and more bite open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful figure struggling in the giant tooth and the flame, is holding the upper arm of the Silver Dragon King with one hand, and holding the lower teeth with one hand, just like this, The silver dragon king's giant mouth is slowly opened! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person and one dragon separated again, this time both sides managed to maintain their bodies and float in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
