			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elders of the Sisters scared away the silver miracle Nicholas, a delicate and gorgeous carriage drove out of the city of the gods, toward Dre Ston went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage is extremely fine, and it is pulled by four strange creatures like deer-like horses. The elf who drives is also the master of this road. He drove the carriage and ran in the mountains without roads, and found the barely able to walk through the rugged terrain without any difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage has a small compartment, but like the suspension on two wheels, letting the wheels rise and fall, it is always balanced. In the face of the road that is difficult to pass, the creatures of the four-headed cart will simultaneously force the whole carriage to fly, and after gliding through the air for a short distance, it will be light and will continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a beautiful elf sitting in the carriage, her pale gold is like a golden waterfall that flows down slowly, and her skin is ivory. There was a bit of sadness in the delicate face, and there was a trace of tiredness. It may be that there is a chill in the vagueness. She narrowed her neck slightly and wrapped her thick clothes tighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is like a kitten, smashed into a ball because of the cold, looks soft, slender, and pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it seems that she is very tired after a long time. Her body was soft and gently leaned against a man sitting beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is round and round, and his clothes are beautiful, and his face is ambiguous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great magician is dressed up by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved to make the elf more comfortable, smiled and said: "Tired, wind butterfly. But it doesn't matter, soon we can It’s time to rest. You see, it’s been more than a month, you can already walk down the ground, so don’t worry, your injury will be completely good. Staying in the city of the gods for so long, you are also boring Is it OK? Wait until we get to Dresden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is indeed a little tired, she closed her eyes slightly, you are so Busy, I will always find time to see me. You are not afraid that I really fell in love with you, and then dragged you to hell together? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rughaha, I am afraid of a smile! But so many people want me to go to hell, I am not living well? How many are you?" "You are a lot less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly moved again and put itself in a more comfortable position, whispered: "Rogge Adult, I know, you are going to treat me like Ajani. But my martial skills can't be restored. If you can't recover, then there is no difference between me and a normal elf. You never do it. The use of things, wasting so much time on me, it is better to spend more on the thoughts of Androni and Froya! They will help you more, aren't they?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog gently stroked the long, beautiful ears of the wind butterfly and smiled: "How can I be that kind of person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Obviously, you are." Wind Butterfly's voice is getting lower and lower, and finally, she fell asleep on Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the little face of the butterfly, Rogge surprisingly feels a bit quiet and awkward. He slowly relaxed from the tight nerves all the time. The cabin is warm, luxurious and comfortable, forming a strong contrast with the snowy peaks outside the window. Rogge listened to the net long breath of the wind butterfly, and gradually felt a bit tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the dream, Rogge suddenly hoped that this wonderful journey would be better and longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let go of yourself, open your whole heart to him, trust him completely, rely on him..." In the deepest part of the wind butterfly consciousness, A voice is echoing over and over again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge this time back to the city of the gods is not just to bring back the butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes has told him everything about Nicholas revenge, which naturally includes Nicholas has mastered the ultimate transformation, can be incarnate at any time or Elf thing. In addition to the true strength of Nicholas, Hughes said the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if there is a person in the sanctuary around, it is not impossible to fight with Nicholas. Now *** has stabilized his position on the other side of the world. Although he has commanded her not to move, if he is really worried, he still has this self-confidence and will not sit idly by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not know whether Nicholas can still maintain the terrorist defense of the Silver Dragon form after using the morphological change. However, according to Hughes, the level deformation can completely become the target creature, and can have all the characteristics of the target creature, and the characteristics before deformation can be strengthened to the target creature to a large extent. But in any case, Nicholas, who has been reduced in size, can never completely replicate all the characteristics of Silver Dragon. If this is the case, the reduced version of Yinlong can really be invincible. In this way, in fact, after the use of deformation, Nicholas' overall strength has not improved, but has declined. Well, after the deformation, the silver dragon immediately turned from the bright to the dark, and became extremely bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, listening to Hughes’s words, Nicholas has not been out of the Moonlight City for more than three hundred years, and it’s a must for humans or elves. As far as I know, this may be the only point that can be utilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's more, how does it know that it is my wife who killed me? It's not good, just pay two people to go out and sin." Think of it, Rogge decided. Quite a lot. Of course, the fat man still does not know that the glorious image surrounded by the magical light shield on his face on the same day has already been deeply engraved in the soul of Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time back to the city of the gods, Rogge still wants to see how the newest researches of the longevity tree tribe, which is good at architecture, are prepared. . Recently, several new magics have been successfully opened. After the initial test, Rogge was extremely satisfied with the results. In the future, I will only wait for the battle, let the enemy eat a bit of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a winter, the gryphons of the elves finally adapted to the climate of the north and were able to move normally. Rogge had more than a dozen scouts and liaison officers who could fly. As for the other beasts of the tribes who were not frozen in the cold winter, they were barely alive and were struggling to adapt to the climate of the North, and they could not be used too much for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to watch the wind butterfly and left, but Hughes must have him bring the butterfly to Dresden. The wind butterfly suffered a serious injury and was completely unable to travel like this. However, Xiusi made such a carriage, which made the trip in the barren hills become a rare enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base of the carriage is engraved with a double magic array, one for weight reduction and the other for balance. The wizard's exquisite craftsmanship is perfectly reflected in this carriage, no matter where the two wheels are, the car will remain in a generally horizontal state. There is also a magical array hidden on the floor inside the compartment. The heat is slowly coming from the foot, which makes people feel comfortable in this cold winter. When the summer is hot, the magical array at the top of the car will start, and the cool air will turn the car into a paradise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the four-color seven-color deer of the cart was originally a very powerful animal in the forest, and it is said that there is still a bit of blood in the unicorn. Relationship is one of the beasts of the seven-color deer tribe. I want to use them to pull the car, and only the elf who has been training for many years or Druid can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the art of the elf is unique in the world. Even if you don't consider the value of the jewelry itself decorated on the car, this handwork alone is absolutely valuable. Hughes knows Rogge's habitual character. In the eyes of the experts, this carriage under the cover of concealment is a priceless city, and luxury is unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Rogge did not reason to dislike this carriage, and there is no reason not to take the wind butterfly away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, this magical car carried Rogge and the wind butterfly back to Dresden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Principality of Ale is a small country, but the CEO of the Grand Duke has seen a lot of good things for more than 30 years, seeing this carriage parked at At the entrance of the Grand Duke, it was still shocked. The boss spent a long time, until Rogge opened the door, he reacted, rushed to the carriage in front of the young servant, to personally serve the great magician Rogge. From the tens of meters of sprinting degree, I can't see that he is already an old man of more than 60 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge lifted the lazy and tired wind butterfly from the car, the beautiful face of the butterfly once again shocked all the presence. people. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly has always been hiding under the helmet when he followed Rogge, and he always wears armor. It looks like a heroic feeling. It is more than beautiful. But this time she did not hide her face, and she was seriously injured. She couldn’t wear any armor, and she finally showed her unparalleled style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is a bit strange about the return of Roger's singles, it is naturally a bad luck to think about the robbers on the road if he is the idea of ​​such a great magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the wind butterfly to his room. The boss and more than a dozen maids followed closely behind, fearing that they would not serve well. The head of the Grand Duke government was not low. On that day, even Hilley had to tie him a few points. But he has already been more than 60 years old, and he hopes to live more than three or five years. The great magician like Rogge is obviously his hope. What's more, the Grand Palace has changed its owner. It is the old man who wants to go when the newcomer wants to come. In order to hold the position in front of him, the boss has already put all the old bones out and put out all the skills to serve the Grand Duke of Cricky when he was young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Auntie?" asked Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She went to inspect a batch of newly created swords. Not that I have a mouthful, but she is already pregnant, and she has to work so hard every day, but not for children. Ok," the boss said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded, and Auntie had a fascination with the power of power. As for the child in her stomach is dead or alive, Rogge will never care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After setting the wind butterfly, Rogge went to the newly built temple of the Eye of Wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the day of wisdom and the date of Rogge. On this day, the Virgin Mora will summon the goddess O'Reilly to the world for the first time in the new temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue in a casual suit stood silently in front of the new temple of the Eye of Wisdom for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Rogge on the same day, Mora immediately picked up a huge and magnificent house in the north of the city as the location of the new temple. This house was originally a small and well-known wealthy merchant in the Holy Alliance. It would be expensive to buy it. When Rogge heard about the incident, he just smiled. Even if the eye of wisdom can afford the money, the person will not sell it or two things. According to the impression of the year, Rogge determined that the eye of wisdom would not be too rich. Now that time has passed, how can this 90% of the churches of cults be so fast? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the news came and surprised Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of Wisdom acquired the ownership of the house without a penny. The reason is very simple, the Virgin Mora inspired the rich businessman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this incident, Rogge asked Froia to quietly meet the rich businessman. "He has a natural charm." The fairy who is a master of magic has reached a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural charm effect is far longer than the ordinary charm magic, and the power is not comparable to ordinary magic. This ability is extremely rare. According to Rogge, only a few high-level forest fairies have such talents. This ability has appeared on a human woman, and it is incredible. It seems that there is a little bit of forest leprechaun on Mora. In this way, the eye of wisdom is so fast in the Principality of Layton, and it makes sense. At least O'Reilly chose a correct god for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this ability is destined to be ineffective in Rogge, who is determined to be almost paranoid. However, there are several ordinary people who have undergone such tempering as Rogge, not to mention the enormous spiritual power like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a short period of time, the Eye of Wisdom thoroughly transformed the house into a temple. This degree of transformation is almost a miracle. But as long as you think about thousands of people who work day and night, you won’t be surprised by this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge mixed in the crowd, silently watching the miraculous rise of the Temple of Wisdom. The whole temple is tall, heavy and calm. But the huge, bloody eyes on the front made Rogge faintly uncomfortable. With this mark, the entire temple reveals an evil taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the huge main hall, the incomparably large courtyard is also the reason why Mora looks at it. The Eye of Wisdom has announced that today will be the day of the coming of the true God. Now the whole courtyard is full of people, and Rogge is roughly estimated to have nearly 10,000 people! In this way, one in every ten people in Dresden is crowded here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From these people’s arguments, Rogge knows that there are many people who come to see the excitement, and most people are suspicious of the true God who claims the eyes of wisdom. In the era when the Church of Light is gradually leading the Big Six, the days of the little sects are getting more and more sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Virgin Mora has appeared at the gate of the main hall, behind her, dozens of followers wearing black robes. These people are still like what Rogge saw on the day. Most of the faces are hidden under the black robe's hat, a mysterious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cult is a cult!" Rogge was a bit funny, but then he sensed that there were not weak magical fluctuations in the eight people behind Moura. Some can't smile. It seems that the eyes of the eyes of wisdom are not thin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the courtyard is full of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the appearance of the Virgin Mora, the crowd was quiet and waiting for her to announce the beginning of the ceremony. But Mora stood still, her eyes consciously or unintentionally searching in the crowd, seemingly looking for someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quietly mobilized brute force, easily and quietly pushed forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has the heart to try out the strength of Mora and start to pick up the magic. Mora, who saw the high above, did not respond at all. He let go of his heart and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Mora’s face was bright, and the clear eyes fell on Rogge’s body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart leaps and leaps, and I don’t know what method Mora used to find herself in nearly 10,000 people. Does she really have a god? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the dreamy woman of the gray robes on the day, the fat man couldn’t help but sweat and his legs were soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, Laozi is coming to talk about the conditions, not what she is fighting for! Even if it is a fight, Lao Tzu is not a way!" Ge secretly cheered on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is well prepared today, and he still has a card in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreoni and Froya have seen much more about this cult ritual, and there is no interest at all. Rogge just didn't want to let them come. The power of O'Reilly, whom Eroger saw on the same day, was of no use even if they were present. Only the talents in the sanctuary may be confronted with O'Reilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the old things of Xiusi are also, maybe they can cope with the mysterious secrets of the old fox god. One day, Lao Tzu will squeeze out his old bottom. Rogge thought for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crowd, a clergyman of the Eye of Wisdom gestured to Rogge, and then struggled to crowd the side door of the temple in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked up to the sky, faintly sensing the breath of ***, and finally settled in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has the courage to follow the guide of the eye of wisdom, disappearing into the side door of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main entrance of the shrine is originally a ten-meter-high hall that can be used for large-scale banquets and dances. Now it has been greatly expanded to become a believer. The main place for prayer and worship. Due to the completion of the work, the smell of wood and the smell of paint floated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, those who are qualified to sit in the lobby are the most devout believers who have joined the Eye of Wisdom. In the presence of God, faith is the only standard for measuring everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge led by the guides, from the side door directly to the altar behind. The prayer room where the altar is located is built up in several rooms to accommodate the huge summoning magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead person brought Rogge to the rogue adult before the altar, and the great goddess O'Reilly had passed the goddess through the Mora. You are the only person who can stay here during her arrival. I am going out, please wait for the coming of the true God. In addition to the three or five people of the Virgin Mora and the Elder Karmon, you are the only one who can witness the true God! Really lucky! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the talks, the guide is extremely embarrassed by the words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is undecided He has already seen O'Brien, but unfortunately it was really terrible on the day, and afterwards, he thought that he was a person who had seen the true God, but he still knew nothing about God. Maybe this is the world. God knows the most, should it be the pope? His bright church does not know how many angels are hiding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world suddenly stopped quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds inside and outside the temple suddenly felt something at the same time, all closed their mouths, and their eyes were involuntarily focused on the big bloody eyes on the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a silence, a little boy’s sharp and high voice suddenly sounded: “I saw it! That eye blinked! I saw it! I see ..." He immediately stunned his mother. The simple woman hurriedly prayed, and as for whether the prayer was related to the goddess O'Reilly, she would not care so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of everyone outside the temple are concentrated on the huge eyes. This time, everyone clearly felt that the eye, like life, was overlooking the people below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people were so shocked that they couldn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little milky white light illuminates in the pupil of that huge eye, and in the blink of an eye, this light is already bright and dazzling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some believers of devout believers have been so excited that they are too hard to fall to the ground, tears in their eyes, and can’t stop talking in the mouth of the goddess O'Reilly. Prayer of the prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the temple of the whole eye of wisdom began to shine. In the shrine, it is like a landslide and tsunami, and the Holy Power is constantly improving! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred power of one heart emerges from the Temple of Wisdom of Wisdom, washing the soul and soul of all. In the sacred power of Tao Tian, ​​people panic, just like sinking into the deepest sea in the stormy night. However, the sacred wave has passed, and they are now safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred flame of the milky white rises from the top of the temple and sprays directly into the air for dozens of meters before it gradually dissipates. In the huge sacred flame, there are dozens of little angels flying in faintness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the incomparable hymns sounded from the depths of everyone’s souls. The sound of this singer is as loud as the world, nowhere else. Noise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All came suddenly and suddenly went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold, icy, sound that does not belong to this world arrogance sounds in the depths of everyone's soul:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The believer will be redeemed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a god, all the people trembled on the ground, more devout Excited and crying, it is difficult to be so close to the true God in the lifetime of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The believers!" the holy woman Mora shouted, her sweet voice was like singing a sacred, solemn aria, "The Great Goddess O'Reilly has just arrived in this world! We have used our own soul to feel the majesty of God and the glory of God! Now, let us remember this moment and praise the great goddess O'Reilly!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A holy light rises from the foot of Mora. In the light column, Mora slowly rose into the air, her eyes sparkled two golden light, a golden long in the light pillar without wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's voice became incomparably long, long, solemn, with endless remnants, shaking everyone's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of the enormous Holy Power, Mora’s talented ability has been enhanced by a few times. Every time she mourns a praise to O'Reilly, someone will follow it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between moments, the sound of the hymn of the goddess O'Reilly, who is neat and tidy, has been heard throughout Dresden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the most devout believers in the inner hall of the temple, they are at the center of the surging force of the Holy Spirit, all devoutly lying on the ground, desperately trying to put every point A drop of experience is engraved in the depths of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge plucked all his courage and tried to stabilize his softer knees so that he would not fall to the ground. He was so brave, and even barely able to look at him with a gray robe floating in the air and quietly looking at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came to talk about the conditions, not to fight!" The fat man repeatedly angered himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black and silver Ao Le Reich is as beautiful as a dream, Rogge’s gaze wants to stay on her face, but always involuntarily leans to one side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Innocent." O'Reilly broke the calm, and the anger under her cold voice provoked Rogge's hair to erect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great....Great O'Reilly, although you are a god of great honor, but...but now I am not your believer. You I should use your kindness and tolerance to call me so that I can work for the eyes of wisdom. However, I refuse to give my faith to any god." Rogge’s first few sentences are stuttering, but when I get to the back, I want to go anyway. The words have already been said to go out, and the heart is even more fluent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled the situation with O'Reilly on the same day, faintly feeling that she did not intend to kill herself, so she was so much older that she could continue to bargain. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ao Leilei's eyebrows condense a small group of storms, seeing Rogge dry, a heart almost stopped beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s voice became very dry: "Great O'Reilly, you are a true god, who wouldn't be very embarrassed to personally do it to me? It will... very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty I remember that the goddess does not seem to care much about her identity. Although she did not start on the same day, she did move her feet, and she was absolutely not light. Perhaps it is a gentle foot in God, but with the fat physique of Warcraft, ** is actually swollen for several days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about the foot of the day, Rogge’s heart was so swaying that he couldn’t help but succumb to the heart of O'Reilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still a pair of barefoot like ice, snow and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, a pair of milky white glare lights up on the toes, and Rogge’s eyes burned with a huge pain, for a while, Nothing can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed his eyes and held back without screaming, and finally opened his eyes. His eyes are red and swollen, and tears are flowing. He was afraid of angering Audrey Reich again, looking straight at O'Reilly's silver plaque. It is a pity that in her tears, her face has become blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man piled up the most charming smile of the goddess of goddess, your god Wei I have already learned! I have nothing to offend you! But your beauty is not what this world should have, so I will be rude! Having said that, if you see your beauty, you are not rude, and you are really rude and offended. Don't be angry, I will say something right. As a humble master of secular power, I will assist your followers and your religion in all areas within my power to allow them to freely preach in the territories under my jurisdiction, including, of course, my current and future territories. However, as a humble servant of your loyalty, can you give me a little reward? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?" She asked faintly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger spirit is a priceless treasure. And I am just a humble vulgar, I only want to be compared to faith. To be a little bit insignificant, gold coins. As a price to fully support the eyes of wisdom, I want to levy a little tax on the income generated by the church in my territory..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; Ao Leilei's calm eyes saw Rogge uncomfortable, he always felt that the goddess did not seem to deceive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurryed: "Of course, of course, this tax can also be levied. In order to better protect your followers, can you give me dozens... A few... ah no! An artifact is good! Of course, a dead person can't protect your followers. Although I am a good magician, there are so many strong ones among my enemies. Can you Give me one or two divine powers? If you are afraid of trouble, then the natural charm of the Mora saint is also good! Also, if my life is threatened, you must not sit back and ignore it, right!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, there is a goddess who is coming directly, who is he afraid of? For nearly a hundred years, those gods who have been worshipped by the world for a long time have not heard of personally coming to this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart couldn’t help but start to feel proud. He counted his enemies one by one, and finally thought of the pope, and suddenly he made a sudden attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are courageous, dare to lie to me so straightforwardly." Ao Lei Reh once again condensed the storm, this time, the dark storm Thunder and lightning have already been shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s legs are soft, but they stand firm and tremble: “The great O'Reilly, your gods and miracles are great, However, compared with the miraculous miracles of the Church of the Light, it is still very inferior. And I am also a weak magician. You have just arrived. If you want to show your followers, then my assistance will come to you. It is very important to say that this condition is not high, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all these words, he is already sweating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you so disrespectful, are you afraid that I will punish you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly looks up The goddess, although I am only a humble mortal, but it is not the power of no resistance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly know. "Ao Leilei suddenly smiled, and the room seemed to be bright in this moment. The whole temple shook a little, and Rogge was in a dizzy mood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You are so bold, is there because they are there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Reilly's volley volleyed and snorted: "Call!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stunned Rogge, the bone dragon and the demon lotus suddenly emerged from the void, just like being invisible The hand is hard to pull out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man certainly does not know that the current demon is completely empty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Bound! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon lotus that just lifted the death knives in silence, was completely set in the air, as if it had never been moved.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog only felt that a chill was coming out from the bottom of his heart, and his teeth began to fight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;O'Reilly's hand slowly draws a beautiful arc from the air...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreating! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, I didn't mean to offend you..." The bone dragon mourned and disappeared into the void.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil struggled for a few times, and gradually became distorted and finally disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge tried desperately to summon* **And Bone Dragon, of course, he couldn't get any response.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the same day, O'Reilly flew to Roger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her dreamy face, the fat man is still standing, but it is already scared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Are you afraid of me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gegg! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can talk again. People in this world express piety, what is the usual way to do it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gag! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, it is donation! So are you willing to donate? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge desperately nods his head!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Your donation is set at 200,000 gold coins per year for the time being! You are very capable. At every step of the eye of wisdom, Mora will ask for your opinion. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
