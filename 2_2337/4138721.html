He felt the coolness of the wind in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s already autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dess sighed, and after he had inexplicably hurt twice in his heart, he knew that Karajan and Chrisma were already fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death was not a terrible thing for them to come to the angels. After the death of the angel, the soul will also receive the redemption of the heavens, return to the artifacts in the hands of the pope: in the door of all beings, and then become a reincarnation angel again. If the reincarnation angel dies again, it will turn into unconscious energy and return to heaven. But this time it has been nearly a month, and the door of all beings has not seen their souls returning. Dess faintly felt that the two of them could never return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three great giants of the Last Judiciary, who have been infinitely beautiful, are now left alone. Recalling the scenery of the past, he could not help but feel infinite. He used to be so ambitious and thought he was close to success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once thought that the power of the Big Three could safely eat Augustus, known as the 'blood angel'. He also thought that it would be The power is enough to deal with the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Battle of Lille Square, he was so confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, all his confidence and ambitions turned into a cloud with the shot of Orphey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stunning shot, not only repelled the Big Three, but also destroyed all their dreams. The true strength of Augustus also made the Big Three understand how ridiculous the idea of ​​a joint force to eat blood angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s earth-shattering whispering technique allowed the Big Three to know completely what is desperate! Even if Augustus is in great strength, Dess now knows that he can't be compared with this blood angel. As long as the pope exists for one day, all his ambitions are as daydreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dess through the window, looking at the splendid spire of the golden wall of St. James Cathedral. How many secrets are hidden under the spire? How many mysterious characters are hiding behind the scenes? He thought that after he had taken charge of the Doomsday Judiciary, he had already entered the secret of mastering all the secrets of the church. It seems that the fact is far more than this! A ruthless fact is that these first-time angels were actually excluded from the highest decision-making level of the Guangming Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a knock on the door, Dess woke up and came in with his first assistant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dess, you haven’t dealt with affairs for two weeks. Now there are a few cases that have been delayed, and you have to ask adults. You cut."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak." Dess's voice is full of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the case of heresy, the case of the singer Rogge is the most urgent. The Bavarian Grand Duke has sent people twice to say that The hammer of the god of war is the property of Orphey Roque. So, after Orpheq’s death, all the property of the hammer of the god of war should be owned by him. He asked us to immediately release Faith, Fog and Isabella. Returning all the property of the hammer of the god of war. The person who just came is very rude. He said that if the matter is not resolved within three days, let us know before we are under the pope."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall crystal cup in the hands of Dess was immediately crushed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only calmed his anger for a long time, he knows that now he is in the eyes of the pope, fearing that the status and use value is far less than the Bavarian Grand Duke is afraid, but This is true. The Bavarian Grand Duke, who has followed the miracle, is more important to the Church of Light than to the head of the Holy Knights, Augustus. He is a small final jury judge, what is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thoughts are extremely painful for the arrogant Dess. He could not adapt to this feeling of despicable knees. In the past, he was taught to teach others. For a long time, Dess only squeezed a word out of his teeth. "The two people... Fiss and the fog, now they are released! All the things of the Ares are still going back! Also spit it out! Right, who is Isabella?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't make a big punishment for Fiss and the fog? And the little girl, have you ever been to her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant is hesitant, back Dao: "Adult, Fiss and Fog have played, but not heavy. As for the girl, it has been closed for a month, sure... it is moving. But today I personally checked, she did not receive too much A big injury will definitely come back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dess slaps the assistant out! He is too angry to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which bastards have done that little scorpion!! I don’t think women will go to the streets to find them! Is there any less scorpion in Lille City? Why do you have to pick this! I will be killed by your stupid pigs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People! The subordinates have already investigated it, and they are basically the people of Kara Yang’s direct Guards! There is only one person under our direct staff. As for this person, he is daring and has secretly executed him! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Des struggled to calm his anger, and his pale face was flushed at the moment. His bloody eyes glanced at the assistant sharply, coldly: "Death." ? I am afraid that he said that you have done the little bitch? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant immediately crouched on the ground: "Adults are forgiving!" The villain is confused for a while. Just blame that the little bitch is too tempting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! Dess yelled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put all the people who have done the little bitch and hand them over to Master Augustus." See how adults handle it. Anything else? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lionheart Knights and the remnants of the Golden Lion Knights have returned to Lille two days before. The five thousand and five hundred knights came back only a total of four hundred and twenty knights. We sent people to capture the same party Kate of the sorcerer Rogge, but there was no small conflict with these knights. Our people were injured dozens and one died. The round table knight Charlie has already told the adults of Augustus. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid! ! Don't provoke anyone who belongs to the Bavarian Grand Duke! Do you think that the guys who will only bully the civilians will be the opponents of the warriors who have fought? Being beaten is alive! Also, who is this order, how can I not know? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is a search warrant under Chrisma. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove immediately! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There were a lot of great aristocrats in the past for the sympathy of Rogge's accomplices, such as Franco, Lance, and Robsky. I was stopped by this. But this time For some reason, Marshal Rosio went out and sent the Grand Duke Gonzalez to say that he would donate 100,000 gold coins, provided that these people were released."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Dess is simply overwhelmed! The gold coins are accepted and everyone is released! By the way, be sure to be polite to the people sent by the Marshal. The fox is also a person who cannot be offended. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, can't put it now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...Kara Yang’s hate for Rogge, he told me to fix these people before he left. So, adults, you see, yes. It is not for the subordinates to arrange a few highly skilled therapists, let them raise a few days to hurt. It’s not very good to let people go now...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;” Kara Yang...” Dess smiled bitterly, nodded tiredly, and waved his assistant to go out. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to be quiet, he needs a rest. He is holding the sun and leaning on the sand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He was too small to look at the power and insidiousness of these secular aristocrats. When the Big Three were still there, no one had a final judgment on the arrest of Rogge and the party. But now it seems to be the same, It’s hard to come! Is it that Karajan and Chrisma have not returned to the door of the sentient beings? This is the highest secret of the church!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another knock on the door. Dess was so angry that he did not tell anyone to let anyone in trouble? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dess adults, Master Augustus let me inform you, please go with him to the Grand Duchy of Bavaria immediately." Come in Augustus The adjutant of the capital, so Dess’s men did not dare to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dess is a little surprised, what did Augustus do at the Grand Duke? Also bring yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nowadays, unlike the past, he dared not ignore the authority of Augustus, and after a little finishing, he followed the pass of the Holy Knight out of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is gone, he never came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Marshal Rosio has returned to his handsome account in the territory of Ron’s Principality, looking at the huge sand table in front of him. Wei Wei is standing next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "David, have all the troops been withdrawn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, They are all back. So far we have lost a total of 32,000 people, and Ron’s loss is 55,000. The non-day knights stationed in the kingdom are in the same league with the Lions Knights and the Golden Lions. In the First World War, nine thousand cavalry were lost, and now there are fewer than 8,000 knights in the 'non-day'. The father is an adult, this battle is not only the most elite of the Ron Principality, but also the most elite two knights of the Bavarian Grand Duke. The group also suffered a lot of damage. The Principality of Ron can be said to be already in your palm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"David, even if 'non-day' is now only Five thousand knights, but we have not been able to overcome it, the Knights of the Knights and the Golden Lion Knights are really powerful, even with five thousand enemies of one thousand five, but also to reinvent the enemy, break through. The two Knights How many knights are there? How many left are the Knights of the Round Table?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "I heard that there are only two Knights returning to Lille City. The two Knights have less than 500 people. It is a good thing for the Bavarian Grand Duke to lose weight!" David asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosce Rio frowned, you are smarter than your older brother, but do you know why I rely more on him, and I am more at ease to let him go and do things? It is because he knows his ability, he can control his ambitions, never do things that are meaningless, and do not do his own power. The miracle is coming to the Grand Palace instead of the Roscio family, I hope you remember this! This will never be meaningless. This time, in addition to our established goals, do not interfere with the rest of the benefits! The Bavarian family is an eternal ally of our family, so we must protect all their interests. By the way, did Catherine leave? There can be no problem with her! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, I just received the news that my sister has left the king in secret." She only brought a personal maid, protected by Pross, without any problems. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! "The old Marshal nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David also took out a list of relatives. The middle-ranking officer of the Rhine League in this battle lost a lot. This is what I drafted. Waiting list, you see what's wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very relieved of your ability to do this, don't have to look at it. Candidates choose Rosello Family loyalty is the most important. As for talent, you and Gonzalez will bring troops, and the fighting power will not be worse. Now, plan to see how to put the four thousand non-day knights in the opposite fortress. Eat it. When these knights die, the non-day Knights can be completely removed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, do you want to adjust the big brother's face to the Spider Knights? The combat power should be above these non-day knights. Or call my Mercedes Knights? Although the number is a little less, I am confident that I will break through the front of the non-Tian Knights."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under the last moment, these knights must not move! Oh, David, you The pro is still not old! It is the third-rate army with the alliance. Can we not eat the 'Non-day' Knights? The war is not just as simple as the Cavaliers. Come here, let’s study and let the world see Look, the league is not the only old guy in Bavaria who will fight. First, think about how to get these knights out of their tortoise shells..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Father, non-day knights have a sense of honor, maybe we can take advantage of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We asked the Knights to fight against the four thousand knights. For as long as we pulled the other troops far enough ten miles away, it would be a shame for the non-day Knights to agree to this request. They have always been big. One of the top ten knights is self-sufficient and proud. The same number of knights, these three-rate knights will not be in their eyes. Destroying our four thousand knights can hit our morale heavily."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a few days after Pross came, we let him Dressed as an ordinary knight, it is surprising that you will kill their masters in front of the battle! In this way, the chaotic non-day Knights will fight with our four thousand knights. At the beginning of the battle, our reinforcements will be on the battlefield. Catch up and attack the fortress. It is not difficult to attack without the fortress of the non-day knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is contrary to our commitment, how to remedy it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The opposite is a military fortress, there are not many people, but the light is. As for our side, I will not be the master, and it will be good to kill the master as a dead ghost. Father, you better go back to the Principality, just don't know about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunset as blood...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bloody sunset, the elves and the orcs are dying to fight for death, and the hardships of the battle are beyond the expectations of all the elves. Unlike the previous shoals of sand and mountains, the orcs are this time. The offense seems to be more organized and several times more numerous than before. So even though there are soldiers of the seven-color deer tribe, it is not a problem for the elves to win, but the casualties are inevitable.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the early morning, the orcs are as high as the tides appearing on the highlands outside the Sarah Pass. In the past, tents decorated with animal bones and giant teeth were tied up on the high ground, tents Before the tree was painted with a banner of blood stagnation. Elder Sarah told Rogge that this represented the organized orc tribes began to participate in the attack, rather than the random gathering of previously spoiled orcs. The bloody flag represents The existence of a shaman wizard. However, the elves are the devil of the orcs. The ability expresses great contempt. In their view, any adult elf can go to the orc tribe to be a great wizard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very strong head Man holding a huge battle axe, standing in the high ground and screaming something. It is covered with a very thick copper armor, a necklace worn by the neck, and armor on the knee, with a few sharp edges. The spike. The spike has already been stained brown by blood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surrounded by a shaman with a strange feather and bone ornament. The orcs apparently have passed a thousand and are still increasing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and a group of elf elders stand in a particularly tall and broad war ancient tree On the arrow tower, the protection of this tower is also particularly strong, although it is located on the last line of defense, but the absolute height guarantees that the above people can overlook the entire battlefield. This is a magic shooting platform, the six magicians of the elves They have all accumulated on the platform, so the guards here are also very strict. In addition to the elite warriors of a dozen elves, Androni also leaned back on the wall and looked bored at the orcs in the distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That... is Minotaus? Rogge asked some doubts about the elder Sarah.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is obviously not as strong as Minotaur." Minotaus is an outstanding beast. If the real Minotaus appears in the orc empire, it must be the heavy responsibility, and it must not be the leader of this small tribe. It may be the little devil who has fallen into the world. "The elder Sarah, who has been seen for hundreds of years, is not sure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded, an orc tribe attack, the two tribes co-operate It is very difficult. If the Orc troops come, it seems that the elves will move away from the limelight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves elders are a little embarrassed, Feili Road: "These low-lying beasts breed too fast. In the early ten years, the new generation has grown up completely. And we, a warrior, need 50 years or so in adulthood. Although we can fight the orcs every time. The offense, however, swears, our ability to withstand losses is far weaker than the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog nodded and he began to count the orcs The advantages and disadvantages of a cheap warrior come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t let them discuss again, the orc’s offense has begun. The shamanic ritual danced a strange and ugly dance, and burst into a screaming curse. After a moment, a faint red cloud clung to the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a group bloodthirsty!" Sarah elders lost their voice. The Philippine elders are dignified and this battle will be more difficult, the magicians, ready to cast spells! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc, wearing rough leather armor, rushed to the elf fortress, and the tall ogre and the hulk were also mixed in. The Kobolds are constantly throwing small stones to the elf tree wall and the arrow tower, trying to suppress the archers of the elves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sarah’s Griffin has just taken off The boulder thrown by the Cyclops shot down both ends, scaring the rest of the Griffin warriors to fly back to the battle. After the Elf line, they rose to the heights until the Cyclops’ range, and then dared to return to the battlefield. It’s just that the long arrows shot on more than a dozen gryphons are sparse and far away, and there is no quasi-head. Although almost every arrow shoots the orcs, as long as it’s not the hit, those skins are rough. The beasts, thick and blessed with bloodthirsty, have no influence, and continue to rush with the arrows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven eight up to four meters of Cyclops It is so conspicuous and fierce in the orc community. Repelling the griffins makes them even more excited, and the boulder is like a raindrop. The arrow tower of the elves. An arrow tower formed by a war tree could not withstand such a dense blow. After suffering the bombardment of dozens of boulders, it finally collapsed. The three elf archers on the tower fell alive. Dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen Tauren warriors, under the cover of other orcs, rushed closer to the tree wall. They raised and fell, and they desperately cut down the tree wall. When the axe went down, it was a piece of sawdust flying, and it was obvious that the thick tree wall could not be blocked for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the initial panic, the elves gradually recovered. Archery gives Rogge an eye-opener, and an arrow is nailed to the weak part of the orc's joints, nails, neck, ears, etc., which effectively weakens the orc's combat effectiveness. This has no purpose with the Terran archers. The diffuse shot of the volume is in stark contrast.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Philippine elder's fireball blasting in the beast crowd, the wizard's magic begins 6 Cast to the orc's head. Although the Elf Magician has only six people, each round of magic There will be dozens of orcs falling down. At this point, the one-sided situation has finally reversed. But Rogge knows that the magic of the elf magician is limited, it will soon be consumed, and the number is too small. The impact on the battle is not decisive. The battle is won, or it depends on the assault of the Wetland Dragon and the Elf Knight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon, the Elf’s line of defense has retreated to the third and final Behind the layered tree wall. This tree wall has four war tree guards, which are much stronger than the first two tree walls. The elves also know that there is no way to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked coldly at the battlefield where the broken limbs flew and the blood spilled into the pool. He had already got used to this bloody. Androni stood behind him and picked up the flying stalks that occasionally flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cyclops are approaching, one of them is a huge huge sudden scream, throwing a boulder to the high platform that stands on Rogge and Elf elders. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge stone clip comes with a gale! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves' elders are mostly magicians, and the elf warriors are not known for their strength. Seeing the boulder flying, they are scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Rogge stands still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boulder hits the chest, and Rogge snorted, his eyes bursting with silver, his hands slamming, brute force everywhere, in the elf’s exclamation In the middle, the boulder turned to fly to heaven! Although Rogge's brute force is enough to compare with the hilly giants, it is not easy to pick up this volley flying stone. He already has some astringency in his mouth. Fortunately, after sucking the green dragon blood crystal, his strength was a little bigger, and this did not make a fool. Another benefit of Green Dragon Blood Crystal is that it has greatly improved Rogge's anti-toxicity and acid resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it bad for you? If you have a little bit of a brain, you can't use much energy. Can you stupidly work hard with the Cyclops? Hehe, Is your brain the same as the orc?" Seeing Rogge eating a dark loss, Androni whispered behind, but cheerfully sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is furious, this is for the elves to stand up, you can't help, but still sarcasm? He took out a homemade scroll, and a fireball threw it at several Cyclops, burning them and yelling. The Cyclops hurried back a short distance and escaped the scope of Rogge's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You come, I am waiting for you." Androni's voice suddenly became soft and greasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has this heart, but there is no such courage, only a long sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the fierce orcs were nearly half of the casualties, and the fierceness was reduced a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Philippine have seen the time have come, and under one command, Elf and other elf warriors have withdrawn from the defense line and turned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A row of tree walls suddenly fell, pressing more than ten orc warriors below. The three giant wet dragons rushed out of the gap, and the two-footed giant mouth went down, and they bite the half body of an orc. The attack of ordinary orcs is hard to find the hard scales on them. Only the giant axe of the Tauren Warrior will leave a wound on them. But the wetland dragons are quite spiritual war beasts. They started to focus on the bull-headed warriors, and the bull-headed warriors were strong and could not withstand the three-five bites of this war monster. After a while, more than a dozen Tauren warriors were torn into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a restriction, three wet fishes of more than ten meters long are slaughtered in the orc community, and more than a hundred elf knights are led by Huron. Killing in the gap, it is a burst of killing! The orcs immediately fell into a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc head leaps like a thunder, carrying a huge battle axe and rushing down the high ground, going straight to the wet land to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strange atmosphere suddenly appeared on the battlefield. A thick fog in the air did not know where it came from, and the cold and evil atmosphere continued to emerge from the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a huge bone faucet stretched out of the fog! The tide of Longwei spread to the entire battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is really amazing, the elf knight and the orc warrior in the fog are scared to escape immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge bone dragon stepped out of the fog, and the elves on the battlefield exclaimed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon, the most powerful undead creature in the fairy tale, why is it here? The elder elders were also completely shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another savage bone demon emerged from the fog, holding a giant axe burning with hellfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the two undead creatures, Flame Bone and Gregory, are a big thicker and more horrible. Gregory finally had some bone dragons this time, not a creature like a crocodile. When it stands up, it is more than four meters high. The thick hind leg bones, the powerful tail and the light blue mist from the nose, make it look full of oppression, plus the natural Longwei, now Gregory finally has the majestic appearance of the dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden appearance of these two guys shocked all the orcs and elves. Out of fear of the instinct of the upper dragons, the wet dragons became a mess and did not dare to approach Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is very proud, and screams silently, of course, this whistle only Rogge can understand what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am so prestige! Too great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory lowered his head Come, staring at the elves knights, suddenly rushing forward, Long Wei made all the horses frightened, and they all stood up and turned around and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is awkward and awkward, it seems that this is the benefit of the Green Dragon soul. This damn ***, only to increase his own power, did not consider the feelings of his own master, and all the benefits were saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the winds of Gregory River, a mouthful of green mist sprayed out and covered the elves. Thousands of sounds, several elf knights face green, planted Malay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hahahaha! It turned out to be a poisonous dragon!" Rogge thought bitterly. But in any case, the more powerful Gregory is, the more it helps to establish the tall image of a fat man. Although it is still a poisonous dragon, at least the toxicity has been much stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple and fierce flames of the bones can be without the thoughts of Gregory. It cut off a wetland dragon to the side with an axe, almost cut it into two sections, and the yellow blood spurted several meters high! The flame bone demon once again took the battle axe high. This time, the giant axe drawn a light and shadow of the flame in the air, once again squatting on the wet dragon that was desperately tumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni whispered the words of the orc to Rogge. She has lived in the forest for many years and can understand the language of the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed dumbly. "What does this have to do with God of War? It is obviously the messenger of death!" He felt that if he could be the god of the orc It seems to be good too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looks back, see Sarah Elder and Philippine The elders are desperate, standing behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The orc actually summoned the bone dragon! The other devil is no weaker than the bone dragon. I am afraid to say that we can't keep Sarah Pass this time. Now our wetland dragons of the seven-color deer can still entangle them for a while, and God will let the adults withdraw to our tribal territory! Wait for us to report this to the elders, mobilize the army, and then clean up these damn orcs!" Said heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The heroic power of Hilo is unpredictable. He has already foreseen all this." Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Light shines from him, pouring into the ground like water, and a beam of light rises into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sang a mysterious spell that no one could understand without a dignified, low voice. This made the elder elders who have always been acquainted with their knowledge and pride. Of course, no one can understand this spell, that is, Rogge himself does not understand what he is saying. Mysterious spells, if everyone can understand, how to show God makes adults different? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that it’s hard to be in this first few days, after this pass, there’s no need to show any miracles in the future. Even if some people doubt, they have to pass the customs of these believers. So his performance spares no effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy pressure was scattered from Rogge, pushing the elf elders to move back. Suddenly the blue light flashed on the battlefield, Androni did not know when he had personally killed him. This Roger was shocked. He refused to make another show. He immediately indicated to Gregory and the Flame Bone, let them cooperate with their performances and hurry back to the outside world. Otherwise, it’s no joke to fight with Androni. Anyway, the three-headed wetland dragon has already died two heads, and one of them is also seriously injured. The strength of the seven-color deer is greatly damaged. His purpose has been reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shouted and raised his hand to the bone dragon. Gregory struggled for a while and slowly disappeared into a virtual shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again pointed to the flames of the bones, and the flames of the skull that had just smashed the third wetland had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Shenwei! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder Sarah immediately fell down. The elders of the two seven-color deer tribes on the high platform were also excited and tearful, and they could see the god of Hilo again for the rest of their lives. I am very impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a trick, and an invisible force took a spear from an elf guard. The fat man then threw the spear into the sky, and the flame suddenly ignited on the spear, and a figure leaped out of the beam of light on Rogge, grabbing the burning spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light on her body is so dazzling, just like an angel made up of pure light, no one can see her face, only see her behind Elegant, slender wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear is thrown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is like a blast of lightning, everyone has a flower in front of him, and the battlefield seems to have paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, all the miracles have dissipated, and it is a cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s radiance has dissipated, he smiled and looked at the battlefield. But in the eyes of elder elders, this unseen fat man is now so unfathomable, so sacred and majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden riot on the battlefield, and the elders of the elves were busy climbing up from the ground and looking at the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a field of open space in the middle of the battlefield. The orc’s collar stood in the middle of the open space, and the tall bullhead warrior. It also maintains a double-handed axe that traverses the chest. The orc warriors gathered around it and their faces were terrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
