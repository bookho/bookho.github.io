			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an invisible giant hand draws a huge black gold shades the Tiffany sky, there is no sun, moon, star, cloud, no light or no wind. Only the soldiers standing on the wall can see the edge of the black brocade, the bright sunshine still shines on the camp of the Chaoshan Legion, and the brocade is also set with gold piping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness runs in the streets of Tiffany, getting thicker and thicker, as if to condense, the lighting on the street seems to be hiding Go to the heart of the lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, everyone in the city of Tiffany is now in the sky, people look at the sky silently, but they are exhausted, they It is also impossible to see a ray of light from the sky, and all the light sources around it are gradually dim and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany is quiet, there is only one depression in the silence that makes people want to scream crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know where the sudden cry of the child’s sharp cry, the crying immediately stopped, it seems that the adult was holding his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is like a black brocade exhibition, no longer wake up, the revelation of the gods is like a whisper, the day is a dream that will be lost forever, and the footsteps of history stay today. There is heroic blood under each grass, and the broken weapons cry when no one is there, with the bones of the brothers, let us move forward to the country of death...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The singer's voice faintly floats in nothingness, the fear rises from the deepest part of everyone's heart, and the violent hurricane is set in the blink of an eye, intending to devour these trembling creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This wide range of shady enchantments can only add a trivial fear effect, but it consumes a lot of our magic. It is not worth the loss!" Lich Elgar Evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and did not answer. There is no concept of fear in the world of death. Although many high-level undead creatures naturally have fear enchantments, this enchantment is almost useless. Because the undead is completely immune to fear, except for Gregory. So even if he explained it again, the Lich would not understand the role of this heavy shady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark. It has always been a source of human fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this suffocating darkness and silence, Tiffany's magical radiance slowly illuminates. Numerous colorful spots bloom in the same moment in the void, colorful streamers flash, freely and elegantly interspersed and flew. The flower of magic faces all this vitality in full bloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnatural nights are like a huge canvas, and the first to be painted on this canvas makes those beautiful and deadly magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of attacking magic flies out of the forefront of the Tiffany wall, and the targets are all in the same place. Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fortress on the high platform illuminates a layer of subtle magical brilliance, and a huge shield covers the entire surface of the platform. Aggressive magic that has come to the fore has exploded in the passport. Even if there is an occasional passage through the shield, the power is greatly weakened. There is no way to blame the masks that the Masters have blessed themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the entire high-rise is illuminated by the magic of flashing! The mad believers have found their own goals, and slammed back with magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany's spires illuminate one by one, and the entire city's outer walls begin to glow with a faint yellow glow. Tiffany, the yellow rose under the night sky, finally began to reveal her true ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical spells of the mad believers blew up on the brilliance of Tiffany. Add a smudged enamel to the yellow rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aha! How could my Tiffany be afraid of the weak magic of this useless guy?" Wenna looked at the crystal screen in front of him. The latest battle situation. He danced happily, and his bald head was burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long scream suddenly came out of the crystal screen! Wenna suddenly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic shield that covers the whole city of Tiffany is a miracle. But how can such a large area of ​​protection block the death of Elgara? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first flames of attacking magic on Tiffany City have not yet dispersed, and the second attack magic has already whistled! This road is called, the mad believe that the Masters are killing can be described as hearty. Their general role is to pour their most powerful attacking magic into the enemy's head in the shortest possible time. Until the magic is running out. The only thing left is to let the hard-working soldiers go to the water dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stop! Rogge, who stood on the high platform, turned and screamed: "No more attack magic!" All Masters listen to me! Summon Elemental creatures, and assist the heavy infantry with auxiliary magic! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany's magic shield can only protect the magic, can not resist physical attacks. So the military number Changming, the Imperial army began to slowly advance, dozens The huge siege equipment is like an ancient behemoth, roaring over the high platform and rushing to the beautiful city in front of you!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of elemental creatures swaying Standing up from the front of the Imperial Army. Among them are up to five meters of wind element giants, and also about two meters of fire elements. Of course, more are thick and strong, endless soil elements.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the elemental creatures is all concentrated on the door of Tiffany. They are carrying intensive arrow rain and attacking magic, rushing to the front of the city gate, picking up their fists and slamming Wrapped in a thick steel gate! The continuous roar of loud noise is crazy enough!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more and more attacks, elements The creatures fell one by one, but Tiffany's gates have been smashed, some distortions, two big There was a big slit in the middle, enough for a warrior to squeeze in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empire’s heavy infantry saw the city break, the morale was higher, hundreds of soldiers shouted in unison Pushing a car to the city. The two tidal corps in the car rushed to the magical array on the wood with the army mage. The impact of the slamming wood pushed by the soldiers was magnified by the magic array. The impact of the city gates tilted inward by a point.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several long ladders that have been stretched out on the lower floors of Tiffany. On the platform, the brave imperial warriors fought bravely along the long ladder to attack the platform. These platforms seem to be very narrow, but they are very wide enough to accommodate dozens of fighters, so the battle for the platform is fierce. Warriors not only have to fight with the defenders on the platform, but also have to withstand attacks from nearby and higher platforms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deafening killing can't cover up the sound Screaming. A corpse with a body full of arrows or burnt with magic. I couldn’t help falling from the air. The imperial warriors glared at the red eyes and tried to attack the city along the long ladder!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Became an elf shooter. The elves lined up in intensive formations, and under the command of several guardian warriors, dumped an arrow of rain on Tiffany's platform. The unparalleled archery of the elves was fully proved at this moment. Hundreds of long arrows spanned hundreds of meters, almost all of them fell on the platform, and all the defenders on the top were instantly shot into hedgehogs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Arrow Rain swept through the platform one by one, and in the blink of an eye, it plowed over ten minimum platforms. Only the elf's range is only enough to get the lowest platform. Why not the middle and upper platforms. But the bottom of these platforms can already provide enough to get to the bottom of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor warriors cheered and flocked to the platform. I want to kill the passage to the city. At this time, the rumble of the rumble, a copper gate that was half a meter thick slowly fell, and the passage was firmly sealed. When the imperial warrior on the platform was still at a loss, the platform was shaking again, and it collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of meters of heavy platform squats on the head of the imperial warrior who can't escape below. Heavy stones ignited large swaths of smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are dozens of thick plasmas in the smoke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyesight of the elf is far from human, and the high-level elf female mage is pale. Although they have seen a lot of killings. But the sights in front of them still make them scream involuntarily. Two young elves have begun to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siege war was directed by Wallace, and Rogge was just standing on the high platform, staring at the fierce battlefield with a calm face, just thinking: come to the army I started to concentrate on this side, yes, let me know more..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany in the city. Wenna’s hands are flying on several crystal balls. He controlled the magical facilities of the city. He was so excited that he jumped around and almost danced:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky stood in front of the window, and it was helpless to the madness of Wenna. What he just wanted to say, suddenly there was a burst of ice, and then faintly said: "The other side's sanctuary has come, it seems I have to call them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Sanctuary? Let me see! Aha, find them." Wenna stared at the crystal screen, and the scene above had been switched to the unnatural sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, two faint figures wrapped in black robes are slowly falling to Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner smiled and pointed to the guy on the left to give this guy a chance. It seems that this time it’s good luck, there is a sanctuary to bury, I Death is also worth it. Wait, let me put the little ones out... Ok, let's get started! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky is slightly closed, and the ice wind on the robes is starting to move, with the long curse echoing in the room, unimaginable The huge magic comes from all directions. In a moment, all the metal objects in the Wenna laboratory seem to have lost weight and slowly floated into the air!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wen With his brilliance in his eyes, he kept chanting, holding a crystal ball firmly in his hands, his eyes fixed on the crystal screen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the city, countless fighters are still struggling to kill!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a loud bang, Tiffany’s two gates are finally unbearable The strong impact, roaring and falling to the city! The screams of the defensive soldiers who came out of the door at the end of the door were instantly drowned in the cheers of the tidal heavy infantry.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly a thousand soldiers flocked to Tiffany, and blocked the wide passages that could be used in parallel with the four-wheeled carriage. The soldiers who walked in the gate of the city gate felt in vain a fierce violent wind. They suddenly looked up, and now a steel gate that is one and a half meters thick is falling!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, all the fighters who saw this scene were almost on the spot!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icy, thoroughly cold, making the blood condense cold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No screams.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large plasma of the steel gate suddenly spurts out and will be close to the steel gate The soldiers thoroughly drenched!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The granite paved ground was completely broken, and the blood of the cockroaches began to spread along the cracks.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior standing outside the steel gate suddenly heard the other side of the sound of a harsh metal friction, and then exclaimed, then, screaming, screaming However, the inside and outside of the steel gate are already two worlds. The soldiers outside do not know what is inside, but it is conceivable that the gate must have been purgatory because of the steel gate. Gap, is there blood gushing madness <br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; is just a short work, screams in the steel gates completely disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the warriors outside were not waiting too long, and the screams disappeared. The steel gate slowly rose in a snoring sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the steel gate, a pair of blood-red eyes lit up, followed by a second pair, the third pair...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not waited for the foremost warriors to react, a sharp wind swept past their bodies, and the next moment, several soldiers suddenly burst into dozens of pieces of meat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster in the steel gate jumped for a few tens of meters, and then fell into the imperial battlefield outside the city with a thunderous bang. In the smoke rising from the sky. More than ten empire reloaded warriors flew out of its heavy body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gale whispers and the smoke is exhausted, the Imperial soldiers see the killing. In its place of standing, huge stamping has already carved a large dish with a radius of several tens of meters on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a monster made of metal, up to four meters in shape, shaped like a giant insect, with four legs and long legs supporting its body. It has four extremely long arms on its upper body, and each end of the arm holds a sharp blade with a diameter of one meter! Its head is very strange. It seems to be attached to three twisted human faces, six blood red eyes can not keep scanning around, leaving no dead ends! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a whistling sound, the reloaded warrior around the metal monster suddenly appeared on his heavy steel armor with a smooth and neat scratch! The empire's refined steel armor can't stop the spiraling blade wheel, so what about the body inside the steel armor? The warrior looked at the dark red liquid that was constantly pouring out of the scratches, and his face gradually became pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦, a dozen reloaded soldiers scattered into a corpse. Their sharp swords and tomahawks only made some dents on the metal scorpion monster. It seems that the metal texture of the faint blue light shining on the body is far beyond the steel of the Imperial soldiers' weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha! What tides heavy infantry, not in front of my little baby is not fragile like glass! Hey, Laozi’s little baby has borrowed a lot. In the sense of the Necromancer, the soul is really easy to use. Is your broken spell finished? My crystal tower can't be controlled!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of 16 killings..." Rogge number, completely ignore the life and death of the elite soldiers below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to send a deep green corpse up?" Elger asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not the time. Wait a second!" Rogge frowned and stared at Tiffany. He felt more and more that Tiffany was somewhat different. Although the high walls blocked his view, the magical fireworks that popped from time to time also confuse the magic energy around him. His feelings are sharp and undetectable. To the situation in the city of Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the goddess of nature is dying in his body, seems to be echoing something, and its power is growing, the spirit of Rogge The force is almost impossible to suppress it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the killing of 16 heads and arrows on the battlefield has slowed down. Wallace is worthy of being a long-time general, and in a short period of time he can see the weakness of the killing. Under his military order, the siege of the soldiers who had been besieged and killed had to retreat. They replaced the square infantry heavy infantry with the giant shield. They only waved medium-sized blunt weapons such as warhammers and flails. The more sophisticated things are, the more they can't be shocked. Sure enough, after killing dozens of hammers and hitting them, there was a very harsh metal friction inside the body, and they slammed into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a gorgeous green meteor drags a beautiful trajectory out of Tiffany City! This lively, gorgeous green is like a living thing that can survive the world. Even the blood, broken limbs and internal organs that are everywhere on the ground have turned green in this moment. They are not dyed green, but naturally become green. Even if there is no bright green light in the sky, at this moment, they look green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All liquids turn green in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the green world, the goddess of nature goddess madly surging, Rogge quietly, opened the door to spiritual strength. Let the natural goddess, who has been depreciated for a long time, come to the fore, and lay dozens of seeds on all sides. Rogge saw the location of the seed. It is also allowed to grow, and it is not the elves who can settle down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergar had a hoarse voice in his throat. The intense life that suddenly appeared around him made him feel very uncomfortable. The staff had a meal, and a circle of light gray ripples spread out, and all the seeds that had grown up were extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the green meteor has broken through the sky. Hit a blurry figure in the air! In the green light group, the dark figure is unusually clear, and he can see that he is suffering enormously. At the same time, Tiffany's spires inlaid with dark black crystals began to tremble and whisper, and a deep black ripple broke out, hitting the still struggling figure in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect it! They are actually dead, and they are still such a powerful dead spirit!" The sky wrath looked dignified. Perhaps because of the excessive consumption of magic, the ice wind on the wrath of the sky has lost its vitality and turned into an inanimate pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot boil is one of the most terrifying magics that Druid can master, and it instantly activates and completely steams all liquids in the target. If it is directly in this magic. Even if it is a strong sanctuary, it will at least be seriously injured if it is not dead, let alone the death fluctuation of Wenna after the increase of black crystal. Unfortunately, they did not expect this goal to be a dead soul. There is no dead body in the body at all. As for the volatility of death, it will not have any effect on the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid's eighth-order magical forest light has the magical effect of instant healing for the average person. But for the dead, it is synonymous with the end. In the work of destroying the undead, if the believers of the natural goddess are fully prepared, in some ways, even more sharp than the light mage who uses the divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenner began to mobilize busy, and the wrath of the sky floated out of the window to search for the sanctuary who had entered Tiffany, or Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue looks cold, he already knows who is hiding in the city of Tiffany. He turned his head to Elgra: "It seems that their cards have been revealed, and we don't have to be polite, let the corpse go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the spell of Elgara, a burst of suffocating suffocation and stench from the high stage rushed out in the blink of an eye. The reloaded warrior is fighting desperately with the killing, and the thick blood is enough to overwhelm everything else. However, the elves on the high platform who had just spit out because they saw the bloody scene were so mad, their faces were white, and they began to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another, I don’t know where to drill it, it’s more than ten meters, just as much as killing and agility. Moving on the battlefield. Under the manipulation of the Lich, they did not go to the killing, but directly to Tiffany! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of magical brilliance flashed, reflecting a corpse that was jumping in the air. It has four long, powerful legs, but it doesn't seem to have any joints. On a body like a worm, a human head is placed, which is extremely incongruous with its huge body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look closely, the green body of the corpse is actually made up of human corpses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few corpses have already rushed under the city of Tiffany, their four long legs, like a strong suction, even climbed vertically to the city. , the degree is not slower than moving on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge raised his left hand, and a thin and dazzling light beam came out of his hand and went straight into the sky. Under the unnatural night, this sacred pillar of light and light is very striking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, Rogge, this time, what else do you want to hide?" He thought for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍惚, (the past) is once again in the memory of precipitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani used his last strength to hold him tight, a hot and wet feeling that he could not spread on her chest, then his heart Pain, all the light is extinguished one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absolute darkness, there are several lightning flashes, which is the tip of the Death Class. Then, it was the white feathers that fell like snow, and when the dancing snow drifted over, the golden blood was still flowing with soft light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class is appointed, but the ambassador is in the beautiful city of Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly woke up and was still in the fierce battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nine-order magic...but are you afraid?" Rogge asked himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly removed his heavy armor and wore a dark black robes. His right hand pointed a slight hook, and the dark red Casinaras had fallen into the palm of his hand. The faint light could not stop, as if he was crazy for the upcoming blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the beautiful Tiffany, he just walked to the edge of the high platform and his arm was caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned and saw the eyes of Froya's flashing green flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going desperately?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to kill. Rog smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly wrapped her arms around Rogge, and her lips were so dazzling in the battlefield full of blood and stench. Rogge In the future, I could enjoy this kiss. Froya used all her strength and looked at Luo Ge’s mouth. His instinctive reflection made Froya’s row of silver teeth come back without success. The little goblin was angry. Underneath a bite on his lower lip, he finally printed a bright bloody print on Rogge's lips.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
