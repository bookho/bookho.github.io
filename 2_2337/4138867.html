			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the five chapters flying over the mountains<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of light angels is not A mortal like me can measure it. Although O'Reilly has come to this world, I have no feelings about her at all. I have to say that if you want to find her, I am afraid that only you can do it." A passage seemed to have exhausted all the energy of the pope. He panted and began to cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles's brilliant red eyes carefully observed the pope for a while and sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is pouring out in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud quickly condensed on Achilles, turned into a pure black robes, covering his red luo body. The style of the robe is exactly the same as the robe worn by the pope. But this old-fashioned robes cover him, but it adds to the charm of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only his bald head, looks, hands and barefoot, is a stunning beauty composed of ice and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM and Macbeth have just arrived, have not experienced the human body's **, so there is no feeling. And the heart of Augustus is quietly rushing into a stream of heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles's bright red eyes suddenly fell on the blood angel's body, and under the glare of the red eyes, Augustus immediately humbled. Go down and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles no longer pays attention to the blood angel, and his eyes fall on the pope, and he does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time has been frozen in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, maybe only a few minutes, maybe a few hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles finally said: "Well, I am going to O'Reilly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He slowly rises into the sky. MGM and Macbeth also followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles's pair of beautiful unmatched frowns. Cold and authentic: "Do I have to let you follow me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM and Macbeth on the spot. Macbeth immediately sank and said: "Achilles adults, Frye Miller let us help you hunt down O'Reilly. We don't follow you, how can we help you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles suddenly smiled charmingly and said: "Assist? Do you want to help me? Oh, in this world, Fleminger is not able to restrain me. If you want Help me. Then I have to find a way to find Auger Reich. If you must follow me, then you can. But I can't guarantee your safety, maybe I will occasionally lose something in the battle. Looking at the glory of the Fleminger, I might as well remind the two adults that if you meet O'Reilly, you must flee. She is not as generous and kind as me. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is MGM and Macbeth, or Augustus. All of them did not expect Achilles to come down and say something like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Pope is still coughing. It seems that the only big thing for him is to recover from coughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth and MGM looked at each other and endured anger: "In this world, I think we have the ability to protect ourselves. Achilles Stuart, let us follow you! Otherwise, if there is anything wrong with this pursuit, I think Tilatemis is not good at the Supreme God."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles's mouth reveals a sneer, saying: "Do you want to intervene in the battle between the light angels? Well, if you can keep up, then come with me!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and swayed in front of him, in the ten roots of the blue. The space was actually torn apart by a crack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles did not return, stepping into the space crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They finally did not dare to step into the cracks in the space left by Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope finally suppressed his cough. He looked at MGM and Macbeth and seemed to sigh and said: "Two adults please follow Let me come, let us first familiarize yourself with the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sky in the north, a team of people is marching on the wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange force. Behind the thousand walking soldiers, follow the five giant steel golems. The surface of the cyan ray is engraved with the emblem of the Babylonian imagery. The back of the Golem Legion. Follow a delicate and gorgeous carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team suddenly stopped. There was a commander who flew to the side of the carriage and gasped. "Report! The front... found a dragon! Judging from the body. It is an adult silver dragon. It is full of scars. It looks like it is I experienced a very fierce battle before I died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a murderous voice in the carriage: "Oh? A dead silver dragon? Take me there." Look!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the command of the commander, the carriage brought a thick smoke and immediately galloped forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant dragons gradually appeared. The carriage didn't seem to be in danger at all, and it stopped before it was opened directly to the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, stepping down a gorgeous glamorous lady. She looks like twenty-five or six, beautiful and charming, but there is a line of loneliness and fortitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t wear a long skirt, but she wore a safari that was easy to move. Her boots were slightly a bit, and the figure disappeared immediately. After a while, she appeared again in the place where she just stood, just as she had never moved. In this short period of time, she has turned around the silver dragon body for several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers who stood behind the lady were respectful and seemed to have known her strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a silver dragon, and it is a high-ranking silver dragon. Its strength must not be weak." The lady looked at the dragon in front. The corpse said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young middle-aged fat clerk behind her is writing a book, trying to record every word of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been dead for a while, the body has a lot of injuries, and the wound on the back fully illustrates how powerful its enemies are. Well, I still can't see What kind of creatures can cause such wounds, but it is clear that its enemies have taken away many important things from it, and the huge gap on the faucet has already explained this. This wound... this wound It must be to remove the dragon crystal! Look at it, obviously it is still struggling to fly back to the dragon city before death, that is to say, it is likely to have a silver dragon in the direction it is facing. Near the Dragon City, we have the opportunity to meet the silver dragon that has been placed. Of course, there are too many things worthy of use on this dragon's body. We deserve to stay here for a week. When it comes to Dragon City, My guards may be able to change to the dragon skin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk's pen is like a dragon snake, remember to sweat. After waiting for the lady to finish, he found the opportunity to say: "His noble and beautiful Lentini, as the name suggests, there must be more than one silver dragon in the Dragon City. Of course! With your unparalleled sword skills, And the invincible Golem Legion of the Empire. I think we can kill at least two adult silver dragons! But what if the three silver dragons come in more than three? The magic statue and our soldiers may have run in the sky. In order to ensure the success of revenge on Yinlong, you see... Are we setting up a place far away from the Dragon City after scouting the location of the Dragon City?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lady is one of the three great Juggernauts, the wind sword Saint Stendini. When the current Emperor of the Babylonian Empire was still just an ordinary prince, he met Lentini's mother. After the eve of the eve of the storm, there was Lentini. But the prince of this romantic lingering has forgotten this thing cleanly, and Lentini’s mother is sad. Alone came to the hill village on the border, gave birth to Lentini, and lived here for ten years. I don't know why, after the prince went to God, he suddenly missed the lover of that year and sent him to visit. Finally found the mother and daughter living alone at the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, under the half-request, the emperor brought the mother and the daughter back to the palace, and wrote a fairly satisfactory ending for this relationship. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But!" The clerk also tried to distinguish: "In case there are more than three silver dragons..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if there are ten silver dragons, this The princess also escaped!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk began to sweat on the fat face: "But... what about the golem and the soldiers? You can bring it The golem of half of the entire empire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini suddenly smiled slightly, faintly said: "Then you will fight to death! Anyway, sacrifice for the Babylonian emperor Life is originally your highest glory. As for the magic image, if it is destroyed, it will be recreated. If there is no money, it will go to the neighboring country. What are you afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk is cold sweat DC, he has followed the spleen and sturdy princess and swordsman for several years. Knowing her temper, knowing that once she starts to smile, it is a harbinger to kill. At the moment, he no longer dared to say anything, but only Nono’s words were recorded in the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has been recorded as a contender. The clerk hopes this is the only time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini was about to step on the carriage, and suddenly the whole body was stiff and fixed there, just like the sudden petition by Medusa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk hurried forward and asked: "His noble and invincible, Lentini, what happened to you, is it too windy here that affects you?" Too beautiful skin?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini quickly recovered, she ignored the clerk behind her, and immediately took the car door after getting on the carriage. Shut up. So the clerk did not see her pale face and cold sweat on her forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emperor Richelieu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A robe in a robe is standing at the long table and carefully looking at a picture at the other end of the long table. Androni was still sitting behind him as before, and the long legs were restless on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brush method is exquisite, the characters are vivid, and the artist is not very skillful. The painting is a fierce big man who has smashed his right leg and is bullying a weak poor mother and daughter. The fierce expression on the face of Dahan is in stark contrast to the helplessness of the mother and daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This picture is very good! You have done a good job, now go and give this picture to Pompeii, let him consider how it should be given The emperor sent it up," Rogge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the long table stood with several warriors. They carefully put the paintings away and retired after the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This painting is a scorpion painting of Frederick? You insist that this painting reflects the disability of the Great, and it is a little too far-fetched! So obvious I can see even the plotting strategy. Feuerbach will not see? I don't believe it." Androni asked in disapproval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said, "You don't understand this. Indeed, anyone with a bit of a mind knows that we are framed by Frederick's nephew." But if you think about it, the whole empire knows that the right leg of the emperor is a squatting land. The people on this painting are similar to the way the emperor was young. The witty scorpion dared to draw such a painting, whether it is out For what reason, it shows that his jealousy to the Emperor is not very much in his heart. I saw this painting. I think the Emperor is so generous, how much more or less will it be in the heart? You think about it again. Since Xunzi is such a person, then Frederick himself must not respect the Emperor. Besides, if the Emperor agrees to replace or dispose of Frederick, this disrespectful painting is a good excuse!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andronie sighed: "The scorpion of Frederick is really naive. You are being played by a player, and then you will be able to draw such a The picture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled. Road: "No way, young people are always easy to impulsive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not laugh a few times, laughter came to an abrupt end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Rogge seemed to stay completely, standing in the same place, turning a blind eye to a spike that stabbed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androne did not think that Rogge suddenly suddenly dazed, she was caught off guard, and could only throw Rogge to the ground. A sword in the backhand pierced a piece of desktop that suddenly became alienated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's face is blue and his body is cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni just wanted to climb, and suddenly it was a stay. The body was stiff and fell back into the arms of the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carpet suddenly jumped up and became an extremely fierce monster in the air. It has only one disproportionate head and two thick and powerful hind legs. This little monster is a foot high, but when the big mouth full of sharp teeth is desperately opened, the whole big head seems to split into two halves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Rogge has regained his ability to move at this time. His right hand is directly inserted into the mouth of the monster, no matter what he grabs, just 狠A grip on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster screamed and turned into a soft mud. At this point, Androni has not recovered. Still stiffly on the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her stunning face. Rogge smiled and smiled very badly. Subsequently. He sealed Androni's double, soft lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s charming eyes widened, but she couldn’t move for a while...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Finally, the blue shadow flashed, Androni had been like a frightened rabbit, hiding in the corner of the room. She blushes on her face and her chest rises and falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat looked at Androni, and suddenly smiled: "Annie, I haven't seen any adverse reactions to you!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andro, a moment, immediately recalled the scene that had just happened, and his face began to turn white immediately. She angered: "Dead fat, I am kind to save you, you actually take advantage of the opportunity to take advantage of me! Do you want me to leave you regardless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Annie, you really started to change." Rog smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sinks his face and stares at him without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Androni is already on the verge of an outbreak, and the fat man immediately shifts the topic with interest: "Right, you just felt it!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s attention was really taken away, and she was very embarrassed: “Of course! This... Who is this? He is too strong. This power is really ... I don't know how to describe it. With such a powerful sacred power, it seems that he should have come from heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly Don, Androni gently said: "Dead fat, you have to be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Rogge smiled casually. , said: "The guy of this level is definitely not a small insignificant person to come to me. But if you meet later, you may wish to play with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north of Moonlight Dragon City, stands a dangerous peak. It was originally a snowy lion's home. But these extremely fierce Warcraft are now fleeing and fleeing away from their homes, lest they fly slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because their homes have been occupied by people, it is the existence that they absolutely dare not challenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So big dragon crystal. It seems that Nicholas must be very angry before he died!" Serrafi Road floating in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The angry soul has power." Feng Yue replied coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite of Serafi, a gray robe is holding a huge dragon crystal that is nearly half a meter long. Her silver eyes and the faint silver of the dragon crystals shine together. This dragon crystal is too big, and her little hand that is blown to the ground seems to be unable to grasp it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the wind, the silver awns are flowing, and the dragon crystal is being watched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, Gregory will take a few days to come out, you have enough time to study it. Hey, just that power, it has to It has been absorbed for so long! I really don't know when this waste will really help us." Serafi Road. Her words seem to refer to the bone dragon. But as the other pointed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue finally reached out and held the ends of Longjing. A silver wave like a wave of water gushed from her little hand, covering the dragon crystal. The dragon crystal in the light wave began to slowly elongate, and slowly, a long gun gradually appeared in the hands of the wind and the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue is concentrating on transforming Longjing. Serrafi did not know what was being thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fengyue did not put all his thoughts on Longjing. She suddenly said: "You are very ugly now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi was furious and shouted: "Feng Yue! You want to fight again? Is it? Now that the power has fully recovered, if you can't win you, I...I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is angry, the wavy blonde gradually stretches straight, with The improvement of power has restored the appearance of light angels with both majesty and beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still look like you now." Fengyue said with a cold voice without feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s heart just had a good time, but I didn’t expect Fengyue to add another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner is already angry. Her blonde began to dance, the space around her was writhing, and there was already a faint space crack!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wind is just burying the head and transforming the dragon crystal, mad at the anger Weina turned a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the windy moon that doesn't evade, Wella can't really cut a sword. However, she couldn’t vent her anger, and she looked around. In addition to the huge cockroaches on the mountain, there is really no target for anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Wella’s strength in ascension suddenly dropped sharply, and in a twinkling of an eye, the force that just broke the space converges cleanly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind rose his head, and the silver eyes looked at the sky in the south, faintly asked: "Who is here?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's eyebrows are tightly locked, and sighed softly: "This feeling...should be Achilles! I didn't expect that the reaction of Heaven will be so fast this time, actually sent him to the party." It’s down.”...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What is he doing. Demonstration? Is he trying to challenge all the powerful people in the world?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed. Road: "No, he just wants me to know that he has already arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is very powerful?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner was silent for a while, and said: "Of course it is powerful, but I am not worse than him. But now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Feng Yue stares at Wei Na, cold and cold: "Now the source of God is divided into two, so your strength is not as good as him. Do you want to say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stunned, and then gnashed her teeth: "Fengyue, what are you talking about! You... are more and more annoying! It seems that I should really beat you up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind snorted and said: "Is it by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena has not had time to attack, Fengyue has handed a long gun with a light silver flow. She is still cold and cold: "It's almost the same with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rifle is purely made of silver miracle Nicholas's dragon crystal, how powerful it is, naturally not necessary Say more. As a light angel with a jail gun, the Great Sword is not very suitable for Wella. Of course, for the angels who are born for the battle, there are no weapons that are not much different. However, if the opponent is also a light angel, then these micro-land gaps are likely to determine the outcome of a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina took the Longjing rifle and she could hear it. Nicholas also snarled in the rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve the power of equipment by sealing the soul of the victim. Although it is very evil and overbearing, it is also a particularly direct and effective method. The more powerful the soul is, the more difficult it is to manufacture equipment. Can be made with the soul of Nicholas and the dragon crystal, the power of these creations, in addition to the wind and the moon, there are really few people in the world can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
