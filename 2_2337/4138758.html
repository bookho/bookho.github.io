			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daddy's new book <Spiritual Officials> Let's help to hold a field.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;==== ======================================================================= Steep peaks can be seen everywhere in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outer world, the gale that whispers in all directions, with countless sandstones, hits these cliffs violently. However, after experiencing thousands of years of wind and sand in different circles, the hardest rock is still standing upright. These tiny sandstones want to smooth the cliffs, and I don’t know how many millennia I have to go through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cliff top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** and the bone dragon is standing against the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the owner for a long time, the bone dragon gradually fell in love with the feeling of overlooking the earth at the top of the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the previous strength was weak, the oncoming gale was enough to smash the bone dragon down the cliff. But now it's different. The bone dragon is holding his head proudly in the wind, and the whole body's blue and black light is transmitted and shimmered through the disguised broken bones and stucco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands as a nail on the cliff top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is impossible to make the bone dragon stand in the air like a ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory looked at ***, the admiration in the heart is simply uncontrollable! Being able to be accepted as a pet by such a powerful owner, its heart is already blasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the spirit of Rogge was added in time, the master servant could still circulate with the kings, but this is not a long-term solution. There is always an end to this escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time the master servant climbs a mountain, he can see the dragon in the abyss and hovering in the distant sky. After the war with ***, the dragon of the abyss is no longer willing to leave the other kings too far. This is not because its strength is not as good as ***, but because it is scrupulous about the heavenly patrol, and does not dare to call all the power for a long time. To make it a little gratifying, *** seems to have the same scruples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the two kings just used the power of the peak to fight against each other in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss of the dragon suffered a loss in the body is too large, the action is not as flexible as ***, but also sneak attack, up first was wounded. Since then, it has been more down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory's breath is too low, although it has little effect on it, but it is very annoying, a large piece of blue and black breath will block the line of sight Needless to say, the stain is like a layer of cobwebs, more or less will affect the flexibility of a little action. However, *** is completely unaffected and naturally takes up a lot of money in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the kings ended in the light stone fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When other kings arrived, they only saw the huge body of the abyss dragon falling from the sky, and the *** and the bone dragon had already disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the cliff bones lazyly squatted down the tail, it is trying to take two slaps of ***, see the demon lotus suddenly returned * ** Body, wrapped her from head to toe tightly. The clever bone dragon immediately knew that the master's master was coming again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the purple fire that is coming across the sky is wrapped in a small group of dazzling milky white sacred energy, and the light that shines makes the bone dragon feel extremely Comfortable, it quickly hid in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple fire floated quietly in front of the ***, and Rogge and *** were communicating in a way that the bone dragon could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for the purple fire to expand very slowly and very slowly. This time, *** is also very rare to find a body material for Rogge, and is extremely picky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon suddenly felt a guilty conscience, inexplicably felt a chill. It looks like electricity, and frantically searches for the best materials for the body of the corpse on the entire mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a tall and strong corpse appeared on the top of the cliff. In the chest of the corpse, the sacred energy is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s movements are extremely careful and very slow. Not only did he have to maintain the magical array of sacred vindictiveness, but he was also able to cautiously block the overflow of divine energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world of death and negative energy, such a powerful sacred energy is not conducive to a volcano that can explode at any time. Once the spill, even if Rogge and *** can keep their lives, Gregory will be blown away by the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the direction of Rogge, *** cleared a flat and clean open space on the top of the mountain. Then, with Rogge, I carved a magical array a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical array is far more complicated than the bone dragon's imagination. Even in its pre-existing memory, it is rare to see such an inscrutable magical array in the Devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no day or night in the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the magic array was finally engraved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss in the distance has disappeared. This time it seems that the kings are looking for the wrong direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The milky white sacred energy was slowly and gently removed from Rogge's chest and slowly fell into the center of the magical array. It turns like a liquid in a blink of an eye, slowly permeating along the lines of the magic array, and a magic symbol that is almost invisible is illuminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally breathed a sigh of relief. It seems that this magic array can work successfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Quietly standing beside the magical array, the flashing magical light reflected the devil's flickering. Behind the demon mask, I don’t know if it’s a joy or a worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly said: "Wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately said to the bone dragon: "Gregory! Go back to the tomb!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory ate an amazing! You want to drop me again? It's not that easy! What happened to me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed: "Gregory, this is a magical array that interferes with the kings' moments of movement." But the specific effect, I have not fully grasped. The best result is to interrupt the process of their instantaneous movement, sending the kings to other planes. However, it is also very likely that it can only interfere with the movement of some kings. I only lead the kings, this magic array will play a role. However, if only one king appears to be okay, if two kings succeed, my master and I will have to escape. If there are three kings successfully transmitted, what will be the result, you are also very clear. Gregory, you can't get into the fight with the king, your master doesn't want you to be destroyed in vain. Go ahead! "Gregory swayed his head and just wanted to scream and protest, and he was interrupted by ***: "Gregory!" Do you dare to defy my orders? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said again: "Gregory, let's go first!" As long as there is a king that has not been successfully transmitted, my host and I will have a chance to escape. At that time we couldn't take care of you anymore. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon still wants to say something, a flower in front of him, then the whole world is spinning around!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the whistling wind, the bone dragon saw the mountain peak retreating in the fast, and soon, it could not even see the *** that he threw himself. The bone dragon struggled in the air, but a huge force will make it strong. Tightly bound, let it move, can not fly in the direction of the ancient tomb.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mountain is disappearing from the bone dragon's eyes, it looks To the sky, the thick clouds are gathering wildly at the mountain, and there is another huge lightning falling from the air!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! ......"Bone dragon screams <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** and Rogge stand on the peak and calmly look at the huge cloud vortex in the sky. Sooner or later, even if the interference can be successful, this is not a good time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge magical array appeared in the sky, the central part of the magical array was smoky, and the space was unnaturally distorted. In the twinkling of an eye, a dark space crack appeared, and six huge shadows appeared one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array on the top of the peak suddenly released a dazzling glare! A vigorous and irresistible moment of force filled the surrounding space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this tremendous power, Rogge only feels that he is like a sly scorpion, and he has lost the ability to think! By his side, even the *** was slightly shaking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge never thought that this magical array would be such a huge energy based on Androni’s vindictiveness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space crack suddenly wriggling wildly! The two magical arrays are constantly on the corner, but in the middle, the kings who have not completed the transfer process have become victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of horror, uneasiness, and anger is stirring in the space! The kings are still struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fragile space cannot withstand such torture, and in a blink of an eye, dozens of new space cracks appear criss-cross. A few consecutive glare flashed, and in the angry voice of the king, the three huge shadows disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two shadows still resist the suction of the space, and the last shadow succeeds in getting rid of the restraint of suction, and the form begins to become clear. Rogge immediately recognized that the king was the Lich Elgar. It's no wonder that the momentary movement was originally moved by Elgra. It is naturally the most familiar to this magical array and the first to get rid of it from the crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are still three kings who successfully completed the transfer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A deep look at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under her calm demon mask, no one knows what is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and grabbed, the Death Scythe had already appeared in her hands, and then shouted, and the wings suddenly opened, and they would rush to the three kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, her figure flashed a bit, but she was still in place. Rogge grabbed the wings behind her and pulled her down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Not to be surprised that Rogge can make himself unable to fly. The ability to manipulate gravity allows her to exercise very little with minimal effort. Similarly, it doesn't take much energy to pull her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how did Rogge catch her wings? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stupid! Still not running!" Rogge's huge mental fluctuations with obvious anger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Stay one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s corpse body shines with magical light. He grabs the wings of the ***, dragging her like a meteor to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aelgra is angry with a staff! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the most proud moment of moving magic turned out to be the trap of the kings themselves, which greatly dampened its dignity! It is still not known whether the three unlucky kings were sent to other space planes, or they were lucky enough to be randomly transmitted to a corner of the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the magical light flashing in the distance, it’s almost mad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the only line of reason prevents the impulse to chase it. As a lich, it faces an unparalleled ***, which is absolutely fierce. What's more, there is another Rogge that makes it hate it? This magical array that interferes with the instantaneous movement is so powerful that it has long been out of its cognition! Obviously this must be the ghost of Rogge. If the *** has this ability, it has already been used. How can it be chased by the kings for so long? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the other two kings finally succeeded in resisting the changes in space, and the form began to become clear. But at this time, the magical light that just flashed in the distance has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the power of the king is insignificant in the face of the power of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you don’t rely on instant movement, no one can catch up with the ***, they can’t catch up with the bone dragon. In the vast world of death, you want to hunt down the king, it is simply an idiotic dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the horrible battle instinct of ***, it won’t take long, maybe the kings will only get together to protect themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is only one bone dragon beside ***, and each king has a powerful undead army. It is not easy to deal with the king without the corps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Seven Kings, she has no chance to form her own undead army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's more," Elgara thought bitterly. "Gen is not everything! ***, there is a pass in front of you that you can never think of waiting. You! Without the guidance of our kings, I see how you pass!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge dragged *** I don’t know how long it flew, *** wings A vibrate, suddenly shocked him out. *** Gently hovering in the air, dragging Rogge backhand, and changing direction. The figure of the two flickered, and the degree was much faster than Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she’s really rude, there’s no such thing as a straight flight. Every time the figure flashes, it’s a slight change, and the violent vibration makes it every time. Rogge has a feeling of almost falling apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that *** is deliberately revenge, but thinks that he has been pulling her wings when she dragged her, and it seems to be better than her current practice. Where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that when he was in a hurry, he even smashed the "stupid" and immediately felt guilty. As soon as he thought of the violent means of the past, Rogge felt that something was not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this battle, presumably the kings no longer dare to use the momentary movement to hunt down the means of **, and at least enough to protect themselves. At that time, she had another free time. It was not difficult to turn around Rogge's world occasionally. At that time, how would she rectify Rogge is hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge couldn’t support it, *** finally stopped. A familiar scream came: "Master!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, *** throws Rogge on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon of the surprise intersection looked at Rogge, and looked at the ***, swallowed the following bark again. It knows that when the owner's master is also there, the flattering is very easy to shoot. The smartest way to do this is to pretend that nothing is understood, just not to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge loosened the bones and finally climbed up. Suddenly, the eyes of the *** and the bone dragon were staring at his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is a bit strange, looking down, a white, plump feather is sticking to his hand bones...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extremely shocking bone dragon finally moved his eyes, and he couldn’t help but look at the wings of the ***. Just at this time, Rogge’s gaze also fell on the wings of the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the endless world seems to have solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The small mouth of the demon mask, a whistling sound of Qing Yue spread far away! Her wings were raging, and everything around her was immediately doubled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rumor, Gregory and Rogge were no longer standing, and the heavy bones were firmly pressed to the ground. This is the first time that Rogge personally experienced the gravity attack of ***, and it really is unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** snorted and brushed up the wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Bone Dragon cautiously climbed up and looked at each other. The bone dragon immediately turned his head and did not look at Rogge. Rogge was furious in his heart, and the dark bones of this fickle turned out to be so snobbish. If there is a chance, he will have to teach him a good meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Going to Rogge, Rogge couldn’t help but take a step back. If it wasn’t for ***, he would hold his hand, he would I have to fall into a big pit behind me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge only felt a slam in his head, and he noticed the perfect curve of the demon lotus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver vortex continues to expand in front of Rogge’s eyes, Rogge just screams badly, his mental power is like a flood of flooding, rushing out ! The suction of the whirlpool is so large that it is unimaginable, and Rogge’s huge mental power is not lost in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the corpse was scattered, and Rogge, who had completely lost his energy, could not help but return to his own world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the broken bones scattered in the ground, Gregory squatted down on the ground and did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People! Gregory was so scared that he immediately jumped up and his tail swayed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where were you looking?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am watching how you learn to offend you, master! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** snorted, looking at the bone dragon, looking straight at it and timid, and finally the whole body was shaking, this was done.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his eyes tiredly, and it was a beautiful face. He fixed his mind and saw that it was not the face of the butterfly, but Droni.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rogge, you have been in a coma for a day. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? Rogge was so weak that he couldn't help but snorted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How was your magic experiment, how could it suddenly faint?" Androni asked with concern, but Rogge knew that she was not concerned about his body, but when she could leave the Elven city and exchange with Gregory. But Rogge is now burdened. I have already gone, I feel good, and I don’t care about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear and soft voice came out of the door: "Dear! How have you been fainted for so long? If it is taken advantage of being taken advantage of by others, am I not losing money? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face changed immediately. This fairy princess has always been one of his most headaches. The shame of shame has not been revenged so far.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the fat man can be said to be slippery, then Rogge is now close to big disgust. Although the realm has been fundamentally different, but The nature of vengeance has not changed at all. It’s just that Rogge is now entangled in everything, and there is really no time and energy to fight this little goblin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog He turned up and sat up, his face white and scary. He saw the wind butterfly shrinking in the corner of the room, looking at his eyes is extremely complicated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is against Ander Ronnie said: "Let me take a day off, we will go out to the Ayre Principality immediately! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni's joy and the pain and hatred that fluttered in the eyes of Froia were all caught in Rogge.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when Rogge, who had recovered his physical strength, stepped out of the temple, he obviously felt that the temperature of the city of the gods was already cold. He looked up at the top of his head. The old tree canopy on the cloud is now yellow and green. Roger's brow wrinkled, and he felt that the shoulder was heavy and could not help but sigh.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem of the old tree of the elves Androni and Froya have already known, but they are also helpless. Rogge did not expect them, even the inscrutable Hughes can not solve the problem, they two young girls What can I do?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guard of the dark-faced knight who rode the moon, Rogge rushed to Dresden. He sent it first. A knight, to inform the Dresden stationed in Dresden, immediately went out to Recto, responsible for managing the newly merged country of the snowy. Frey, in addition to good mana, more Under the enthusiasm of the wrath of the sky, he is still an outstanding commander and political strategist. Rogge now does not want Frey to see Androni, so as not to make extra money, so that this simple Druid is not a 'brother'. Since then, he is no longer working for him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that more than Androni and Froya are around, Rogge feels a lot in mind. Plus Rafael, who is hidden in the dark, if the death class reappears, he is not completely self-protecting. Just watching the increasingly windy butterfly, Rogge can't help but think of Ajani, faintly. I feel a little bit into the wind butterfly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge nodded and came to the door of the magnificent living room on the third floor, just to hear a crisp crack of the vase, and then a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger frowned, and asked the door: "Auntie, what is so angry?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie said with anger: "I have not said that no one is coming in? You, are you coming back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes I am back. The country of the snow cape is no longer there. The only thing that exists in the future is the Recto province of the Principality of Aray. Has the territory of the Principality of Aray been unexplored for more than 100 years?" Rogge said As I walked to the aunt, I carefully looked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie glamorous as ever, despite the careful wearing of clothes, but the slightly raised belly has been concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the use of the Ayre Principality to develop more land? Is the Tikick family or the owner of the Ayre Principality? You killed your father, poisoned My brother, I haven't put it in my heart. But now I am a female grandfather, but no one listens to my orders! Everything needs you to come back to make a decision! Rogge, you are the real grandfather of the Ayre Principality. Ah!" Auntie ridiculed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said faintly: "Auntie, angry can be bad for children. I am very respectful of the traditions of the upper class. The reason why you are not allowed to intervene in the national government is I am afraid that you are tired, and you don’t know how to govern the country. I am a magician. I am not interested in the power of the Ayre Principality. The blood of Tikirk will always be the master of the Principality of Are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie is furious: "Rogge! Don't think that I don't know your intentions! You use me and my children to be your shields, you are afraid Interference with the Holy Alliance! Waiting for your feathers to be full, you might kill me like my father and my brother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog is somewhat surprised Looking at the aunt, he suddenly felt that maybe some of the glamorous and debauched women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Auntie, as long as you don't do stupid things, this will not happen. The first thing in front of me is to settle my elves. As for me. Other goals are far beyond the scope of the Holy Alliance. The existence of the Principality of Aray, who is its ruler, does not matter to me. I now personally master the power of the Ayre Principality, I do not want someone to block me. Auntie, since I can kill Tikick and Carlos, I can naturally kill Clark. You should understand that I am not afraid of the Principality of Layton, nor the interference of the Holy Alliance. I really don’t want me. There is nothing wrong with the elf, but that doesn't mean that I will give everything to the elf. I am a great magician and I have the best killer. No matter which country in the Holy Alliance, even the most powerful Principality of Layton, they may be able to Blocking my Elf Guard, but I can't stop my assassin. I can say with certainty that as long as I am willing, no Grand Duke of the Principality can live for a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge sneered, and said: So, no one wants to threaten me! I am rushing me, but I have done everything! Do you think Clark and his uncle Alams don’t want to kill me? But they don’t dare. Even if I die, I As long as there is still a living killer, they don’t want to sleep for a good day in this life. Auntie, peace of mind, be your female grandfather, and raise your children with peace of mind. It will take a long time for me to return the Ayre Principality. To you. How can this small place of the Holy League be my goal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Rogge’s surprise is that he’s a haze After the words are finished, Auntie’s eyes are bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went up two steps, kneeling in front of Rogge, hugged his leg, looked up, eagerly said: "God! This is me Dream lover! You have turned conspiracy and scorpion into art! Rogge, please don't abandon me. If you don't like the child in my stomach, I can knock him down and give birth to you again! But no matter what. Please don't treat me as a useless woman! I admit that I have a natural fanaticism about power, but I am by no means a person who abuses power! I know that you must have a big conspiracy, the Holy Alliance is like this. It’s also insignificant in the conspiracy. Let me share your plot! Let me share your wisdom! The time we get along with, I think you can see with your wisdom that I know in politics, financial income and even military affairs. A lot. Anyway, please let me contribute some power to your conspiracy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the burning fanaticism in the eyes of Auntie, could not help but A chaos, he licked the sun, and said: ! Now I need to rebuild the army of the Principality of Aray. I will inform Hille, and in the future, the matter of armaments and candidate officers will be yours first. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
