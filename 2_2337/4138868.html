			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the six chapters on the gambling <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter six gambling<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore is stepping on a soft scarlet carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His steps are not uniform, and his strength is too deep. These nuances are not noticed by ordinary people, but for a warrior whose strength is not far from the sanctuary, this can only mean that his heart is not calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore’s heart leaps and his mind is in chaos. For him, the chaotic mentality is a big taboo, but Fiore has not taken care of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, even if he was upset, he should be fully suppressed. Because at this moment, the tall man who walked in front of Fiore, is the head of the Holy Knights, the blood angel Augustus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore can't see the strength of Augustus, but knows that blood angels will see through his state at this time. As a martial-born warrior, he couldn’t control his emotions, and it was too much to say. Impressing the blood angels so badly, this is very unfavorable for Fiore's promotion in the church or the Holy Knights. However, power and status are as good as today's Fiore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the noble and elegant figure in front appears in his sight, he can't control himself. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the approval of the Church of Light, Fiore and several priests joined the army of Bavaria and temporarily served for the Principality. The other sacred colleagues entered the army and followed Marshal Rosherio to fight the three small principalities in the south of the Principality. Only Fiore had no interest in the military. He managed to get the task of protecting the Grand Duke’s wife Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time goes by, the countries of the South are now gradually clearing the great means of the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Principality of the martial arts has completely turned into a huge and terrible war machine. however. Even if the entire Rhine Union's land and the surrounding small principalities were annexed, the 400,000-strong army was too large for the Bavarian Principality. Moreover, in two months, the 300,000 new recruits who are training will gradually step out of training and set foot on the battlefield. The 700,000-strong military equipment, training, logistics, and supplies can easily drag down the entire Principality. At this time, the Principality has become a hungry beast. Since you can't find enough food in your own territory, you have to go to other places to find prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are so many beasts at the end of the day to choose people. All the countries around the Principality even include the Dro Empire, one of the three great empires. All began to recruit troops to prepare for war. The Bavarian Principality is definitely going to war, but it is not known now which will burn the war to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as a few months ago, the war machine of the Bavarian Principality was overwhelmed. If it was changed to another country, it must have collapsed. But Catherine relied on unparalleled computing, her powers, cold-bloodedness, and her unparalleled appeal in the Principality to maintain the operation of this war machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows. Behind her perfect and noble face, what kind of mind is there, it seems that the entire Principality has been installed in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So protecting Mrs. Catherine’s Grand Duke is almost as important as protecting the Bavarian Grand Duke. Catherine does not have any martial arts and magic. She is going to visit the Principality from time to time, and the danger is far greater than the Bavarian Grand Duke who is in the army. Of course, in Fiore's heart, no one is more important than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore looked at Catherine’s numerous sleepless work; he watched her still worried about the lack of military expenses at the last moment. The next moment is to put on the most perfect smile to meet the young warrior who is about to go to the front line; he looks at her facelessly signing dozens of hanged orders, and then weeping alone when no one is there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore also heard many criticisms of this perfect, noble and cold-blooded Grand Duchess. Every time he forced to suppress the impulse to slash the sword, because he felt that doing so would make Catherine's efforts go to waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore decided to share the accusations of injustice with Catherine, though. She does not know her own mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already served as Catherine's guard for a few months, but Fiore did not say a few words to her. Catherine was always busy, and when she was free, Fiore would rather give up the opportunity to talk to her in order to allow her to sleep for a little longer. As the sect of this period. Fiore has this confidence. Catherine will not refuse to talk to him for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that she looks into his eyes every time. There are silent expectations and appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, Fiore can bear everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he thought that he was the only one who understood and understood Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus led Catherine to the Pope’s prayer room and turned to: "Mrs. Catherine, the Pope is already waiting for you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled, the charm of the first beauty of the king is not the same, this smile is like a spring bloom, making the entire gallery a bright one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pleasure to see the Pope in the prayer room!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine While holding the noble and elegant smile of the signature style, I lifted the skirt of the long skirt, and then... I opened the door of the prayer room with one foot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore’s mind was blank and he couldn’t understand what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the face of the Pope sitting in the prayer room was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope is sitting next to MGM and Macbeth. They looked at Catherine, and it was impossible to connect this woman who was close to perfection with the rude behavior of the kicking, and she laughed so elegantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine did not wait for the Pope to order, and the money went to a chair and sat down. She greeted MGM and Macbeth, and the grace of manners made the two high-ranking angels stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the most obsessed Tiratemis in the world of heaven will like her very much? The two angels thought quite disrespectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have not been aware of the changes that have taken place on their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Pope," behind Catherine's charming smile. There are always some daunting things hidden: "Are you sure that the full support of the Bavarian Principality is ready? I am here today to thank the Pope for his generosity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The Pope coughed up and finally calmed down and calmed down: "Respecting Mrs. Catherine, the Church of Light has sent you members of the Church. The mission of the Church is to serve the Most High God, we are not convenient." Direct involvement in secular wars, but please rest assured that the noble Bavarian Grand Duke is a miraculous voter. No one can stop his great cause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine He chuckled a few times and said: "The seventh and seventeenth pages of the scroll of the gods in the Light of the Holy Scriptures are clearly written. The mission of the Church of Light is to spread to the glory of the High God. Communication and service, the difference between numbers, this The gap is big! Is it true that the Church of the Lights has just been revised? If there is no change, then I don’t understand that the Principality is doing its best to fight against the infidels and spread to the beliefs of the High God. Why can’t they get it? Since the help of the Light Church? If you think that only a total of six Templars can influence the War. I can only say that I cannot understand your definition of help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustus said: "Respected Mrs. Catherine, please note that the only person who has the right to interpret the teachings is His Majesty the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine Smiled: "The right to explain does not mean that you can talk nonsense. Well, then I will listen to the interpretation of His Majesty the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a quiet room in the prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Catherine broke the silence: "Good! I don't seek the Pope's explanation. Now the Principal is about to fight the Dro Empire, if you can get help from the Church of Light." Then, the Principality will have 100,000 warriors to save their lives! Your dear Pope, would you rather watch the hundreds of thousands of God's most devout believers die?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled even more fascinatingly, and she turned her hand over and had a bright dagger in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no movements in prayer. Because Catherine would not have martial arts at all, no one would believe she would assassinate the Pope. Only Fiore exclaimed: "Catherine! What are you doing! Put down the dagger, you can never hurt the Pope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Catherine’s dagger Is your own chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore's face is white, he does not care about his status, lightning-like reach, took the dagger from Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked at Fiore with a smile and extended his left hand and said, "Get it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Under her gaze of clear eyes, Fiore actually felt great mental pressure. He could not violate the will of Catherine like steel. I had to tremble and handed the dagger back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore suddenly smiled. Since he can't stop her from committing suicide. Then, if you stay with her, you can still do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is desperately crazy. Is it called...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine softly said: "The dear Pope, I don’t care what God sees, I only know that I can’t let hundreds of thousands of young warriors in the Principality This embarked on the battlefield and fought the Dero empire, one of the most powerful empires on the entire continent. At the same time, the brightest church, which was supposed to be their spiritualest pillar and the most determined ally, stood by and watched! His Majesty, the Pope, has been A year! How many times have I been looking for you in the past year? But what did you finally get? Six sacred churches are these! Of course, adults of Augustus once led the Holy Knights to the front line to help, but they just walked A circle. If today, I still can't get help from you, then I will pierce the heart with this dagger. Because I really can't face so many young soldiers who will die in the battlefield."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope opened his dim eyes and met Catherine’s clear eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time, just silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine continued her perfect and tempting smile, and the dagger began to pierce his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore thought he could watch Catherine commit suicide, however. He can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore’s hand is extremely pale. His fingers trembled slightly, and the sword on his back began to move gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Pope sighed and said, "What kind of help do you need, Mrs. Catherine?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled and pulled the dagger out and gently threw it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the dagger is between her white chest. Dipped a bright red blood line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need 20,000 holy knights!" Catherine exports are amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus frowned: "But at the moment there are only 15,000 holy knights near the Principality. How could you give you 20,000? Most..." He glanced at the pope. Continued: "I can give you up to 5,000 holy knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That 10,000!" Catherine smiled sweetly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six thousand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eight thousand!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is helpless: "Okay, it’s eight thousand! I will arrange it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Catherine stopped Augustus. There was no treatment on the wound on her chest, and there was still a slow flow of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood slowly flows through the white chest muscles, so glaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred!" Augustus took a breath. The sanctuary has always been in the hands of the pope. He did not have the power to decide on the dispatch of members of the church. The blood angel suddenly discovered that when asked for the members of the church, Catherine did not look at him at all, but only looked at the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope slightly opened his sleepy eyes and said: "This kind of person, there are only twenty in the church."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" Catherine smiled very charmingly and said: "Don't think that I don't know how many members are in the church! Give me eighty, never more!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-five!" The Pope seems to have come to the spirit again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next hard bargain. Let Augustus look stunned. The most fascinating members of the Church of the Light, at this time, as if they were on the market, became the target of bargaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a seemingly interesting process, filled with blood and blood. The blood has soaked in Catherine's bra and began to seep away from the skirt. But the pope turned a blind eye to the blood, and Catherine was only when the blood was not flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty! No more!" The Pope spit out the final card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty is forty! But add them both!" Catherine was like a spring-and-white finger. Pointed to MGM and Macbeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time even the pope’s half-closed eyes opened, and he coughed a few times. When he just wanted to speak out, he was interrupted by Catherine: “Anyway The two adults have just come from the heavens. Since they are familiar with the world, it is better to follow me. I can guarantee that the two adults will experience more wonderful things in this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus has a face. He never imagined that MGM and Macbeth had come to such a secret matter, and Catherine actually knew it. Where did this secret leak from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze suddenly fell on Fiore. Under the gaze of electricity, Fiore trembled softly. Paled face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled and stared at Augustus. Dao: "It's not a stranger to Fiore. He just knows that there are angels in the church recently. I just saw these two adults are unparalleled. Not in this world, they can sit next to the noble Pope. So I ventured to guess. So seriously, Augustus is an adult. In fact, your previous move confirmed my conjecture!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM and Macbeth looked at each other and MGM said with an elegant smile that was not inferior to Catherine: "I think it would be very interesting to be able to experience the world with Mrs. Catherine."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since MGM and Macbeth have agreed, the Pope will no longer speak out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the purpose has been reached, Catherine stood up and bowed to the pope. Her face then passed a pale, softly poured down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the emperor Richelieu has begun to have a chill of silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! The Emperor closed the painting in front of him and fell heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge humbly stood by. He is not far from the emperor's land, and there are bosses in it. When the wrath of the natural goddess is launched, it will not accidentally injure the great emperor. It’s just that Rogge feels that the boss’s ability to manage the land should not stop there. As he stepped into the Emperor's study, the wrath of the natural goddess showed no signs of attack. Although the goddess divine attack is not regular, but for a long time no movement, is something that has never happened before. It seems that the goddess of power seems to be suppressed by a mysterious force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quietly looked at the majestic Emperor's Palace, only to think that there are too many secrets he does not know in the Asrofic Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have not arranged to kill Frederick in the middle of the road, why should you send this picture over? Do you want to irritate me?" The emperor gloomy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately replied: "Freiter has broken our ambush and has fled back to the Chaoshan Legion. Your Majesty, we are worried that he will provoke the soldiers of the Chaoshan Legion. Follow him in rebellion. The empire has already damaged too many warriors in the fight. These warriors should die in the battlefield instead of dying in their own fighting! After all, the Sturt loyalty to the empire, he resolutely gave up. The belief of the goddess of nature relieved the alliance with Druid. But Frederick is the most faithful believer of the goddess of nature. After we overthrew the city of the sky, he could never compromise with us. We sent this The painting is to hope that His Majesty can know the misunderstanding hidden in the secret of Frederick. The Chaoshan Legion, one of the three major empire of the Empire, can no longer be lost because of Frederick’s personal refusal to admit defeat."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
