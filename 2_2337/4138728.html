			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter three-person <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some completely unburned trees still in the rundown city of Sayi Black smoke. More than ten houses have been completely destroyed by fire, and many houses have large, shocking holes. Although the body has been removed, there is still a trace of blood on the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a cry of misery in the city. In a short period of time, more than one hundred people became souls under the sword of the Black Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mother crying son, wife crying husband, grandson crying grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rouge, who had not slept overnight, took the elves in the city. He always appears where he needs to direct the citizens to move the bricks of the collapsed houses, rescue the people buried underneath, and simply heal the wounds for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has begun to call the 'seal of the devil' of Rogge as the "great magician, the long-lost town suddenly encountered such a disaster, all people Lost the idea and looked at Rogge's eyes full of fear and helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Old Luck apparently thoroughly pursued the basic survival rules of the nobility: foolish people. The people of Sayi City have become accustomed to accepting the orders of the nobility, and they need a single person to give orders. Rogge, who showed great power, naturally became the commander of this order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what he wants, but the damage caused by the black warrior for a few minutes is far from his imagination. He was amazed at the tremendous damage that the black warriors had caused to the city. These black warriors are only part of the ***. If Gregory and the Flame Bones are added to this rank, or even *** personally, I will not use it for half a night, will this small town be razed to the ground? It is not difficult to kill at least this 10,000 people. Although Gregory's wind poisoning has no effect on the strong, it is most suitable for the mass slaughter of the weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly understood why the church was so jealous of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An undead creature that an ordinary Necromancer can command is equivalent to a small army. If it is powerful like Rodriguez, the undead creature is a legion! He was able to fight against the church and the entire Holy Knights for three hundred years, precisely because of the countless powerful undead creatures he controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rodriguez’s three hundred years against the church was three hundred years of escaping from the east, any sacred knight’s army chasing Rodriguez If the scale is less than 500 people, it will be destroyed by him and become a dead soul. After several defeats in succession, the church also learned to be smart, sending out large units of more than a thousand. Just like this, how can I catch the big magician who is alone? After such a stalemate for three hundred years, Rodriguez finally couldn't stand it and killed the Great Temple of Otto, which was captured by the light of judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Temple of Otto has the cardinal and hundreds of sacred knights guarded, and the mighty light angel Weina is among them, but still by Rodriguez Attacked in one fell swoop. The Bright Church has been chasing the Spirit Master for countless years, precisely because of fear of the second Rodriguez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Rogge, the necromancer, should be very powerful, and its strength is far beyond the magic of his eleventh level. There is no reason for it. There is a *** existence, which is enough to clean up the people like Androni who are close to the sanctuary. Gregory and the Flame Bone are not weak, plus hundreds of powerful undead creatures, and a small army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the other hand, his necromancer is actually very weak: he is a necromancer without an undead army. All the undead creatures were taken over by the ruthlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a busy day, Rogge finally calmed down the chaos in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the Sayi City Tax Officer respectfully received Rogge from his guest house. After the death of the Earl of Luck, the city of Say is only the highest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the dinner, some of the highly respected gentlemen in the city of Sayi were present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Guardian Warriors were also invited to attend the dinner. Their brilliance made these beard-and-white gentlemen all helpless, and greedy eyes walked up and down their faces from time to time. The wind butterfly never took off the helmet, but she just sat quietly there, and naturally it showed the brilliance and the eternal manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen," Rogge smiled and looked around. "The devil has been re-sealed by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence was silent for a moment, and suddenly a cheer! After a night of blood and fire, these noble gentlemen are filled with fear. Rogge looked at the scores, and that day they were the fastest packed. Anyone with wealth and status will become more afraid of death. The human being, the fear of the unknown, often goes through the actual situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the demon has been sealed, and the gentlemen who are not too young are lively like the 18-year-old boy, and the atmosphere is extremely extreme. Active. Even with the courage to start, he began to play a joke between Rogge and these beautiful Elf female warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was active for a while and smiled: "But my strength is too weak, and this seal may be reopened at any time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was quiet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat looks at the pale faces of everyone, how do you not know that they are thinking about moving quickly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay, I will guard the seal of this demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman They immediately sighed. But Rogge obviously does not intend to make them happy longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up to three days, the devil will try to break through the seal again. If this seal is successfully broken, I can only evacuate immediately. I am not this. Devil's opponent. Even if it is the white bones of Amaro's men, I am completely defeated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, respected magician, if When the devil breaks through the seal again, what will happen to you? Since you, please forgive me for being rude. Why are you still a devil's opponent? Why do you still stay?" An obese old man trembled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two days later is the weakest time for my seal. The ancient devil will definitely hit the seal. If its power is not fully restored, then come from the devil." The monster will only be the inferior devil last night. If it is strong, there will be a high-level demon like this in the world. If it is only a small monster, of course, this possibility is less than ten. One, I still have a way to get rid of them. After that, only if the elves live on this land, the seal will be unbreakable! But if you come out with a high-level demon, then even I have to escape. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is one more thing," Rogge’s eyes turned to the ancient demon Amoro bulimia, and I will arrange a magical array in the city for three days. So in case of its resurrection, there is the blood of the 10,000 citizens in this city, this magical array will be able to firmly bind the Amorro to this land. If not, the Amorro operation will be completely free of space distance, and it can be transmitted thousands of miles away in an instant. In two days, the distance that ordinary people can escape, it can catch up in the blink of an eye. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere between the seats has become weird. Although people are still talking and laughing, Rogge knows that they are hesitating whether they want to stay and gamble. Win They can't get anything. If they lose, they lose their lives.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Rogge did not leave them a choice. The gentlemen have not yet seen the courage to die.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they run away, if there is a demon coming and going like a wind, it’s better to have a demon tied in place. Even if this requires the blood of 10,000 people, but the blood, after all, is not their own flow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many arguments among the gentlemen, and finally reached Consistent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put forward a high-sounding reason, saying that they need to report to the localities, so they will inform the news of the resurrection of the devil and the death of the old count. To other cities, and in order not to let the ancient devils of the Amorro's claws touch the millions of people in the Principality of Aray I am afraid, I have to risk the sacrifice of more than 10,000 residents of Sayi City.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some gentlemen who have not made a sound, but Rogge does not I suspect they will escape tonight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Master of Magic, in order not to let the public turmoil, I think this news should not tell them good. ! What do you think? "The obese old man whispered close to Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, in the wind butterfly impression, I have never heard of the famous demon in the devil world called the Amorro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves guard the warriors are also a look of disgust, if they do not respect God to make adults, they can not help but want to beat people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this all you mean?" Rogge asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was a little uneasy and said carefully: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it. Go and pack up. I won't disclose this news to anyone. It's time to get it." Rogge smiled and made the best commitment for them. If the fat man announces the news, all the citizens will choose to flee. Without the blood of this 10,000 people, how can we guarantee the safety of these cadres? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who have no intention of eating, and immediately quit, and rushed home to pack things away. The two days are too few, and the distance that can escape is limited, so that everyone has made up their minds to stay out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled as they watched them leave, turning their heads to look at the tax official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax official is in his early forties, his head is a bit bald. He wears a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, lean body, perhaps because of too much work in the book, with a bit of savvy in the savvy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a bit embarrassed: "Roger adults have to pack their luggage. If you don't think this house is simple, feel free to use it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head and rested in the castle of Count Luck, and arranged a few magic arrays. Don't be too arrogant when you go, it is not good to alarm an acquaintance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a thrilling day, the city of Sayi finally entered a deep dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Around 2 am, at the same time, a carriage began quietly on the street, slowly out of the city, and then rushed away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Because Rogge has warned that if the number of people who donate blood is less than 10,000, the magic array will not work. The population of Sayi City is only a little more than 10,000, so the characters who are eligible to attend the banquet are only After notifying the most immediate relatives, I quickly left the city of Sayi after simply tidying up the most valuable things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the blood is a little farther Some distant relatives also couldn’t take care of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tower of the castle, the wind butterfly is watching Roger with a roaring carriage in the dark. It is famous, although it is already midnight, she can easily see the far carriage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rog Man, I still can not understand the human family, they threw it when fellow, why these people cheat, lie to them to leave to die? Noble elves have never done this kind of thing! "The voice of her anger is shaking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, no one denies that the elf is an elegant race. Similarly, the Terran is full of conspiracy, infighting and betrayal. However, why are the people more prosperous, and the elves can only hide in the mountains without the human race? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is a little confused, she looked at Rogge, the latter is standing in the cold wind, calmly looking into the distance. God made The facts are too high and unpredictable. Wind Butterfly has no idea what his next plan is. However, it seems that everything is under the control of God. She couldn’t help but sigh gently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...I really don't know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought for a moment and whispered: "Maybe... the Terran are very good, they are just like the orcs, they will all be born..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stunned, suddenly burst into laughter, laughing and stunned, and his ears were red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved his hand to the endless plains in the distance, and the voice became low and sounded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, you see, this vast On the plains, there are dozens of ethnic groups, including a huge military empire: Asrofik. The empire is only the number of the army, several times the population of all the elves in the Central Mountain Range. And there are seven or eight small countries in front of us, and seven or eight of them can mobilize the army of 10,000. You said that we have more than 10,000 elves, even if they are all on the battlefield, how many Terran troops can they withstand? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, you know, now the elves are like a baby, walking in countless wolves. Every decision I make may be related to the life and death of the entire elves. The world is sinister, the weight of this burden on my shoulders. I hope you can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly bowed his head and whispered: "Rogge, I am not good at politics and governance, you are a lot I don't understand the order. But Hilo chooses to guide the elves, it must be justified. But why do you know that there is a demon here? What is the relationship between this demon and the elves? Why do you want to tell this wicked person this message first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a magician, the magical world is vast and magical, I can perceive it. The existence of Moro is not strange. Wind butterfly, the existence of the ancient demon Amuro, is a threat to the elves and an opportunity. Just beside the city of the gods, there is such a demon sleeping, how can we feel at ease All I have to come This is the case. The elves have been indifferent to the past, and I can only say that it is really short-sighted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for these people I revealed that they were leaving them to leave the city. They are the most greedy people, the bloodsucking scorpion sucked on ordinary people. Now, the original owner of the city, Leuk, is dead, mastering most of the wealth and The rich people of power ran again, and the city of Sayi was already in my hand. It is not difficult for these simple citizens to accept the elves. As long as the elves put down their senseless arrogance, they will learn from the Terran. There will be a lot of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that Rogge is so relentlessly scorning the elves, the arrogant wind butterfly is angry, she Can't argue with Rogge in the big political strategy of the elves, only cold and cold: "Master Rogge, what did you do to me that day, it seems to have nothing to do with the safety of the elves? Also, the one you gave The bloody order of the series is also for the elves. Family considerations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled slightly, skipping the day when he was tempted to talk about the movie, just said: "We are in the wolves, So I need a brave, fearless hound to defend against these wolves. I can't help but say that the elves are too elegant. This elegance is weak on the battlefield. So I need a bloodthirsty unit, one Only break into the dark forces, a force that can do everything to kill the opponent! Only with this unit, the elves have a little bit of security."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the elves are excellent archers, and most of them are excellent brave warriors! "The wind butterfly argues.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. But the Elf has never been a qualified army! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly is a popular language. As the guardian of the Elves, the military knowledge is also one of the compulsory courses. The education that Wind Butterfly has always been is If it’s not that the Terran is too mean and shameless, and it’s just fighting the Elves, it’s not the elves’ opponents.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf’s individual combat power is very strong, Central Mountain Ten Tens of thousands of elves have more than a dozen or more masters. In terms of population ratio, it is indeed far from the human race. However, as Fengdie said, the population and fertility of the Terran are not at all. The elves can look forward to their backs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Rogge, the wind butterfly gradually understands that the elves’ thoughts are too naive. On the battlefield, the opponent is not required. How can it be possible to make a conspiracy?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger," Wind Butterfly has the courage to say, "I know that your wisdom is not comparable to me. Your order is also for the future consideration of the elves. But...but..." She said, she lowered her head again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s cold smile didn’t let me bring Rumsfeld out of the law enforcement team ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly raised his head and said with resoluteness: "Master Rogge, your mind is actually very clear. You just want to get me to put Ram. Sfield sent to the law enforcement team! The other players have changed a few rounds, only...only he is always doing bloody things! This is not fair!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge softly said: "Dedicated to the future of the elves, this is his luck!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind screamed angrily: "But why? You only target him alone! Do you want to use this method to make me succumb? Well! I swear in the name of Hilo! I will never be separated from him!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly was shocked: how can this be! You can do it with me, but don't involve others! Do you think you can do whatever you want in the elves? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha laughed and was furious. This wind butterfly has a stubborn stubur, and her relationship with Rumsfeld is very deep. But she After all, it’s still innocent and completely ignorant of Rogge’s vicious means.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not involve others? Rogge said coldly, "That is impossible!" On the contrary, I will not deal with you. You will not follow me one day. I will not stop remediating Rumsfeld in one day. Maybe there will be other elves, and even the entire elf will be unlucky. And all this is just because of your selfishness! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our elves are always loyal to love! No matter what means you use, you get my body and I can't get my heart! I will reveal you to the Presbyterian Church. "The wind butterfly is also very angry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles that some elders will stand on my side. They will distinguish the fate of the whole family and you alone. It’s heavy. What can you do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a meal, Rogge sneered again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's more, I only want you, don't want your heart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly exclaimed The body was soft and almost fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge did not look at her, still looking at the endless darkness of the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, I originally had a lot of hope for you. But I did not expect that you are as stupid as other elves. Elf can be because of me. Xing, you can also die because of me. You better think clearly, if you don't obey me, what will happen to the whole elves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly Face Change It was pale, and the two lines of tears flowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger adults...Can't give me some time, let me think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly took a ritual and left slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles at the back of the wind butterfly. You want to give the first holiness to Rumsfeld before me, then I will Send the elves to the devil's mouth. As for him, I can guarantee that death will never be his worst ending. I have some strengths in how to deal with the soul. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly stood still, then burst into tears and rushed away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head and smiled. "Don't I still be able to clean up your little girl?" As for Rumsfeld, hehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at a carriage that was galloping and smiled. Luck was already seated to summon the demon The crimes, these real moments of the city of Sayi have ran away again and again, and now, no one can stop Rogge from getting this small town.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the early morning, the residents of Sayi City wake up as usual, they slowly appear, and there seems to be something missing in the city. Finally, a person cried, "How did the master of Khari go missing? He was still eating at the tax official's house last night! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens have been talking about it, and finally the heads of the city who have attended the tax official's dinner yesterday are gone.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They faintly felt that there was something big to be born, and they couldn’t help but panic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another person calling, "Great Magic division! The great magician Rogge, he is still in the castle! He will tell us what happened to him! Yes, there must be something born! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood before the castle, and the elf guards stood behind him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the face of the wind butterfly is very pale.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind in winter is very fierce, and the cloak of the elves is flying with the wind. Then Rogge’s cloak is not moving. It looks very strange.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My people!" Rogge echoed in the air with the soft sound of magic. No one has any objections to his formulation, and everyone is worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow, the ancient demon will once again hit the seal, and the devil's men will run out of the seal."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public suddenly exclaimed, and timidly cried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the rich guys?" Someone shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They, after learning the news, they have left the city overnight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Rogge expected, there was a buzz in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you inform us, why only tell the rich! You liar!" Someone questioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger fixed his eyes and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't inform you, because escape is absolutely unable to escape the devil's claws. I stayed, I will face the devil with you! Even if I Not a devil's opponent, I can guarantee in the name of the supreme god, I will also be the first person to fall under the devil's claws!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sun Rogge is so sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who are starting to kneel down. Slowly, more and more people are kneeling in front of Rogge. After a while, all the people are kneeling. In front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly looks at Rogge, she increasingly feels that this god is a mixture of angels and demons. He can threaten himself with the most vicious means without hesitation. He can not kill the village without hesitation, and he will courageously face the devil in order to save irrelevant people. Wind Butterfly has already seen the power of the Black Warrior, and she is also familiar with the horror of the recorded ancient devils. Although God made the adults retreat the bone dragon with incomparable power, but he said that he can overcome these ancient demons, the wind butterfly is absolutely unbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, a ride rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was a little surprised, staring at it, turned out to be the tax official to return. Did he really move to the rescue? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax official finally came over and the citizens looked at him quietly. He jumped off the horse in front of Rogge, whispering: Can leave these neighbors and run away. I let my family continue to escape. But I think it should be back! If you can't stop the devil, you can fight it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked and never thought that this seemingly weak tax official was so bloody!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;There are countless people applauding, and some people shouted: "We fight with the devil! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog has some accidents, he secretly calculated, after the acceptance of the city of Sayi, this tax official is a usable material.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now everything is in the calculations of Rogge. He calms the citizens, builds a barricade in the town, and rests at home waiting for the result of his battle with the ancient demon.<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has taken the opportunity to occupy the castle of Count Luck. The devil seal inside the castle can deter anyone who wants to touch the castle. What's more, all the things are a bit of a thing The castle's people have fled the city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the elves, secretly summoned Gregory, and quietly said to the bone dragon: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go tell ***, I will use another black warrior tonight, one is fine! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory will appear again in a short time, and he brought back a message from ***.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner said that her men are few and can't waste any more. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s disappointment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s eyes flashed in flames, Again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
