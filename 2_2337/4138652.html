			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow fox knights bypassed the frontal spider web with skillful skills, and the infantry began to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and others ran away and ran out for one or twenty miles. Looking back, the smoke was rolling in, and the snow fox had already caught up. Quite a lot. The aristocratic scums were scared, turned to the horse's head, and fled to the Devil's Forest, ten miles away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart is not slow to chase, with the snow fox brigade riding, long ago can catch up with those rabble. However, he has been suppressed for nearly a year, and he does not see this small force that is obviously an enemy. He is known as "butcher Hart chased ten miles, there will be a snow fox knight to go back and guide the infantry, and in front of two miles, a group of five highly skilled knights hung Rogge and so on. He does not let go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart is very fond of the feeling of blowing in the galloping wind, and under his rush, his blood is slowly boiling, the nameless flame Constantly burning his nerves. Looking out of sight is already a blood red, Hart seems to see the clowns running in front of him on the tip of his gun! Blood ran down the gun and dripped in his mouth "Mom, it's really thirsty!" ! "Hart's heart cursed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and others fled to the side of the Devil's Forest, slowed down, and with Kate's order, suddenly turned back. The five snow fox knights in the back half of the world pulled the horse's head flexibly, and the five horses stood up at the same time, and they turned around and opened the distance. The light theory riding, but stronger than Rogge and others. More.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Hart has already caught up and slowed down outside. It was a snow fox cavalry who stepped back. Prepare to contact the infantry team. Suddenly there was a scream in the forest, a lightning bolt shot, and the autobiography of the soldier passed through the chest, with a bloody rain, and flew a few tens of meters away before being obliquely inserted on the ground. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden moment immediately shocked everyone. Then in the snoring, a hundred cavalrymen smashed out of the Devil’s Forest and surrounded Hart. The back road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the forest, Fiss slammed his head on the head of the dead pig, and whispered: "You have this." Arrow, for Why not keep shooting magician? Pig brain, you? If you can fight the magician for a while, take you to be a shield! ! "It’s just an arrow. It’s really a few months of hard work. It’s just an arrow down, it’s exhausted.” At this moment, Rens is really worse than a waste.<br /><br />&nbsp Hart looked coldly at the knights surrounded by him, and when he saw Etter and the fifty gunmen behind him, the pupils shrank. As for the axe gun knights, he didn’t look at them. Take a look. Hart looked back at Rogge in front of him, and the people who were swept by his eyes all consciously bowed their heads.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart Yang Tian laughed, riding a gun and pointing to Etter! One hundred snow fox cavalry slammed their heads, and the thunderous hooves sounded, and the natural alignment of the marches formed a frontal impact formation. The rifle slowly lay flat, like a forest was cut down, pointing to the "Dragon and Beauty" mercenaries in front.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue A bucket of snow water poured down from the head, and it became cold. I thought that Hart and others would impact the weakly weaker side, just in time to take the snow fox cavalry. Entering the ambush in the Devil's Forest. I didn't expect Hart to be on the same side of the strength. (In the eyes of Rogge, the strength of the team is basically equal to the number of the team.) Don't think too much, Rogge Immediately sang the spell, quickly added magic shields and add spells to himself, and added magical scrolls to Kate and Franco.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et Xun Calm down from the shock, still a bit of military common sense, he knows that there is only one way to escape at this moment. It is hard to say whether the outcome of the hedge is overwhelming. He raised his two-handed sword and blessed himself with an add-on, screaming and holding hands. The knight under the madness had an impact.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two iron flows suddenly slammed together, and the moment the man turned his head. The hurry of Hart in the crowd was like a thunder. Every arrogant, faint vindictiveness flashed, and a knight was picked up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete struggled to cut two swords The snow fox cavalry was slashed in the back of the chaos, but the armor of the god of war was instead The sword collapsed. But this powerful sword also made him black. He breathed a little, and suddenly saw the devil's general Hart rushing toward him, the faint flash of temperament shocked Hart. The tip of the gun was slightly trembled, and the blood flower continually spurred on all sides. The tip of the gun, like the finger of death, locked his heart. When Etter was desperate, he tried to raise his fighting spirit and screamed, and the horse greeted. An arc is drawn in the air, and the cockroach is on the rifle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, Hart led the team to penetrate the formation of Etter and hit Etter. Waiting for the entire formation of the Snow Fox cavalry, Rogge and others have arrived and joined forces with the remaining cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one impact, the "Dragon and Beauty" mercenary group killed and injured more than forty knights, while the snow fox only fell ten. Now "Dragon and Beauty" has no advantage in terms of number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart put the bloody rifle on his mouth, licked the blood on it, and bit the piece of minced meat on the gun, not Stop chewing, blood rushing down the corners of his mouth. Hart’s face is even more sinister, and the rifle is slowly lifted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a cry, a fireball flew out of the forest and flew straight to Hart’s cavalry. A man in the formation of a cavalry was also a rush of a spell, and a fireball greeted him. The two fireballs volleyed in a volley, and they slammed into a piece of scorched earth within a radius of ten meters. The Snow Fox Master took five cavalry guards and left the team to the forest. On the road, the two mages played two fireballs again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart does not care about the battle between the Masters. With the rifle in front of him, Hart led the squad, with a rush of murderousness, once again rushed to the "Dragon and Beauty" mercenary group. Kate yelled: "There is still a way to go! There is only one dead end in the U-turn! Brothers follow me!!" He took the lead and rushed out. The former guardian of the Duke of Winnington kept up, followed by the dragon. Mercenaries raised with the beauty. A hundred and a half-hearted cavalry rushed to the opponent in order to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart is excited that every pore is screaming, the gun in his hand is like a snake, and he is constantly smashing his flesh and blood, taking life from his body. Stripped in. His extremely fierce shot pierced the throat of an axe gun knight. The huge impulse made the lance sneak out of the neck. The poor knight’s blood spurted, and the whole skull was only a thin layer of flesh attached to the body. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart’s sense of pressure is light, and it has already crossed the opponent’s formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned the horse back and gathered the formation. However, he saw Rogge and others with the remaining sixty remnants of the army to escape to the Devil Forest. Hart also refused to admire the opponent's decisive decision. This time, the snow fox fell down more than ten people. If Rogge chose to run away and escape, he would be caught up by the superb snow fox. At that time, except for a few highly skilled knights, the rest could not escape the end of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart stared at the "Dragon and Beauty" mercenaries who were fleeing. For a long time, they slammed their guns and shouted: More than ten riding snow fox cavalry chased down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge leaned on the horse's back in the Devil's Forest, his mind was almost blank, and the oncoming branches were constantly pumping on his head. He seems to have no feelings, but only subconsciously recognizes the magical signs in the distance, leading the squadrons behind them to escape to the scheduled ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action was a mess from the start! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial lack of intelligence, the surrounding tactics are naive and ridiculous. The "Dragon and Beauty" self-righteous fighting power in front of the old and powerful snow fox, has become a farce. The snow fox twice took the lives of nearly a hundred people and the enemy was completely defeated. The other side of the silver armor (Rogge and others do not know Hart's name and information) devil-like killing means, chewing the blood of the soldiers when the flesh and blood dripping from the corners of the mouth, the gun into the human body burst of blood, It flashed in the mind of Rogge like lightning. Every time a bloody picture was crossed, there were countless thunder and thunder, and Rogge shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding scenery seems to become a flat landscape, with only a squeaky voice in the ear, nothing else can be heard. Rogge consciously ran in a certain direction, completely unaware of why he ran there and ran to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another part of the Devil's Forest, the battle between Faith and Snow Fox is nearing completion. The forest has been bombarded with a piece of magic by both of them, and both sides have used up their magic. Behind the Snow Fox Master, there are several knights on the side of the horse. This is a masterpiece of Fiss's series of lightning. The Snow Fox Master's magical consumption is too large, and now he can only support the shield, and the whole body is shaking slightly. He was very depressed, and the level was at least two levels higher than Fes, but his opponent was squatting with a good equipment and fighting for himself. He also reimbursed five knights. Fortunately, the magic of Faith has also been exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Snow Fox Master "Hahaha" laughed three times in the sky, and found a scroll of fireball from the bottom of the pocket, rubbing the dust on his body, shaking his spirit, posing The posture, the loud voice sings the start of the spell, it is called a swaying, powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
