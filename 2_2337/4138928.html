			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;盛世年华章章四中线<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章四中线<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor Richelieu suddenly entered a delicate balance period, and the tension of the previous sword-drawn Zhang Yi was eased, and the major forces resumed the apparent Hee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turmoil brought about by the religious war was suddenly swayed by the sacred virgin of the goddess Mora and the goddess of the two goddesses. Not long ago, I also fought the eye of wisdom and the sacredness of silver, the intimate and close-knit compatriots. In the past, in the religious war, the believers who had fought and died suddenly found that the enemies of the past were actually brothers with common beliefs, and they were extremely confused at one time. Fortunately, their hatred immediately had a new venting point, and all grievances found a scapegoat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying that is quietly circulated among the believers. The goddess of wisdom, O'Reilly, is actually the real goddess of ice and snow, but during the sleep of the goddess of ice and snow, holy Taught a group of speculative guys led by Rockefeller and Jimmy. They used the name of the goddess to collect money and seize power. When they discovered that the goddess began to wake up, in order to safeguard the gains they had gained, they even took the risk and tried to usurp the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, everyone who saw the sorcerer saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodies of Rockefeller and Jimmy were handed over to the fanatics. Although the behavior of the corpse is not glorious, but as long as it is beneficial to ease the contradiction between the two believers, Rogge will not hesitate to do it. Of course, this move also provoked a strong rebound between some ice and snow mage and senior priests. Mora’s attitude towards these two people is very different. Treating Snow and Ice Mage, she is a great effort to charm and inspire. For the clergy, it is either ambiguous or tuneful, and even some of the reaction is fierce. It directly afflicts the blasphemy with the party and imposes various cruel religious punishments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of ice is not a tolerant goddess. This can be reflected in the religious punishment of the silver saints, which severely attacked the heresy from the ** to the spirit, and even called brutal bloodthirsty. Nothing is worse than Rogge’s newly established Inquisition. Many of the clergy who are now squatting under religious punishment have also contributed to the strengthening of religious punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of the miracle of the goddess of ice and snow. Mora’s cold iron fist quickly cleared the opposition inside the silver sacred religion. This sacred and noble servant does not allow even a half-sent of different voices within the church, and encourages confessions and disclosures among believers. Anyone who has a little bit of criticism about her behavior is likely to be detained with a heretical hat and suffer cruel religious persecution. For a time, the phenomenon of the brothers in the silver saints, the father and the son became enemies, and the endless stream, can almost be said that everyone is at risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mutual suspicion. The trust and friendship between the sacred believers of the original iron plate is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps in this plane, only a handful of people have enough power or luck to be able to glimpse the scales and claws of the kingdom of God. But those who have the mind don't need to stand on the height of being able to see the kingdom of God. They are only able to infer the true ending of the religious war and the meaning behind the ending from the change of Mora's identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the religious war subsides, political struggle seems to have come to an end. Pompey left the emperor early and returned to the southeast front. A new offensive was launched to the enemy in front. Alexander soon returned to Xijiang and reorganized the Glacier Corps. For a time, the political attacks against Rogge and Straw suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Straw are both on the defensive, and the other party’s move gives them a rare respite, and naturally they will not have more trouble. Moreover, Straw also has a deep heart in the abyss gap, and Rogge is also a lack of skills. He needs to concentrate on restoring the silver sacred religion that has just arrived, and it is imperative to quickly improve his personal strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God success, indeed opened a window to another world for Rogge. In addition to defeating the grand ambition of the goddess O'Reilly, Wiener's urging and betting with Androni, Rogge's heart is still faintly new. That is an intuition about danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great has taken a disrespectful attitude towards the religious war. It seems that he is now in the southeast direction. As the king of the Asrofic Empire, the power of wealth and beauty is no longer in the eyes of Feuerbach, he is now interested, one is longevity. One is the history book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the long supply line, this time the empire was only prepared to dispatch the most elite 200,000 troops, and the Emperor personally led and vowed to attack the Longine Sea West Cliff! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of mobilizing, changing, and mobilizing troops throughout the empire is very long. It is estimated that the combat units and logistics are all in place, and the emperor can go out, at least in the coming spring. The season is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a peaceful weather, there are countless undercurrents, like the seemingly calm sea of ​​reefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dark blue night, the brightly lit Richelieu has a brilliant pearl dotted on the grassland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three barely visible figures standing in the sky, looking at the pearl on the grassland. A faint black mist rushes from them, absorbing the light around them to hide their shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three people are the three kings of death in the world that have to leave the Central Mountain Range again. In their eyes that swayed the flame of death, the lights of Richelieu were filtered and replaced with fireflies that marked the breath of life. Among the mortal beings, some of the fireflies are surprisingly bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these powerful fireflies don’t worry the Three Kings. What really makes them jealous is the existence that should be extremely bright, but hidden in ordinary fireflies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three kings who have become accustomed to the death world for a thousand years of monotonous repetition. The experience between this plane is like a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings looked at Richelieu in the distance and turned to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless icy ocean of the North is now the territory of the former king, now the goddess of ice and snow. Out of caution for the unknown world, the place where the Three Kings first thought of and felt comfortable to settle down was the city of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new undead castle they built in the Central Mountains has been destroyed. The kings couldn't forget the day, and the dragged Constantine came to the flames. I want to hand over the demon lotus to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Undead Castle, facing the three kings. Constantine is fearless. The imperialism in the momentum is the death king. They have no way of knowing the relationship between Constantine and Fengyue, but the relationship between the two must be close. Otherwise, it is impossible for Konstantin to know that there is a demon lotus leaf. Lost in the hands of the kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Warrior Emperor once again refused to hand over the devil to Constantine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin’s face was hesitant, struggling, and then turned to resolute. He opened his own beliefs at the beginning of the war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is a thrilling battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred to death, Cardinal vs. Undead King. The devout faith of the Most High God is proud and stubborn from the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two powerful forces swayed the stormy waves of the entire death swamp, and the undead castle collapsed under the breeze of power storms. Constantine is like a god of heaven. He uses the holy flame as a spear. He uses faith as his eye. In the name of the highest god, he sacrifices the braveness of the black warrior and wins the demon lotus from his hand. Then the injured was not too light, Constantine and fearlessly met the bone emperor and Elgar who stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings read the wind and the moon. I really don't want to kill Constantine, and the cardinal magic is far beyond the expectations of the three kings. When Constantine cursed the cast, the vision of the air suddenly revealed a myriad of angel images, or sitting or standing. Or empty hands or holding weapons, it seems that at any time it is possible to tear the space barrier, come out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones of the Emperor and Elgar, who lived under the flames of the Heavenly Patrol Hunter, faced such a vision and were already vigilant. They don't know the world, but in the world of death, in addition to the heavens, there are often other powerful angels coming from heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real reason why kings have chosen to live forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not impossible to defeat the heavens and patrols, and it’s not hopeless to defeat the angels. But after that? Who knows how many gods and gods are behind the gates of the glorious heaven. How many more high-spirited angels carrying the wings of glory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this piece of demon lotus leaf, the black warrior emperor has no idea how much trouble it has caused to the kings. However, he never explained that Bone Emperor and Elgar did not consult. This is the mutual respect between the kings and the trust from the depths of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plane is too broad and too complicated. The kings only feel that there are crises everywhere, and there are endless streams of power. After leaving the Central Mountain Range, they negotiated, and there is no clue what to do in the future. Therefore, under a silent tacit understanding, the Three Kings all the way to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this new complex and turbulent life has finally activated the souls of the kings who have been filled with time and dust. Even in the longest time of the bones, the heart of the battle rekindled the fire of fighting. Although they began to go into exile, they are completely different from the world in the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to find the windy month!" Elgar finally broke the silence. Going north again, you are about to enter the field of Fengyue. At this moment, it is no longer necessary to cover up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I feel... there is always some difficulty." The Emperor of the Black Warrior also spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have lived a long time in restraint and cautiousness, and now the world of death no longer exists. In the past, the framework that binds our actions and thoughts should also be Abandon some." The bones slowly and authentically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while. The three kings continued to fly north, and they swept across the thousands of miles of icefields and finally entered the territory of Fengyue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a demon on one side and a goddess on the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would it feel like to be standing between the two? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge at this moment, the illusion is in front of him, and the dark red and bright green colors are alternately swaying, and only the blood is inflated. It seems that the next moment will split into countless pieces. The fat man takes his heart and expands his mind to the extreme. The soul is in the vortex of the two forces as the mainstay does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different scenes gradually show that the heavens and the earth are completely gone, the whole world is divided into two parts, one side is a lava filled with a strong sulphur atmosphere, another On the one hand, it is a mountain, forest and river full of life. The two worlds are distinct, tit for tat, and do not give each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man stands on two world division lines. He left his foot on the lava. The right foot stands on the grass. Looking up to the sky, the sky is also divided into two, azure blue and dark red, each side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the two worlds, each has a strong presence, which dominates two different worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a seemingly static picture behind it that is extremely dangerous and dangerous. At each of the two worlds, there are two very different forces in the wrestling. . As long as one of them is slightly slack, the balance is tilted, and there will be a great change that will cause the heavens and the earth to hang over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s mental strength is slightly revealed in the direction of the abyss, with a glimmer of glory in front of him, and the illusion of the image is one of them. In front of him, there was only one dark red. Can not resist the distortion of light and shadow. From that red light, you can always see lava, flames, black cone mountains, and even the figure of the Barto demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge only felt dizzy, he fixed his mind, all the illusions in front of him were shattered, and the real world reappeared in front of him. In front of him, there is a large dark red color that is slowly flowing, and suddenly it is dark and uncertain. Rogge is very familiar with this piece of light, which is the space gap leading to the abyss world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge saw this vision in front of him. Immediately understand that the abyss gap is unstable. It is almost always possible to collapse. It's no wonder that Straukon has paid such a large price to seal this gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge carefully regained his mental strength, and the existence of his desire to snoop is too strong. Powerful to the point where it may affect his mind at any time. He looked around. This is an unusually tall hall. It looks like a four-story building from the outside. In fact, it is a complete hall. The cracks in the abyss are constantly creeping in the middle of the main hall. On the ground below the abyss gap, a huge magical array has been built. There are three metal poles standing around the circle, and three crystals of different colors are set on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
