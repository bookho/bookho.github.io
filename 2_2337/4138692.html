			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of the dwarf’s calm were not a few days, and the invaders were killed by several times. This is the middle of the dwarf king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the intruders came to more than 400 people, and the arrogance was naturally very different from the past. The Terran went out of the silence and chose a hilly logging camp outside the forest. This time the Terran actually brought in more than a dozen horses! They are still the same sly and sinister. Just as they walked out of the silence, they sent a large number of people to search for the dwarves. The dwarf did not expect the human race to be so fast, and was arrested by more than a dozen dwarfs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rage Flame Hammer" knocked on the throne of the throne excitedly. Two small beasts have brought back the information he needs, and a dwarf sorcerer with a green robe is reading what he sees from the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozen dwarves who sat in the Chamber of the Dwarf King were all "heart of the flames". But now there is a position that is empty, and that position originally belonged to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf king’s majestic voice sounded: “This time, we have to give these invading humans a lesson, we have to mobilize the most elite warriors, all will The intruders were completely buried in the land. Inform the giants to prepare! Adjust the miners and get through the passage to the Terran camp!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" My king, are we not killing them all, but capturing them?" a dwarf said hesitantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is obviously dissatisfaction in the eyes of the King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;虏 can be used to exchange rewards with the Terran means to exchange the recipe for winemaking. The dwarf did not dare to look directly at the dwarf king's gaze, but insisted on it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf king hesitated, other dwarves whispered, it seems that many people agree His idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, tried the taste of Terran spirits, all the ale is as tasteless as water.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fixed! Grab the captives! Attack the Terran one morning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who leads the human adventurer is obviously a military expert. The small camp is surrounded by mountains and waters and has occupied the topography. All the places have built high-rise arrows, and there are no dead ends in all angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fighting against the dwarves can be different from the war within the Terran, and the underground is the dead end of the Terran! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf king who watched the Terran base from afar, smiled confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer is not a piece of iron inside. In the center of the camp, Paulus is fighting fiercely with Rogge and others for the feasibility of the tactics. The last time to lure the enemy, the elite gold lion knight actually died four dead, and five people were injured, so Paulus was distressed. Only Rogge and Jinge’s death and injury were even more serious, and he was not completely done. But this did not alleviate his dislike of Rogge, a sinister and despicable guy. He said more than once that after returning, he must report the original contents of Rogge to Orpheq. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the enemy is currently, Paulus is not a person who does not know the general, he is indispensable in the regular battle against the dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day of the Terran camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the sentinel felt a sigh of tension in the wind, and the tower seemed to tremble slightly. After a while, the sentinel is now not an illusion, the tower is indeed shaking, and the amplitude is getting bigger and bigger. Soon the sentinel was the source of the shock, and countless dwarf warriors walked out of the morning fog with neat steps. In the middle of their ranks, there are three tall, frightening figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sentinels desperately knocked out the alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rage Flame Hammer" rides on the ground salamander, the warhammer is high, the dwarf warriors stop, and they are neatly arranged in the Terran camp. The first five hundred meters array...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he brought five hundred elite dwarf warriors and three hill giants. More than three hundred soldiers were left in the dungeon because of illness. But five hundred soldiers are enough to deal with at least eight hundred people's army, not to mention the enemy of more than five hundred people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Terran on the wall was in a panic, and apparently did not expect the dwarves to mobilize so many troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, the camp opened wide, and the Terran invaders sneaked out and began to line up. The number of human races also surprised the dwarf Wang Da, where there are four hundred people, there are clearly seven or eight hundred people! However, the thought of the six hundred miners and junior fighters who are preparing to sneak into the tunnel, the "Rage of the Flame" is still quite determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hilly giants once again cast a boulder on the people in the array, but three fireballs flew out of the Terran camp, accurately hitting the boulder in the air, Its volley is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone is not the specialty of the hilly giants. After more than a dozen rounds of throwing, the three giants have clearly exposed their fatigue. "Rage of the Flame" waved and stopped. After all, they were still the main force on the battlefield. Then his warhammer was lifted again, and the Terran had not yet set a good position, screaming:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the honor of God of War!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the honor of God of War!" All the dwarves and giants shouted together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, a flame erupted from the mouth of the ground salamander, and it rushed to the Terran with the Dwarf King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Terran Invaders soon became a battle, the Golden Lion Knight was in the center, the Dragon and the Beauty Knights were behind, Jingo’s Snake Warriors guarded the wings Benjamin’s Shadow Killer is in the lineup, and the Black Warrior stands with the Golden Lion Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three hill giants followed the dwarf king and rushed to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf King "Rage of the Flame" lifted high, accompanied by a deafening roar, the hammer hammered down, a flame wave spanning tens of meters The space, to the Terran camp, swallowed a golden lion knight and a black warrior in a blink of an eye. The giants also cast stones in their hands, overturned a dozen people, and then pulled out the huge wooden sticks behind them, rushing to the Terran position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the situation is not good, Paulus slashed the sword to meet the dwarf king, Kate and Jinge's two guards intercepted three hill giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf squadron then succumbed to the scene, and there was a sudden fight on the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle, the golden lion knight formed a small square team, facing the impact of the dwarfs, but one step back. In the blink of an eye, a dozen dwarves fell in front of the golden lion. Surprisingly, the dragon and the beautiful knights did not fall into the face of the elite dwarf warriors. Anyway, the master has money and is a big-weapon businessman. Rogge's men are all equipped with heavy shields, long guns, battle axes and handcuffs. This is specifically designed to deal with dwarves. The long gunman holding the axe gun is not so much an enemy, but rather pushing the dwarves out. They kept on concentrating with the dwarf warriors. The dwarf is born with short short legs and loves to use a tomahawk. He is supported by these long guns. Where can he be cut? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite dwarf warriors between the moments have no choice but to take the dragon and the beautiful knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dwarves have no choice, and there is no way for the dragons and the beautiful knights. As the standard configuration of the dragon and the beauty knight, the handcuffs have an unexpected power. In such a short distance, the refined handcuffs of the God of War are enough to shoot through the chain armor of the intermediate dwarf warrior, although the arrow is not deep, but it is enough. You know, at this time, there is no reason to donate poison on the arrow? And the poison that is fed is Fuluya's special for the short body. Just to grab more live, this time is a special effect powerful anesthetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate only had a few rounds with the giants of the hills, and was shocked by the giants’ unbeatable strength. But Kate is desperately trying to vindict her, and she will not die. He knows that if he retreats, the battle behind him will be chaotic. Kate squatted under the glory of the body, and the blood spattered, and the stainless steel gun in his hand did not live in the giant to leave a wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge summoned a giant sword spider and summoned several warriors. With his deep understanding of Necromancer, the summoned scorpion is now a well-equipped scorpion warrior. What he lacks now is only the soul of the strong, so he cannot study the more powerful undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Rogge used a short spell to bless himself with the oldest "British Bull Power", "Additional Skills" and Blessing. After the three magics were finished, Rogge, who was on the battle, became a war fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the dwarves' strong men were all held back, Rogge was simply killed. Under the protection of the sword spider and the warrior, Rogge did not have to worry about his own safety, but began to worry about the safety of his future property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the "binding soul" round and used his axe to squat to a dwarf hundred-year warrior. When the bang was loud, the stainless steel shield in the hands of the 100-year-old soldier was crushed and the left arm of the shield was broken. The 100-year-old soldier looked incredulous and shook a few times and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hundred years of warriors can not be hit, what other dwarfs are afraid? Roger is more confident. In front of the battle axe, cut down one; the axe handle stretched back and stunned again; even punching and kicking did not have a return. As for being occasionally cut by the dwarf warrior, it is also difficult to defend the "reincarnation" of the triple protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly saw that Kate was struggling with a giant, so he rushed. Kate and his many years of cooperation, heart and soul, a big bang, vindictive into a strong light. The giant's eyes glanced, and then he screamed and jumped up. It turned out that Rogge stabbed the giant from the back, and the entire axe did not go in. Just because of the height, this axe is the thickest of the giants. The thickness of the hills and giants is far from the imagination of Rogge. A long axe tip stabbed in, but still did not touch the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounded giant was immediately mad, and the wooden stick was full of battlefields to chase down the sneaking villain, but the anger was not good, and it was accidentally injured. Many dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the battlefield in the melee suddenly seemed to have a pause in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear sky didn’t know when it was full of black clouds. If the clouds are living, they are still gathering in an incredible degree from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central part of the cloud soon formed a huge whirlpool, the electric light in the vortex shines, and the huge thunder keeps coming. All the players in the battle slowed down and looked at the vision between heaven and earth with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female magician in a red robe flew into the sky from the Terran camp. She fluttered and a strong red light floated on her chest. On the battlefield, only a few people, such as Rogge, could see through the red light, and saw a strange little Ding in the ball of light slowly spinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's cold, melodious curse sounds from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Kingdom of Sin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Ding suddenly frantically rotated. The ground of the entire battlefield seems to have life, and it begins to creep slowly. Slowly, blood began to seep out of the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hammer of the Flames" suddenly shook all over the body, and all the strength was quickly drained from his body. The dwarf king took a deep breath and tried to re-collect the energy, but now the flame power that has almost become part of his life has disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must be the witch in heaven! That damn what "the kingdom of sin"! The Dwarf King screamed at the wrath of the wrath, and the centuries-old warriors who appeared in the week were all faltering. He suddenly appeared, swaying the two small barrels of whiskey that day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, regret, self-blame, and anger are filled with the heart of the Dwarf King. However, because of his responsibility as a king, he could not be guilty of this, but the senior soldiers were cursed, but this war has not lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground troops are about to break out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria in the sky is still singing a spell, and after a moment the spell is finished, she points to the ground and spits out the words of Qingyue like the nine days of Fengming. : "The wrath of the abyss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth vibrates violently, and the sound of a burst of ground from the ground makes the Dwarf King more and more desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's hand is lightly tapped, and the ground is a sharp fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retire! "The Dwarf King knows that the general trend has gone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf warriors suddenly rushed to the opponent, and succumbed to the weak man who was unable to withdraw to the dungeon.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three huge figures were stopped in front of Rogge. There are dozens of dwarves next to the figure. Whether it is a hilly giant or a dwarf, it is a rare seriousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was furious and shouted: I let it go, the dwarf is money, the giant can be nothing! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the giant, it was Roger who stabbed an axe on the **, Weng replied eagerly: "Despicable intruder, unless Our blood is dry! Otherwise, don't think about dyeing the dungeon of the Dwarf Hill! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly smiles secretly and thinks that he can save a few dwarves at the expense of himself? Check it out!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Froya, who is like a demon, has completed her third spell: "Thunder Forest"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless electric lights rising from the feet of the dwarves who are escaping, and within a few hundred meters of the radius, they suddenly become a forest of thunderfire. The electric fire presents an unusual dark green. From time to time, the dwarf was hit by the electric fire, and the whole body was covered with tiny green sparks, and twitched and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hundred meters away, the vast majority of dwarven warriors have been left behind by the Thunder Forest...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills giants are extremely angry and rushed over to Rogge. Rogge sneered, and the horse ushered in, and the "binding soul" screamed to the hill giant with a heart-rending whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are silently intertwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant made a painful arrogance, and the wooden stick in his hand broke into two pieces. A blood arrow is then marked from the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger Zema came back and stared at the giant who had not yet died on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill giants gasp hard: Impossible, you are just a personal class..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge faintly said, "This is nothing impossible. Your biggest mistake is on your weapon. The broken wood is worth a silver coin worth 10,000 gold coins. The result of using a silver coin to counter 10,000 gold coins is your end now! But of course you don't understand it, aren't you? There is no time for the soul to have time for you to think! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another blood arrow is marked, and the huge head flies far away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mars, which is invisible to the naked eye, is sucked in by the black crystal on the 'Bounding Soul'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at the body of the giant and said to himself: It seems that I am not losing to you. He turned to the horse's head and once again rushed to the other two giants in the battlefield.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf warriors went forward and used their bodies in the 'Thundering Forest' A road finally escorted the Dwarf King and fled back to the dungeon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the overall situation has been fixed, Froya scorns the spell, Xiao Ding becomes crystal clear, immersed Her chest. If there is a well-informed old magician present, I will definitely recognize the origin of this little tripod: the artifact "the kingdom of sin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Kingdom of Sin" will form a huge magic enchantment within a fairly broad range: the kingdom of sin, the size depends on the magic of the artifact holder. In the enchantment, the artifact holder can display the ratio The original magic has a higher level of magic. At the same time, the artifact 'The Kingdom of Sin' itself can also move several unique powerful magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder Forest It’s a powerful magical prison forest attached to the 'State of Sin' that will not be able to act for a long time. It is the best spell to capture the dwarf slaves. The terrible thing about the Thunder Forest is that it has a wide range and can successfully wear the spell zone without falling into the top, none of the ten.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artifact also has a distinction between good and bad, 'The Kingdom of Sin' is undoubtedly a very powerful artifact. Under it, "Rage of the Flame" is not at all embarrassing. And he In the drink, I have already added some spices to Froya. These spices are not poisonous, but they have become a very dangerous anesthetic after resonating with the magical power of the country of sin.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s impossible to become a poison, but at that time, Froya will face the lost rationality of Rogge and Benjamin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure? Do you really want to use bloodthirsty?" The voice of the eye is calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Even at the expense of fifty years of life, I will break this evil curse and fight with these devils!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundred years of warriors behind the Dwarf King are solemn and silent, and the silent face shows unyielding determination! For them, don’t say that it’s 50 years of life, or what is going to die tomorrow? In order to protect this home, defend their women and children, they are willing to pay any price! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky sighs with a deep sigh. For the old wizard, the fate of the race has already been decided as early as the time to set foot on this land. Any resistance will only add a little tragic color to the final ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloodthirsty technique is applied one by one to the dwarf warrior. The dwarf who was being manipulated squirmed on the ground in pain. After a long time, the "Rage of the Flame" stood up. His eyes have become blood red, his skin has turned into a strange dark red, and two long fangs grow out of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, 6 continued the dwarf warrior leaping from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My king, Anyan has woke up from a deep sleep, he wants to see you!" A dwarf guard is anxious to the dwarf king who has just completed the bloodthirsty technique. Reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anonymous? Did he wake up? Great! Tell him I will be here!" Dwarf King is excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous is also a giant, a giant who has been sleeping for more than three years. But he is not a hilly giant, but a mountain giant with much greater power and a giant collar of this dwarf dungeon. The angry rock is six meters tall and clearly passes the hill giant. Different from the pale skin of the hill giant, the thick body, the angry rock is bronze skin, well-proportioned and body-building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting between the Dwarf King and the Giants is simple and straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I already know that my three tribes have left me forever. But I can feel that their souls are not getting peace, they are in the flames of the devil. Struggling under! The hammer of anger, my old friend, the blood of God of War is flowing in our blood, I will help you, let my people get peace after death, and let your people rejoice in the underground city. "Live life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected angry rock, I have no doubt about your determination. But the power of the devil is far from your imagination! The hands of the devil There is also a very evil magic weapon, this time I am defeated in this magic device! My friend, I hope that you can take your family to leave here, return to the sunset mountains, to a devil can not touch Where."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected anger and flame hammer, the road to the west has been blocked by the devil, we only have one battle, there is no other way. Three years The sleep makes me see a world that I couldn’t peep before. The waking angry rock is stronger than before. I will challenge these demons. I have already felt the magic weapon, it is recovering power, but it can't be used within two days. So we have to fight these demons as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is also an indescribable evil under the door of the abyss. I will release them when necessary, and let the demons kill each other with my flesh and blood."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected anger and flame hammer, I can feel your sorrow. Let our fate decide tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The night passed quickly, and Rogge and his allies did not rest well. It took too much time to clean the battlefield. However, this is the same as the gold coins in the rock piles. No one will be too dirty, except Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle killed more than a hundred dwarf warriors, and captured nearly four hundred. What makes Rogge happy is that there are good warriors in the battlefield. The insight of the fat man's understanding of the world makes it possible for him to clearly observe whether these souls were dwarves or humans before they were born, and even the soul of which person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the dragons and beauty knights who have followed their own for many years, Rogge sent their souls to where... The heavens in which God lives are obviously not suitable. These evil-dominated people go to the underworld and are more likely to be burned by the fire of hell. As for the devil world, that is where the strong can go, even Rogge himself is not a strong person, not to mention these men. The dragon and the beauty knight are just sinister and insidious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the Golden Lion Knight is one that can't be let go. Jing Ge's men are also good players. In dealing with the attitude of the soul, Rogge has always been a hero with no strength, no racism. As long as the soul has a certain intensity, the fat man is the one who refuses to come, and is a good material to test the magic of the dead spirit in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, fat people can't let others know that they are collecting souls. He shuttled through the battlefield and greeted the warriors and the soldiers who cleaned the battlefield. Rogge can call everyone's name, and the fat man without a shelf quickly won the favor of everyone. Turning around in the battlefield, a black flame in the black crystal on the Tomahawk "Bound Soul" has begun to burn. The entire battle axe began to glow with a layer of white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly broke a small tree with an axe, and the canopy of the small tree withered with the naked eye. When Rogge inadvertently stored a large number of souls, the Tomahawk began to automatically attach a powerful curse effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, such an evil weapon can not walk around with imperialism, we must deal with the soul as soon as possible. Trying to refine several undead creatures is a good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, in the human society, the two big gold characters of "justice" must be attached to their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of 'Bound Soul' is naturally nothing more than the magical master of Froya. However, the little demon girl also has a very serious dark tendency. It is not uncomfortable for Rogge's unscrupulous behavior to enhance his strength. At least not let the fat man's secrets go out. Rogge is now respectful to her, respectful, and still does not need this secret for the time being, but it is difficult to say later. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger glared at the tomahawk full of evil, icy, and death, sprinting all the way, and wanted to sneak back into his camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Where do you want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger scares a sweat Looking back, Fu Luoya stared at him like a smile. He hid the 'binding soul' behind his back and said: "Hey, this, Your Highness, you know that today's battle is very hard, yes, the villain is tired, want to go back and rest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's behind you, show it to me!" Froya's eyes were all smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue sweating is the broken axe of the villain. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweating ability is full of harm, ask you what is the cold sweat, is it specially trained? Give me a stop!" Froya said that she was around the back of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out to be like this! It seems that you are not a small gainer. Is this fat meat fake?" The goblin is close to Rogge. Pulling the fat on Rogge's face hard, it hurts Rogge's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya grabbed the 'dead soul' from Rogge’s hand, but did not expect it to be so heavy, exclaimed, the tomahawk fell On the ground, I pulled out a deep pit. Under the shock, the souls in 'Bounding Soul' are all restless, and the whole battle axe is green, and a green smoke flies around the tomahawk, constantly trying to escape from the battle axe. Around, but always pulled back by an invisible force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Broken Soul’ Weng’s shaking, the sound of the epoch, like a midnight ghost crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stared at Rogge and smiled: "Do you want to refine the soul in this axe into an undead? I didn't expect this. The broken axe is so heavy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya added a few times of strength, even giving himself a higher level than the "power of the bull" "The power of God" is also unable to move the soul, and finally gave up. She looked at Rogge with interest, as if she was watching a World of Warcraft that had never appeared before. "Well, dead fat man, how can you have such great strength? It seems that you have smashed me a lot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue Busy: "This, how dare the villain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things go back to your account! There is nothing in your camp, or go to my lab to practice your undead! Seeing the level of your death magic is not so good, I will teach you something by the way! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
