			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be because of murderousness, perhaps because of the mood, in people’s memory, the battlefield seems to have always been clouded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield in front of Rogge is not the main battlefield of this war, but the two sides have also joined 40,000 people. Although there have been no large-scale battles in these ten days, there are still more than 3,000 resentments in this land. Of course, as a defender, Rogge’s troops lost much less than each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 20,000 troops led by Rogge were responsible for defending the left wing of the Leiden Kingdom and stationed in three cities. On his front, it is part of the army of the Kingdom of Latvia and a coalition of the Principality, totaling nearly 40,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is stationed in a small town, the wall is not high, the river is not wide, and the position is steep. Rogge and Charlie led seven thousand troops into the city. Sure enough, as Charlie expected, this opportunity, the enemy immediately surrounded the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that all of Rogge’s elite troops are in this small town. When the Latvian army first attacked the city, it gave a drop of water and left more than a thousand bodies under the city. The first battle was frustrated. The Latvian coalition forces had to retreat 10 kilometers, set up a large camp in the distance, and began to build a large number of siege equipment. After the preparations were completed, the small town was captured in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the frontal battlefield, it is far from being as calm as here. The Kingdom of Layton is worthy of being the first power of the Holy Alliance. Under the leadership of the old and powerful King Romon, the 60,000 elite troops defeated the Livre Kingdom and the Three Principality Army 80,000 people. On the left, because of the weakness of the army, the two small principals that were allied with the Kingdom of Leighton were badly beaten. After a few trips, the troops lost 3,000. At present, the troops of both countries have retired to the kingdom and cannot stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big civil war that is close to being evenly matched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Layton and the Kingdom of Livi and Latvia have no ability to completely destroy the other side. Even with this ability, the winner will only be a victorious winner. If he is not happy for a few days, he will be defeated by the Astrofic Empire. Therefore, to what extent this war should be carried out, the two sides are actually tacit. The battle depends to a large extent on the outcome of the battle on the frontal battlefield. Once the outcome is won, the war will automatically stop and the main battlefield will return to the conference table. The bargaining for compensation, cedar, armament and even marriage will be replaced. The front line of the soldiers will fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Romon, although angered by the crown, is not an incompetent generation, nor has the ambition to destroy the country of Livi and Latvia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussing with Charlie and Hilley many times before the war, Rogge already knew this. Therefore, he was leisurely and unsettled in the city. As long as he dragged the superior strength of the other party, he achieved the strategic goal of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Latvian forces have an absolute advantage, in addition to the two thousand inexperienced new army, the Rogge defending forces are all elite. Under the keen eye of more than a dozen gryphon knights flying in the sky, any large-scale movement of the Latvian army could not escape Rogge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are four magicians in the Latvian army, they can also summon some fierce birds, but how can any bird be compared to the Elf Griffin? I haven’t waited to fly, I’ve been shot down by an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two thousand elf shooters in Rogge City are really nightmares for any siege forces. But Rogge always controls their range, and it is strictly forbidden for any elf to shoot an arrow three hundred meters away. Otherwise, the number of casualties in Latvia will increase immediately, and their magicians will not be too close to the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the wind is in a hurry, Rogge and Charlie stand in the city, looking at the Latvian army that is gathering in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the square in the city, Rogge’s army has also been assembled, and it is being arranged into a neat team, waiting for further orders. Compared with the elite of five thousand battles, the queue of the two thousand new soldiers is much more messy, and the faces of the soldiers are mixed with excitement and fear. This will be their first time to fight against the enemy's flesh and blood. In the past ten days, most of them just shot and stone in the city, never compared with the enemy sword. The Latvian army tried to attack the two cities before and after, and they were easily repelled without climbing to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you ready?" Rogge asked Charlie with a sigh of relief. It was not like trying to lead the army to several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding city is not bored. During this time, the Latvian army will practice every part of the day. Rogge looked at the Latvian army who was practicing in the distance, and turned the magic ring on his finger carelessly. He said to Charlie: "Do you see any flaws in our plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie took a moment to think about it, looked at the defenders on the head of the city, sighed aloud, this plan will not have any problems. And as you tell, from the beginning of the war, Raphael did not shoot from start to finish. Just... Hey! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and smiled at us. Although we paid a price, we will definitely take it back in the future. Moreover, there is no war in the war. You? Charlie, you promised to help me unconditionally. We don’t have the force of Orpheq and no men who have experienced wars. So no matter what means we use, as long as this war can win. No matter how many people die, as long as they are not my soldiers, it doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie sighed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s face turned to chill, and a faint murder slowly spilled from him. He said coldly: "Time is up, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergency horn sounded from the Latvian military camp! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latvian army commander General Adams was surrounded by a group of generals, and looked at the Aley team in the distance. It seems that Rogge is going to give up the city defense and prepare for a dead battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latvian public will be extremely puzzled. At this moment, the Latvian army is five times as many as the enemy. Every day, I hope that Rogge will not come out of the city. Is there such a good thing today? There is a conspiracy among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But General Adams turned his mind and thought that as long as he defeated Rogge’s frontal forces, then his conspiracy was useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The order is going! The whole army is attacking!" Adams gave the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the two armies were in opposition, compared with the 35,000 troops of the Latvian kingdom, Rogge’s 7,000 people looked so thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly observing the enemy, General Adams, the two thousand troops on the left wing of Rogge, are obviously undertrained. In the face of such a weak enemy, General Adams decided to defeat the opponent with an upright tactic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the horns, three hundred heavy Knights came slowly to the front of the line, behind them, three thousand light cavalry with a sabre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams once again looked at the Aley team and finally waved his hand forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surrounded by a very burly heavy knight who put down the helmet's face and screamed out, and rushed to the front of the reloading knight. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reloading knights have spurred the horses to form a torrent of steel, rolling towards the Aley team! A hundred meters behind them, three thousand light cavalry wielding sabers, screaming in the mouth, and gradually began to add, to the battlefield midline, it is already a knife and snow, hooves like thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the cavalry, tens of thousands of Latvian infantry marched neatly, not slamming the shield with a sword and moving forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were another five thousand Latvian infantry that were neatly arranged and pressed against the two thousand new recruits on the left wing of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the approaching reloading knight, Rogge subconsciously licked his lips and asked with a sneer: "Charlie, look, we can get it." Do you live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie faint smiles and spend your money. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, he screamed: "Archer! The armored arrow is ready, two hundred meters ahead... shot! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two thousand elf archers have drawn a brilliant blue-steel broken armor from behind, pulling the elf longbow, waiting for the order In a moment, this arrow with a very strong death scent crossed the heavy-loaded knight who had already rushed to the front of the line and screamed into the middle of the light cavalry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although Latvian light cavalrymen are close to the horseback, but this arrow rain is surprisingly accurate, and the shatter-resistant arrows that shine in the cold lightly penetrate the light cavalry's locks and shoot them down. Only one wave of arrows and rain, there are more than 200 light cavalry falling horses. Seeing General Adams a cold in the heart. He has long heard of the power of the Ale Principal's Elf Archer, but never thought it would be so good.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Zagul's earth-shattering screams, eight hundred throwing spears with a heart-rending whistle, like a thunder, as the electric reloaded cavalry, who is sprinting 20 meters away, flew over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latvian heavy cavalry is like a paper paste in front of the horrible Tikton throwing a spear! Eight hundred spears greet the three hundred heavy-loaded knights, and almost every reloading knight will insert two or three throwing spears. Some throwing spears from the hands of the masters are the ones that run through these reloading knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur once again screamed, striding forward, the giant axe flashed in the cold, and he would escape the spear and lead the assault of Latvia. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majira and other Tickton tribe masters have also rushed forward, the Tomahawk waved, will rush through more than 30 reloading knights throwing spears Cut down Malay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follow-up light cavalry has already experienced the second wave of the Elf Archer, and has fallen more than three hundred rides. But they have not been able to hold the team, only the steel wall that was built on the Tikton Warriors hit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咣咣! There are huge noises! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two steel torrents finally slammed together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless Tikton warriors are all red, they are relying on the thick steel armor of imagination and the strong impact of the cavalry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the impact of the Latvian cavalry also knocked down nearly a hundred Tikton fighters, their impact finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark side shooters of the moon around Rogge are in front of each other, the elf bow in their hands can’t keep flashing magical light, one is passing magic The battered armored arrows are shot in the rain to the Latvian knights! This close-range shooting is the dark side of the moon. The elves have a powerful arrow that shoots at a very fast speed. The broken armor accurately passes through the gap between the Tiketon warriors and shoots down the cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war was burning, and the cavalry under Adams was more than half damaged, which made the long-time veteran eyelids involuntarily smack a few times. But he is an incomparable soldier. He firmly believes that even if the quality of the soldiers in his hand is much worse than the other, this final, the final winner will still be him. The deadly weakness of Rogge lies in the two thousand new recruits on the left and the position of his formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the stationed city of Leipzig, it was a little too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams ordered, and another 5,000 infantry rushed out in the battle, interspersed between the Rogge army and the small town. He wants to marry the two sides at the moment, and the soldiers are cutting off the road of Rogge's return to the city at the same time. Even if he can't smash the army of Rogge outside the city, he must at least force him to abandon the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the front line of Rogge’s left-wing 2,000 recruits has appeared loose, as if it had been scored in a wedge, there are several places that are deeply impressed by Latvian soldiers* * Come in, although Aley is strict, no one dares to escape, but the line of defense seems to be only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams ordered again, and five thousand infantry rushed out of the line and rushed to the left of Rogge. The veteran will crush Roger's weakness with the final iron fist! After defeating Rogge here, Adams was ready to fall into the hinterland of the Kingdom of Leighton, returning to the back of the main body of Layton led by King Romon, and thoroughly pulling the kingdom of Layton from the throne of the first power of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams from the unified 10,000 infantry, waiting patiently, waiting for the moment of Rogge's defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the midfield battlefield, the Latvian cavalry that lost two-thirds had to retreat and gave the battle to the 10,000 infantry that had already caught up. The 2,000-strong elite infantry of the Ayre Principality strode to the forefront and launched a desperate fight with the Latvian infantry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the losses of the Latvian army have far passed the Ayre Principality, the entire front of Rogge has begun to waver and began to retreat, but the second wing Because of the lack of training, the Qianxin Army could not retreat, so the order it received was a deadly battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge’s line of defense turned a big circle, and the new army on the left became the most prominent part. At this moment, two thousand new troops have already suffered more than half of the casualties. The command of the Latvian army, which is dominant, is also quite clever. They attacked the joint part of Rogge's main force and the left wing violently. It is necessary to cut the left-wing troops entirely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s left wing has been completely divided. Even Latvian magicians are approaching the front line, and a series of fears, fireballs, and lightning magic hit these new battlefields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's time." Rogge said coldly, Charlie successively issued a series of orders, and then personally led the 200 Spartan Knights from the lineup. go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took out a crystal cymbal and handed it to an elf guardian who was behind him. She took off the beautiful magic longbow on her back and hung her head on an arrow. Then she sighed and sighed. The arrow took the crystal and crossed the sky, falling far into the besieged. Among the thousand Aley recruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield of the fierce battle, almost no one noticed such a slightly special arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams is more concerned about the Spartan knights who fought in battle. From the intent, this cavalry wants to smash back the flank of the Latvian infantry. He sneered and ordered a thousand light rides that had been regrouped to intercept the two hundred heavy Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystal 骷髅 fell to the ground and shattered into more than ten pieces. These pieces were turned into powder in the blink of an eye with countless feet in the boots. Unconsciously, a faint gray light spread quickly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams suddenly frowned. The battle that was already a foregone conclusion, the situation suddenly changed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latvian cavalry and the Spartan knights slammed into the head, just like a piece of cheese, cut by this incredibly sharp knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie, who burns the sacred and flamboyant flame, is like a holy angel, but in the eyes of the Latvian cavalry, he is undoubtedly the embodiment of death. A gun was as fast as a thunder, and he saw a flash of electric light, and he could not see the gun body completely. The Latvian cavalry that was intertwined with him was as usual at first sight, but in the blink of an eye, they fell off the horse. In their hearts, they would inexplicably add a blood hole that was transparent before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Charlie's leadership, the Spartan knights completely ignored the huge gap in the number of opponents, and went upstream, killing the Latvian cavalry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Archers also pulled out four arrows from behind, and shot them in a row and fell into the Latvian infantry. This row of unusually dense arrows is still very neat, nearly 10,000 branches and arrows constitute a long line of death, in the blink of an eye, even in the Latvian infantry to cut a blank death zone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted and raised the dragon-throwing gun, and jumped up. In the twinkling of an eye, he crossed the Tikton warriors and entered the Latvian infantry. in. He smiled a little with pleasure, and the dragon's gun flashed on the gun. In the blink of an eye, he shot a gun in eight directions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, the horror power of the Dragon Slayer was finally fully revealed. On the trajectory of the Dragon Slayer, whether it is the armor shield or the flesh and blood skeleton, there is absolutely nothing to stop it! The thick gun body and the spikes that protruded around made the dragon without a whole body. The soldiers who were unfortunately pierced by the chest did not even scream. The huge wounds that were one foot in diameter often made the body stand up and down. Family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Rogge cleared a piece of open space in his body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, there was a slight chaos in the Latvian infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, greater chaos emerged among the new Allied Principality. No one noticed that the piece of light gray had covered the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A corpse on the ground suddenly jumped up, and it suddenly hugged a soldier from the Ale Principality, biting his neck in his mouth. On the top, I tore off a piece of meat and chewed it greedily. The screams of this warrior did not attract attention, but when more Aries Principal soldiers screamed, even the Latvian soldiers who killed them were not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers who fell down are standing up and swaying at the moment, they seem to have been hungry for thousands of years, dragging the incomplete body The most recent flesh and blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of zombies were resurrected among the recruits of the Principality of Aray, but a small number of Latvian soldiers rushed too far and were thrown to the ground by several zombies. Turning around and tearing it into a cockroach with broken meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment in the encirclement, hundreds of desperate Aries recruits are being surrounded by thousands of zombies and shackles, tearing, screams and earth-shattering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hellish scene has made Latvia's most brave warriors begin to retreat, and some soldiers' eyes have turned back to the magicians who have been with the army. Are these magicians the legendary horrible necromancer? Although the legions of these undead creatures are bravely attacking and tossing their enemies, Latvian warriors prefer to leave these ‘Allies’ farther and farther away. Latvia's side of the magician's side of the singularly appeared a large open space, but they did not pay attention to the changes in the attitude of the soldiers around, still stunned to see the changes on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is muddy, and more than ten meters tall and tall, the demons are struggling to climb out of the ground. Their forearms are like cockroaches, and they have a huge horrible blade. These scorpions are like a pair of giant scorpions, whether they are soldiers of the Ayre Principality or weak zombies, they are divided into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Lager is the power of magic?" A general in Latvia turned pale and shivered and asked an old magician nearby. Although he was full of fear for these magicians, his commanding position did not allow him to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician Lager responded vaguely. He didn't know which one of the three colleagues was put in this horrible magic. At this moment, his heart was very complicated, and he was afraid of it. He knew that the position of his magician was not from then on. Guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general no longer spoke, and he looked at the hell not far from the complex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no order, the Latvian soldiers are out of the battle, involuntarily stepping back, idly watching tens of meters, originally belonged to Their battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of zombies and shackles crowded there, and there are dozens of people still alive in the soldiers of the Ayre Principality, on the battlefield that suddenly appears quiet. The screams of these dozens of people are particularly fierce. The skeletons of the bones that stood out from the flock could not find a target for a while, and wandered a little in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outside world, some of the bored bones were biased and then jumped excitedly. It suddenly looked at the ***, *** is looking into the distance, do not know what is thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, can I go?" Gregorian asked hesitantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Standing, just as you didn't hear this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master..." Gregory did not continue. In his mind, he was thinking desperately: "If you don't go this time, he may never call me again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the soul The relationship between the contract, the bone dragon is so desperately thinking, and shouting in the ear of the ah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top clever bone dragon took the one out of us at the crucial moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Still no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has keenly captured the difference in ***, it jumped into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon that suddenly appeared on the battlefield caused an exclamation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this opportunity, Rogge led everyone to kill, and with the help of Charlie, who had already defeated the Latvian cavalry, he finally temporarily retired the Latvian infantry and led the army. Retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Rag... Are you sure that the terrible things will not get out of hand?" The general in Latvia whispered to the old magician around him, he The sound is very dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician responded vaguely. Where does he know the answer to this question? Looking at the zombies and cockroaches that are crowded together, anyone will be chilling. In particular, these undead creatures were still alive soldiers before a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Adams was used to the body and death. He first showed Rogge’s attempt to leave the battlefield. This is a good opportunity for the enemy. How can he let go? ? Not to mention the sudden emergence of thousands of undead creatures on the battlefield, that is, the Supreme God will display miracles at this moment, and will not shake the will of the veteran of this field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
