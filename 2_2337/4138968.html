			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如如梦章七南归下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章七南归下<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still early in the morning, the Astrophy Empire ambassador’s residence was surrounded by hundreds of royal black armies. The surrounding neighborhoods are also full of guarded guards, and there is a guard post almost every few meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassadors have already known the changes outside. However, if the imperial talents come forth in large numbers and can be elected to the ambassadors during this extraordinary period, they are all brave and determined. Although I know that I am in the enemy's capital, once I move my hands, there is no possibility of survival. However, the people in the group have to guard the various key points without any confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sat in the room safely, closing his eyes and meditation, and Froya fell on his lap like a golden kitten. The plane that was already being carried out by her was meditating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the black armor escort surrounded by outside, Rogge did not agree. Don't say that these are just ordinary warriors. Even if the Dro Empire sent several strong men to be besieged, and with Adrienne's strong and unspeakable existence, he also had full grasp and fled with Froya. As for the life and death of the members of the regiment, it is not within the scope of the fat man’s consideration. It is not a big deal to lead the army back in time to avenge them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black box guard in front of the embassy seems to have suddenly received a silent order, and the tide is separated from the two sides. In the twinkling of an eye, one is enough to accommodate two. A luxury carriage rides in parallel. Whether it is a man or a horse, the movements are neat and uniform, and the training is really amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty luxury coaches came from afar until they stopped at the gate of the festival. The horses were downed by the Dro Empire. There are even a few people holding the coat of arms representing the blood of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, thin, well-dressed old man first came to the gate and looked at the top of the gate to make the squadron’s hand screaming with glory. He couldn't help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shouted with great strength: "Don't let the arrow! We are not malicious! Your Majesty the Holy Church, Pope Rogge, has come to the country, specially sent We are here to welcome the Pope to the palace. Before we did not know the arrival of the Pope, there were many scorns, and I asked Rogge to be more tolerant. Please please convey my meaning to the respected Lord Rogge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the group stunned and immediately flew to the Rogge room. Report this news to the very honorable pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Church is different from the Bright Church. In the Holy Church, serving the servants of God does not necessarily have to be single. When Rogge made this rule. I have experienced the ruthless ridicule of Mora. After all, the fatness of the fat man is too clear. However, Rogge also has reasons to say that he has two wives. Regardless of the aunt, the Princess of Feuerbach always has to take care of it on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the people who reported the news saw the ice-snow mage’s famous empire’s fabulous group leader squatting on the pope’s lap reading, without any surprise, the land was just envious . Then I saw Rogge sitting in the chair and closing his eyes to calm his eyes. When the mountain is not moving, the people who reported the news are even more eager to see the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Rogge can get the gods, it is not accidental!" Recalling Rogge's previous deeds, this person is even more emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the report, Rogge opened his eyes slightly and slowly said in a low and strange voice: "Let them wait!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the man retired, Froya looked up and said, "It’s pretending!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge licked her blonde hair. Smiling with a smile: "To deal with these people, you have to put your feet on the shelf. The more arrogant you are, the less they dare to slow you down. We don't hurry to go out and let the guys of Dero wait slowly."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya squinted slightly, enjoying Rogge’s stroke, and said: “The attitude of the Dero people to us has changed very quickly!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Obviously. They must have just had a big defeat. So we don't have to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, seemingly busy, actually dull as water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Froya were placed in the Sophie Palace in the Imperial Palace dedicated to the highest guests of the Dro Empire. In the last ten years, the Sophie Palace has only been opened four times. Slightly ironic is. The Sophie Palace is open four times. Three times was used to receive the Pope of the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the next day, Froya couldn’t stand the endless banquet of the Dro Empire. So he was called a doctor outside, and he went back to his room and concentrated on the meditation. And Rogge is circling daily between the Emperor of Dro and the aristocracy of the dictatorship, and seems to be happy. The Emperor of Dro soon discovered that this fat man with a good smile was not simple. No matter how they tried, he could not find a slight tone from his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In countless banquets, Rogge talks about religion, talks about goddess, and talks about faith, that is, nothing about war and covenants. The envoys of the Asrofic Empire suddenly became leisurely, and they were not in a hurry to see if the negotiations could achieve results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days passed, they were not in a hurry, the Emperor of Dro was anxious to go crazy. The southern war reports came one after another, and the Bavarian army, like the wind, has successively defeated the three largest territories in the southern part of the empire. In these three wars, the Dro army killed and injured nearly 30,000 people, and another 80,000 people were defeated, only reorganized from the rear. In these three wars, the most unexpected thing in the battle was the battle between the Duke of Duomo and the Lions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke Dumars is the most powerful candidate in the southern part of the Dero empire. In the past half month, he has opened the main force of the Dro Empire, and has mastered the 20,000-strong army. He has been trailing behind the Lions Army and trying to capture the battle. However, the Lions Legion has acted swiftly and has never decided to fight with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten days in the hide-and-seek game, the Lions Army suddenly stopped in the Betten Valley. The array awaits the arrival of the Duke of Dumars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Duke of Dumars is only a hundred kilometers away from the main army of the Dero Empire. However, the distance of more than 100 kilometers has become the key to determining the outcome of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite of the Dumas 20,000 army, there are 8,000 lion tooth knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the sun is already slanting, and the clouds are like blood for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody sky put a layer of bloody new clothes on the eight thousand standing knights. In this bloody square, suddenly a rise of a cloud of blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this group of blood clouds, the whole lion tooth square is moving! Iron rides rolling, like the blood pool in the sky suddenly broke. When the sky falls down a red waterfall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that blood cloud has long since surpassed the Cavaliers. With the infinite murderousness, swiftly and rushing to the Dumas army!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty duke of Dumars greets the sun, the sun and the clouds are stabbed His eyes hurt and the scenes that he looked out were a bit fuzzy. He stared hard at the blood cloud that was rolling over, only to faintly see the Cavaliers in the blood cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duchess of Dumars suddenly smelled a bloody suffocation, and then they couldn’t stand the sun’s eyes, and they could not help but shed tears. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a hell!" Dumars cursed. Rubbed his eyes hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faintly heard that the army behind him kept screaming, but the voice seemed to be far away, very erratic, he could not hear clearly. What exactly is shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumars finally opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, his eyes are the biggest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when the space around him has been stained with heavy red, which is like a fog, constantly flowing. And the vaguely knight. It is already in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers still look young, the handsome faces are full of expressions, and the cold eyes seem to have blood flowing. The Duke of Dumar suddenly had a feeling that he felt that the knight looked at his eyes as if he were watching a dead person. The Duke of Dumars did not know why he suddenly felt this way. His eyes saw his arm along the shoulder of the knight and saw the gun in his hand along his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could he be so fast! Dumas thought of this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke stood in the war, and the horrified expression was already frozen in his face forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood cloud flicked over his body and flew to the battlefield behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vulture is hovering in the sky, and a keen instinct tells it that there must be a hearty dinner today. Its sharp eagle eyes couldn't help but scan the earth and look for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, there are tens of thousands of warriors who have been confused, and among them, a straight blood line is rapidly expanding in battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky falls on the blood waterfall, and it has already flown to the front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one would have thought that the duke of Dumars would have been so fast. Early the next morning. When the main force of the Dro Empire came to the Betan Valley in accordance with the guidelines of the defeat. I saw only the bodies of tens of thousands of Dero warriors and countless vultures that were eating. There is no body of a lion tooth knight on the battlefield. Obviously, the Lions Army Corps was calmly retired after cleaning up the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three strong southern ministers have fallen. Shake the whole dynasty of the Dro Empire. The current Emperor of Dro is not an enterprising person, he is arrogant and arrogant. After the war reports of the defeat of the Southern Wars came one after another, he finally suppressed the fear of his heart and fundamentally changed his attitude towards the Astrophy Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, as long as the Asrofik Empire is willing to send troops, whether it is cutting the land or compensating for military expenses, the Emperor of Delois will agree. Therefore, Rogge, who plays an important role in the Asrofic Empire, has become the focus of O'Siniya at this moment. It’s just that the fat man does not mention politics, and all the rules are played. As long as he speaks, in addition to preaching the teachings of the goddess, it is the greatness of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to attack Rogge, the Dro Empire empire and ministers can be said to have worked hard. They know that power and money have no effect on the status of the fat man. The only one who can impress Rogge is the woman. However, the fat fairy is beautiful and the body is also perfect, and the identity is outstanding and the magic is superb. The Emperor of Dro searched almost Osinia, but how could it be possible to find a woman who was comparable to Froya? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is impossible to win by quality. That can only be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overnight, the quality of the maids in the Sophie Palace suddenly rose by two levels. The fat man entered the palace gate and looked around. It was almost everywhere. It’s just that the fat man has to put on the papal shelf at the moment, and he always maintains the image of sacred glory. The little goblin will never let him go, so he faces the delicious garden. Fat people can only see and can not eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a loss of taste, fear that only he is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days. The Dro empire continued to retreat, and the Astrofic messenger did not do anything. After the Dro empire circulated a grain-producing Lake District, it signed a league agreement and agreed that the Asrofic Empire would be dispatched. The 100,000-strong army entered the territory of the Dro Empire and fought against the Bavarian Principality and the Church of Light. In the war, all the supplies of the North Army were under the responsibility of the Dro Empire. In addition to this, another condition of the agreement is that the Holy Church is free to preach in Dro, and the Church of Light should be expelled from the Dro Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the religious terms, the Emperor of Deloi readily agreed. Although there are many believers in the Illuminati Church in the empire, at this moment the Bright Church has been openly standing on the side of the Bavarian Principality. The only thing that is probably the Holy Knights is to participate in the war. And there are indications that the fighting power of the Bavarian public squad is unexpectedly strong, largely because of the many members of the Church Church serving in the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor of Dro himself was also a believer in the Church of Light. But in his eyes, the kingship is more important than everything. In front of the big man, what is the highest god, what belief, even the parents and brothers, let him go to hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the number of e-mails carrying the alliance agreement. Rogge, standing in the sky garden of the Sophie Palace, could not help but sigh, and the benefits are a wonderful thing. In the face of interests, the Asrofic empire and the Dro empire, which would have been going to fight a war, turned into brothers who fought side by side in a short period of time, and concluded an alliance agreement that could affect the situation on the entire continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These numbers are known for their fierceness and speed. They can return to the north within one day, and then more than 100,000 hardies will pick up the axe saw, and countless towering ancient trees will fall down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the extension of the avenue, the hundreds of thousands of imperial forces that have long been ready to go will be led by the legendary stars Alexander and Pompey into the Dro Empire. As the army marched together, there were hundreds of mages of the Holy Church. A powerful ice temple warrior group. And the strongest people gathered together on a scale never seen before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the camp of the Holy Church, there are nearly 10,000 elf shooters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magnificent battle is about to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a confrontation between the Warriors of the North and the Southern Warriors. It is a battle between the northern strongman and the southern magical sanctuary, and it is also the collision between the sacred church and the bright church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunrise is rising, the eyes are already full of stars, and Rogge is standing in the sky garden, and has been standing for a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just looked up at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a cloud roll or a wind, you can bring him endless information. Rogge knows that, not long after, Osinia’s sky will sound the fierce and stalwart of the North, and he knows that this time Feuerbach personally entered the South, and he has already been able to return to the Northland Prairie. Preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great has made up his mind and will die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer night is surprisingly cold. The whole of Oshniah raised a thick and damp mist, and the thin dew climbed up to Rogge's hair, gathered again, and ran down his cheeks, disappearing into his collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that O'Siniya’s souls that have not been scattered for thousands of years have already traveled this night, and they radiate cold to dispel the warmth that should be in summer night. meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes narrowed and looked up at the night sky. He seems to be smiling, but the expression on his face seems to be a vampire eager for blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, a drop of cold dew can also pass him too much information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is watching the sky, and the book of Hilo is slowly flowing in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods create existence from nothingness, creating a kingdom between the planes. Everything in the kingdom will be determined by the will of God. God will rest, they Tired of creating a country. When you wake up, God will be truly God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God will be tired."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of this page, it’s still a familiar phrase: “The gods are not omnipotent, and Hilo is omnipotent.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge’s eyes crossed the night sky. He seems to see that outside the night, there is a mysterious country built from scratch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she builds the kingdom of God, will she rest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you wake up, God will be truly God." This sentence is repeated in the heart of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she woke up, did she really complete the process of closing the gods? At that time, did she still remember everything in the past? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is suddenly very upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, with Rogge's position as the boundary, the night of the sky suddenly opened. After the night, it is a completely unknown world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The north is thick and dark, and there are several tall and tall figures in the dark. And beside the darkness, the one who stands proudly is the one that makes her dream come true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her black hair is still straight, there is a waterfall, the brilliance of the silver plaque is as good as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the figure with the skull of death, I don’t know why, it always seems so lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
