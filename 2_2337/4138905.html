She seems to have practiced some martial arts, and she uses the threat of vindictiveness in her hands. However, this level of vindictiveness is the biggest increase in power and degree among ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the rules of power do not apply to this angry woman. The furniture in the room is made of mahogany with a very hard texture. If the vindictiveness is less than ten or more, even if they can be removed by empty hands, the effect of this firewood cannot be caused. These are called in the Big 6 market. To the sky-high king of the wood, now is like a pile of poor wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put one hand on a wooden chest with a chest height, eight drawers and a pile of copper-clad decoration. The filigree jade finger is very fast and ingenious. Shake it, then the heavy wooden cabinet jumps like a life, dancing around her fingers. She waved her hand and the wooden cabinet screamed and flew to the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made a fist in the other hand, the fierce fist in the air with an unimaginable high straight forward, catching up with the wooden cabinet in the air, like breaking a crystal Like a goblet, it has been smashed into four pieces of flying wood. More lively than the work of a most experienced coward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around, the copper wrap angles, hinges, metal handles, and the whole big 6 most expensive firewood, not a complete There is nothing to be said about standing things, and this is a little sigh. She immediately shouted: "Give me out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp and pleasing sound echoed in the room, and it seems that this drink also contains strange power. A sharp scream was heard from the corner of the ceiling, and a small thing came out, and it fell to the ground. It seems that this is a very heavy fall, it can not climb for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A gnome is nothing more than a gnome in the lowest filthy earth! Gregory, you are getting more and more out of nowhere!" Cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome looks a little gray and black, and looks like it is no different from other gnomes. It can't take care of the body's soreness, one turned over and climbed up, one finger a day, one hand to raise the chest, panic and confession: "Weina master! I am doing this for you too! You know, there are many things in this world after all. Do it in secret, but the size of the sacred dragon is too big, sometimes it is less convenient. However, these cumbersome, humble, boring things are rare to make the two greatest, intelligent, beautiful masters do it! Can I rather Use the ultimate metamorphosis to become a gnome, or the lowest gnome of the earth! As long as you can stay beautiful forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just in the room Everyone who smashed a smashed woman was the revival of Wella. Although the mahogany of the map suffered such a terrible catastrophe, compared with her, this power can almost be called extremely weak. It is like the difference between a gnome and a giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, is this your faithful performance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome is confident Road: "Of course!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why do you hide and sneak in my room? Your courage suddenly becomes bigger, do you think I am now? Can't this force lift you up?" Wella's beautiful eyes slammed dangerously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnome was shocked and shivered: Weina gnome You can sweep the sanctuary with only fourteen levels of anger, although your power has not recovered yet. But at least there are five or six levels, and I am more than enough to clean up! But in this way, you can lose one of the most loyal servants! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted, and during this time, she had already had a clear understanding of Gregory’s habits, and naturally knew Gregory. Why are you hiding here?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she wakes up from the dark dragon circle, she immediately runs to look for ***. The two are in the *** I didn't know what to talk about in the hall, but it didn't take long for Wei Na to soak up and go back to the room and start to pick things up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Hiding in the door of the main hall, the eavesdropping was unsuccessful. In the gossip, it was quite intelligent. It immediately took the first step and hid in the room of Weina. As for the consequences of the present, it did not consider that much.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina had a slight breath, and she said coldly: "Gregory, you are here to stay here, don't go anywhere! Wait for me and *** to finish the bill, come back and pack you!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has hesitated about Na Master, do you really want to find the owner again? I think... don't end! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina just quietly watching Gregory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory On the ground, under the eyes of Wella, it trembled more and more. It hardened the scalp: "The mood of the master has been bad since the world. You see, no one dares to approach the master. The main hall. And now that your invincible power has not recovered, of course, it is more than enough to deal with a sacred dragon, but to go to the owner of the ***, you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weina is cold and cold: "Is she afraid of her?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her words are quite powerful, the steps to the door have stopped.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Weina thought for a while, only that the recent behavior of *** suddenly became very weird. She told Gregory to tell me everything that happened in the recent period, and I wouldn’t say anything! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory secretly fortunately escaped, and it just wanted to speak, and Wella said again: "Take your eavesdropping and see it." Say it out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Verna’s gaze to kill the dragon, Gregory did not dare to hide, not only spit out what he knew. , plus a lot of self-conjected content, Willa heard a dizzy turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read through the many memories of God’s original, I left an ear to Gregory, listening to it and lingering. Say everything about ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it? Devouring... It seems that this is a good way to improve your strength! It works well for my current situation. I used to ignore it. Wella spoke to herself, and she immediately said to Gregory: "What did you say?" "Gregory heard that Weiner spit out the words of swallowing, and scared the cold sweat. It couldn't help but learn the ultimate deformation and become a gnome." It’s wise to decide, otherwise, in the eyes of those who have mastered the devour, there is really no better taste than a sacred dragon with weak strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is determined Determined that as long as Wella does not regain strength, she will never appear in front of her in the form of a sacred dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory of wisdom immediately decided I tried to get the attention of Wella from my own body, but now Wei Na is concerned about, except for strength, it is ***.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just said, Once, the elders of Hughes who had heard wisdom talked about the recent anomalies of the *** master. He said with emotion: 'Love makes people blind. '..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner really stunned, she left her left foot, and a strong force from Gregory’s feet, it immediately flew involuntarily Weina reached out and grabbed the underground gnome in her hand. She stared at Gregory for a long time and asked: "Is this sentence really said by the old things of Xius?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory nodded desperately.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Wei Na hand loose, Gurley Gao Li fell heavily on the ground. It hurts so badly, but he can't scream, and he can't help but hate the fragility of the gnome's body. If it's not the gnome's talent in stealth and hiding, it's Gregory. Big talents won't choose this form!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wena is silent for a long time, suddenly reaching for a stroke, and holding Gregory in his hand, then one The word asked: "Love... What is it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory immediately said: "Love...that is...is..." It suddenly appeared, and he was actually strange to the word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waste! "Vina anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory wants to make meritorious deeds, it racks its brains and finally says: "The word love is very familiar and makes the Terran blind." Is it... I think we should ask the individual to ask, or ask the elders of Hughes again. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory finally got a big bang, how dare he stay? His body was blurred and he immediately slipped out like a light smoke. It seems that the race of the underground gnome is not only a hidden talent, but also agile. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina meditation alone for a while, silent under the feet, like a ghost out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful and mysterious city of floating city is a desirable place, the colorful magical light belts flow in the sky, the goblin in the light Playing the harp and holding the flute tirelessly. Only suddenly, a strange and terrifying atmosphere spread in this city of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Emperor and Elgar did not recognize that Wiener was the light angel who easily destroyed the abyss and then cleaned the world of death. But the instinct of undead creatures, or the instinct that makes them feel empty, has become extremely dangerous. When Weina was awakened, Elgra was presiding over the Dark Dragon Faction, while Bone Emperor was the guard, and both kings had seen her. At that time, the kings did not know the origin of Wella, but felt that the faint sacredness of her body made them very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Wella is weakly outrageous, but the arrogance of looking down on the earth is innate. As soon as she stepped out of the dark dragon circle, she turned a blind eye to the two powerful monarchs and the strongmen around the squad, and went away from the hall of ***. And some of the strong people did not know why, there was no thought of dissatisfaction with her rudeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the two kings walked on the promenade today, they saw Vera again. This beautiful woman is standing at the other end of the promenade, her strength is still very weak, but her gaze makes the kings shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a hungry lion looking at the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the burning golden eyes, Elgar suddenly stopped and then turned to the right and turned to the floor. Stairs going up. The bone emperor set foot on the stairs downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stood still, and there was no gold in the air. In the dark, the golden eyes burned even harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A door in the corridor suddenly opened, and the Death Class just came out and all the expressions immediately stiffened on the face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class suddenly shrank back like a frightened rabbit, and slammed the door tightly. He is not a top killer, feels very keen, and does not take a look at the direction of Wella, it is a source of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint window opening and closing sound, it seems that the Death Class chose another way to leave the Floating City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Xiusi, he left the city of floating since the moment Wyna woke up. These two days are not related to Froya and do not know how to study. What is mixed with Wena, who was also accommodating his posts. Anyway, ***, Wella and Rogge, he is not seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only person in the city that is not feeling abnormal is Androni. Instead of fearing Weina, she always wanted to find some excuses to dangle in front of her and chat for a while. If it weren't for this very beautiful woman who had a faint majesty all the time, maybe Androni would do something. But that is nothing to do, sad to look at Wella, itself is also a very pleasing thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every time I see Vera, I always feel that her eyes are full of scorching, that is almost boiling passion! And Wella will suddenly ask her some questions about love and love, and every time I let Androni get a little dizzy. Her heart is always speculating, is this mysterious beautiful woman taking the opportunity to test herself. Those who can set foot in the city of floating are not leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stumbled to decide to use this tenderness, rather than the violence of the past, to bring this woman into her arms. Although Wella seems to be weak, Androni can't afford to be strong. Really reluctant! Every time I read this, Androni will involuntarily float a little intoxicated laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she has never thought of arrogance, is not willing to use this girl strong, is it because of the fear in the subconscious? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the main hall of the ***, she has turned every place in the floating city countless times. The whole floating city was hollow, and the strong people who had already smelled the dangerous atmosphere fled with various excuses. Only one Androni dangled in front of her every day. Every time Vera saw Androni's heroic face with a charming face, the heart would involuntarily emerge the ability to swallow. And each time, the instinct of the light angel will subconsciously modify the engulfment to be more perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she looked at Androni’s eyes and became more and more enthusiastic. Weina only relied on asking another thing that was of interest to her, love, and desperately suppressed the impulse to swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the more Weiner couldn’t control herself, the more times Androni appeared in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vicious circle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory!" Wella moved with a spirit A scream that rang through the entire floating city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! The underground gnomes descended from the sky and fell at the foot of Weina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnomes jumped up and turned and fled. It’s just that the ground beneath it has a strange wave of power fluctuations, no matter how he changes his body shape, he just cleans his power every time. So after a while, although Gregory was already tired and fainted, it was still striding in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnome has finally confirmed that the master of Vera is only using five levels of vindictiveness, and it is not that she can compete against it. It is a luxury to run away in front of her. Of course, the shape of the sacred dragon is still likely to escape, but it becomes a very stupid thing to become a sacred dragon in front of Wella, who is devastated and weak in strength. In this regard, Gregory of wisdom is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the gnome is extremely sorry, why can't Androni spend more time in front of the owner of Wella? If the owner of Wella swallows a new Juggernaut, shouldn't he see the sacred dragon that has nothing to do with it? The vanity of Gregory suddenly felt that at some point, the weak is not necessarily a bad thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at the tattered black robe on the ground gnome, frowning: "Gregory, you are getting less and less clothes." "品品!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory immediately said: "Vina master, this piece of robes is a little old, but you know, suitable for a gnome The magical equipment is very difficult to find..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! Gregory, go out with me." Wella interrupted the obvious intention to make a long story. Gnomes underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome wiped the sweat and respectfully said: "Follow your instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a twinkling of an eye, the master servant has already left the gate of the floating city. Weina glanced at the clouds floating below, and leaped lightly out of the floating city, head and feet, and passed through the thick clouds in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnome looked down, and the gray-black face was actually a bit white. Jumping from the sky in the form of underground gnomes is simply suicide! But the consequences of letting the master of Wella wait for a long time are also equivalent to suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnomes yelled all the way, dancing and falling from the sky. It suddenly felt a shock, and was lifted up by a strong force. Although it was still falling down, there was no feeling of weightlessness. When I saw it, I saw myself in an ancient and magnificent courtyard. There was a magnificent Baroque building in front. The four armed guards at the door were staring at this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s hand was loose, and the gnome fell to the ground. When Gregory got up, he saw that Wella had already reached the two oak-clad doors. The guards have reacted. They have gathered around and said: "Who! Dare to be acquainted with the Royal Library of Delaware?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina Squatting, her face was cold, her hands were slightly on the guard's long-handed axe, and at least four of the eight-level defensive guards turned around involuntarily, and then four big-headed helmets slammed into the ground. together! Looking at the guards lying down on the ground, the gnome at the bottom could not help but have some gloating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena did not push the door, and directly punched a big hole on the door that allowed one person to enter and exit, and walked into the big library. The underground gnomes were busy going in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly said: "Go and move all the books about love!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the underground gnome took a bleak Short sword, jumped up and said: "Not too fast! Which action is slower, I am Greg... I immediately slaughtered him1<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These librarians are Some people who don’t know martial arts, even though the wicked dwarf looks very ridiculous, but the mysterious beautiful woman can’t resist the faint pressure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, In front of Verna sitting in front, the book about love has piled up like a mountain. There are poems, novels, biographies, history, and even the study of love theory, more than tens of thousands?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Weina closed her eyes and said faintly: "Everyone chooses a book casually, use your fastest time, read it!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty librarians face each other, they don't know what the mysterious woman is, but when they look at the big hole on the door, no one dares to resist Heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe in history, love has never been used in such a way as to be interpreted in different ways from dozens of ways. The sounds of different thicknesses read the book held in the hand at the fastest speed that they can reach, and the huge and strange sounds of the city meet in the library.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a fear of the woman’s lingering fear, these officials have already fallen under the huge sound of the top chaos. The underground gnome has heard the legs soft, it tries not to Trying to discern the content of the sound, but the content is poured into the ears, all kinds of stories, sighs and logic can not torment the wisdom of the underground gnomes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under this kind of pursuit of the recitation method, the poetry has no impact from the stagnation Infectivity, the romantic warmth of love stories, or the sadness and beauty are all gone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina closed her eyes and did not have any emotional fluctuations on her beautiful face. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden exclamation from outside the library door. It turned out that the time of the guard’s change was over. The replacement guards are now. The coma guards also saw the damage of the gate, so when they made an alarm, they rushed into the big library. The librarians stopped reading and they read it. They were in the middle of the gorgeous high-back chair. It’s empty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the Royal Library, Rogge is squatting in the study. He has already got someone to break into the Royal Library. The report, but did not care. His body is still very weak, although the trauma is almost the same, but the magic recovery is extremely slow. But Rogge is not afraid of someone to trouble, at this time the guy who dares to come to Tiffany It’s a foolish fool, maybe the only exception to the world is the light. The pope, who seems to fall at any time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he just listened briefly and waved the generals below to handle the big library themselves. Being smashed into the incident.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Rogge, there is still an unresolved thing. Until Androni pushed the door in, he really made up his mind. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie's path sits on Rogge's seat and habitually puts a pair of long legs on his desk. This is the way: "Dead fat, you are looking for I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Rogge stood in front of the window, as if he was still hesitating, and said for a long time: "Annie, there is one thing, think Please help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Helping you to go to the city of floating? That is impossible!" Androni immediately said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and shook his head. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a while before he made a request to Androni.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Androni sighed fat, you know that I can't leave the city for a long time now... but for this matter, I will find a way to go for you once."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni stood up and walked out. After Rogge, she stopped and sighed: "Dead fat, have you been living so tired?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
