			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deeper. Wan Jia *** has long been extinguished, and Tiffany entered the home of sleep. In addition to the magic torch on the Champs Elysees in front of the palace, the magical torch is still shining and forming two spectacular light bands, the rest of the city is shrouded in the darkness. Occasionally, the lights of the stars, and even the light of the blue moon in the sky, are not enough to penetrate this dark sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge himself did not know, from when he liked to stand on a high place and look at the world from a bird's eye. Think carefully, maybe this habit is also from ***, in memory, every time you see the *** in the world of death is independent of the peak of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold air is crystal clear and refreshing. Rogge took a deep breath and only felt that his chest was wide open, and the boring work and the troubles caused by personnel during the day seemed to slip away. It’s just that the leisurely moment is almost extravagant. At least on his desk, there are two notes of the gnome Nakuba and the goddess of ice and snow waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed softly, just turned around, and suddenly there was a strong space turbulence in front of him, and the road shook like a wave. Every time there is an expansion of the energy of the space landscape, everything in the room is squeezed into powder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat is familiar with the demon lotus like the palm of the hand falling from the air. Yes, it is indeed falling. It seems that the power of *** is so weak that it can not only control the fluctuation of space, but even control the whereabouts of its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the devil, Rogge was surprised and happy. He strode forward and stretched out his arms, trying to catch the empty demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a flash of silver in front of the eyes, and suddenly there is a gun that flows through the silver mans, and then slams on the arm of Rogge. Sting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles slightly. It seems that *** is still the same as before, and you can't touch it yourself. He waited, and his figure suddenly disappeared before the dragon soul gun touched his arm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he has appeared in the space behind him, reaching for the waist of the demon. Hold the *** that was supposed to fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting a warm and jade, Rogge suddenly appeared, the original demon lotus is not the icy and lifeless sense of imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** in the arms was obviously stiff, and then a very dangerous feeling rose from the bottom of Rogge. He quickly released his hand and the lightning drifted to the rear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of the demon lotus suddenly unfolded, the tip of each wing feather formed by the slender nails, slightly turning to a very small angle, arrogant and thin Sharp blade, the beautiful wing immediately becomes a murderous blade. Then the Dragon Soul Warrior really turned into a flying dragon, screaming and screaming at Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is dignified. Between the thoughts has been a spiritual shield of silver, but this time the position is not in front of himself, but in front of the devil. Rogge certainly does not expect the Light Shield to stop the ***, only hope that she can dodge it, so that I can fight for the next magic. Although his master has always been used to being weak, he does not want to be left behind in a face-to-face manner. This is a big issue of dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Rogge’s surprise. *** actually hit a silver light shield on this one! The silver shield couldn’t bear the impact, bursting open, and turned into a room star rain. However, the momentum of the *** also stopped, and the dragon soul warrior stabbed Rogge one meter away. It has been exhausted, and no more than half a point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** that is retreating like electricity will not be able to flash this silver shield? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was shocked and almost made the magic in preparation fail. Fortunately, his magical control is no different, it is hard to reorganize the magic of a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only took out a few notes and completed the magic. A number of chains that shine with sacred light appear out of thin air, and the vertical and horizontal errors are made. The demon lotus is tied up and solid, and the unbalanced *** is pulled by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena has never been so angry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time you pretend to be *** is so unsatisfactory. Even the little devils and the devils came to the air and almost did a little mess. She thought she had completely mastered the structure of this plane space, but for some reason, the rules of space transition were slightly different from her cognition. And her power at the moment is extremely weak, and it is supported by the power contained in the dragon soul gun. As a result, in the process of crossing the space, it was almost hit by space storms to other planes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not enough. Wella hasn't calculated with Rogge that he used to hand over his old account in the temple of the *** that day, he even dared to reach out and help! Of course, she wouldn't be polite, and she would smash a shot and want him to retreat. As a result, he was stabbed and stabbed, and he was still holding a bag. The next series of attacks failed to succeed, and because of its weak strength, it was obvious that Rogge would set the light shield in front of him, but he couldn’t control the demon to flash to one side, but hit it up, but it was Losing balance, almost fell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She! Special light fighting angel! Even a light shield can't flash? This is really an unforgivable shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most annoying thing is that this dead fat man has locked her in place with divine bondage! A Necromancer casts a divine bond, and Wella, the perfect light angel, is dedicated to bind the dark and undead creatures to the sacred bondage to lock in place? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to this plane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Weina uses the pinnacle of power to transform the divine power into the power of death, she can even use the same effect as death. The spell-like ability, but she is the light angel born for the battle, and Rogge is just a human. Is Rogge's use of power at such a level? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Wella looked at him with amazement and anger and walked over. She has used dozens of methods in an instant to try to break the sacred bondage. But they all failed. At the moment, Wei Na has only five levels of vindictiveness. Even if she uses the power of art, no one can compete, but the five-level vindictiveness is the five-level vindictiveness, and no matter how it is changed, it will not become a six-level vindictive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s hand gently stroked the mask of the demon lotus, using the fingertips to experience the warmth and softness of the trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina thinks that the demonic mask of the demon has been changed to its own appearance, and this temperament is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what should this fat man do next? Weina suddenly thought of this problem and thought of the fate of the past. And in the experience of the abandoned land and the battle of ***, my heart could not help but tremble. But the body is still paralyzed, and no matter what she is born, she is powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the current demon lotus contains mainly the divine power, but it still contains one of the most pure death forces, so the time of divine bondage will be exceptionally long. some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her surprise, Rogge stared at the mask of the demon lotus for a moment, and even took his hand back, and untied the sacred bondage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina was on the spot for a while, turned her heart thousands of times, and once I replied to the freedom of action, I forgot to shoot him a few shots. Clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed low, as if there were many emotions: "It’s been eight years...***, your change is really big... At first you would rather fight with all the kings, and would not change the demon lotus, that is... just don’t want me to see your changes? But... forget it. I want to see you, though you don’t want it. I won't take off your mask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina didn't expect Rogge to say this. The memory of God's origin reappears in the depths of her soul. That is the memory she shared with ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lead-colored sky, in the winds of fierce death and the peaks of the hustle and bustle, they can’t escape and fight, but they are increasingly desperate Days, one by one, reappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she inadvertently swept these memories, she just smiled. At that time, for the arrogant light angels, the struggle and struggle between the humble and the dead spirits was just a joke. However, at this moment, she re-reads, and she clearly feels that the deepest lies in these memories are concerned, sad, desperate and resolute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, these memories are so heavy! Her arrogance and contempt was as shallow as a fall, and the atmosphere of the missing season was everywhere, crushing her arrogance and engulfing her contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has some suffocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena is a bit flustered. She inexplicably wanted to find out something to prove that Rogge was just a humble and shameless necromancer. She suddenly remembered that Rogge had seen her. Those who are sleeping. Wella can't move, can't say, but still can feel everything around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge standing in front of her did not have any movements, his expression was very hesitant, looking at the ground liar! So I dare not look up. Wella was sure in her heart again, feeling that breathing was a little smoother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog finally looked up and looked straight into her eyes: "***, actually... I saw you when you were asleep. I don't want to say it, because you...you never wanted me to know what you are. But I decided to tell you that we shouldn't always be hidden between us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's breath immediately stopped, and the heart twisted into a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, have you been able to fully exist in this plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Rogge, there is a joy of joy. He has always had some stuttering: "***...that...I don't have to summon in the future." What do you mean by saying that you are going to live in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina couldn’t help but laugh. "You said where I live?" She repeated Rogge's question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and felt that this problem was a bit strange. The fat man's footprints are all over the North and South, and the *** has traveled back and forth between the planes. However, for them a concept that does not exist at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighed: "***, since you have come to this plane, then...be with me!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina frowned and coldly said: "Is it possible? Where do I want to go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Good, everything is happy by you." Rogge smiled. He looked at Wella and frowned and asked: "***, how is your strength weakened to this extent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you wake up That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The number of grievances is completely enough, shouldn't it... Is it that Ella has moved his hands and feet?" Rogge thought bitterly. The tone has gradually turned cold: "No matter what the kings have done, I will let them repay in the next king war! ***, you are too weak now, this war will not intervene. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" Weina was a bit curious, in her opinion. Any king can knock Rogge down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles coldly in the world, the rules of the game must be determined by me. Since these damn kings have come up with seven things to hunt you, then don’t think about what is fair here! I will set the finale in the activities of the Southern Bright Church, and then inform the Bright Church in advance that there will be three most evil big undeads in their parishes. At that time, let us see who the Holy Knights and the Undead Kings are. And I will wait in the middle of the road. If the kings have a life to escape from the south, I will give them a fair decisive battle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed softly. Nothing to say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly took off her helmet A gold falls like a waterfall, the sun jumps on the silk, and the fascinating glory of the world shines on Rogge's eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina smiled and said: "I have already seen it before, so I don't wear a helmet. Since you are willing to go to the kings for revenge, then I ask you if one day I had a war with O'Reilly. What will you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue and O'Brien's war? Why? Didn't she wake you up?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly smiles and you don't care. You don't have to answer now, think about it when you have time! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she turned around, she would jump into the void. However, her figure just wanted to hide, and the devil’s wings were tight, and they were born. Pulled back!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's different from the world of death, there are a lot of guys who are even better than the king." You are very weak now, and when you are in danger, you must remember to flee. After Rogge finished, he let go of his hand and let her go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep. But there are still tireless people who don't want to fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is lying on the table, a pair of green eyes squinting at the warm flame beating in front of her eyes, waiting for the moment of water opening. Only when the water blooms into a round shape, the temperature is most suitable for making tea. Xiusi slowly placed the tea in the teapot, but the calm expression always showed a little bit of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tea is finally fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little goblin actually forgot to grab tea, but just thinking about his own thoughts. When Xiusi was fortunate, he quickly poured a large cup for himself and deeply absorbed the tea. Only when the tea is nourished by the internal organs, and then shallow and shallow, and the mouth is turned over, you can fully understand the essence of the tea from the wind and water. Tea is to drink this place. In the past, in order to grab the little goblin, I had to drink it, and plainly ruined the good tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's hands are shackled, and the unparalleled face has a faint sorrow. "The elders of Hughes have been twenty-four this year. According to the tradition of the southern aristocracy, I am already an old woman. What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes pondered for a moment It is just sighing: "His Royal Highness, aging is a problem that every living creature will inevitably encounter. It is not impossible to have longevity and youth, or even eternal life, but the cost is often very heavy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria sighed faintly. She suddenly said: "Elders of Shusi, you said, is it possible for me to grab Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes was silent for a longer time, Then he said: "Your Highness, you also know the character of Rogge, I want him to be only by your side, I am afraid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly won't It is enough to ask for all his possessions, as long as he can have his true feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya suddenly sat up and grabbed the tea of ​​Xiusi. When he was in Houston, he was like a cat who had been stepped on his tail and jumped up in pain. He hasn't spoken yet, and the goblin has already revealed the signature smile that is so feminine! I will give myself half a year, if I can't seduce him, then I will take risks! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is Your Highness? "With the wisdom of Hughes, I feel that there is something that can't help her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is my most beautiful age, if I can't get him at this time." After that... it is even more impossible. "Froya has nothing to say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just don't know when, a drop of crystal water drops from the corner of this little goblin, but she is completely ignorant. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the Tiffany gate opened wide, and the 10,000-strong army slowly left the city and went to the city of Sidde.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger rides on the horse and slowly moves forward with the army. Today, I don’t know why, it’s unusual for Xiusi, who has always been a ghost, to ride with him.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue Master, it seems that you have made great progress recently! What have you studied in these days? "Shuss smiled and asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knew that the old fox had such a question, there must be something, so honestly: "The goddess of ice and snow have been watching these days." Miracle record. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out! According to the Elven classics, the goddess of ice and ice used to be a very active god, leaving many miraculous records. However, in recent decades there has been almost no miraculous record of the goddess of ice and snow. In fact, in addition to the goddess of ice and snow, there are many gods who have the same phenomenon. One of the elf colleges who specialize in miracles believes that these phenomena indicate that they will grow old! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is a big surprise? Isn't God immortal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses: “My old man has repeatedly pondered that when God first became a god, he still carries the deep memory of the gods. But as time goes by, these brandings will gradually disappear, and God will become a pure god. In our secular In the eyes of the Chinese, when God matures, it becomes old. For example, when a person first becomes a god, he will still clearly remember the love and hate before the gods, but as time goes by, he will gradually be affected by the gods. Slowly forget all the feelings of the previous life. Because of the existence of feelings, there are still many weaknesses in the young gods, not invincible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
