			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Heaven in Chapter 9 on the expedition <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 19 Expedition<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, the entire empire’s military system was spent in the midst of a busy day, preparing for the Great Defence of the Abyss and re-entering the Gloomy Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey and Alexander have been busy for a few days, and Rogge seems to be at ease. In addition to several strong sanctuaries, he did not bring any elite troops. Therefore, in the preparations for attacking the dark forest, there is nothing wrong with him. However, the fat man is very interested in the war machine of the mainland of the Astrophy Empire. Therefore, as long as he is idle, he will observe the war preparation process of the two major empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, Rogge had nothing to do, and at the invitation of Straw, he went to his house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment the Emperor has already defined the line between the two sides, so Rogge is not worried about the safety of his trip. Such as Rogge and other great aristocrats and empire ministers, it can only be assassinated and can not be attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the warm afternoon sun, Roger’s gorgeous horse-drawn carriage drove smoothly into the prime minister’s house in Straw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This re-visiting of the old place, the prime minister's house is completely a scene of elegance in the atmosphere, luxury, the strangeness of the bloody night has disappeared. In this rare and good weather, Straw and Rogge feel that tea in the garden is much more attractive than private discussion in the secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve first thanked Rogge for saving Serena from the abyss of Barto, and Rogge was kindly polite. . After the two men went back and forth to fake a few rounds, Straw finally began to cut into the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since Roger is so caring for Serena, I will let go of this old face. There is something to say. Charles must have been invited by Rogge. Going? You are so valued by Charles, but it’s been nearly ten days. If you have anything to say, you should finish it. Should you let him back?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge smiled and said: "I didn't know Charles Master shortly after I arrived in the emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straer nodded and said: "It turns out. There is one more thing. I have two daughters. Su and Serena, you have all seen the land. If they have anything to offend you in the future. Can you let her go? In return, I I will also constrain my men and not move the intimate women around you. The stage we are vying for should be the Wanli Sands. Kidnapping and assassination should not be done by heroes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately recalled the "intimate" women around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, among the women around him, the most 'soft' is the wind butterfly and Froya. The strength of the wind butterfly is much stronger than before. Her wheel saw, which has been dyed with poison and accompanied by a powerful curse, is definitely a weapon for harvesting life. Under the influence of the double curse of darkness and bloodthirsty, the wind butterfly is almost immune to all the weakening of the two curses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the little goblin. The rogue is not in Rogge, although he can no longer use the artifact 'lost paradise', but as a great magician full of high-level magical items, Fu Luoya can not be underestimated by anyone. In addition, such a seductive and beautiful woman, the average man is more or less willing to hurt when he is working with her. However, when Froya was murdering, there was absolutely no hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Mora. As a goddess who often displays miracles, even if she does not have a bit of strength, it is not an object that can be easily provoked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Serrafi and Androni...they are not going to bully others, it’s already good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Rogge smiled and said: "I don't like to be bound by too many people, so this thing can't give you any promise. I only hope that you can Restrict the two ladies. Don't be too arrogant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two consecutive setbacks did not discourage Straw, and the smile on his face was not even Change: "Although you refused me, as a reward for your rescue of Serena, I still have to give you the last reminder. In politics, there is also room for negotiation and compromise in the fierce conflict, but in two There is no room for buffer between different faiths. Historically, every religious war caused by a conflict of faith has more bloody and cruel than a large-scale coup. I heard that the empire has recently raised a church, wisdom. Eyes. And you are its strongest supporter. The Eye of Wisdom is developing very fast. It is rapidly expanding the size of believers in the southern part of the empire. The area is originally a gathering place for the supporters of the silver saint tradition. I miss you. I know what I mean. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Today, the eyes of wisdom, the number of believers has exceeded 500,000. According to this speed, it will take a few years for the eye of wisdom to replace the silver saint and become the largest sect of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the silver sacred religion that is absolutely intolerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that once the city of the Clouds is defeated, the next thing to deal with is the silver sacred religion. However, from the current point of view, the alliance between Alexander, Pompey and the silver saint is a typical alliance of secular and religious rights. The two imperial names are not the devout followers of the goddess of ice, just as Straw does not believe in the goddess of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, if the Eye of Wisdom wants to compete for the right to teach with the silver saints, Rogge still has a chance to keep Alexander and Pompey neutral. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in fact, the fat man has a big problem with the belief in Ao Leilei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thanked Straw for reminding me and looked at the sky and offered a farewell. Straw did not add more, and personally sent him out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s carriage passed a corner and just turned into a quiet avenue, a reddish figure suddenly fell in the air, falling lightly in the carriage top. The attacker then turned over lightly and walked in through the wide window. Two cold lights in the hands quickly hit the Rogge throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was in the car, closed his eyes and raised his eyes, turning a blind eye to this sudden assassin. The elf warrior who drove was also completely unaware of the changes that occurred in the car behind him, but only drove the carriage to move smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold light condensed in the throat of Rogge, it turned out to be two exquisite short swords, and the sharp edge of the blade also flashed a faint magical light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you hide?!" This is the crisp sound of Serena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still keeping his eyes closed, and leisurely said: "If you don't plan to really stab it. Why should I hide?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serena was angry for a moment, she shouted: "You!... Do you think I really can't stab?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Rog smiled. The eyes finally opened, and the dazzling silver mans of that moment hit the soul of Serena! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge took two daggers from Serena and then gently swept over her waist, and the girl who was already paralyzed could not help herself. I have been sitting around Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat body of the show, the slowness of the magic and even the Barto demon can not resist, let alone Serena this young swordsman? Although Rogge’s fixation used this time was a little less powerful due to the instant, it was not something that Serena could resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant Serena was hit again. Can not help but be discouraged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Serena costumes are different. She wore a light rose-colored light armor. This light-weight workmanship is exquisite, the materials used are exquisite, and the value is very high. However, the protective effect is very limited, and the meaning of the decoration is more practical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light armor is a good complement to her figure, the neckline is very low, and through a series of special designs, Serena is not full. The chest can also show a seductive cleavage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the exposed and tempted clothing does not completely conceal her surviving youthfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the fat man’s eyes fall on his chest. Serena is a little smug. She intentionally raised her chest and snorted, looking at the fat man with a challenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Serena, you came to me suddenly, what's the matter?" The fat man's gaze is just a glimpse at Serena's chest cleavage. And too. He seems to be a righteous gentleman at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you are going to go to the dark forest soon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog nodded . Road: "If there is no accident, it should be sent out after seven days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog said with a smile: "It seems to wait until the Empire reunifies the mainland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serena glared at Rogge for a long time, this: "No. The second thing is that in the abyss, you... I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more she said, the more she stuttered, the little face swelled red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she gritted her teeth, so that she could squeeze out a word from her teeth: "Than..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the second thank you no matter how hard she works. It is also impossible to force it out of the throat. She paused. Suddenly I fled through the window, and even the two short swords were forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Serena’s long distance. Rog smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten days, the two corps of the Imperial Glacier and Poseidon joined forces and began to march into the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting for the 20,000 infantry that the Emperor transferred, the regular legion of the expedition has nearly 70,000 people, and 50,000 of Alexander’s return from the western border. The dwarf slave warriors are a total of 120,000 troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military system of the Asrofik Empire is extremely developed, and the supplies of this army are mobilized within half a month, respectively. Placed in the eleven military camps from the Imperial Capital to the eastern border, waiting for the army to pass. Judging from such a highly efficient and orderly war machine, Prime Minister Straw is indeed a rare talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this army, more than a dozen elf guards surrounded by Rogge are extremely eye-catching, not to mention that he is always following a charming little goblin . The soldiers of the two empire's corps are extremely disciplined, and no one is harassing these beautiful elves, but when there is a chance, there will always be some young soldiers who can't help but look at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way to the army, Rogge talked with Alexander and Pompey from time to time, and learned a lot about the history of the imperial war. For example, at the beginning of the empire's founding of the country, it will open the way to the sea and seize an estuary as a dream of the empire. Therefore, the famous empire of the empire is named after the nouns related to the sea or water. Only the location of the Asrofic Empire is special, and the north is the ocean of ice. It is extremely difficult to sail, and it is useless to take the sea. If you want to open the seaport on the east, west and southeast, it is possible to annex at least thousands of miles of land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the empire can get through the sea, whether it is a hundred years or a thousand years, it is not a question that Rogge cares about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the army is camped, Rogge will command four separate camps. This is for Hughes, Ban, Serafi and Androni. Although these camps have never been used, they respect the meaning of the four strong men. That's enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Rogge unexpectedly noticed that there was actually a light in a camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately came in. Seeing that Xius was sitting in the account, holding a book and reading it with magical lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it’s the Elf Code? Have you found any good things on this time?" Rogge laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes looked up, and he always looked calm and tired at the moment. Rogge was shocked, and this was the first time he saw that Hughes was so weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes did not speak, and handed the book to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolute Speed ​​and Time, Tikonek..." Rogge frowned. He flipped through a few pages and found that it was all about conjecture and reasoning about the relationship between speed, space and time. These theories are piled up indiscriminately, and some of Rogge knows that they are wrong at first sight, while others look like genius guesses and inferences. But through the whole book, the impression is more like a madman recording his own nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is Tikunik? The great magister of the previous generation?" Rogge asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Tikunik is a mixture of madman and genius, with powerful magic but uncontrollable. In his short life, he wrote at least More than a dozen books on this plane and magic. But the one that is most clearly written in these books proves that at least half of the inferences are wrong. The other half of the conclusions cannot be confirmed. Therefore, when When a magician is in trouble in magic research, he often reads his writings in order to get some inspiration from those crazy ideas. Of course, if a magician can have the same power as the main god, he may be able to verify his suggestion. All kinds of crazy hypotheses." Hughes replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Xiusi did not lift the ground: "For the speed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man snorted and said: "The real speed of your old man, although I have not seen it, but presumably How many people on this continent can catch up with you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and said: “Without a few people, one can catch up with me, It’s already too much! I’m too old, and it’s very difficult to improve even a little bit of speed. It’s like you young people. Everyone is so energetic.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this. Where does Rogge believe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man still asks: "Who is chasing you like this? Do you want to gather people and give him a small set? Just be prepared. Even if it came to Nicholas, he would still let him suffer a big loss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and shook his head: "The next set? It's useless. My old man is old. Big, the action is not as flexible as before, but if you just want to escape, how can Nicholas put it in the eyes of my old man? But this guy...oh, don't say it. Escape for a while!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is even more strange, and he wants to know exactly who has pushed Hughes to this point. The fat man just wanted to ask, suddenly felt that there was a heart and soul that passed quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical lights still radiate a steady and soft light, but the Hughes in the camp has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Rogge has seen the real speed of the old fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in the account, speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Rogge suddenly picked up the "Absolute Speed ​​and Time" that Hughes threw on the ground, striding out of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Virgin Mora was sitting on the main hall of the Eye of Wisdom, quietly looking at the imperial envoy in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial envoy is a middle-aged aristocrat with a sullen face, and there are some connections in the emperor. This time, he spent a lot of gold coins, and he got the messenger who made the Ayre Principality and executed the Holy Baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his understanding, such a mission to the imperial state to perform punishment is a rare fat difference. The special envoy has made up his mind. In addition to the beauty and special products, how can he get a few times of interest in the gold coins he spends? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of the special person assigned by Rogge, the imperial envoy led two hundred light rides, and after a long journey of more than half a month, finally came to the Principality of Are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see the Virgin Mary, the soul of the Special Envoy immediately flies beyond countless planes! It’s just that he still has a sense of reason and knows that Mora’s identity is special. If he comes hard, nearly a thousand believers around the main hall will immediately tear themselves and the two hundred cavalry guards. However, his soul has been completely hooked by Mora, so he made up his mind to spend more time in the Principality of Are, so that he could find opportunities to force Mora to submit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the indescribable beauty of Mora, her noble virginity also made the special envoy tremble with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye of wisdom is very cooperative in the execution of the holy baby. The special envoys are fascinated by magic, and with his slow magical feelings, he can feel the power of the baby. When he executed the holy baby, he was quite scared in his heart. For fear that the goddess O'Reilly, who repeatedly showed miracles, would drop the thunder and turn him into a coke. But the punishment of the goddess is illusory, and the threat of Prime Minister Straw is real. Therefore, in the matter of the baby, he did not dare not do his best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the incident of the Holy Baby, the special envoy has risen again. He looked for various excuses to stay away, and after two days, he was waiting for a new opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mora saint," the special envoy said in the most solemn and majestic voice, his eyes always involuntarily fell on the chest and legs of Mora "There are more and more believers in the Eye of Wisdom. According to my observation, more than 30,000 believers have come from all over the country and gathered around the main hall. Can you explain what is going on?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora warmly replied: "In another three days, the Eye of Wisdom will hold a grand ceremony for the goddess, and the devout believers will come to Dre Ston is to participate in the sacred prayer ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
