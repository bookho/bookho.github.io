			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Heavenly Chapter 15 Abyss in Hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 15 Abyss<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the process of history is a necessity, then this must be made up of countless accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve rushed to the door of the space and asked, "How did Serena go in?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s woman said: “She was inexperienced and went to the door of Rogge and was driven into the door of space.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You mean..." Straw's voice trembled, and he still had the last line to ask: "Then, the sword of Damocles..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It was also brought in by her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Straw has seen countless storms in his life, he still feels dizzy and weak at the moment. I almost fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black women look at Straw indifferently, and even have some gloating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selena squats with your love, never knows how to do things, and how many bad things have happened. The last time she was in trouble, If you are willing to keep her in the dungeon for three months, or at least licking her fifty whip, will she still know that it is so thick and unpredictable as today?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straben was worried and anxious, and was stunned by the black woman’s fire. "Sue! Enough! Serena is still young. It is inevitable that you will make a mistake. As a sister, you should help her more! Now you are still schadenfreaked. I think it’s right for you to be shut down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Small mistakes?" Su cold smiled and said: "Bringing the sword of Damocles into the abyss of Barto is also a small mistake? Father, you can tell me. What is wrong with this? Is it bigger? If there is, then I am willing to spend twenty years in the dungeon! Just because of her point, people laugh at the big teeth, if not for the power of the Excalibur, Want to talk to Roger, who is like a fox? I really don't understand why the Excalibur will choose her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strao sighed and said: "This... ...hey, what is the use of these now? Or just think about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufa vented some grievances in his heart and seemed to be aware of the situation. The sinister. Shen Shen said: "Father, Druid in the city of Yunxiao is not very good at cracking the seal? With their understanding of the seal. There may be a way to seal the door of this space. Greedy Druids will take this Opportunity to propose new conditions, but there is no way. Since the sword of Damocles has entered the abyss of Barto, then this space door may collapse at any time. The door of the abyss is still far away from the emperor, but the seal is cracked In one case, the Emperor almost killed Pompey. You think, if the hordes of Bata Devil suddenly emerged from the Imperial Capital..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strater It has been calmed down at this time, although he still deplores Serena. But since she has entered the Abyss of Barto, it must not be alive. After the heartache, the imperial prime minister finally recovered his calmness and determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Strawland’s deputy rushed to see him outside the door. Straw and Su looked at the door of a calm space and reluctantly left here and came downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stroud! We sensed the Mark of Charles in the vicinity of Pompeii, but the soldiers were eager to succumb to the conflict with Pompeii. As a result, they killed one other person. They had too many people. Our soldiers could not resist, almost all were killed, and only a few people escaped!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stranger frowned, took a few laps of his hand, and then ironed his face: "Remove all of our people! Don't clash with Pompey and Alexander tonight!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy took a moment and said: "But. Master Straw, our strength in the Imperial City is not worse than Alexander and Pompey! Now Charles is arguing that they are given by Pompey. If you take it away, what about the safety of Charles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straer snorted and endured the anger in his heart, Shen Sheng Road: "I have to endure these days and say, if they dare to move Charles, then I have nothing to worry about!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Straor's adult! The big thing is not good! The news just came. Riddle was assassinated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strough was shocked: "What! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Riddle is in charge of the Imperial City Defense Force, although the position is not high. It is a real power figure. He is Stroud's confidant and capable, precisely because he is in town, although Alexander and Pompey have huge private armed forces in the emperor, Straw is not worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Charles was kidnapped and Riddle was killed, the two things can only mean that Alexander and Pompey are ready to use blood and fire to join him. Decisive victory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strough quickly calmed down from the anger and quickly came to the command hall downstairs. The magical devices in the command hall and the two magicians of the time of rotation can enable Straw to pass information to important people in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the hall is a huge magic map. That detailed list of the underground and underground buildings of the Imperial Capital, and even the natural rivers in the depths of the underground are marked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straus stared at the map for a moment, reached out and clicked on the map a few times, and the several bridges he pointed to were lit up. He told the deputy: "General Riddle was assassinated, but General York was also ours. The Guards that he could mobilize immediately took control of these bridges! Also, let him pay attention to the size. Closely monitor Pompei The movement, once there is any movement, immediately return. Inform the amps outside the city, let him lead five thousand soldiers, approach the military battalion of the Glacier Legion for surveillance, but do not fight with them. Inform Gurbanda, say 'blood month 'The night has arrived.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy wrote these commands one by one, letting the two magicians pass the message one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strough stared at the magic map for a long time, his fingers hanging in the air, and he could not fall. Finally, his hand fell on the magic map, and a large-scale house lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su! You are going to kill Li Wei who lives here. After killing him, if you are still free, other people in the yard will also be here. Killed, one does not stay! Come back here immediately after the kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black women gently licked the red lips, it seems The coming killing and bloodyness made her very excited. She replied, and the seductive figure gradually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, an important bridge on the magic map suddenly turned red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician in charge of communication said: "Master Stroud, there has been a fierce battle on this bridge, it seems that the other side also wants to control this Bridge. Very sorry. The message said that the number of opponents and individual combat effectiveness overwhelmed us, so our locals were repulsed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the location of the bridge. I immediately ordered another place on the map, where there was a residential building. "The mobilization of the heavy infantry team and the squadron, occupying the roof and the tallest building in the Vonsk district. Be sure to stay here at any cost! Please ask the Gulbanda Master to come here to assist the defense."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location designated by Straw is very important. This home can control a large area nearby, one end of which is a strong military fort controlled by the Straw faction, and the other end It is the Imperial Palace. If Pompey and Alexander do not pass through here, they will bypass half of Richelieu. Can attack the Prime Minister's Office. They will never let the soldiers enter the Imperial Palace within a kilometer range. This kind of behavior was seen by the Guards, but it was like rebellion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is urgent at the moment, it seems that Alexander and Pompey have decided to come hard, so Straw will no longer want to cover up the truth and decide to send troops directly to occupy important positions. House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short time, the color of this home on the magic map also turned red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician of the communication reported: "Stroud, the other party mobilized a large number of fighters, is attacking! But Gulbanda and his masters have already Arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a response in the city of Yunxiao?" asked Straw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have received their message. The elders of Osedas have left the city of Yunxiao and are expected to arrive in Richelieu three days later. Nature The Druid, where the goddess shrine resides, has assembled and is monitoring the main hall of the goddess of ice and snow. As long as the ice and snow mage leaves the main hall, they will immediately capture the main hall of the goddess of ice and snow."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a faint bloody suffocation in the command hall. The black sui appeared behind Straw. She smiled at Straw, smiled and was cruel. Straw nodded and knew that Su’s mission had been completed, and that it must have been alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the imperial prime minister once again fell on the magic map. While paying attention to the changes in the situation, he issued a command to mobilize the people already. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a little bit that he feels very confused, that is, Alexander and Pompey are very clever commanders, why do they make this almost crazy tonight? the behavior of? Even if they can put themselves to death, how should they face the anger of the emperor tomorrow? They are the generals of the army. This kind of behavior in which the warriors openly fight in the emperor is enough to destroy the race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what doubts Straw has. At the moment he must be tit for tat. Mobilize all the power in your hand to fight against your opponent. At least he must also get the moment to meet the Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, the flames that ignited everywhere reflected the night sky of Richelieu. The bloody edge of the blue moon in the sky was not noticed by anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this 'blood moon' night. Is it that all the people are crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just Straw’s doubts, but Alexander and Pompey have the same doubts. However, the two sides have been in opposition for a long time, and they have already prepared a number of emergency plans in different situations. As long as one party has a change, the other party will inevitably start a response plan. When you come to me, the scale of the conflict has expanded rapidly. The whole time of Richelieu was a flash of fire and a burst of fire. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two sides still maintain the final restraint, in addition to the most fierce competition in the Vonsk district, the competition for other minor locations, the military forces invested by both sides are Less than 100 people. In fact, although both sides are the most powerful ministers of the empire, they can only fight for themselves in the imperial capital. In addition to the most important location in the Vonsk district, the purpose of fighting in other places is to test and contain. In the case of not being able to use the army on a large scale, the outcome of the battle between the two sides will depend on the outcome of the battle of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After General Riddle’s death, the city defense forces have temporarily become paralyzed and unable to control the situation in the outer city. The imperial guards of the Imperial Palace have been fully guarded. I just don’t know why, because of the reasons, I will not turn a blind eye to the killing of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the silent attention of the Guardian horror behemoth, both sides carefully controlled the scale of the conflict and revenge, and did not dare to step a step further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But both parties know that there are too many factors that are beyond control. In the ever-changing battlefield, accidents happen at any time. Therefore, they are quietly accumulating all the power in their hands, ready to give the opponent a final blow before the situation is completely out of control. Even if you have to face the anger of the great emperor. That is also the matter of tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the magic map of Straw, a silver church that was originally calm in the south of the city suddenly turned into a bright red. Then quickly disappeared from the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint twitch in the eye of Straw. He came to the window and looked at the raging fire pillar of more than ten meters in the distance. Such a sudden and fierce flame that instantly flattens a church can only be a masterpiece of high-level magical land. Straw secretly sighed, and when the high-level magicians of both sides began to move, the scale of the conflict could not be controlled. Unfortunately, Straw can't control the actions of the Druids. The only way to do this is to weaken the power of the opponent as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been quiet, Su said: “Father. I’ve already had a good rest. It’s time to go out and go out again. I think, now the city is wandering around. The snow and ice mage must be a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strough nodded heavily and watched Su’s figure gradually become blurred. He suddenly said: "Su! You have to be careful, they have a lot of strong people. If you encounter difficulties, don't be reluctant, come back here immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Su’s figure paused. Then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she left, she chuckled and said: "This is the first time you care about my life and death!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has always had a bloodthirsty and cruel voice, and there is a faint whimper at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood and flames do not cause the attention of the wind butterfly. She is still immersed in the thrill of killing, and the warm blood is flowing down her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly now has no feelings about the bloody suffocation, but the faint moonlight in the sky makes her irritated. She almost couldn't suppress her bloodthirsty **, just wanted to rush into a house full of people to kill, just like she had just done at the old man's house called Riddle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly swept between blood and fire, and raised the left hand with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently rubbed the blood on her fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is warm and sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put her hand down again. Rogge had been strict, and her tongue was not allowed to get blood. Wind Butterfly now only knows that Rogge’s orders must obey, and that a few drops of blood are already the limit she can achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the torture of the dark and bloodthirsty double curse, the wind butterfly has become groggy, and her whole body is like a stove. Consciousness is gradually blurring. She wants to go back as soon as possible. In the crazy and absurd carnival with Rogge, vent the pain of burning, then. It is her most desirable, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quiet sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ignorance of sleep is her happiest time. Wake up is the beginning of endless pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden and severe pain made her wake up, but she still looked puzzled at the light shrouded in her body, not knowing the light column that caused intense burning pain Where come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the burning of the Holy Light, the blood of the wind butterfly quickly boils and evaporates. When the last drop of blood disappears, the Holy Light dissipates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a gentle voice was introduced into the heart of the wind butterfly: "The confused soul, you let hatred blind the soul, in the blood and dark hell The farther you go, the more noble and pure you are, are you willing to accept the destruction in your shackles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly is looking for the source of the sound and discovers what is ahead A figure appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a middle-aged man whose face is covered with weather. He was barefoot, wearing only a dark gray robes and a long brown hair on his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly’s gaze fell on his hand. This is a pair of slender, white hands, strikingly wearing a gorgeous shackle on the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body flashes with a brilliant blue glow. Glittering on the chain, countless magical symbols such as small bubbles under water, can not help but turn over the surface of the chain, and then gradually disappear. However, the new more devils will come up from the depths of the chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man is separated from the center of the butterfly by a burning house, but he walks in volley, and the smoke and fire are not on him. Traces of the next star and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he walks closer, the more the wind butterfly feels a strong light is transmitted from him. Not only did her eyes sore, but it was shining on her. It seems to have also burst into a burst of blue smoke. Watching him walk, the wind butterfly can not help but fear, and took a few steps back. But when she looked at it again, she discovered that the man had neither transmitted glare nor burned his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything just now is an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lost soul, you have completely lost your direction. I will not let your hands contaminate more blood. Let me go, in the sacred In the flames, your sin and the curse of your burden will disappear, and you will have the opportunity to repent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong fear makes the butterfly unable to calm down Think about each other's words. The man spoke for a long time, she only understood a meaning, he wants to take away himself, and will burn himself with the holy fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly has a little bit of the toes, and the whole person floats up. Just want to escape to the distance. Somehow, the killer she did not dare to confront the mysterious middle-aged man in front of her, even if he gave his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
