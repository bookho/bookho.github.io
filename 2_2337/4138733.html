			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly has been standing in front of the window for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky outside the window is gray, and the bright red sun hangs low on the horizon, completely making the wind butterfly feel a little warm. Although it is not early, the maids in the courtyard still dare not speak loudly, fearing to disturb the still sleeping master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s the same night, it’s a little sleepy. She knew that Ajani must be crouching around Rogge at the moment. She shook her head desperately and expelled the picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly has the urge to cry. For a time, she was so helpless, but she could not find a harbor to rely on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, when Rogge was having fun in the Grand Duke, Ajani quietly entered the room of the butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aga Ni? Is there anything?" The butterfly has a hint of coldness and hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani wants to stop, silence for a moment, suddenly burst into tears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly was shocked, although because of her relationship with Rogge, Wind Butterfly is very sorry for Ajani. But after all, before Rogge arrived, the two had been close family sisters! The wind butterfly couldn't help it. He gently hugged Ajani's shoulder and patted her back, whispering comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ajani cried even more, and finally she was crying, and the wind butterfly cried a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy, she just cried a bit, and a pair of beautiful eyes have swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly..." Ajani sobbed, leaning her head, not looking to the face of the wind butterfly. "I know, you must look down on me in your heart, look down on me and... I and God make the adult go to bed. Jenny's face is pale, and she worked hard for a long time before she squeezed out the second half of her teeth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still very happy, very loud! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly face was white, she shook her head and said, "I never thought about it, really...I Never thought of you and... that thing... what is not good. He is a god-given, bears the mission of guiding the elves, and he is a very powerful magician! Although it was ugly, the butterfly suddenly woke up and grabbed the small mouth with his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani has not cried at all. She smiled bitterly and broke free from the arms of the wind butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know it will be like this...thank you for comforting me." Ajani turned and walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly only thinks that Ajani is very weird, she is busy holding Ajani. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Ajani, what happened? Is it Rogge that bastard forced you?! If this is the case, let us tell this. The Presbyterians will go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Presbyterian Church? No use." Ajani shook her head and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice of the Great Temple will help us! Ajia Ni, sister, tell me, what happened? I am the guardian of the church. Those who have the ability to protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani gently touched the white face of the butterfly, smiled and said: "Thank you for calling me. A sister. I really want to go back to a small time, when Rumsfeld was the best friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajiani sighed and asked: "The wind butterfly, God makes Rogge's magic only eleven, but you have the confidence to win him. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly stunned, the answer to this question is obvious, but she suddenly remembered that Rogge’s sacred light and black flame shield axe Against the wind, standing on the top of the bone faucet, he could not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly, the "Dark Side of the Moon" unit formed by Rogge adults, what do you think is the fighting power?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask you again, in the sinister environment, is the elves in the north or the elves in the central mountains more able to survive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind butterfly has a small mouth and can't speak. She suddenly has some anger: "Enough! What do you say? Do you really like him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Ajia Ni sighed and said softly: "The wind butterfly is so intolerable that it is not perfect. I have never told you that the elders of Xius gave me a secret order, that is, at all costs. Let God keep the grown-ups in the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly was shocked: "What? Is God not the Hilo to guide the elves? This sacred mission It’s not finished yet!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In fact, as soon as the city of the gods was built, the gods said to the elders of Hughes that his mission to guide the elves has been completed. He worked so hard for the elf for so long, but there was no advantage at all. Now the guiding elves have found the holy place and also laid the foundation. The foundation of the Elf is strong, and this matter is finished. If there is no benefit, he is not prepared to contribute any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly only thinks it all They have already come out of her imagination. "How is it possible! How glorious it is to be the god of Hilo! God, he still has to discuss the benefits!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani smiles Looking at the butterfly's eyes is full of strange pains: "Yes. He has many benefits, one of which is you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a breath of air. "Does the Presbyterians agree with his greed and rudeness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani doesn't talk, just squatting at the wind butterfly, one of the butterflies The heart slowly sinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Presbyterian decided to meet all his requests, as long as he would stay in the Elves..." Ajani finally said that the wind butterfly is unbelievable s answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can the Presbyterians make such a decision?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All of the Elf The change is all from God's wisdom to make you and I know. The elders of Shusi said that God's talents are the key to the survival of the elves. But he really does not want to order this order, so let me inform you. Let you talk to him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was silent for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aga Ni sister, are you one of his conditions?" The voice of the wind butterfly is full of exhaustion and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. I took the initiative to seduce him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is eating again shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly, we are the best friends since we were young. I want to fulfill you and Rumsfeld, but Rogge is so lascivious, I think ......With me, maybe he will be satisfied!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly hugged Ajani and couldn't help but burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good sister, don't cry. As soon as you return to the city of the gods, you will leave with Larsfield and return to the Green Sea. As for I, this is already the case, before I return to the city of the gods, I will try to entangle him and please him. You see, my sister is still very beautiful, very smart, will make him satisfied!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind's crying is even louder, and Ajani can't help but cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the reasons for the pain are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind broke into the house from the window, almost freezing the wind butterfly! She tightened her clothes and fell tired on the bed, but she couldn't sleep, and her big eyes stared at the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Rogge is also completely sleepless. He had just smashed a Necrotic bee and a Necromancer with a silent spirit, but he did not disturb Ajani in his arms. The fat man is no stranger to the strange subordinates. However, the gray-clothed girl who had never seen it after a glimpse of a glimpse made him difficult to let go. This mysterious, beautiful and incredibly stepping into the sanctuary has become Rogge's biggest concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly measured the strength of the party, and felt that if there is *** to help, the two should not be weaker than the mysterious woman. He finally made up his mind that when things are a little slower, you must go to the outside world to see you once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani’s naked back suddenly shivered. Rogge pulled her over and saw that her tears had not been wiped off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Baby, what's wrong, who is bullying you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani slowly shakes Shaking his head, whispered: "The adult thinks that I am sorry for the wind butterfly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "Do not worry, it is not necessarily effective! Besides, I will definitely love her, haha! Baby, don't be sad, you didn't say, can you go to hell for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Ah..." Ajani sighed innocently. She crouched in Rogge's arms and fell asleep again. She was so happy that she didn't know how long it would last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sleeping Ajani, Rogge suddenly felt a warm feeling. Anyway, there is no drowsiness, he repeatedly considers the future action plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night came again, the big men who had been carnival all night last night got out of bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos is pulling Rogge in the courtyard, telling the story of Dan Luo’s loss, and the face of the frosty butterfly is just right After that, I stared at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos said half of the words immediately disappeared, stunned at the back of the wind butterfly, until Rogge took a shot, he Only slowed down. He looked at Rogge and his face was red. Although it is not the first time to see the wind butterfly, but every time it is inevitable to be out of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the wind butterfly is able to shock the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge fell a bit like this future heir to the throne. In addition to the common problems of the arrogant and timid, these nobles have no common mentality, and can be regarded as a very good person, especially compared with fat people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the attendant came to inform: "His Royal Carlos, Miss Auntie came to see you!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos and Rogge look at each other, who is looking at the aunt, naturally needless to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, there was a crisp smile at the gate, and the graceful appearance of the costumed aunt appeared at the gate. Her watery eyes were intentional. Unintentionally, it is all about Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear sister, you are not afraid to come to see my brother!" Carlos laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie’s eyes flow, Jiao smiled: "What is going on, you have to be the heir to the throne, how can I not go straight to the flattering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just have to shoot the big magician's flattering, I will never offend you anymore! Well, I am going to try the newly sent hunting horse. "In the laughter of Carlos, Yang went and left Auntie and Rogge aside." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie was so angry that he stumbled and angered: "There are people who are almost thirty, still so noisy!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has a dream come true for many years, and it is normal to be happy." Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just said that I said, I should..." Auntie looked down and sneaked at Rogge.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I can meet with the beautiful and noble Auntie, I am honored that I am right! I specially prepared a small gift for you. I don't know if you like it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie took a look and immediately screamed and shouted!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog In the palm of my hand is a ruby ​​necklace, and the soft radiance of the gemstones flashes the eyes of her aunt and her heart!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewelry for women The power is endless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it for me? "Auntie is so excited that she can't breathe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I will help you wear it and see if you can deserve your beauty." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie became incomparably gentle and obedient. After Rogge put on her necklace, her hands fell and she took her waist and forced her. Auntie snorted and fell softly in Rogge's arms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge picked her up and strode back to the room Auntie eats and laughs, and the eyebrows are full of style...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a month of careful preparation, Dresden enters a grand carnival. Crick's grand justice announced the change of Carlos as the heir. It is striking that Rogge will take over the position of the court magician and be sealed by the Earl. The seal is the smaller town of Sayi and the surrounding area. In order to get rid of Rogge, the Grand Duke of Tikke can be said to have enough money.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute between Ayre Principality and the sudden emergence of a big magician Throughout the Holy Alliance, the monarchs of all countries smelled a disturbing taste.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden increase in the Ayre Principality A great magician and hundreds of extremely embarrassed and elf warriors, the national ranks in the Holy Alliance immediately increased several positions. In order to find out the realities of the Ayre Principality, all countries sent a large mission to attend the reform. The ceremony of the heir to the throne.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know that the crazy old man of Tikick suddenly has a good hand in his hand?<br />< On the day of the ceremony, Dresden has been decorated. The Grand Duchy is almost overcrowded, and the embassy of the nations is swaying, and the food is sprinkled with savory food. The most interesting thing is the experience of this great magician with the Elf Guardian, but unfortunately no one knows his origins.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, about Rogge The rumors of the experience are flying all over the world. The envoys of all countries are looking for opportunities, and they want to bring this great magician to their own country, and they have to try to destroy the similar plots of other countries. In the scarlet wine, the shining gems and Between gold chest buckles, 谣The temptations and conspiracy are quietly circulating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the surprise and extreme disappointment of all the envoys is that Grand Dukewick announced the change of Carlos as the heir to the throne. After that, he once again stood on the high platform and announced loudly: "Under, I will announce another good news!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is quiet in the hall, everyone is waiting for this sudden good news.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Tikick is very satisfied with this effect. It seems that after Rogge served as the court magician, the honors of the national envoys have improved a lot! Now Dagong has completely forgotten the waste of Gennawala. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great magician, Mr. Rogge, and my most beautiful daughter, Auntie, are already engaged! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news immediately caused the national envoys to explode.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trickie Grand Duke Originally, he was somewhat wary of the powerful Rogge, but the rich Rogge obviously would not love the money. Every big magician would not be short of money, just the ruby ​​necklace he gave to Auntie was worth a lot. Dagong also worried that Rogge would have ambitions, but now he is engaged to aunt and is now a family member. In the aristocratic tradition, the alliance based on marriage and blood is the most sacred and firm. If Rogge and Auntie can have offspring earlier, then Grand Duke will not have to worry any more.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Dagong looks The following countries are respectful and respectful, and their hearts are happy. It is hard to describe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is wearing a dark green dress. Make today's fat man magnificent, behave calmly, and naturally have a majesty. In an evening gown The nephew is also glamorous, and the huge ruby ​​lies quietly on her snow-white high-rise chest muscles, attracting the attention of countless men. The man does not know whether he is looking at the gems, or is looking at the high chest, deep cleavage The eyes of the nobles are mixed with envy and jealousy. They know that although they know that they can't compare with the aunts, they may have the chance to be lovers with the great magician. Unexpectedly, I heard that the great magician Rogge is not a good man!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
