You dare to lie to me! Is this method useful?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the memory of Wind Butterfly, the voice of Hughes is always from the tolerance, this time is no exception: "Of course! Instant movement is to rely on tearing the space barrier to achieve two points. The most powerful part of the divine power is the order and time. With the power of the mighty divine power, the power of this magical array can completely restore a small amount of disordered space, although not much, but if If someone in the nearby space is moving in an instant, the bit of space that is restored is fatal! It is a trivial matter to be randomly transmitted, and they are likely to be sealed in other spatial planes that pass through the transmission process! There has been a range of disturbances. What did Xiusi promise you? When is it not counted?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an irrepressible anger in Rogge’s voice:" Dear Ess, Elder, I am absolutely not in the mood to make a joke. This demon The array is really amazing, and many of the parts are more my imagination. But Elder Chess, you know that I am a Necromancer, do you think I have divine power to drive this magical array?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not!" Hughes laughed. "But what can I do when I am doing things? Is there a magical array that can absorb and store a lot of divine power. With your magic It should be possible to maintain a magical array of this magical array for a long time, but one of the most outstanding crystallizations of the ancient magical civilization of the elves! Such a powerful function, even as long as such a low magical power is maintained, even I can’t help but want to be a magician. In the glory days of the elves, this magical array is the key to the number of elves' great magicians far from other races! With the support of abundant magic, the realization and use of magic is naturally much faster." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows the great value of this elf magic array, although it has lost erosion, but for him, there is this magic array as compensation, maybe not eating A big loss. In comparison, the magical array that interferes with the instantaneous movement is also very wonderful, but it is far from being comparable to this magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Rogge suddenly smiled: "The sacred power required to drive the magical array that interferes with the moment of movement is very large, and the elders of Xius, you let me be in the moment." Where do you go to find so many divine powers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes thought about it: "This is a problem. It was originally a ritual of the temple's rituals. It takes more than three days to extract. But when they are no longer pure, the divine attributes have disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue looks at the elders of Sousse, you If you have anything, just say it. Anyway, I have fallen into your palm, what are you afraid of? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I am afraid of it," said Xiusi. "This 10,000 elf is not only your burden, but also the hostage in your hands." You said that I dare not help you, think about it! Magic and vindictiveness are all kinds of energy. Although the vindictive effect of the sacred attribute is almost the same, it can also drive this magical array. The room for such a choice is much larger. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally couldn’t resist the anger in his heart, and passed through Hughes, yelling: "In this place where the North is a thousand miles away, except for the temple." Beyond those three, I have not seen anyone with a sacred attribute yet! Did you introduce me to a few? I was able to fight at least with the power of erosion. Now that you erased my erosion, I told me to let me find someone with a sacred attribute. ! Elder Chess, I repeat it again, I am not kidding! Old things, I tell you, 10,000 elves are not only my burden, but also the pledge in my hands! If this is not a satisfactory result, I would like to see how many elves can escape back to the Central Mountains! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes, a smile, and a light man can’t hold back! Of course, I know that I am old, and I dare to take such a big risk. You must not dismantle my old bones?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Shusi..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, I know, you are absolutely no joke now. The last time you were in the Green Sea, you were not around. A very beautiful female swordsman, called An Ni Ni, half of her sacred attributes are very strong, the history is harmful! If my old man does not spend his eyes, she should be a 16th-level swordsman. It’s already as powerful as my old man!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet! ? Rogge whispered: "Androni is gone, where can I go to find her!" Old guy, give me all the high-level killers in your Darkmoon tribe! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do with so many killers?" Can't Raphael? The killer is not just looking at the quantity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is almost roaring: "I am going to church robbers and Templars!" There are still many low-level clerics in the Holy Alliance, and I will rob them all! do you understand! Give me all the killers! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why rob the church? This will cause public outrage! "Sius asked inexplicably: "Androni is now in the room of your temple. What are you going to do to rob the church?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about? "Rogue can hardly believe his ears.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said Androni is now in your room..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did the old man fool you?" She arrived only yesterday! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at Hughes, slowly saying: "Hughes, my patience is limited." You have been maintaining the magic array for the past three days. How can you know that she has arrived? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a 400-year-old killer. The killer naturally has a killer." Are you interested in being a killer? I can guarantee that the killer world is absolutely no less than the magician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet finished, Rogge has opened the door and rushed Go out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly outside the door was shocked and hurriedly followed Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes called twice, but Rogge did not hear it at all, and the figure had long since disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Elder sighed and said to himself: Light man It’s just that you can’t hold your breath. The little beauty magician who is with Androni is not that good. There are already a few elders who have suffered too much. If you hit it like this, you can’t fall into the paradise. Going? Hey, my oldest man is the most wise, just looking for an excuse to hide for three days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tired and tired Rogge rushed into the wind The Temple of the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian elves just wanted to block, and they were pushed to the sides. They saw the wind butterflies that followed, and they knew that the people who had just rushed in were God-giving adults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes adults, be careful!..." Their kind reminders are obviously in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in front of his own door, Rogge instinctively smelled a dangerous atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know why Androni would come back so happily, but he didn’t care so much. Her sacred attribute is the most important thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge carefully pushed the door open, everything in it was like when he left, how can he have a half-personal shadow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s anger in his heart, it seems to be cheated by the old guy of Xiusi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed into the room, but felt that the foreground was fluctuating. Rogge, who often travels to and from the outside world, is extremely sensitive to space fluctuations. He immediately knows that he has already entered another space just at that moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a darkness around, and the wind is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been running around for a long time. Now his magic and mental strength are only a little and a half. He suddenly falls into an unknown space, and luck is really bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly also caught up in front of the door, she only saw Rogge rushed into the room, then the space fluctuated, Rogge disappeared, the door The scenery has completely changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly was shocked and stayed there for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a crisp voice in the room, obviously impatient: "I thought that after a few old guys had suffered, the elves should be smart." How come there is a daredevil rushing in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another lazy soft voice sounded: "Take it! Let them suffer a bit! Anyway The elf who dares to rush in will not be able to cope with the 50 new wolves we have caught?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous voice suddenly said: "There are people outside the door. It’s so smart, I know I shouldn’t be chaotic. Come in, it’s okay now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is in the room, actually casually Rogge Deceived into the trap? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly took a deep breath and took out the long sword, eagerly raised the vindictiveness and stepped into the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand in the hall leans against a maroon-short swordsman costume, and a long sword with a light blue flame is free to be placed at hand. . Sitting on the other side of the sand is a female magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is very powerful, it is actually fourteen..." The swordsman turned his head in surprise and saw the face of the butterfly, and immediately stayed. For a moment, all that was said was forgotten.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people were shocked at the moment when they saw each other. For a while, The air in the room seems to be a little solidified.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of extraordinary people has always been one of the proud sources of wind butterfly, but the beautiful face of the female magician does not seem to be To her, the wind butterfly is unbelievable, and there will be such a beautiful person in the human race.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allure is good, the wind butterfly is hard to imagine, the man will So... so beautiful and seductive!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful things have always been a little bit of a killing power for the elves. Looking at the flames of the male swordsman burning in the eyes, the wind The heart of the butterfly couldn’t help but jump a few times!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the swordsman, she suddenly had There is a mysterious fear, and there is a trace of emperor in fear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courage and confidence of Fengdie’s first entry suddenly disappeared, and I didn’t know where to fly. . <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the two men fled to the north of what Andrew Luoni and Fu Luoya <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp They have long known the beauty of the elves, but the beauty of the wind butterfly seems to belong to the world at all. Anderney’s eyes are getting brighter and brighter, she brushed her back and put up the long legs that are raised high, and lifted the stars. Then, I went to the wind butterfly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly was shocked and quickly gathered, and the wheel saw slanted to Androni.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni chuckled, the vindictiveness rose sharply, the blue flame flourished, and then retracted, condensing into a real blue flame.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly was shocked, only 16 levels of vindictiveness can be condensed into a real flame. This beautifully over-exposed swordsman is actually the same level as the Elder Sisters?<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp; wind butterfly immediately has a heart of war, this unidentified swordsman strength is outrageous, who is her opponent? Moreover, at a glance, the sword in the other hand is not sheathed, but the faint pressure is obviously not a product, far from the wheel saw in his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly has just opened its mouth and is ready to call for help. Suddenly the blue light flashed in front of her eyes, and the tip of the starry sky has already reached her nose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two blue and green figures are chasing in the room quickly and incomparably! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are known for their agility, and Androni’s swordsmanship is also a path of gloom and gloom. The figures of the two are lightning fast, that is, Fulu Ya can only barely see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled and tightened the wind butterfly, and extended a hand to touch her face. The wind butterfly was shy and angry, and her little face rose red, and she was anxious to cry out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, don't make trouble! The people who just broke into the paradise have killed all the wolves, and are hitting the enchantment I set! He is about to rush out!" Fu Luoya suddenly exclaimed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni immediately threw the wind butterfly on the sand, and the starry sky has been squirted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is a wave of fluctuations, just like a mirror suddenly burst. Rogge, who had a silvery glow in his eyes, crossed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flashing, dangerous and incomprehensible blue light made Rogge overjoyed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog Xun retreats, and the tip of the starry sky is always a foot away from his throat. Androni intends to prescribe this person first, she does not want to kill in the city of the elf. Moreover, this time, I have another purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she had a flower in front of her eyes, and Rogge’s degree suddenly doubled, and her attack range flashed. Androni was shocked, and the stars were shining, ready to fight this terrible opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Androni! Stop! It's me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar call Droni stopped the offensive. She looked at it for a long time before she recognized that the man with a beard and black eyes was Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Rogge, there is an unspeakable ecstasy, some shouting in disbelief: "Androni! Really you! How come you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Roger as if he was like a fool, Androni's face was reddish, a little shy, and a little happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for her answer, Rogge would not come from the resort! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is flickering. In the rumor, countless lightnings flew from the hands of Froya to Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic shield’s light can’t keep flashing, but after running around, Rogge, who was killed in Paradise Lost, is no longer the opponent of Froya. The magic is exhausted and hit by more than ten lightning bolts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, who was covered with a small electric fire, climbed up from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A soft voice rang in his ear, and the horror memory connected to this voice immediately rushed into the heart of Rogge, and he could not help but shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Rogge! I haven't seen you for so long, seeing you lie to God, but there is nothing to grow up!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned and smiled, and he calmed down from the joy of seeing Androni. In front of the Fulua Qingli as always, just a little bit of sang and melancholy in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess! How come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does this mean? ?小罗格! You have this unconscionable thing, so people are so worried about you! You see, I am throwing home and doing business, it is easy to run to this snow and ice place? It is not to see you without conscience. One thing at a glance? You not only sneak into the deep forests, but also take care of yourself as a god. You can’t say such a beautiful elf in your hand. Now it’s hard to see you. Only Anne is in your eyes! You are worthy of me. Infatuated?" Fu Luoya's crisp voice is very fast, talking and talking, the eyes are reddish, it seems to drop tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is stunned, this little goblin will also have a heart? ! He screamed a few times, but he was too confused to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-hour martial arts, he tried to squeeze out a sentence: "First eat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one click, Androni couldn't help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves’ dishes have always been beautiful and light. But the atmosphere at the dinner table is very strange at this moment, and it is not a meal time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time when the Bavarian Grand Duke declared war on the Rhine Union, everyone in the entire Rhine Union knew the outcome of this battlefield. Although there are two great magisters in the party, how can it confront hundreds of bright masters in the entire Guangming Church? Moreover, Juggernaut Prossis is also on the side of the Principality, and the two great magisters must retain a considerable amount of magic to defend their own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the Principality is like a cloud, although the strength is not too much, but the elite knights emerge one by one, the Rhine League is good at the famous Most of the time, with the Duke of Roscio, he voted on the side of the Principality. Even if there is no light church to help, the fate of the Rhine League's defeat is unchangeable, let alone the blood angel Augustus of Megatron 6 also led the Holy Knights to be eager to move? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Dero empire once again proposed to send troops on the condition of Froya, the Rhine League rushed to the top and grabbed the last straw. Louis IX was afraid of the resurgence of the family's reluctant Fu Luoya, and discussed with the ministers, and was prepared to take Fu Luoya down, and then secretly sent to the Three Emperors of the Dro Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke Russell who participated in the resolution was deeply dissatisfied with the decision of Louis IX. He quietly revealed the news to Froya. Froya, who wanted to defend the dignity of the Bourbon dynasty with a bloody blood, finally realized her innocence. She broke her heart and made up her mind to escape to the city of Rydney with Androni overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have their own concerns, but going to the north to find Rogge has become their tacit understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni still remembers the location of the Green Sea, and the countless elf girls in the Green Sea also remember this unparalleled blue swordsman. They successfully entered the Green Sea and also heard about the whereabouts of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Androni and Froja, snow, cold and warcraft are not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two beautiful women are like a mountain of water to find the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl in the city of God knows more about Androni. Androni was originally a personal guardian of God. Froya even claimed to be Rogge's wife. Their special status made them settle in the room of the temple Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria couldn’t stand the loneliness, and there were countless traps in Rogge’s room with artifacts, and the elders of the visiting elders ate a lot. suffering. However, since the two are the subordinates and wives of the gods, the elders did not dare to offend. Moreover, the elves are naturally not resistant to beautiful things, and there is nothing wrong with the place where they are offended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge forced himself not to look at Androni, but often couldn’t help but glance at it, always showing the joy of not stopping. It was not difficult to deceive Androni to give a sacred vindictiveness, but now Flora is also there. Wherever there is this little goblin, Rogge has become accustomed to everything that has been repeatedly martyrdom. She will certainly ask why she needs Androni's sacred vindictiveness, and the great value of the elf magical array can be seen at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the existence of *** is Rogge's biggest secret, and he is never willing to let anyone know about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is very worried, just thinking about how to open Froja, and Chad Androni gives a sacred temper. Beside him, his ‘wife’ Froya was picking on the food while talking about a bunch of sloppy words about Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is very quiet, she is angry, shy, and somewhat hilarious. She still can't accept the facts of Rogge, half of it is out of anger, and half is out of special cleansing. If it is not for the sake of being able to see the mysterious side, she is never willing to look at the fat man. However, Froya is a beautiful woman, and the wind butterfly is even more beautiful. In the eyes of Rogge, it seems that they completely look at the two of them in the same thing, but they can’t help but sneak into themselves. The color of the eyes is barely visible. ! Androni's heart is a little smug, and there are some sneak peeks that he does not want to admit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has also been figuring out how to make Froya open, so that she can secretly ask the fat man about the skull dragon, maybe Rogge still knows Some news about ***! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly sits at the other end of the table, and does not know what it is, and it is uncomfortable. She now knows that Androni is actually a daughter, but she thinks of the strange behavior she had just caught herself, the burning flame in the eyes that she occasionally saw, and her thoughts about what she did when she was in the Green Sea. Can not help but some strange fears. There is still a layer of melancholy in her heart, and the beauty of Androni and Froya is gone. They are also powerful in the imagination of the wind butterfly! Seeing the color of Rogge 'wife' Fu Luoya, the wind butterfly finally realized that why Rogge, who seems to be lascivious, can put himself for so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Fu Luoya seemed to talk and laugh as usual, and kept teasing Rogge, but the anger in her heart was gradually rising! The more she is certain, the girl in Androni’s heart must be related to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This peculiar meal is finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Androni gave each other a look, and found an excuse to walk outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Androni, I have something to ask you, but it’s not very convenient now..." Rogge hurriedly lowered his voice, he was so excited Pickpockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also have something to ask you...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't say the name 'Froya'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's tonight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, three will be better I am not familiar with this place, you will wait for me outside the door..." Androni’s voice is as detailed as a mosquito. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them agreed to return to the room, and under the gaze of Furo Alum, Rogge did not have anything like that, Andro Nie turned her gaze with some guilty conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is quiet, the moon is rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quiet winter night is the best time to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint moonlight falls through the velvet curtains in the large bedroom, and everything in the room is coated with a layer of silver-blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two great beauty sleeping on the unusually large bed. Everything is so serene, quiet, and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya turned over in a confused way, his mouth still muttering: "Dead fat! You give me a stop..." and then sink again I went to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni also seems to sleep very well, breathing fine and even, but people, like no bones, quietly walk through the quilt, Sliding down the floor from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is like a ghost, quietly out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s toes are slightly on the ground, and the whole person is sliding on the ice and moving silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the gallery, Rogge has been waiting there. Seeing Androni, he said nothing, turned and walked up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two came to the top of the temple, and Rogge walked out of the window, and in the eyes of Androni’s astonishment, fluttered up the roof . She couldn't help but re-estimate the strength of Rogge, but what she cares most about at the moment is not the strength of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just stood, Androni appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still wearing a silk-embroidered nightdress, and the large skin at the arms and chest is exposed. The cold night wind swayed her nightdress, showing her proud figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the night, Rogge habitually lifted his mental power, and the faint silver light in his eyes almost saw Androni’s thin nightdress. Under the nightdress, Androni was not in the air, and the dress fluttered, and the blush at the chest was looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment, both of them have their own concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Androni," Rogge whispered, and as he turned around, he suddenly changed his mouth: "What are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or let me talk about it first!" Androni’s voice is also as fine as a mosquito, she is very strange, she is deliberately dressed like this, this luscious fat man It’s just that you’re in a big mess, so you can squeeze out what you want from this extremely slippery fat man’s mouth. But his own looming body, he turned a blind eye! In the winter nights of the North, the wind on the roof is cold, but for them, it has no effect at all. He will never lose because of the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge thought and knew that the situation of me and the elf in the north was very difficult. I need your help. I want to know if our original agreement is still possible? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was shocked and lost his voice: "Do you mean using the marriage exchange to kill the Roscio family?" Dreaming of you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly smiled, and the momentary charm made Roger's heartbeat stop. "Froya doesn't call her every day, is it your wife?" You missed her! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger smiles and dares to provoke her! But I really need your help, and I know that I am asking for the price, then you talk about yours." Conditions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is a little puzzled, slightly wrinkled eyebrows come to you this time, in fact, it is not good to listen, is to come to you of. The war between the Alliance and the Principality has exploded, and we have been unable to stay in the South. Since it is coming to you, it will naturally help you. Do you need such a serious thing? There must be something else to pretend to be a good person! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked seriously at Androni: "I am serious!" It’s not enough for you to help me and help me! What I need is that you can listen to my orders and act according to my plan. It is the subordinate's obedience order to the superior! Only in this way can we really wave the strength of both of you! If you can help me, let my elves get a foothold in the North, and if this is the case, you will not have to marry me, I will also play for the Rocherio family for three years. what do you think? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at Luo plaid inexplicably, your god is a fake! You won’t be addicted, give it to you. Forgot it? Now that you have swindled more than 10,000 elves to the north, you sold it, and it’s your style to count the money! This is not a small amount!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger sighed a sigh..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the fat man changed his name, Androni’s eyebrows pick one But did not say anything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pursuit of power and wealth will never end. After experiencing so many things, I have already seen it lightly. "Rog's voice reveals the unspeakable Cang Sang: "Where is there a completely ruthless person in the world?" At the beginning of getting along with the elves, I am like you said, I plan to sell them to get the money, but now I can't do it! I really want these sprites to have a space for survival. How difficult it is for the elves to live peacefully in human society, I think you are also clear. I am stupid, and I will do this kind of thing that is totally unhelpful to myself! You want to laugh and laugh, I can't help it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly moved a little inexplicably, and she gently patted Rogge's shoulder: "I also like the elf." Don't worry, we will help you. Fu Luoya, she will listen to me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly raised his head, and the color was unmistakable. He immediately said: "The marriage contract..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is so angry and funny, shouted: "We are married!" Again, I am careful to cut this matter! Or is it that you are getting better now, and you are not afraid of my blue sky? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will face me all the time, I will help you, but it is not a white gang! I ask you one thing, you have to answer honestly!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Roger’s strange gaze, Androni’s heart floated again with the woman in gray robes, black and silver. She is so tyrannical, overbearing, arrogant, mysterious, and so beautiful, beautiful as a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s heartbeat was unstoppable, and a touch of shyness creeped up on her cheek, like a burning cloud of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she is very frightened! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge..." Androni eats authentically: "You remember the one that pretend to be God, the one you summoned... the skull Dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Androni was so solemn and so shy to ask Gregory, Rogge only felt a whirl! She has a quirk, but in any case, Rogge can't imagine, she will ask questions like this, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the fat man calms down the kung fu group. He fixed his mind and replied: "The skull dragon is sealed by me. Now I can summon it through the contract. What happened?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
