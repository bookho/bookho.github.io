			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Heavenly Chapter 17 Blood Curse in Hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire of the majesty on weekdays The prime minister is more like a helpless old man at the moment. He rushed in. Rogge certainly won't move for him. Straw can not succumb to the empire for decades, and if he still can't act, there will be few people who can play in the entire continent. Rogge’s face was unbearable, and he was thinking about whether he was taking time to give him a hand, and solved this affliction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when you think of the strange rules of the inner struggle of the empire, if the fat man kills Straw, it is rebellion. Rogge still doesn't want to oppose it, and he doesn't want to rebel in the future, so he will suppress the murder in his heart. But the dagger in his hand is still pointing at the woman in black. Under the red mans, the Soviets did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Straw rushed in, he saw Serena in Rogge’s arms, and immediately trembled: "Yes... Serena? She... ...is she still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said coldly: "It’s not bad, at least better than me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected by Straw, Rogge put Serena’s great bargaining chip on the ground, and then took a picture on her ass and said, “Don’t pretend to be unconscious. Go home!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celena screamed, her face flushed, standing in the same place, and she was at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strauch untied his robe and threw it on Serena’s body, wrapped her whole, and then gentled it without any objection: “To Rest in your room!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, it is a miracle that Serena can return from the abyss world, and Straw is ecstatic. For other small regrets, you can turn a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Rogge came out completely red, and the pieces of Serena’s body have almost no cover, what happened, just a look It is known. Then contact Luo Geping's reputation, Straw is more convinced of his judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Straw, my daughter has returned it to you. I will leave. As for the rest of the accounts between us, I will naturally take a careful look. Come to liquidate with you." Rogge dropped a few cold words. Just want to step up and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Straw called Rogge and said, "Don't you think you should stay and talk about it? Maybe we can find a couple." Can you accept the place to talk? In the empire, there is nothing politically impossible to negotiate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled lightly, "Damocles The sword is still in the abyss world behind me. It will not take long for an abyssal lord to lead countless Bata devils from here to conquer the world! You are not busy solving problems in your own home, follow me Is there anything to talk about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve’s face changed dramatically! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen Rogge and Serena miraculously return from the abyss. There is still a last line of luck in Straw’s heart. But now, he can only watch Rogyang grow away, and for a time, he is ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge jumped out of the high wall of Xiangfu, just fell to the ground, and Serafi appeared behind him like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This dagger is good!" Serrafi praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is expressionless, still striding forward, plain and faint: "That sword is better!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, the abyss lord itself is the most valuable." Serrafi's words tonight are very good for Rogge's spleen. However, he was angry and he would never give her a good look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The land is worth the money, but I really don't know how to turn an abyssal lord into money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, of course, is to crack the curse that is under me! Is it really letting it out? Is it going to let it go, will it let me go? Will it really give me rights, strength and territory? Even if it is willing, what do I want in a territory with only fire elements, servants and demons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the curse is triggered. I also have a chance to beat it." Rogge suddenly stopped and stared at Serrafi: "My magician is fat and tender, but I have never given a certain servant." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi was furious and shouted: "Are you looking for death? Without my help, you have already died in the abyss world. Come Don't want to see the face of the abyss lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge does not give back to the earth: "If everything depends on you, sometimes there is no kind of help." I will die on this place one day sooner or later. The difference between death and death is not big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraffy suddenly smiled softly: "You thought That is really an abyss lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and asked: "What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi did not answer, but lazily said: "You just discussed Serena as a sacrifice in front of Casinaras. The last few words deliberately wake her up. The despicable intentions of the middle, I have to lie to this ignorant little girl. Want to marry me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue's tricks were dismantled on the spot, but his face Thick, really non-Serrafi can be expected. The fat man actually said: "Don't you look at her? If not, then don't bother me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Serrafi is really angry Then, she almost stabbed a few swords on Rogge, or at least kicked a few feet. However, Rogge held his hand and stood up, and the role of you was beaten, but the fat face of the board clearly showed that it would never yield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light angels who are able to traverse the major planes, and the rogue means of taking fat at one time have no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraffy finally squeezed out a sentence: "You should find a piece of clothing to wear it first! You are fat, which plane is not good looking." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog snorted and turned and walked forward. He took a road that was not extinguished, and apparently there had been a fierce battle. Although the fat man has gone through hardships in the abyss world, he discovered that this affluent night has not yet finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not look at the foot, whether it is broken bricks, or the wall of the fire, all the way through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of him suddenly jumped out of a swordsman, he shook his sword. Dad said: "Who is in front!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge did not answer, stepped forward, the dagger flicked, and already broke his throat. Then Rogge stripped his coat and put it on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi frowned: "Who is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stroud Soldier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brushing, Serrafi’s cross sword has been on Rogge’s throat, her voice is already cold like ice: Don't think I don't dare to kill you! Tell you. I have never been patient. If you want to try to challenge it again, then take a step forward and see if my sword will be recovered!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog snorted and did not hesitate to step! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a big step back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi was crying and laughing, and finally laughed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the lord of the abyss?" Rogge took the initiative to ask for advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Serafi could not see any flaws in Rogge, he knew that his attitude was changing rapidly and there must be problems. But now is not the time to care about these places, she now briefly describes what I saw in the abyss world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her field of insight. Everything from Casinalas is invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most powerful devils in the Abyss of Bata, the lava lord Casa Boriongado, broke through the blockade of multiple planes with extreme horror A small part of his own consciousness projected to this plane, thus forming the devil lord Cassinaras faced by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the further growth of its power. It opened up a separate space for itself, reconstructed the lava world in space, and created a projection in accordance with the lava lord. It could not help but extend this space to the abyssal world, trying to become a channel connecting the two worlds. But the great demon of the Barto Abyss world is almost the public enemy of all non-evil creatures and half-evil creatures. An unknown alien strong presence has occasionally discovered the existence of this space. After a thrilling battle, the newly formed lava Almost all of the world was destroyed. This small part of the consciousness lost contact with the lava lord and could only hide and rely on its own strength to slowly recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Casinaras itself is not an entity at all, nor is it an abyss lord. It is just a phantom based on the growth of a small part of the lava lord's consciousness. And it has been completely shaped in the abyss projection. Since then, he has lost the ability to return to the sword of Lord Moklis, and can only control several very powerful field abilities on the Great Sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time. The sword of Damocles gradually comes with a legend that if the demons that are closely related to the sword are pleased, the power of this sword is enough to destroy an army! If you anger the devil, then it is just a sharp sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a sword of Damocles returned to the hands of Casinaras, and the consciousness of a little lava lord attached to the sword would be with Cassie. Naras is one and becomes a truly complete consciousness! In the long years, it has absorbed the blood of tens of millions of sacrifices. In fact, there are no 10,000 offerings provided by Rogge, and Cassinaras, who has gained full consciousness, is at most a few days from the projection world. The middle straddles the material plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, although the lava lord personally crossed the countless planes and the plan to fall into this world went bankrupt, but a Casinaras whose strength surpassed the great devil is enough Destroy the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why do you still have to watch the sword of Damocles fall into its hands?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casinaras in an incomplete state is just a consciousness, it cannot be destroyed in the abyss projection. But after getting the sword of Damocles It will be quickly materialized and materialized. At that time, it will definitely go out of the Batu Abyss projection and come to the material world. Hey! If I don't let it come out from there, how can I kill it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is thinking in his heart, thinking and saying: "Well, you can kill an abyss lord, equivalent to killing a dozen demons, or equivalent In the dozen or so most powerful dragons, that is to say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi angered: "I have already said that it is not an abyss lord at all. The degree of evil like the lava lord, the only god in the heavens who is fighting the priesthood is likely to defeat it in the environment of the Bata Abyss! It is at most a little stronger than the ordinary big devil, as long as it is out of the lava world, it It may not be my opponent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is very respectful and asks: ? It sounds like you are not quite sure why some confidence that it can kill it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Sela Fei snorted, did not answer this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly realized, "Yes, there is the goddess O'Reilly! It turns out that you plan to go together! But O'Reilly is not already Has it been a baby?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When she needs it, she can show up directly." Serrafi looked at Rogge, who was cold and cold. The tone suddenly became gentle. She said: "You already know the origins of Casinaras. Now come over and tell me the details of O'Reilly's details on the same day and give me a little bit of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi’s eyes are bright and her heart beats faster. She has fully felt that it’s so happy to talk about others and inquire about the secrets of ulterior motives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at her and said: "You are a strange servant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lafite's face is complete, and the color is correct: "My belief in Audrey is as devout as you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge understands now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his voice very low, forcing Serrafi to stay close to be audible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing that God can't use the spirit to fluctuate, in the case of fat people, this is common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
