How could their sneak attack troops escape the dragon's eyes flying in the sky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge took a deep look Wallace, whispered: "So this time the war, what we have to do is to level up ... dare to block everything in front of the goddess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , Solato City should usher in another sunny morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the distant sky is swept away at an incredible speed. Projected on the earth, the boundary between shadow and light is clear. This light and dark dividing line quickly swept across the ground, expelling all the sun and warmth from the city of Solatu, and driving all hope out of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Fernandez stood at the head of the city. The hand that he held in his hand was not a crystal cup, but a hilt with a sword. It’s just that his dark black dress is out of tune with the soldiers’ armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks up at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power that had previously been flying in the thick clouds seemed to disappear in the city of Soratu. The clouds stayed over the city, thicker and thicker, and more and more The lower the drooping, and the center of the city of Solatu, slowly rotates. The wilderness more than ten kilometers away is still sunny. You can see the towering Ampere shining in the background of the blue sky. The green coniferous forest covers the sunny side of the hill. It is like a silent giant guarding the Delaware emperor. The channel of all. But there is no trace of sunlight that can shine into the city of Sorato through the clouds. It seems that the city has not left the city for a long night. The orange light shines through several houses in the vicinity, and it is a warm day. It looks strange and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the lead-gray cloud vortex, Fernandez suddenly felt that the sky was not moving, but the earth was spinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do our reconnaissance cavalry have a return?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been with Fernandes The middle-aged knight replied: "Fernandez, I have sent 15 teams to reconnoiter the cavalry, but ... there is not a team back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This look The voice of the knight who went up to battle was also a little trembling. He is not afraid to see the enemy, but sometimes the unknown is the most terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez just sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sudden hoof came from the city. Immediately, the commander jumped off the horse and rushed to the city at the fastest speed. Breathing: "Adult! The Cavalry of the Chaoshan Legion appeared in the east of the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the commander did not fall, and another commander also galloped Under the city, the cavalry of the Chaoshan Legion also appeared in the south of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two road cavalry are far away from the city, each number is around 5,000. Although they did not mean to attack the city, Fernandes knew that these first cavalry were only to complete the encirclement, and the main force would arrive soon. The advance light ride has reached 10,000 people. It seems that this time, the Chaoshan Legion is going to fight hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fernandez, you still wear the armor!" The middle-aged knight advised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez smiled a bit and said: "If it is necessary for me to fight and kill myself, it means that we have completely lost. So this one, wear no Wearing is the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth began to tremble slightly, and the sky was lit up with smoke and smoke, and there were bursts of low thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the red dust of the sky. Gradually, a piece of steel forest emerged, which was a long gun that the heavy cavalry held high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand ride heavy cavalry in front of the city of Sorato became an assault line, behind them, four thousand followers also hang light armor, holding axe shield , laid out the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged knight on the head of the city is a bit pale. He didn't care about the heavy cavalry under the city, just staring at the horizon in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another, the infantry phalanx stepped out of the red cloud, and this steel torrent seemed to never stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez looked at the flying flag of the center of the army under the city, carefully identified for a long time, did not see which family the badge belongs to. He was not familiar with the Aristocratic aristocratic lineage and turned to the middle-aged knight for help. The Cavaliers watched for a long time, and only saw that the owner of this golden light badge had outstanding achievements and power, except for this. I can't see anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s no longer important to be the leader of the city. The important thing is that it is just the front of the siege, and it has assembled more than 30,000 troops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solato City Defense is sturdy. However, there are only 50,000 people, and there are only 10,000 defenders. However, this is not the main battlefield of the southeastern front of the empire. Therefore, in the past, when the Chaoshan Legion occasionally attacked, it would only have more than 10,000 people at most, and would never rashly attack the Wall High City Solatu. But this time, counting the 10,000 light rides surrounded, the Asrofik Empire has already dispatched 40,000 troops! Moreover, they did not know what means were used, and they had eliminated all the detectives sent by Sorato City, so that Fernandez could not even ask for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez’s sense of smell is sharp, and the signs are not right. He did not think that he would run away immediately. However, the other party has the ability to eliminate all his detectives without any sound. If he leaves the city, he will probably be killed by halfway, but he can't bring too many people. The city owner did not flee before the war, in which country can be the crime of decapitation. The Sortu City defenders are nearly 10,000. In the city of Jian, even if they face three or four times the enemy, they are sure to stick to it. Therefore, it is indeed too risky to escape when the enemy is unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a little hesitant, and the Imperial Army is already besieged! This time Fernandez wanted to escape and could not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We still have a chance!" Fernandez calmed down and shouted at the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 10,000 soldiers stationed in Jiancheng, Fernandez brought a lot of mages when he became the city owner, plus the civilians who helped the war, this land is indeed Have to fight. The Sorato garrison is also a veteran of wars. When they think of this, they have calmed down a lot and their morale has risen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Fernandez immediately asked with the voice of only the middle-aged knight: "Look... can we surrender?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged knight laughed very bitterly and replied with a very low voice: "Fernandez. I am afraid, we have no such opportunity anymore..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Solatu warriors on the city’s head suddenly exclaimed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the center of the Chaoshan Legion, the high-flying flag on both sides of the flag, each raised a banner. The flag fluttering in the wind has no decoration, just a dark red near purple and black! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind swayed the flag, and the whistling whistle was like a hymn to the god of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these two dark red flags were raised, even the soldiers of the empire were stunned. They looked at the two banners with intent. The fundus began to appear in a variety of blood. A sturdy and heavy-duty warrior suddenly hits the shield with a giant axe in his hand, and roars in the sky! In the blink of an eye. It seems that he should be like him, and other imperial warriors are beginning to scream! Even the front row of reloading cavalry is almost screaming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bloody double flag of the Empire Army is on the battlefield, it means not accepting the enemy to surrender, whether it is a warrior or a civilian! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They...to the massacre!" Fernandez grabbed the hand with the sword because it was too hard, and the bones had a blue-and-white color. All the Delaware defenders in the city were involuntarily clenching their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez slammed out the sword and shouted: "Come on! The whole city mobilizes. Pull all the active people out to defend the city! Today, We are not rushing these Asropiecs to go home!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez is super confident on the surface, but his heart is terrified, he The middle-aged knight looked away, the loyal, long-time battle veteran pale, and his eyes were as worried as he was. The emperor’s rise to the bloody double flag before the siege will inevitably force all the soldiers and civilians in the city to fight blood. There are only two reasons why they do this. One is that the commander is a full-fledged fool. The other is that they have absolute certainty to kill all the creatures in the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant empire army suddenly quieted down and fluttered the war. Strode out of a heavy warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not tall, but the armor on his body is so thick that he will leave a deep in the red clay wasteland every step forward. Footprints. The samurai carries a tomahawk in his hand. This looks like a heavy axe with at least thirty or forty kilograms in his hand, like no weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reloaded warrior stopped walking until he was five hundred meters below the city, and looked up at the defenders on the city. Although Fernandez couldn't see the face of the samurai hiding under the full-faced helmet, he felt completely cold in the eyes behind the helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a cry, a magician on the head of the city couldn’t help but seduce and fired a fireball at the reloading warrior. The reloaded warrior suddenly had a very pale silver ray, and he raised his axe high and looked coldly at the fireball that was flying closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fireball is close. The reloaded warrior suddenly shouted. Suddenly picked up the giant axe, and even fired the fireball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fire. He is still standing and unharmed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange and cursing sound on the battlefield, and even many of the soldiers on the head of the city of Solatu were suspicious. It seems that someone is chanting a magic spell, but as soon as he is condensed, nothing can be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse has just stopped, a dark gray, ten meters of clouds appear in the head of the city of Sorato, the magician who just fired the fireball together with the surrounding soldiers They are all enveloped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a terrible look on the face of the Master. He was convulsing, his eyes were prominent, his mouth was screaming, but his voice could not be heard. It seems that something is blocking his throat. The mage tried to cover his neck with both hands, but his face was quickly defeated. Finally, the wizard fell softly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he fell, he was like a dead body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog is rolling and condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers in the fog fell one after another, only a few wary soldiers on the edge of the fog fled the fog in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this is...the fog of death!" Fernandez couldn't help but sneak up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big magician under the city! It seems that this is the trump card that the emperor relies on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez must find a way to kill this great wizard. Otherwise, the city of Solatu will break. His eyes were not searching in the army under the city, and he suddenly saw a mysterious black robe man holding a white-bone staff in the Central War. He was chanting a spell. He couldn't help but be surprised again. The black robe mage was nearly a kilometer away from the head of the city of Solatu. He was able to cast a fog of death at this distance, indicating that he must add the ability to increase the range for this magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of magic, obviously has already surpassed those of the original big magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Fernandez to figure out how to deal with this unexpected big magician. The black robe mage's second spell is also finished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground in front of the city of Solatu suddenly slammed! The sturdy and thick red clay could not survive, and the Delaware soldiers on the city’s head could hardly believe their own eyes. But the ground in front of the city is indeed rising! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Terrain changes", the eighth-order magic, has always been known for being extremely difficult to control, and is almost useless in the magic strong matchup, so no one The Magi is willing to spend years of energy to master this magic. So after generations, almost no one in the world can master this magic, and most young wizards have never heard of this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the earth’s thrilling tremor finally came to an end. The ground in front of the city of Solato has risen by fifteen meters, forming a gentle and wide slope that leads straight to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original high wall of the city of Solara has become a smooth road! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the Masters of both sides have begun to suppress each other with magic. The mage on the head of the city accounted for the cheaper range, but the heavy arm of the Imperial Army suddenly separated from the two sides, revealing a row of crazy believers behind him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mad believers are not only far more magical than the Sorento Master, but also have an overwhelming advantage in number, so only two rounds of blasting, has easily taken Solato The mage suppressed it. Every time the Delaware Master shoots a round of attack magic. There will be several times of counterattacks, and even two unlucky magicians will fall into a new fog of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding in the city of Soratu, Rogge passed through the gap in the helmet and looked at the smashing magic in the sky, and suddenly felt very incomprehensible. Thirst! He rubbed his lips, which had almost been cracked, and raised the tomahawk in his hand, pointing slowly to the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him. There was a sound of sullen footsteps! Rogge didn't have to look back and knew that the 10,000-strong reloading infantry was marching in a uniform pace, preparing to open the enemy's flesh and blood with their heavy axes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly felt the heat in his body, and his heartbeat gradually accelerated. His hand clenched the thick axe handle, the blue steel gloves and the giant axe handle could not rub, making a burst of sour voice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really... bloody!" Rogge secretly felt. He can't remember how long it has been without this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge screams, slamming the tomahawk, walking along the path of the sorcerer Elgara with amazement of magic, striding forward to the city go with! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground around Rog suddenly trembled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and saw There is already a horror warrior with a height of two meters and a dark black body. Rogge is a necromancer. I immediately recognized this black warrior from the strong death of the warrior and the eyes of the death flame. However, this black warrior is very ordinary despite his heavy weight and the giant sword in his hand. But somehow, Rogge always felt standing in front of himself. It seems to be a mountain that can only look up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Warrior Emperor?" Rogge was shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has only seen Elgar in the Seven Kings of Death, but from the memory of the Lich, he already knows the appearance of several other kings. Although Rogge has always wondered why the three black robes who are accompanying the goddess have such a strong and pure death, he never imagined that one of them would be the king of the dead world, the black warrior emperor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what about the windy month? What happened to the world of death? Rogge’s heart was very light and extremely trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the black warrior’s eyes, burning in the flames of death, looked at Rogge with indifference and walked slowly toward the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are separated by 20 meters, slowly stepping on the city, looking directly at the city's thousands of defenders as nothing! The falling arrows in the sky can't help Roger's specially reinforced heavy armor, and the Black Warrior emperor has an invisible protection. No arrow can shoot within two meters of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical light flashed on the city, a flame arrow shot at Rogge, and the Black Warrior Emperor was a sharp ice cone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s pace is not changed, and there is a silver light shield in his hand, which easily blocks the flame arrow. The Emperor of the Black Warrior snorted and raised his hand, and an invisible wind rolled up all the ice cones and sent them back to the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a gray fog of death that has taken the lead. Covers the location of the two Delaware Masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at the black warrior emperor and immediately jumped up. Directly into the fog of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, he has flashed from the other side of the fog of death all over the body, with a huge axe in his hand and a cross-legged image. Stop your waist! Rogge smiled, completely ignoring the weapons from all sides, just waving a giant axe, madly slashing! The soldiers of Solatu are flooding. However, it seems to be ramming the sturdy reef. From time to time, the limbs with broken limbs are thrown out. In the face of the fat power of the fat man, their fate is like a splash on the reef, only the crushed fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth shakes again! The large wall of the Sorato swayed and cracked a few huge cracks! The horrible Lich Elgara once again launched his magical attack, this time his goal is a solid high wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the Empire reloaded infantry has set foot on the city! They used heavy shields to resist the enemies in front of them. Then turn the giant axe, no matter the shield is a soldier, a civilian, whether it is a strong man or an old woman, just kneel! Screams, splashes of blood, minced meat and internal organs will only arouse their killing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every warrior's eyes are a blood red, just like the flying blood double flag! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly discovered the gorgeous Fernandez in the distance, immediately locked him as his goal. He walked toward Fernandez step by step and leisurely. The giant axe in the hand does not live in the bright red road in the forest of steel and flesh. Behind him, what is left is a path of flesh and blood that is complemented by broken limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rogge, a young man who was cut off from his arm suddenly stood up from the pool of blood! From the clothing point of view, he is just a civilian, but at this moment, he has become a warrior who is not afraid of death! He held the sword with his left arm and forced it to the back of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrible long whip made up of a piece of sharp blade appeared like a flying out of the sky, and instantly circled the young man! The long whip suddenly recovered, and the blood mist immediately exploded in the air. The young man’s body had been broken into several pieces. It rolled on the ground in the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the long whip is in the hands of the unknown. The black trench coat on her body has been ruined. Showing a close-fitting lock with a faint purple light under the clothes. She held a delicate dagger in her left hand and two sharp blades at the heel of a pair of boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shake in the wrist. From the barbs of the whip, I smashed countless pieces of meat and blood beads, and then smiled, saying: "Master Rogge, I can grab you in front of you this time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha laughed, and the giant axe pointed to Fernandez in the distance, saying: "Leave the guy to me, the other you will kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernandez suddenly felt like a frog stared by a snake, the ice of the polar ice soaked all over the body, his face pale, so he couldn’t move! Suddenly, the figure of the middle-aged knight was inserted between Rogge and Fernandez. Fernandez regained his ability to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a bit, the axe fell like a thunder! After a loud bang, the middle-aged knight in front of him used a gun to hold the giant axe of Rogge! However, the terrible power attached to the giant axe has already bent the steel guns! I haven't waited for the middle-aged knight to spurt out the blood in the chest, and there has been a burning pain in my heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly bowed his head and saw that Rogge’s left hand did not know when he had a delicate dagger. The dagger easily penetrated the knight's chain armor and completely fell into his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Cavaliers fell, Rogge saw that Fernandez had already stepped down the city and fled to the direction of the city government. He stood at the head of the city and looked down at the city of Sorat, which had become a hell on earth. The tidal warriors are advancing rapidly on a street, and they have not let go of any house. In the raging fire, the houses were collapsed one after another, and there was always a fireman screaming out of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior emperor is no longer in the city, I do not know where to harvest life in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cold smile on the head of the city, just about to chase Fernandez, and suddenly stopped. He looked down at the fallen knight. The Cavaliers apparently died, but his face was still full of anger and unwillingness, his eyes were still big, and he held Rogge's boots in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed, squatted down, gently slid the knight's eyes, and then dressed up the knight's fingers one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a loud bang in the distance! In the dusty sky, the wall could not withstand the endless magical attack of Elgra, and it collapsed for a while! The heavy cavalry, who had been standing still, finally instigated the horse and began to advance toward the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes of Elgar slowly put away the white bones staff, took out a gray crystal ball, hoarsely said: "We should also go harvesting... ..." The lich walked to the burning city of Sorato, guarding him, just a person wrapped in a dark gray robes and carrying a fine sword. On the sword, there was a faint turmeric magic glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
