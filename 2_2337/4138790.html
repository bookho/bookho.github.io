			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the sudden invasion of the Astrofic Empire, the Great Civil War of the Holy Alliance came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fronts were ceased in place on the day when this amazing news came, and the positions of the countries’ confrontations once again became the council of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of this debate is not whether or not to stop the war. In the face of the mighty Astrofic army, if the sacred allies are not as uniform as ever, then they will only be defeated by powerful enemies and everyone will end up together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the armistice is not a problem, the focus of bargaining between the two sides now is the conditions of the armistice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Astrafik’s army was in the first place, the first was the Kingdom of Rivi. After attacking the Kingdom of Crewe, the Astrofiks could also choose to attack the three small principalities in the northwest, or invade the Latvian kingdom bordering the Kingdom of Levi in ​​the southwest, and then turn to the Kingdom of Layton. The Kingdom of Leighton was originally bordered by the Asrofik Empire, but this time it did not become the target of the Astrofic Empire as it used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in the Holy League countries thought that when Feuerbach’s expedition to the dark forests of the East, the Duke of Doliya, who had never been willing to take risks, dared to do his best. The 100,000-strong army under its jurisdiction attacked the Holy Alliance. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this time the Great League Civil War has killed and injured many warriors, as long as the major powers of the Allies are united, there are still more than 300,000 troops. Even if it does not include Rogge’s 80,000 new recruits, the number of powerful soldiers who have been able to fight for good warfare has passed 200,000. In the eyes of the kings and generals of the Holy Alliance, the Duke of Dolly Empire, although not a military idiot, is absolutely incompatible with the name. At least half of the generals dare to claim that they can roll Doriak back to his hometown under conditions of comparable military power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the Kingdom of Livi and Latvia is now very bad. From the situation, they have become the target of the Astrofic army. The border guards of the Kingdom of Livi suffered heavy losses in the first wave of attacks by the Astrofiks, and this time Doyal’s command suddenly became brilliant. His actions were very quick and dare, and the army was divided into three roads. After the central force broke through the defense line of the Livi border, it did not stop for a moment, but directly attacked the hinterland of the Kingdom of Livi. After the same two-wing troops broke through the border defense line, they began to gather toward the center and surrounded thousands of remaining garrison troops in the Kingdom of Livi. In front of tens of thousands of troops, no one would think that these thousands of rounded soldiers could support It took a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is everything at the moment. If the Kingdom of Levi is delayed for a while, the main force against the army of the Layton Kingdom cannot be withdrawn in time to resist the Astrofic army, and it will be dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Parliament of the Holy Alliance, Rogge let the Kingdom of Livia and the Kingdom of Latvia fully understand what is called greed. He saw the plight of the two countries, and therefore instructed the messengers of the Principality of Aray to put forward extremely harsh conditions and never let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Rogge is still on the surface a sacred, sacred and noble, saying that the lives of the Ale Principality and the citizens of the Kingdom of Layton are priceless. of. The despicable kingdom of Latvia actually colluded with the Necromancer, first killing many heroic Ale Principal soldiers with the Undead Legion, and then extremely cruelly killing the city in Leipzig in an attempt to turn 50,000 civilians into undead corps. This kind of measurable behavior cannot be tolerated. Therefore, in this war, Rogge must fight the Latvian kingdom. Even if the Ayre Principality dies, he will never care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latvian people have allegedly argued that they have not colluded with any Necromancer, the Leipzig incident is a conspiracy, and the undead army on the battlefield has nothing to do with them. . Unfortunately, although this time the diplomats rarely said the truth, no one still believed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the place of the Holy Alliance Parliament, what is the meaning of Rogge’s gambling swearing is actually clear to everyone. When more than 30,000 Latvian troops were dragged by Rogge, it would be hard to say that Levi and Latvia could rely on the remaining 60,000 troops to resist the invasion of Astrafik. At this moment, the 20,000 new army in Rogge has been trained and started to enter the city of Bora. It will not take long for Rogge to have 40,000 troops in his hands, so that the Latvians who confront him will not dare to arbitrarily reduce their strength and help the main battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge actually opened a price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Ikerel’s reasons, King Romon took a default attitude towards Rogge’s actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tradition can't restrain Rogge. His attitude is tough, and the only place that is reasonable is that the two countries are not required to cede land, but the requirements for compensation and rare minerals are enough to hollow out the national treasury of the two countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t agree with Rogge’s conditions, then the 30,000-plus Latvian army against Rogge seems to be tempted to invest in the northern battlefield to defend against Astrofi The army is gram. Moreover, Rogge has 40,000 new recruits still in training. It is also possible to eat the positive Latvian troops by relying on human tactics alone. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days of arduous negotiations, the Asrovik’s squadron has pointed to the city of Levi. The two countries in desperate conditions had to accept Rogge’s conditions and promised to compensate the Layton Kingdom, the Three Kingdoms Gold and the 500,000 Gold Coins, respectively, and pay immediately. At the same time, Rogge lists a long list of rare magical materials that almost wiped out the years of the two countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are just rare minerals and magical materials, worth less than a million coins. Surprisingly, this list is very precise and meticulous. It is almost what is in the national treasury and how many. What is listed and listed on this list. God knows where Rogge got the information, in order to open such a predatory list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of the ravages of the country, Levi and Latvians had to bow their heads. The two sides agreed that the armistice agreement will take effect immediately, and the two teams can leave the front to establish the first line of defense against the Astrofic. After paying the compensation, Layton and Aley will participate in the war as reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the main force of the Leiden Kingdom is more depleted in the continuous attack, it will be slightly rested. Rogge’s troops have not suffered any losses, so they will be the first batch of reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a critical situation, Rogge is not afraid of what the two countries will play again. As for the possible revenge after the war, he is even more unconcerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later, four trucks were escorted to the city of Bora with thousands of elite Latvian warriors. The goods on these four carriages have worth more than 1.5 million gold coins. It is no wonder that Latvia will send so many soldiers to escort when the war is tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time escorting war reparations, Latvia took a bit of thought and sent an old general who had never met Rogge on the battlefield. The general’s face is kind and good, and at first glance, he is a good old man. Obviously, Latvians do not want to make any more waves with Rogge. After all, Rogge’s 40,000 troops stationed in Bora City is a considerable force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two sides met, the old general was full of joy and the answer was very decent. Rogge also showed the most sincere smile, and could not help but compliment the heroes of Latvia, the magician is brilliant. When I talked about the magician, the smile on the face of the old general was very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although two foxes are illusory, the true relationship between the two sides is squandered by the glaring warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the four trucks were loaded with gold as compensation, and the other two contained all kinds of magical materials that Rogge named. It's easy to count gold, but it takes time to clear the magical raw materials. More than a dozen officials kept busy, moving one small box from the carriage and carefully checking the quantity and quality of the materials according to the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge accompanied the old generals while chatting, waiting for the completion of the settlement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be casual chat, but Rogge consciously or unconsciously explores the political and economic situation in Latvia, while the old general knows everything and says nothing, just answer False and false, do not know which sentence is true, which sentence is false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to count the work, and Rogge and the old general can finally end this witful chat. Rogge is still unfinished, and the old general is starting to see his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that the old general’s age is high, and the inventory work has been going on for two hours. He also had to accompany Rogge for two hours. The so-called gossip, basically Rogge asked, he replied. When Rogge saw his answer, he did not leak, and he changed his strategy. He asked dozens of questions repeatedly, and the old generals answered a little bit of inconsistency before and after. He would ask the question. The old general took the king’s death order before the trip, so that he could not offend Rogge anyway, so he must let Rogge follow the troops. Therefore, despite the difficulty of coping, he still cautiously responded, that is, did not reveal confidentiality, and did not let Rogge find an excuse to tear the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roghaha laughed at the problem! I have already prepared everything. I will lead the army tomorrow morning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old general took a breath, Let me be your guide! If you have any needs, let me know. I have some small prestige in Latvia, and I can provide you with some convenience in military service, camping and intelligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded and General Charlie wanted to finalize the marching route and operational plan. I will tell you the plan tomorrow morning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Charlie arranged for the marching equipment work tomorrow, and went to Rogge’s study, and finally asked Rogge to re-attempt the battle plan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the huge magic map has been marked according to the latest battle report provided by the old general.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Charlie, you see, the 60,000 coalition forces of the two countries are now confronting the 80,000 Asropiks in the plains of Kampas. If the final battle is over, it is hard to say. According to your opinion, if the coalition forces are defeated, where will they retreat? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie thought for a moment, on the map will choose to retreat into the Pancalo Valley. It is easy to defend, although there is no way out, but in addition to a narrow valley Outside the road, the Astrofiks can not find other places to attack. And the location of this valley is just right, not far from the city of Livi. I heard that the city defense of the city of Livi is very strong, relying only on the 10,000 King City Guards, I must The Strofik can't be attacked for a while. Not to mention the Astrofic people want to attack the king of Levi, they have to attack the Kleite Fortress. Although the fortress defense is not strong, it can also support For a while. At that time, the army retreating in the Pancala Valley was killed from the back, and the situation of the Astrofiks was not good. Moreover, within a week, our army could arrive, and by then The coalition forces attacked the Astrofiks on both sides, and they were not retired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie, if the two coalition forces were completely smashed? We entered the Fort Wright, Is it possible to completely block Aspen? The Ficks attacked the route of the city of Rivi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roger, the coalition is impossible to be fully smashed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie said: "If the coalition is really smashed, then we just have to hold the Wright Fortress." If the Astrofiks want to attack the city of Levi, they must go north to bypass the Khar Mountain. It is a few hundred kilometers of roads, and it is possible for us to cut off the road at any time. I really don't understand them this time. Why did you attack the Holy Alliance from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge carefully looked at the magic map for a long time and finally made up his mind that our goal is the Wright Fortress!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie is about to leave, and is called by Rogge Lived.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated for a while, said: "Charlie, my order, no matter what, no matter how unacceptable, will you execute? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie took a look at Ge Daren, you are the highest commander of the Principality of Aray, and I am only a general of the Principality of Aray. Any order you, of course, It must be executed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good!" Rogge breathed a sigh of relief, can you give me a promise? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie is a bit strange, but still said: "I swear! In the name of the Holy Knight." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge relieved and smiled and said: "Good! You should go to rest early, and marching will be very hard tomorrow." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the city gate of the city was opened, and the thousand strikers took the first ride out of the city. Under the guidance of Latvian soldiers, they will go down first. A campsite prepares for the arrival of the army.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After an hour, Rogge’s more than 30,000 army sneak out. In addition to leaving 2,000 people stationed Outside of Bora City, Rogge came out this time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latvian veteran Horne has been in the army for decades and is still a little royal The great aristocrat. He had already left the city early in the morning, waiting for Rogge on the side of the road. Although he was ostensibly afraid of losing time, everyone knew that he wanted to take the opportunity to take a look at Rogge’s military.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf has always been the best archer. The deep, bizarre magical longbow behind these elves is more than just a good-looking one. What makes the old general worry is that the riding of these elves does not seem weak. He is very clear about how powerful the elite rider is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge came out of the city in the darkness of the Spartan Knights and the Moon, the cold sweat of Horn's forehead finally came down. This is the first time he saw the most elite troops in Rogge's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn is also a knight, and when his eyes swept over the original Golden Lion Knight, it took a minute to get back. Although he did not understand the skills and specialties of the dark side of the moon, but looking at the murderous eyes and the cold eyes in the eyes of these elves, he could not help but think of the demon on the battlefield and the cold-blooded soldier known as the butcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Horn's gaze fell on the four elf guardian warriors behind Rogge, even the eyes of the old general could not help but reveal the heat and the light of the glory. They don't have long bows like other elves, but they wear magical swords. Gorgeous green armor like a beautiful piece of green leaves, decorated with golden patterns. Their bodies are so steady and steady, and obviously the martial arts are very clever. But the most eye-catching place is the exquisiteness and beauty of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These are the Rogers' Elf Guards? It's really... enviable!" Horn's thoughts were not pure thoughts, envy No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the city, there were nearly a hundred heavy-duty horse-drawn carriages, all of which were covered in strictness. I don’t know what was inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Horn was waiting, Rogge came over and smiled and asked, "General Horne, you see, can I still have a pass?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roger, I have been a soldier for so many years, but such a powerful warrior, such an elite knight, I saw it for the first time! And..." Horne lowered his voice and said: "Your Elf Guard... is unique!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "General Horn, the beauty of your house Wouldn't it be less?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been in the military for decades, the power is slight, although there are several women in the family, but they are added together, too Can't compare with the adult's Elf Guard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looks at the army of the fisherman, faintly said: "General Horne should call you Ogg General Makanin is right. You are actually a half-brother with the Kingdom of Latvia, and you have always controlled the secret police force throughout the Kingdom of Latvia. If you say that you lack beauty, then I am the first one who doesn't believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn's face changed greatly, the cold sweat on his forehead rolled down, and he barely said for a long time. "Roger, you are really superb, you don't think you can go anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "In fact, these are not important. After retiring the Astrofic, you will have to take me again. When are you ready to work, is it when my army returns to China?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Horne quickly said: "How is this possible? We Latvians will never do this kind of thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue stared at Horne, Sharp eyes are as real as they seem to be directly in his heart. Horn actually still barely laughed, but the smile was really ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog nodded and took back the generals. You have a set of information on the establishment and maintenance of the intelligence network. You can see that you are very talented, but unfortunately You are too far away from the royal family's lineage, or you should have gotten a higher sergeant with your achievements over the years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn Road: "You are more and more surprised by Rogge. It is impossible for people like us who live in the dark to enjoy the glory of too much sunshine. To be fair, everything that the Latvian king has given me is enough to compensate for my achievements. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles at the Holy Alliance to admire the knights, believe in the light, respect the brave warriors, so do your job, the status is not high. I am different. In my eyes, the importance of the intelligence network and the underground world is no less than the most powerful knights and special warriors in my hands. After evaluating the entire Kingdom of Latvia, I am now your talent. In the same way, although you are not as good as me in the underground world, it is the reason why there are too few people in your hands. What should you do for someone like you, I think you must be more clear than me. There is still a lot of time now, you can think about it carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can people like me do for you? It can only kill the generals and smile a bit. It seems to be a bit older.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few days of marching, Rogge’s army finally settled in the Wright Fortress. At this moment, more than 60,000 coalition forces are squatting with the 80,000 Asropiks on the plains of Kampas, and the two sides have already produced a series of small-scale battles. There are wins and losses between each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two generals are not sure to win, still waiting for the reinforcements of the party, so these battles are only to test the opponent's weaknesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thousands of border garrisons under the siege of the Kingdom of Livi have been fully smashed, and more than 20,000 Asrothic troops are rushing to the plains of Kampas. There are four more days to come.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the situation seems to be more beneficial to the coalition.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge’s 40,000-strong army has arrived at the Wright Fortress, only two days away from the main battlefield. Behind Rogge, the two newly recruited kingdoms of the Latvian Kingdom The reserve troops are gathering, and the 50,000 main forces of the Layton Kingdom are nearing completion of the rest, and they can reach the Wright Fortress within a week. Another 20,000 elite Layton warriors are preparing to cross the territory of the two small principalities in the east. Including the back of the Duke of Doliyak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Doriac dares to stand alone and face the enemy with a number of advantages, then according to the glorious tradition of the Holy Alliance, The 100,000 Asrofiks don’t want to go back to China.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright’s fortress was originally too close to abandoned because it’s too expensive to maintain in the hinterland. But the Great Civil War of the Holy Alliance and the invasion of the Astrofiks made this fortress important.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the Wright Fortress has become the front line And the most important transit station in the rear, the various military materials and food piles in the fortress are like mountains.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are’s team has come all the way, Latvians have never been ill As long as it is a reasonable military requirement, pull The Asians try their best to satisfy them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is not grateful for this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He said to Charlie: "Latvians want our warriors to work hard for them, of course, to give them good armor and let them eat all the war reparations paid to us, but they are actually prepaid warriors. Gold is gone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright Fortress is not too big, after the 40,000 Ayre Principality entered the fortress, it was quite crowded. Under the direction of General Horn, The fortress garrison commanded the 2,000th garrison garrison to let the room out, and try to let the soldiers of the Ade Principality rest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latvian and Alei soldiers The order is not pleasing to each other, this order has aroused the rebound of the entire fortress garrison. The fortress garrison is so comforting to the soldiers: "In any case, the useless Alei rookie will go to the battlefield tomorrow to die, let them pass the last A comfortable evening!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge plans to take a day off at the Wright Fortress and replenish the army to resupply, and then go to the main battlefield support the next day. The amount of military demand required is very large, especially for the advanced arrows that the Elf Archer needs. In the afternoon, Rogge evacuated all the arrows in the Wright Fortress reserve.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost dusk, Rogge came to Ann Dronie's room, tapping the door gently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something? Nothing to bother me, busy!” Androni replied with a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road marched, Androni was a singer As long as she has time, she must hide herself to cultivate vindictiveness or sword skills. She knows that dryness is a taboo for the warrior, but she has tried the taste of the sanctuary, just like a sip of a delicious dish. After that, how can I think about it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously Androni has not made any progress in these days, the more times she appears in front of Rogge The less you come, the worse your temper can be seen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge still insists on knocking on the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that night, Androni’s room became a highly dangerous area. She was obsessed with practicing martial arts, and the stars were not left, so Rogge never ventured again. In the unlikely event that Miss Androni is confused by the blue sky, it is definitely not a joke.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
