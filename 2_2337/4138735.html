The heavy snow since the winter will make the farmers who rely on the land for their livelihood happy, and will give the nobles a good reason to open a banquet party, but it brings a lot of inconvenience to the ordinary citizens living in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just a little bit of white belly on the horizon, the coldest night in the winter night. Preton District, the slum of Lille City, is still asleep in a dream town. In the rich city of Lille in the Bavarian Principality, even the poor people in the city can barely get enough food and clothing in this extraordinarily cold winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as people slept the deepest and deepest, the sound of hooves, footsteps and armor of the armor broke the silence before dawn. A team of soldiers entered the Preton area. The well-trained soldiers quickly dispersed throughout the city, and each soldier was assigned to several families, and began to forcefully pick up the door, suddenly a chicken and dog jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66 Continued to have someone dressed out. In those who are still asleep and unwilling to climb out of the warm bed, the soldiers are even harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, every household has at least one man out of it, and some are strong women. They held shovel, broom and other tools in their hands, silently listed as a messy team, followed the soldiers to the city of Lille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole of December, as long as the snow fell in the city of Lille, the citizens of the entire Preton district will be soldiers when the sky is still not bright. Drive out of the bed and clean up the snow on the street. As for the snow on the roof, it was crystal clear and white, which was a nice view and was preserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest people in these societies are not completely white workers. Every time they clean the snow, they will receive five copper coins, enough to buy a family one day. The food is gone. So although the soldiers were very rude, although they were very warm in the nest, there was still no one complaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unsettled winter. All the commotion is just because of one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is an incomparable arrogant, noble and noble woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because her last name is Rosello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is Catherine Roscio, who is the first beauty of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Catherine came to Lille, the ceremony was grander than Froya’s visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, when her team appeared on the horizon, the melodious bell rang through the city of Lille, and the heavy gate slowly opened. . Numerous costumed knights lined up in a neat queue from the city gate. Shiny golden armor, bloody red cloak, and high-lifting rifle were like a moving steel forest. On each of the knights, there is a flag flying on the tip of the gun, which depicts the emblem of the Bavarian Grand Duke: a majestic lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until ten minutes later, the three thousand dressed knights all rushed out of the city! They spread out to the two sides and were listed as a queue of magnificent knights in front and rear three rows, up to a kilometer wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the chilly wind, thousands of knights are silent, horses are not stunned, and only a few flags of the guns are flying in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s team stopped in and out, and the 500-guardian Rocherio family’s knights also formed a horizontal array. These mighty reloading knights wore black knights, carrying a double-edged one-handed axe behind them, and the right-handed gun was erected high and pointed to the sky. The guns used by these reloading knights are one meter longer and thicker than the average heavy knight-style pistols. There are three prismatic protrusions on the gun body, which are covered with sharp serrations. The knights carry a black giant shield on the left, a horrible spider on the shield, and a glamorous naked woman on the upper body of the spider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of horns sounded at the same time, and the bleak horns smashed through the sky and stunned countless birds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central golden armor knights are suddenly separated from the two sides, a golden armor Bavarian Grand Duke runs out from the middle. He was full of enthusiasm, like a golden flame burning with raging fire, and the end of the flames of the fire was a few meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black knights are also separated from the two sides. A huge black carriage, elegant and elegant, is slowly driven out under the drag of eight purebred Orleans horses. This carriage is completely made of extremely expensive black agarwood, decorated with the Bauhinia branch and the family crest of the Roscio family - a unicorn with a double wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silver-haired Marshall Roscherio crossed the carriage and greeted the Bavarian Grand Duke. Dagong’s gold is flying in the wind, the beard is very neatly cultivated, and the majesty is elegant. However, the skin of the Bavarian Grand Duke, who is already old, is crystal clear as jade, and the golden luster under the skin is not flowing. His golden beard was trimmed neatly, and an amber thumb-sized gem was embedded in his eyebrows, full of majesty and calming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Rochrio and the Bavarian Grand Duke are people of similar age, but now a silver Rocherio is so refreshing, it is already known An elderly person. However, the Bavarian Grand Duke seems to be only 30 years old. In just half a year, he seems to be 20 years younger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men who have been holding power for many years have finally met at the Central Conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosello and the Bavarian Grand Duke Rheinhardt. William stared at each other for a long time, his eyes finally stayed on the gem of the forehead: "My old friend Finally, I saw you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong nodded, although his appearance is still in his prime, but the voice has a bleak endless years:" Yeah, the last time I met at Wang, it was two years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosce Rio sighed, in the past two years, I have had too many things. Fortunately, we don't have to meet on the battlefield. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagonghaha, laughing at a friend, you can make this determination, I am very happy! The last thing I want is to have an enemy like you. Behind you." Those people, the human face spider knight, really deservedly deserved!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosereo smiles almost as much as your lion-hearted knight, and still Your well-known Knights. The human face spider is no match for your secretly trained knights, or the Golden Lion Knights are the real first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Dagong suddenly dimmed. At this moment, he suddenly recovered his true age: the Philippine child, this child..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rossio smiled and tried to arrange everything, but who wanted him to know the news, but also ran for thousands of miles and rushed back to Wangdu? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old friends, why bother to blame? Even my father is not aware of his true strength. How do you know it? What's more, the stupid Kara Yang also paid a corresponding price for it, let it all go past is the fate of the arrangement! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosso Rio stared at the gem of the big man's eyebrows and sighed: "Old friends, I really don't want to see you on this path." You and I both know the dangers on this road. It is not personal power to fight against the world. Why are you suffering? Although we are old, we can no longer charge, but you and I have only one third-rate force in our hands. Is it not so easy to beat us on the battlefield? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Bavarian Grand Duke passed a trace of sad friends, watching O'Fee grow up day by day, I can be said to be the happiest father in the world. But... I just want to be like a general charge, just as if he is still alive, and can create a new dynasty with me. This is also a compensation for my unqualified father for him! Russell guy How do you say that he still refuses to come to help me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also know that his loyalty to the Bourbon dynasty is notorious. I have tried him, but he has been rebuked. The three of us started the prosperity of an era for the Rhine Union. I didn't expect to see each other on the battlefield. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke silently for a moment, said: "Old friends, you know me." The miraculous signs are sudden, and everything after that has no room for me to choose. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roserio smiled and said: "Okay, these are the troubles of the future." Today we should be happy, you lost a son, I hope Catherine can bring you some happiness. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the pearl necklace, she did not wear any jewelry. She doesn't need these accessories to decorate herself. Her beauty and noble temperament are perfect, and she doesn't need any decoration because she is Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Grand Duke looked into the window and was welcoming Catherine’s gaze. The two looked at each other a bit, and Dagong smiled a little and gave a gift to Catherine. She bowed her head gracefully and gave her a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Grand Duke suddenly felt that he was looking into the queue of the Spider-Man, where there were several knights with clear armor. He recognized two of them David and Gonzalez. There is also a middle-aged man among the two. This is a man with a strange charm, his face is ancient, strange, handsome and very fascinating. A pair of long phoenix eyes are not at the bottom, faintly shining blue light. When Dagong’s gaze fell on him, the man’s sudden violent violent temperament provoked a small tornado in his body! Both David and Gonzalez were pushed away from the sides, and several close-up spider knights were thrown out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden flame of the Bavarian Grand Duke suddenly swelled and sprayed a few meters high. The war horse he slammed was long and he couldn't help but step back. Dagong sighed low and the golden flame recovered, forming a translucent golden armor on his body. The horse was quiet and no longer retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man murders and the tornado gradually dissipates. He immediately turned to Dagong Wei, even if he apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Grand Duke smiled a bit like the guy! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roscherio smiled and said: "Yes! For more than ten years, we have changed a lot, but he has not changed at all! Now that you have a lot of strength, he certainly can't help but try it out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David and Gonzalez overwhelmed the frightened horse and came to the man. David smiled and asked: "Mr. Prossis." You will be notified to us next time. Big Brother's human face spider knight can't stand your murderous even if it is strong again! How, what is your opinion on the power of Dagong? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prossis snorted and slowly said: "This power is not his, although it is powerful but not enough." But if he absorbs the power again, it is hard to say. The bright church is alive! Dagong, he is already the commander of the Wanjun, the king of a country. Is it necessary to take such risks and forcefully absorb the power again? What is the use of such powerful force? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the grandfather of the golden flames in the distance, David sighed: "Da Gong he can not release the death of Orphee! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the name of Orpheek, Pross’s face showed great sorrow: knowing that he also entered the sanctuary, he should have a good fight with him. Some...Mom, the guy who can defeat the blood angel Augustus, Laozi...Mom! I am not an opponent. Hey!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornate carriage Under the guard of the huge Knights of the ceremonial squad, slowly entered the city of Lille. The straight and wide Champs Elysées leads directly to the Grand Palace. The scarlet carpet was straight from the gate to the bronze gate of the Dagong Mansion, which is four meters high. A few knights are standing on every side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inhabitants of countless Lille City stood behind the knights and watched Catherine’s team silently. They all want to see the first beauty of the king. However, the atmosphere at the moment was surprisingly dignified, and all the people did not consciously close their mouths. In addition to the hooves, the wind, the flags fluttering on the entire avenue, there is no other sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtains are open. Catherine’s appearance immediately caused a commotion in the crowd, and the exclamations came one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car's window is very large, and Catherine's entire upper body is exposed. Her face is full of classical beauty. She looked proudly at the city, these subjects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Grand Council is following the carriage. He leaned slightly and smiled and said: "Dear Catherine, are you satisfied with the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked up and stared deeply at the Grand Duke , faintly said: "This is our future king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong Lang laughed wrong! Not only this city of Lille, the entire Principality, the entire Rhine Union, but also the vast land, countless mountains, rivers, forests, grasslands, will be our territory! These mighty knights, these loyal subjects are our richest wealth! This kingdom, this country, is the gift I gave you! Are you still satisfied? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong looked up at the deep clouds in the sky and sighed. The thick clouds couldn't help but change, and the handsome face of Ophir Rock filled with sunshine seemed to be illusory in the clouds. There was a pain in Dagong’s heart, and it was almost immediately planted. He suddenly felt extremely remorse, for the so-called power, hegemony, the so-called Millennium dynasty, the heavy price he paid, is it really worth it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong only felt dizzy, and countless bands of light flashed in front of him, and the pain in his heart was even worse. He has been immersed in the power for a long time, and he has become accustomed to dealing with the affairs of the Principality with no emotion. The result of decades of iron and blood is that he did not expect that Orpheq would be so concerned about the relationship with Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only for the moment of the last embrace, he can rush to the kingdom in a thousand miles; he can fight the long streets and challenge the entire bright church alone; He can give up the glory of heaven and bear the pain of the soul eternal into the devil...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, the Grand Duke of Bavaria is on the square, watching the Pope in the sky The big prophecy of the movement exfoliated the last life of Orpheq; on that day, he watched the black wing of Orphee Roker struggling into the flames of the sky. On that day, he had thought about waving the sword to the pope, but he did not have the courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If time goes by, everything can come back again, he will not hesitate to wave the sword, although he knows that nothing will change. However, there is only one chance to be brave. If you pass, you will not come again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, Rheinhardt was ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ofirok, my child, are you in hell, will you still hate me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dagong’s hand suddenly came a cool. This comfortable cold and smoothness gradually calmed the discomfort of Dagong. He turned his head and saw a small hand from Catherine sticking out of the window and holding his hand gently. Her dark blue eyes have the wisdom to understand everything in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think of Orpheus, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" even you Did you see it? Orpheus child, I am sorry for him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled, holding the hand of Dagong tight, gently Authentic: "You lost a son, but you also have me as a compensation. Although I can't compare with the Orpheq adults, I hope to share some sadness for you. You will give me a gift as a gift." Our descendants will take good care of this gift until the millennium."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong finally recovered from the painful memories. He looked at the perfect and noble Catherine. I look young now, but my age is enough to be your father. Don't you regret your choice? "Crazin smiles, the glamour of the hot flash of light in his eyes lies in wisdom, foresight, discouragement and time to bring you the spirit. Dare to open up the spirit of the millennial dynasty." How could it be a young man? This is the home of my Catherine dream. You are a great monarch, and time will prove that Catherine will be your best wife."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandfather’s long laugh can not guarantee that I will succeed. If I don't pay attention to this miracle, we will at least have this rich and powerful duchy, but now we can't look back. Catherine, if you think about it, we may fail, and failure means the destruction of the entire Bavarian family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened after failing?" If you are just a Bavarian Grand Duke, you will never get my respect. "The flame in Catherine's eyes is even stronger. "If you can't let the lion's dynasty's badge pass through the millennium, let us destroy it together!" When the day of failure comes, you will never be alone, and willing to accompany you into hell! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long laughter of the Bavarian Grand Duke is screaming, echoing over the city of Lille, for a long time...<br /><br />&nbsp The clouds in the air are thicker, and the snow-like snow suddenly begins to fall. The sudden snow does not extinguish the enthusiasm of the citizens of Lille. Many people rush to the next intersection, just to take another look at the Rhine. The first beauty of the Alliance Kings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind suddenly burst, with a piece of snow flung into the car window of Catherine. The cold snowflake stuck to her On the exposed neck, it turned into a few crystal drops. Catherine still maintained the most elegant sitting position, as if she didn't feel the cold snow at all. The maid in the carriage was busy taking out a soft satin and wiping it off her neck. Snow water, and a burgundy foxtail shawl for her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
