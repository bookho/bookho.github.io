			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如如梦章章十梦占下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty minutes is very short, but also very Long. The fat man is physically specific, and he now controls almost every part of his body. He can solve the battle in one minute, and can also cross the battlefield and fight all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to an ordinary human standard, as long as the fat man thinks, then he is a stallion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the intensity of the 30 minutes is beyond the imagination of the fat man. Perhaps it’s really a long time since I didn’t have a fever, and Effie was like a wild horse, like a huge tornado swept through the grasslands in the summer, and kept rolling over the fat man. I vowed to squeeze out the essence of the last drop in his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty is rich in women's experience, but Effie is different, although she is not as good as her appearance, she is not as good as Fengdie and Fuluya. Absolutely, but her blazing emotions from the deepest part of her soul are irresistible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a lava boom that rushes into the fat man’s heart. Every time she squats, every twist, every rub, blows the flames in Rogge's body more frenzied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No skill, no control, some are just the most primitive instinct, and the desire to be burned by the fire of the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the instinctive flame goes out, the fat man even feels a slight dizziness, and Effie is sweating like rain, like the bones of the whole body. They have been pumped out in general, and they can only softly lie on Rogge's body. She barely looked up and looked at Rogge. In the eyes of the clear water, it is rare to reveal a thick thought that can't be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger caressed her long blond hair, this hair has been wet with sweat, stuck on her skin, witnessing the past Frenzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, Effie?" Rogge asked with a smile. He always felt that this seemingly ordinary, in fact, the maverick girl who is maverick, hides too many things under the clear eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, just want to see you." Effie gently said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding this moment of Effie. Rogge suddenly felt that the whole body was slack, and the bottom of his heart did not know how long it took to get tired. He yawned involuntarily. Rarely: "What do I have to look good? Well, let's sleep for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked down and saw that the elf girl had put her head on his chest and had already entered a dream. He couldn't help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the tiredness is up, and the fat man is still asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night, the deep and deep central mountain is like a dragon, and the unparalleled body lingers on the vast land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of a dangerous peak. Adrienne's fingertips each emit a thin black flame, burning a magic symbol on the flat rock. This mountain is very strange. The peak is a large platform that is as smooth as a mirror, just like someone who cut it with a giant blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the dangerous peak, Weiner, who is a demon, stands in the air and silently watches Adelaide. Occasionally, she flashed a glimmer of light in her eyes and then reported a new set of coordinates. Adrienne will adjust the magic array accordingly. At the top of the peak, Miro is leaning against his own giant hammer and doing nothing. He looked at Adrienne, but the lingering light in his eyes always involuntarily slammed into the Vena floating in the air. Miro still looks calm and chic, but his smile always makes people feel unnatural, and one hand even subconsciously refuses to leave the hammer handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard that the reputation of the Mozu has never been good. But after killing the Dragon, Artest, you are better able to keep your promise, otherwise If you hide it again, I have a way to make you pay a price." Wella is cold and fluent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looks cold. Cold and cold: "If I go to the devil to kill a few demons. I am afraid no one can stop me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intentionally or unintentionally, Wella ignored The issue of heavenly credibility. However, Adrienne did not care about her seriously. Just saying: "Our Mozu is not strong enough, but if you want to stop you, there are still a few guys who have this ability. But the problem is not here. The problem is that there are many more guests in the Devil. I don't know yours. In the past, but from the perspective of your power attributes, I think, you will not want to see those guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted, no What are you talking about? She just stared at Adrienne to watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summit suddenly fell into silence, only the wind was whizzing past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro, who leans on the hammer, suddenly feels that the atmosphere at the summit is extremely dignified and depressed, and it is almost mad! Between the Venus in the air and Ade Renee in the ground, there seems to be a sturdy undercurrent that can’t keep up. Those undercurrents are neither vindictive nor magical, they do not exist in the form of energy at all. However, Miro clearly knows that these undercurrents do exist, but the way they exist is not what he can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two extremely fierce women are fighting in another battlefield in a way that Miro can't understand. For a long time, Miro thought that he was only a little bit less powerful than Aide Renee, but now he suddenly has a feeling, although the gap between the two sides is really small, but if it is really duel He will never be the opponent of Adrienne. He will not only lose, but he will be defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred years ago, Miro and Adrienne had a duel several times, and they had a win and loss. However, in the past hundred years, Miro has been separated from his heart, and his life is wonderful and he is always in love. And Adrienne has endured a hundred years of loneliness in the foggy field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred years later, Miro was shocked. The gap between the two sides is irreparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Adrienne finished the last magic symbol and stood up straight. She looked up at Wella and said, "You watched me for so long, seeing what is coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wena said: "Of course. From you. In the past, you have already given up everything else in order to pursue strength! Even now, in addition to strength, there is nothing else in your heart. But who is Locar?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina said this, not just Adrienne. Even Miro was shocked. Adrian immediately said: "How do you know that Loca's can read my memory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelene looked at Weina, and suddenly smiled, and gathered a long hair that was blown by the wind, saying: "You really have some Strange, well, there is nothing to blame for you. You see that Dulloga is the agent of the great demon in the devil. Since you already know the existence of the land in Locar, then you must know what I said. What kind of person is the guest? So you still want to go to the devil to chase me? And you are relieved now? Since you have read my memory, naturally you will know that my credibility can no longer be better, at least Miro is much stronger than the one there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro snorted and looked to the side, only to hear nothing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, time is up, we should start." Adrienne pops up hundreds of flames composed of pure magical energy, which will be in the magic The devils are lit one by one. The powerful magic of the silkworm began to tear the space. The surrounding airflow began to confuse, and a strange whirlpool of airflow loomed over the magical array. In the blink of an eye, a space gap was opened above the magic array, and then the powerful energy of the array stabilized the entire space structure, eventually constructing a space door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of leading into the space, Adrianne suddenly turned back and gave Weiner a meaningful smile. Then there was only one of them who knew that the spiritual fluctuations in existence had quietly passed to Wei Na’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can take him away with my appearance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;龙There is a little bit of glare at the tip of the soul gun. Only at this time, Adrienne’s next wave of spirituality just came: “...I know that at that time, you are likely to kill me with a shot.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wella's face was frosty, she didn't enter Adelene's portal, and she was directly in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the earth is on the dangerous peak, only Miro is leaning against the hammer of the giant hammer and staying in the cold wind. Until the space door began to become unstable, he shook his head and dragged the giant hammer into the space door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro is an extremely rare and affectionate person in the Mozu. As for the four places, it is the nature of the Mozu. The Mozu in power worship. Whether it is Wella or Adrienne. It was enough to make the males mad, and it would make Miro crazy. But from the beginning. It is Froya who is crazy about Miro. He is not admired for these two horrible women, and some are just a ring of fear and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason for it, their strength and personality are too strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them, it is destined to be a love game that wanders on the edge of the razor, so the game is not fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space door finally disappeared, and the wind on the dangerous peak suddenly increased. The wind whistling and tearing the smooth peaks, and it will not take long for this mountain to be restored by manpower to restore its appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is looking around, but nothing can be seen. He reached out and touched it, but it was empty everywhere, nothing. He knelt down and touched the ground under his feet. The ground is soft, sticky to the touch, and there seems to be a semi-solidified liquid that is slowly flowing. His fingertips also encountered a piece of slippery and soft small pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no light here, and Rogge’s mental power is empty, so he has no way of judging what these pieces are. But his sense of smell is still there. He only feels that this strange space is slowing down the stench and blood of the thick, but it is strange that, occasionally, the wind will send him a refreshing spirit. Fragrant. This aroma seems to have met, Rogge always felt where he had smelled, but no matter how he thinks, he can't remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a light suddenly appeared in the distance. Rogge hesitated, but it seems that there is the only way to unlock the secret of this dark space, and he finally walks toward that little light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also had some doubts at the beginning that it was the realm of darkness. Even the kingdom of Bartholomew, but he immediately knew not. The breath here is completely different from the breath of the dark Lord God he has sensed. There is too much blood and other flavors here, and the kingdom of darkness is only dark and nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is walking all the way, the soft ground makes walking a very difficult thing, and the large soft objects that always exist Let Rogge give up the attempt to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Rogge finally came to the light. It was a gem that floated in the darkness, and the soft glow it emitted was very strange. Can let Rogge see, but can't completely illuminate the surrounding space. Looks like. It is more like a lighthouse for guiding the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated and reached out and tried to take the gem. It was only when his fingertips touched the gem, all the scenes in front of him changed in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, Rogge found himself in a huge war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark red, like the flow of blood behind the thick clouds. In the turbulent clouds, there will always be huge lightnings. Between lightning, occasionally, the thick pillar of light that entangles the petals and the light strips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is black in different shades. Several large rivers stretched out on the ground. Just the rivers rushing, are the waves of blue and purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the far horizon, you can see a towering mountain. This mountain gives people a different feeling. It looks like a giant with its own life. It has a sky above the sky, a foot on the ground, and a high altitude. It looks down on the humble beings who are flying on the ground or in the low air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crystal clear as jade, and it seems to be soft from time to time. However, in fact, sharp as a sword's milky white radiance. The milky white radiance exudes a rich sacred atmosphere all the time, and it condenses into a spectacular pillar of great light, directly through the heavens and the earth, and breaks through the thick red clouds in the sky, tearing open the space of this red and black color, breaking Go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless strange races on the ground. They cling to the strange weapons that Rog has never seen before, and rush on the earth! There are dozens of meters in these races, and there are seven horror creatures of various shapes and shapes in the huge body. There are also countless strange soldiers with short stature, but fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Rogge’s perspective and distance, these fighters are as small as ants. They screamed in the sound of fighting, swarming forward! Don't look at the narrowness of these warriors, and the individual combat power is not good, but their snoring is unexpectedly loud. And because the number is too much. Therefore, the strange and unique snoring sounds like a shocking earth! Even the snoring of the behemoths of the seven heads was suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this battlefield, the soldiers who are bravely fighting. How many million? Not only the ground, but also the tens of thousands of shadows in the sky. They look a bit like gargoyles, but the fierceness and strength are more than ten times more than ordinary gargoyles. Rogge has no doubt that in the case of one-on-one, these strange creatures he has never seen can easily tear an adult gryphon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the battle is fierce and completely unimaginable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is actually made up of hard black rock, but at this moment it has been completely covered by broken bodies, internal organs and solidified blood! Rogge didn't have to count, he just knew that the number of dead bodies on the ground far exceeded the number of still alive fighters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is almost unfolding in any corner of the battlefield, and the blood of the corpses and the canopy can’t stand in the air, like a rainstorm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s pupils contract slightly, because the enemies facing millions of aliens are hundreds of angels! These angels are all wearing golden heavy armor, and the weapons they hold are different. The pair of white wings spread out in this world of red and black, so glaring! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angels whirl around in the sky at incredible speed, they tend to head toward a group of alien warriors, and then a dazzling flame will be The sky burst open, and then there will be a large group of suffocating flesh and blood falling from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millions of pairs of hundreds of angels with one enemy 10,000 can still get the upper hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only discord in the entire battlefield is a small hill in the middle of the battlefield that is not high but looks very abrupt. This is a hill made up of dead bodies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hills. Jumping a little figure. It looks very, very thin and thin, even thinner than the most numerous fighters on the ground. It’s just that the slender and thin body seems to contain endless power. It clings to a giant blade with a blade length of only five meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hill is located right in the middle of the battlefield. Above it, hundreds of angels are fighting and flying. There are dozens of angels who are always spinning around the hill, and it seems to be the result of this slim figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little figure leaps and bounds, it will jump more than ten meters high every time. On this vast and boundless battlefield. Its leap is so clumsy. It won't even fly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time it leaps, it will struggle to wave the giant blade. The angels who passed by at low altitude. Because the ratio of the body and the giant blade is too uncoordinated, it even gives a feeling of dislocation. It is unclear whether it has swung the giant blade, or the giant blade has driven its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let Rogge stunned, that little figure will smash a flying angel every time he jumps! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angels who were stunned were struggling, but no matter how bad the injury was. They are unable to continue to fly in the air. The angels desperately agitated the wings and fell into the group of alien warriors below. Every angel falls, there will be countless alien warriors rushing forward, and in a twinkling of an eye, a small hill is piled up on that day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These angels are completely different from the angels that Rogge has seen before. Their fighting power is extremely strong. Even if they are seriously injured, the alien warriors will be shredded. Hundreds. However, the alien warriors who fought bravely were too many, and the fallen angels constantly appeared new injuries. Their movements are gradually slowing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the fallen angel will always be completely submerged. Together with his victims, he will raise the hills of the body in the center of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
