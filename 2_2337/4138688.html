			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After experiencing the little unpleasantness of the city of Fallen, the Clarke Chamber of Commerce continued to travel westward. The Lord of the Fallen City once sent someone to catch up and apologize, and the Clark Chamber of Commerce had a few days in the city of Fallen, and he had to express his apology. However, Benjamin’s resentment this time was a resentful comment on the gentleman’s comments on the gentleman’s words. Finally, the old fox said that because the Clarke Chamber of Commerce's highest guest was insulted and reluctant to enter the city of Fallen City, he could only reject the goodwill of the city owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger immediately swears a vow, and goes back to fix the ignorant kid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, Rens asked his companions inexplicably: "This old guy is very angry on weekdays. How can this be so unruly? The little knight , what is it called? Still very cute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility youth guessed it, and did not guess a result. Later, Rogge quietly asked Benjamin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old fox smiled and explained that no one wants to have a too strong neighbor to sleep with. ‘Night Mo’ was already the largest mercenary group. Now it’s a regular knight to train mercenaries. It’s a great achievement and will be even stronger in the future. The young knight Gael is actually a model of the warrior. This time he insisted on not forgiving Gael, just to let the ‘night motorcycle’ mercenary punish him. And this punishment will give the young night knights a demonstration, let them understand that there is nothing good to end in the knight's belief. In this way, unknowingly, the ‘night motorcycle’ mercenary was led. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is just the old man’s wishful thinking. In fact, the fundamental solution is to train a more powerful soldier than the 'Night Mo' mercenary! The old man under the training department of Ge’s younger brother is familiar with it. Wouldn’t it be Daoer of the Mercenary of the War?” Benjamin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because Benjamin’s eyes are really eye-catching, this also makes you see.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The younger brother is really extraordinary! It seems that the old man is lucky, he can get to know the great talents of his brother, hahahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge accompanied and laughed a few times . He once again opened his eyes, and the original victims can be so invisible. He just didn't understand, Clark, a chamber of commerce leader, why would the ‘night motorcycle’ mercenary be an opponent? He questioned several times, and Benjamin just smiled incomprehensibly and refused to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this road, Froya has more and more ways to torture Rogge, and the pattern is constantly being refurbished. The millennial little foxes prefer spiritual torture and endless peeks, constantly questioning what the so-called leg of Rogge and Elysses is. How does this fat man answer? But if you can't answer it, you have to answer it. Otherwise, Froya will make all kinds of embarrassing expressions in public. The face of the golden lion squadron Paulus has become more and more ugly. Others are a pair of unrequited expressions, only to see nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not saying it before, it doesn’t mean never saying it. There are no impenetrable walls in the world, so many people are present, and sooner or later this event will be well known. Proverbs have their own way of living, no matter how innocent they are, they will eventually be heard beyond recognition. Moreover, the reputation of this fat man has always been not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offik wisely decided that these rumors have not been able to affect him, but it is impossible to expect him to like it. Even more worrying is that there is another Andre. This guy is lawless, but he is also capable and strong. Later, as soon as Froya made a sly expression, Rogge immediately obeyed. What is the command of His Royal Highness, I will do my best, and I will do my best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other aristocratic youths turned a blind eye to Rogge’s situation. I don't want to help, but I don't dare to help. Franco had wanted to rescue Rogge for a loyalty, and plugged it in halfway. As a result, Fu Luoya used the 'infernal jail' to seal the space. In the evening, he let him out of the prison. At the time, the handsome Franco was already ragged and unconscious. Everyone thinks that this little witch is still a senior magician with terror strength! With the example of Franco first, everyone can only let Rogge ask for more happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the little witch’s high-pressure policy, Rogge had to make up a time with Elysses how to "have a leg start, the story naturally does not This is the end of the story. The story itself is already disrespectful to Elysses and even Orphee Roque. Froya got the handle, and of course refused to let Rogge so easily. Again and again, The story of the fat man is more and more exciting, more and more natural, and if Froya deliberately teased inadvertently, in an important part of his life, he must repeat the refilling for more than a dozen times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's car surface does not look very wide, but it is ten times bigger! In addition to the princess bedroom and the two maid's lounges, there is actually a bathroom, a living room and a magic lab! Obviously this carriage is an outstanding work of some mysterious space magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s lab has always been closed, only once, when she came out of the lab, Rogge glanced and saw the inside flashing The peculiar blue halo, the countless bottles and cans are neatly arranged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day when the night is quiet, Froya will send people to Roger in the carriage, and all kinds of spiritual torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart has long been hated by this metamorphosis of the goblin. Every time he is tortured, he dreams that if one can put this little goblin on one day, Be sure how to treat her. How does this naturally include all the tricks he knows, whether tried or not. The idea was so strong that one time he couldn't help but rush to Froya. So close, Fu Luoya is a delicate female magician, where can I get the power of Rogge? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just as Rogge was about to touch Froja, a talisman between her suddenly burst into a glare of blindness. Rogge only felt that if he was hit by a large hammer with the ancient Frost Giant, he immediately lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Rogge’s consciousness, it seems that it was not long before he was awakened by a huge pain in the depths of his spirit. He blinked slowly, and suddenly he was lying on the ground and spreading his limbs. He tried to move, and now he couldn't even move a finger. All the feelings of the whole body were not lost. Rogge forced himself to calm down and slowly gather his mental power. He immediately sensed that several gray magical energies were tightly wrapped around his body, and no matter which direction he moved, he would be offset by magical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up? Your courage is really big! Hehehehe, this princess likes you like a bold person! You come up again, you don't want to **I? Don't worry, baby, I will let you enjoy it right away! You will be willing to be my slave!" Froya should have been pleasing to the ear, but it was very incomprehensible in Rogge's ear. evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch sits aside, and the beautiful face is mixed with cruelty and happiness. She was so excited that she shook slightly, and her long, slender fingers consciously tapped the arm of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s two maids came to Rogge with excitement By the side. A maid took out a delicate silver knife and saw the cold light on the blade. Another maid clasped Rogge in his hands, and he danced with all fingers and skill. Rogburn is a lascivious person, where he has endured this kind of teasing, and the things in the blink of an eye are already standing tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knifey maid with a pair of beautiful eyes flashing a cruel smile, she stared at Rogge, and suddenly raised her knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge only saw a silver light in his eyes, he was only scared and screamed: "No!..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver light flashed, the maid smiled and blew a bunch of hair from the silver knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two maids are still moving, serious and meticulous, not letting go of every corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clump of hair fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the work of the maids has been completed, one of the masks ate and laughed: "It turned out to be so ugly after the place was bald!" Then he said disdainfully: "Look at his usual uselessness. It turns out that this thing is also short and thick, and it really looks the same as his people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shivered slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you afraid? Are you not afraid of it? Come and ask me, ask me to spare you, like a dog!" Fu Luoya Greg smiled and tapped Rogge's cheek with his toes. Her feet are equally beautiful. A slippery feeling glides over Rogge's forehead, nose and lips. If it is normal, such a strong teasing is enough to make the fat man become a love dog! But now, he can't feel the temptation at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's heart was like a raging volcano, but the body was like a frozen earth that had been frozen for a thousand years, letting the two maids be at the mercy. He is not incapable of lifting the magical imprisonment, but knows that it is only a dead end after the unraveling. He silently sensed the fascinating, yet powerful, magical fluctuations of Froya. That amulet is one of them, and this magical fluctuation, there are so many in her body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the foot of Froya, a drop of water squirted quietly. This drop of water did not slip down the cheek as usual, but it went around a bend, climbing all the way and disappearing into Rogge's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maids completed their initial work, and after a vicious comment, one of them untied the dress and sat up excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog is completely ignorant. In addition to countless spaces, the *** that is connected with his spirit is breaking through the obstacles of space and flying. Rogge used all his mental strength to resist her, preventing her from crossing the last space barrier and showing up in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More ***, but more than a few people who died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the carriage is crazy. The Necromancer and his pet are struggling in another space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s mental strength was exhausted, and *** finally could not support it, and returned to the outside world like a tide. Before she left, she was extremely puzzled, angry and unwilling to scream. This silent cry was clearly and clearly left in Rogge's consciousness. Rogge smiled a bit in his heart and settled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't fight, you have to live?" Rogge thought with a mockery. He concentrated the remaining mental power, and the maid suddenly screamed in excitement. As he pleaded with the maid, he turned to his head and asked for a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria was quite surprised. Rogge succumbed so easily that her fun was greatly reduced. Her fingertips burst into a small group of fires, and Rogge immediately felt that he had recovered all his ability to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see, how are you going to do my dog! Froya asked with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated for a moment, reached out and took Froya’s little feet, and bowed up with respect. , but it has become more and more urgent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough! "Floria pulled back her foot and looked at Rogge scornfully. "But it was a man with no bones, and thought he would fight with me!" Froya thought, a little disappointed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the way tonight! She told me. In a blink of an eye, I changed my mind. I will give you a night's night for this dog. Don't play too much!" After the command, Froya turned and went into the rest to take two excited maids. Stayed with Rogge outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sky was faintly white, Rogge was exhausted from Furo’s carriage. At this time, Froya just got up. Her cloak went out and the two maids were still discussing with excitement. Froya frowned and asked, "How was your last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is just a spring boar!" A maid answered Road. Froya's face was even more ugly, and the waitress panicked: "I'm sorry, my Royal Highness, I am too rude!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stood at the window and watched With the back of Rogge slowly going away, he sighed: "You said, are we too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is just an incompetent Men, these stinky men are not all the same! He must have felt that they are still cheap! Princess, you seem to look at him quite differently. In fact, Franco, Kate and Paulus are more handsome than him. Alright. However, this Rogge is really harmful, but I can't see it at first..." The mouthful maid covered her mouth and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sighed and felt very bored in her heart. She whispered to herself: "Andre, this time, I seem to have done something wrong again. But I just can't help it! Why have you always wanted to kill him? In fact, he is super respectful. People who actually look down on women are everywhere. Why, why can't I control myself?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the small camp of Froya, Luo Many people are already waiting for themselves. He looked at them exhausted one by one, including his own friends, some of his own subordinates, and Paulus and his golden lion knights. Envy and jealousy are revealed in the eyes of many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate came over and took over the sluggish Rogge. He said to Paulus: "Is Paulus the genius of Orphey, or the prince of Froya? You are the law department. Official? Are you the lord of the House of Lords Aristocratic Investigation Committee? I am afraid it is not? What are your rights to ask Rogge, what do your current boss explain to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulus paused for a while, but said: "As a knight, I need to maintain the interests of my Lord Orfey Roque. Everyone knows that Princess Froya is the relationship of my main Orpheus. Rogge is also a knight who should cherish honor over life, so he must explain the last night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paulus, You compare yourself to the model of the Cavaliers, but you have raised yourself too much? You don’t even follow the orders of the Orpheq adults. What are you saying here to protect his interests? I see that you are dissatisfied and dissatisfied yesterday. Why are you not in the princess camp late in the evening?" Franco Yin Strange gas quipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulus angered and said: "You are insulting the honor of the Golden Lion Knight! You must apologize! Knights, prepare your weapons!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唰唰唰" The second team of gold lions behind Paulus pulled out the knight sword, and everyone faintly flashed the grudge. The dragon and the beauty knights will surround Rogge in the center, and all weapons will be unsheathed. Although the golden lion knights are twenty to one hundred, the momentum is like a rainbow, and the dragon and the beautiful knights are crushed. However, these two of Rogge are not afraid of death. They usually have the same taste as several aristocratic youths. Now they know that they are not good enough to fight. Therefore, no one has even retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate is unique to Paulus. He is full of vindictiveness and confronts Paulus's seemingly endless amount of vindictiveness. At this time, Rogge said with a weak mouth: "Paulus, the princess is looking for me just to talk about the customs. You suspect that I am with the princess." If you have dyed, why don't you personally ask the Princess of the Princess to understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man cuts the key point, and Paulus rises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many metamorphos and quirks in the royal family. They are not news, let alone just small? Of course, these things are not recognized by anyone. To Paulus face to ask if Froya is in private with Rogge, and with the fierce means of the little witch, it is better to let him commit suicide directly. Don't look at Paulus's impassioned look, so that he is so generous to die, that is definitely not done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a struggle in his heart, Paulus had to give up his move to uphold the honor of the Lord. Before he could find a step for himself, there was a laugh in the distance. "Hey! Are the knights so early? I really admire the old man!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is Jinge, and there are dozens of fully armed men behind him. If intentionally unintentional, Jingo is in the middle of Paulus and Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulus estimates the situation, once it starts to move, it is the situation that is attacked by both parties. He immediately hit the ground of the Principality of Hahalon, and of course he should be careful. I just took the patrol camp with my men to see if there were any thieves who did something to do it! Since Jing Ge’s grown up is up, I can take a break. Knights, let's go! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the support of everyone, Rogge returned to his own camp. The aristocratic youth thought that Rogge had a fan, but Rogge only said that he was too tired. It was hard to send away the bad friends. Then he told Robsky to say: "I take a break, and you wake me up in an hour. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An hour later, when Robsky came in, Rogge had gotten up, and the signature smile was hung on the fat man's face. He was holding A magic book is studying hard. Under the hearts of Robsky, I admire him. After a big fight last night, I was tired like a dead man in the morning. After an hour of rest, I started to study magic again. It seems that adults are small and young, and it’s not just luck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team continues to go west, everyone seems to have nothing to do. In general, Rogge also regained his usual appearance, but no matter how the aristocratic youth forced him to ask the night, he would not die.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat in the carriage After a day of rest, I was called to the camp by Fu Luoya at night. But what disappointed everyone was that this time Rogge was quickly rushed out. The maid who came out of him was quite welcome. Luo Ya lost interest in Rogge and never summoned him at night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
