			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the glory of heaven and eight in the hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter eight glory<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful Asrofic Empire is the most extensive of the three empires, but the least populous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two empire of Austro-Hungarian and Delo are in the central part of the mainland where the Terran are concentrated. The surrounding aliens are not so strong, so the two empires are mainly focused on In other Terran countries. In the eyes of the two great emperors, the threats of the human races in front of them are far greater than those of the abyss. In the affluent South, the Terran countries are well-equipped and the magical civilization is very prosperous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with war, diplomacy and descent are often more direct and effective weapons of confrontation between countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Astrofic Empire is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire has been in the savannah with a cold climate and poor GDP since its inception. Surrounded by powerful aliens, the empire is far from the sporadic and weak aliens in the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northern part of the empire is the snow-capped snowfield that has not changed all the year round. For humans, the climate on the snowfield is extremely harsh, and it is almost a barren land. In addition to the occasional Warcraft, adventurers often find no supplies within a few hundred miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long ago, this snowfield was called "the ridiculous snowfield" by the locals. However, the ridiculous snowfield is a paradise for the Ice Warcraft, and it is also the cultivation ground of the silver saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snowfield is further north, it is the endless sea of ​​ice, the legendary island in the center of the ice wind has a giant island, the island is inhabited by the power A powerful ancient frost giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southern part of the empire straddles the towering central mountain range, separating Astrafik from the Southern Terran Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west of the empire is the world of dwarfs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year of the successful eviction of the Church of Light in the Church of the Silver. The long dwarf war broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For anyone, a dwarf who is smelt and powerful is a very difficult enemy. And their fortress is often the whole mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf War lasted for a hundred years and devoted all generations to the life of the Emperor, and finally ended in the hands of Feuerbach. Thousands of miles of mineral-rich hills and plateaus in the western part of the empire have since entered the empire. Several dwarven empire were destroyed, and the rest of the dwarves had to retreat into the mountains, where humans could hardly set foot, or to the depths of the earth, trying to win a small piece of survival from the abyss of abhorrent creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eastern part of the empire is dotted with mysterious dark forests. The forest is a paradise for all kinds of strange and powerful creatures. The Emperor Feuerbach had a great defeat here, and the two outposts built by the empire with countless warriors were completely leveled. The impoverished army had to return to the capital. People familiar with the imperial political situation know that the great emperor who has always regarded victory as his life is extremely dissatisfied with the city of Yunxiao. There are even more rumors that the real reason for the defeat is that Druid intends to introduce the Imperial Army into the Jedi. Otherwise, why explain that many of the very powerful but uniquely unique Warcraft will suddenly gather together and rush to the defense line of the Imperial Army? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great’s heart attacked the dark forest, rumored to find the dragon cemetery deep in the forest. Legend has it that keel grass growing on the sacral bones in the cemetery can greatly delay the speed of human aging. This is obviously a more enduring journey than becoming a dead soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of miles of dark forests have blocked the footsteps of the human army. In the east of the forest, there is only a handful of Terran strongest people to set foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vast wilderness of the northeast of the dark forest. Standing alone in a lonely mountain. Within a hundred miles of the mountain peaks, there are flat plateaus. Only this mountain peak, like a huge stone pillar, is straight into the sky, which is strange and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peaks of the mountain are dozens of miles high, several kilometers high, extremely steep, and the four walls are very smooth by the hurricane that has been going on for years. The summit is miraculously located in a grand and beautiful city. A thousand-year-old bright moon hovering over the city's kilometers above the city. The faint moonlight reflects the city below. Among those huge portals, silver dragons will always fly in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge silver figure gracefully landed on a small mountain peak hundreds of miles from Moonlight Dragon City. Another majestic silver dragon has already waited on the mountain for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majestic Silver Dragon first said: "Cranio, did you come because of the rude challenge?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Dear King. What is your decision?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The glory of Moonlight Dragon City cannot be in front of me Dim. I accept the challenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But those demons have killed the ancient emperor! With your body... you can't accept this challenge!" Cranio lost voice Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong King sighed heavily and said: "Except Nicholas. Gudi is the most powerful silver dragon in Moonlight Dragon City. He...he also died Is it less than a thousand years old..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio lowered his head and said sadly: "Respected king, this...this is all My fault. After I left, did the great Dragon God restore the care of the Silver Dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at the bleak glory of Moonlight Dragon City Cranio knew that the angry Dragon God not only failed to restore the silver dragon's care, but also probably cursed the curse because of her offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon King did not answer this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected King, I will say it again, you can't accept the challenge! The shameless Black Dragons will definitely take this opportunity to attack a lot. Moonlight Dragon City can't live without you. What's more, your body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cranio. I am old. But who else in the family is more suitable than me to accept this challenge? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon king’s counter-inquiry made Cranho speechless. In terms of individual strength, Nicholas is also sealed in the form of Elf, which is also inferior to the current Silver Dragon King. After all, the dragon's body has an incomparable natural advantage. What's more, although the silver dragon king is old, the melee power is no longer strong, but the power of the dragon language magic does not regress much as the age increases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected King, Gudi He... just died in front of me. It was then. I learned about the demons described in the gods. Terrible! This challenge, you...do not win. We can look for other solutions. Maybe you should not bother with the challenge. It is totally rude!"<br /><br />&nbsp Silver Dragon King laughed and said: "Cranio, do you want to say that I am likely to die under the devil's hand? Even then, what is the relationship? Up to two or three For a hundred years, I should also look for a place in my own sterling silver cemetery. The demonic challenge is an insult to the Moonlight Dragon City, and I must not avoid it. Let the Moonlight Dragon City glory ruin me for thousands of years. Hands! Cranio, you are still young, you can go after your own beliefs. But I am different, the responsibility of the king is higher than everything. For me, there is only one choice between survival and honor. Time flies So fast, it turns out that this king has been working for more than a thousand years. It seems that it has arrived. It’s time for everything to be given to the younger generation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio’s head was deep down, and the voice seemed to whimper: “Respect King, let me... let me take the challenge for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amber eyes of Silver Dragon King are full of compassion and love:" Cranho, you are not good at fighting. You go, deviate from the end of the dragon god road, maybe not completely dark. Can be selected as a prophet by the dragon god, you are not lacking talent in your body. What you need to do Just turn talent into strength. Now you are no longer a member of Moonlight Dragon City. Be careful in the future. There are strong people on this continent that can threaten the survival of Silver Dragon. These opponents also tend to behave as well. Holiness and nobility are not on the top. Chris Felena and Nicholas are precedents! In the future, you must remember that no matter whether you are facing a sly human or a dirty dwarf, you can't despise it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Cranio still wants to say something, but is Silver Dragon Interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon king wings open, the huge body slowly lifted into the gale of magic. Fly to Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its long dragons reverberate over the vast wilderness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The border between the empire and the Ayre Principality is full of lush virgin forests. This mountain environment has always been Druid's favorite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the forest, there is a team of about 100 people who are rushing. They are all agile and fly in the virgin forest. Whether it is the bush thorns on the ground. Or the poisonous snake World of Warcraft, can not affect their progress. Even on the way forward of this team. All the World of Warcraft are shunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a muffled sound, the entire forest seems to have shaken at this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fat figure jumped from the tree and stopped in front of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a wave of Druids in the team, and the soldiers behind them immediately dispersed, occupying a favorable position, and many soldiers jumped onto the tree. Then, with the screaming of the coldness of the forest, the enemy was blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't enjoy it in the empire, nothing to go to my country, what do you want to do?" Rogge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Druid took a few magic scrolls from his arms, and then replied coldly: "Prince Rogge, the Principality of Aray is also the territory of the empire. The city of the whole empire has a right to pass through the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "This is not the case. I am in the Principality of Alei. To be honest, I hate you Druid very much. I just decided that all Druids who entered the Principality of Are will be executed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three virtues Ruyi clenched the reel in his hand and prepared for the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge! Do you want to rebel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog snorted, : "When you have a life to live, let me study whether I will rebel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Druid suddenly felt a bit, and suddenly turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the team, the wind butterfly with a black tight armor is slowly falling from the sky. At the moment when her toes fell to the ground, the whole forest shook a little, as if her light body was as heavy as it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the butterfly's eyes is not deep. Finally, in the blue, the purple is shining. Under the soft touch of her right hand, the dark red giant wheel saw was dancing lightly. The whistling whistling sounds and the occasional dark red flames on the edge of the wheel saw always reminded the onlookers that they were terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly's light lips are slightly open, and the tongue is inadvertently licking the lips. Her silver-gray long hair began to be windless and automatic, and the mysterious pattern of black appeared on the clear face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a subtle sound coming from the surrounding woods. The heavily armed dark-faced soldiers of the moon appeared and surrounded the Druid Warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druids are well trained. Not waiting for Rogge to order murder. A Druid has already launched the reel in his hand, and a strong wind with numerous sharp wood thorns in the middle of the squad is facing Rogue! Another druid is surrounded by green fog. These green fogs seem to be slow and fast. In the twinkling of an eye, I crossed the outermost Druid warrior and rushed to the dark side of the moon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Druid just launched the magic scroll in his hand, and countless green vines were created out of thin air, and all three Druids were wrapped in it. A big green ball. As soon as the green ball fell to the ground, it drilled down the soil, and the speed was fast. It's like an iron ball sinking into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face changed, his hands were scratched, and his left foot was on the ground! The wood thorns that flew toward him all flew to the sky with his movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a muffled sound, and the forest shook again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the ground suddenly blasted, and most of the vine balls that had not been buried in the ground seemed to have been hit hard and flew out from the ground. Then a black flame column skyrocketed and hit the vine ball in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
