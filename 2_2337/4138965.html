			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如如梦章六上上<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章六曾<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Werner?" Feeling Weiner's strange reaction, Rogge screamed, but Wella seemed to lose all consciousness and did not respond to Rogge's cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly strange Rogge looked up from the fingers of Wei Na’s hand, but saw her twin crystal clear braids when I didn’t know when it was covered. A layer of faint light, everything outside can not be reflected in her eyes. Rogge frowned, slightly stepping back, leaving his forehead out of Wella's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s detachment failed to shake Weiner’s smattering, she still held that position, so she stood there, resembling a statue that was awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has seen such a Vena before: suddenly stuck in the air, unable to move. That time, Wella was almost hit by Nicholas with a full blow. At the moment, Rogge does not know what happened to Wella at this moment, but he thought that he should not be able to deal with the strange phenomenon in his memory. After thinking about it, he couldn’t think of any great power in his memory, enough to make Wella look like this. But the fat man is not worried about Wella's safety. He really doubts that there is something in this plane that can destroy her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s other moves were not allowed, but Roger’s paralysis was in the meantime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is not a good boy or a woman. Since he does not have to worry about the safety of Wella, his heart immediately moves again. The fat man reached out and tentatively patted Verna's face, she did not respond. Immediately, Rogge talked about her and hurried her. Rush into the reception room next door and put her on the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner has a golden cloud and slowly drifts on the antique style sofa. The faint eyes of the pale face, the loss of the bloody pink lips, let the Vena, who has always appeared in the strong posture, seem to be extraordinarily helpless and pleasing. Rogge's gaze has been fixed on her face, staring for a long time. At this time, Wella is like a perfect artwork. Exquisite and heartbreaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy for Rogge to look down from her face and press her hand on her chest. He suddenly saw it. The beautiful armor of Wella, which is decorated with gold and blue two-tone patterns, is so familiar. Rogge can even tell which layer he had left on the nail leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently stroked the demon lotus, and his heart was filled with emotion. Only when his fingertips crossed the soft peak of the curve of Weina's chest, the demon lotus suddenly slammed and all the patterns lit up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man passed a chill and he immediately bounced. Quickly drifted out of the room. It’s a pity that the fat man’s movement is still a little slower. The leaves on the demon lotus are like spring flowers, and the pieces are open. Then more than ten pale black ribbons are scattered from the nails, catching up with lightning. grid. Several streamers were wrapped around his hands and feet, and an irresistible force lifted the fat volley, and then pulled it to the square, thus fixing the fat man in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is undecided. A ribbon suddenly sharpened like a knife, and it was cut into the throat with lightning! Rogge was shocked. He couldn't afford to dodge. For a moment, his left eye was completely turned into a dragon's eye. A mouthful of blows, a hot air will blow the streamers. Brushing his neck and brushing a blood line on the skin of his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamer turned back like a spirituality and hit the chest of Rogge. This time the fat man got a little reaction time and immediately condensed into a silver in the chest and abdomen. Light shield, can't block the streamers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamer of the demon lotus contains tyrannical power, which shatters Rogge’s light shield in one fell swoop. However, it has not been able to continue because of the moment. Go back and take a break. And if there is a lightning bolt, cut it under the fat man! This time the fat man is not scared. In a hurry, he even condensed into a three-sided light shield in front of his lower body. Firmly protected the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon smashed the two-sided light shield and was finally intercepted by the third light shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, there are countless light shields blasting in front of Rogge, and a new light shield is condensed. For a time, silver swarf is like a meteor fire. They have sprung up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man jumped wildly, and he shouted two voices, but she was still as inactive as she was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the desperate predicament has spurred his potential, and Rogge’s spirit is fully motivated, and the light shields are blocked before the streamers, and there are many more lights. The shield whirls and cuts the streamer from the side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the streamer of the demon lotus has no physicality with Rogge’s light shield, the power contained in the two is far from heaven. All the horizontally cut light shields are blown into silver swarf in the tremors of the demon lotus streamers, and those light shields that intercept the front of the streamers and face their fronts are even worse, almost a touch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the streamer of the demon has already broken Rogge’s light shield, and the high-speed fluttering of the streamer’s front end blows the breeze and has gently touched it. The skin at the throat of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighed and closed his eyes and died. He did not expect that his meticulously prepared means of life would come in handy so quickly, and it was used in this situation. It is a pity that the rare magic materials he has tried to find. After this time, I don’t know what year and month, he will be able to prepare another life-saving opportunity for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's streamer suddenly stopped and patted on Rogge's head, and he took it back. Not only this one, all the devil's streamers have been taken back, and the open nails are once again closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina sat up from the sofa and smiled and said: "It’s really rare, you didn’t have a mess this time.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was frightened and took a breath, then he was unwilling to say: "This time because I am worried about you, so I have no intentions to start. You actually lie to me! Good, very good, next I will never be so polite once!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina smiled and said, “Next time? Ok!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge noticed that Weiner’s smile was a little reluctant, and immediately asked, “What’s wrong? What did you see in my memory?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." Wella seemed to sigh softly. She is flying up. Hidden into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment her back looks a bit bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stayed in the room for a while, knowing that he couldn’t answer the question, so he hurried out and continued to do his own thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frenzied space turbulence contains endless sinister dangers, and if you are not careful, you will get involved in this turbulent flow, and people will be destroyed. Even if power is as strong as Wella. Not willing to stay in this place. Perhaps only the gods with powerful gods can open up a stable field in the turbulent flow between the planes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner countercurrently, carefully avoiding gaps in large and small spaces presented in various ways. In this place. The most terrifying thing is that some tiny planes, as well as some strange planes that have exits in the turbulent space, but have no light exposure. This plane is like a hidden vortex in the sea. Once it is involved, it is such a presence as Wella, and it is difficult to compete with the gravitation of the entire plane, and it is difficult to escape the fate of being swallowed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally. There is a soft glow in front of Wella, a safe island in the raging sea. The outline of a space door is faintly visible in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena jumped from the storm and disappeared into the space door in a blink of an eye. The light of the space door faded away, and the raging space storm restored the original violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of crossing the door of the space, Wella suddenly felt a dizzy, full of strength, and fell down. Not yet waiting for her to gather strength, the toes have already touched the field. She is awkward. Almost fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina finally settled down and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sky here, there are no sun, moon and stars, no clouds of clouds, looking up, just a darkness of nothingness. There is no land here. Looking down is also nothing, but there is an invisible force that constitutes the invisible earth, supporting the body of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three powerful statues each carry a large steel chain, and the other end of the steel chain is fixed on a beautiful temple floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall is more singular and strange. It is made up of countless huge, slender, and willow-like pieces of metal. If a flower bud is not contained, it stands alone in the abyss. Looking from afar, this air hall is exquisite and gorgeous. However, these metal sheets are actually huge. It has a short length of more than ten meters and a length of up to 100 meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal piece is decorated with gold and blue two-tone patterns. It is dark when it is clear. Occasionally, there will be a strong light running through these patterns, and the light in the moment will reflect the whole strange space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stayed for a moment, and then walked to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire space is full of invisible and mysterious pressures, which are not strong, but irresistible. Because of this existence of pressure, Wei Na could not take off and fly, and only chose to walk to the distant hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina tried a few lifts and had to give up. Because this pressure does not come from the difference in strength, but in the spatial characteristics of the field itself. The existence of the pressure is derived from the gap between the two levels of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the kingdom of the wind, the domain of the gods that have been opened up from nothingness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have sensed the arrival of Wella, and the domain of the gods suddenly changed faintly. Every step of Wella's step will span thousands of times. In the twinkling of an eye, she has come to the air hall along an invisible ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petals of the hall slowly descended, revealing the entrance to the hall that is dozens of meters behind. In front of such a temple, Wella, who still maintains the appearance of ordinary humans, looks like a little flying insect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina finally stepped into the hall of the windy month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the hall of hundreds of meters, stands a huge ice crystal, and the wind is still a silver dress, black hair like a mirror, quietly volley Standing before the ice crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are drooping, like falling into a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hall. Wella was finally able to take off and stand in front of the wind. In their previous relationship, Fengyue is now extremely rude, but Wella is not angry, only sighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at the wind and the moon, Wella is like talking to himself: "Fengyue, I accidentally discovered that Achilles took the heavens." The memory stayed in Rogge's consciousness. Hey. Achilles... I don't really understand him until now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Moon's Eyes Slow Slowly open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before her. The image of Moonlight Dragon City emerged slowly. On the endless wilderness, Rogge is flying towards the Moonlight Dragon City, while Achilles is floating in the air, walking side by side with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Space is a wonderful thing, no matter which direction I am going, I will get closer and closer to O'Reilly..." Achilles The soft voice echoed in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flutters while frowning. However, he did not notice. A little red, if nothing, flew out of Achilles's fingertips, and sneaked into his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a rebellious seed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, it is darkness, absolute darkness, and no information can be read from this memory. They know that this period of time is the time when Achilles returns to heaven. All memories of heaven are erased when angels leave heaven.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The darkness finally passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles appears again in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I just want to see you..." Achilles smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew in the wind and his sleeves flew. Fly to the final cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the scenery has passed away, leaving only the bald head, barefoot, and enchanting Achilles in the air. He looked at Wella, smiled a little, and each eye had a red line slowly falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then everything goes to nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the silence of the hall finally sounded cold and indifferent: "What did Achilles finally put?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s fierce hands, the sacred glory gradually lit up in the hall, and then the three million-eyed gods emerged from the void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Fengyue just fell on this god, and immediately closed their eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god that should be just a phantom seems to be aware that someone is peeking at it, tens of thousands of eyes on the side of the wind and moon The fierce deity is overwhelming. Become the real master of the Temple of the Winds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue closed eyes. Arms around the chest seemed to fall into the deepest sleep. Do not let a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of faces in the body of the gods are alive, falling out or doubting, or angry, or cold expression, constantly glance around, trying Looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of faces seem to have alarmed one of the three huge heads that lie at the top of the gold tower. The shiny, metallic, statue-like face moved a little, and the eyes closed tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sees the situation is not good, a clear drink, a burst of dazzling brilliance between the hands, completely destroy the memory of the Achilles legacy. This dispelled its image before the gods opened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is again in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the wind month did not open your eyes again, just coldly asked: "Who is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "From the memory of his legacy, this should be the main god of the destruction of the Heavenly Division, Des Mason. He ... he does not even need to use force, as long as the body enters the plane, it is enough to make the vast majority of the plane The collapse of the space structure caused disasters that destroyed everything. So in many legends, Desmassen is the creator of the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena The voice echoed in the hall of nothingness, and it sounded a hint of sadness, but she did not know that she was in the sadness of the resounding red eyes, or in the sad days of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is silent for a moment, and asks: "Why do you know the main god like Desmason?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The order of divine power is one of the greatest secrets of the heavens. When we leave the heavens, in addition to the main god directly related to the mission, the information of other gods and gods with their duties will be erased."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina sighed with a sigh, gently said: "Achilles has done what he can do. He finally wants to tell us that time is running out." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Fengyue finally said: "Weina, you have no progress in the realm. Otherwise, you will not put the memory of Desmasson directly Before my eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, the voice of indifference has finally had a little emotional fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina shook her head and turned to the outside of the hall Fly away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the Temple of the Air was silently closed behind her, separating the two goddesses who were born in the same origin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wide hall, it is lonely again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what year and month, this loneliness will be broken again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
