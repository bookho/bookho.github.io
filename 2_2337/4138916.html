			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is clear, the white clouds are like a little bit of cotton on the blue screen. The wind came from afar, pushing a stream of clouds to pass by, and going north with incredible degrees, like a beast. The underground is heavily stacked, the mountains are competing, and the peaks and valleys are intertwined. Everything is so familiar, whether it is in the sky or underground. Standing tall and overlooking, the sky is full of heaven and earth, and the mountains and mountains are all in sight. The plains and rivers are unobstructed. However, the sacred dragon flying in the sky has revisited the place, and it has already lost the previous happy mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time it was like a well-prepared opera director, just keep on commanding, and the actors on the stage would sing and dance. Gregory really missed the stage when the silver miracle was commanded to turn around, and it was a good time for everyone to play the striker! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, it’s his turn to play the role of the silver miracle himself, and the conductor is the master of Vera standing on its back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a world of difference, Gregory’s uneasiness for his situation, of course, is only in its wide dragon belly. Finally arrived at the destination, the bluestone mountains where the frosty giants live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has a dragon, the loud and majestic tone can be compared with the hymn of the song God, but the fly in the ointment is that the tail is so high that it is a bit Trembling. On the top of the Bluestone Peak, the frosty giants who flocked out from the stone houses would not have thought that this was the result of the God Dragon seeing them immediately scared to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courage has never been the name of Gregory. Now it has forgotten the advantages and benefits of agility and stealth, and regrets not earlier. Showing my ability to defend, I am very sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory of the Rock, this name is very safe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s on the verge of thinking, Wella has already shouted: “What are you doing so high? Go on!” Gregory was shocked and looked at it. The frosty giant on the ground is getting scared. The Frostman's throwing spear is extremely horrible. It can easily penetrate a dragon with a dragon scale. The only shortcoming of their long-range attack is that the range of throwing a spear is very limited. Although Gregory is as good as electricity, it is still a great risk to fly between the spears thrown by dozens of frost giants at the same time. "Go down!" Wella is already impatient. Gregory trembled, and it was even more horrible to weigh the frosted giant's throwing spear and the anger of the Vena master. In fact, there is nothing to weigh in this. In the middle of the giant's throwing spears, the two masters can also find a way to resurrect it, at most for it to rebuild a body. However, angering Wella, the soul immediately dissipated is already a very good ending. Gregory remembered the silver miracle, and remembered the dragon soul gun in the hands of Weina, and her heart trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It confessed, a hovering, while blessing all the defensive magic that can be used, and swooping down to the Frost Giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory finally shows the ability to practice in the world of death, those days that are struggling on the edge of life and death, the huge body is like no weight, Under the traction of the strange forces, draw a strange trajectory, and walk through the spears of the spears that rushed in the air, and there was no harm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times the sharp spears almost wiped the eyelids of Gregory. The sacred dragon is desperately searching for the intestines, even if it is going to make up a few offensive magics, and this is the fate of being used as a target for throwing a spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咻! A powerful throwing spear has been wiped from the neck of Gregory! Although the throwing spear did not touch its body, the raging wind has opened a few dragon scales! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s brain suddenly became blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s suddenly stunned, and an earth-shattering dragon! The arrogant dragon was slammed down, and the powerful scorpion giant was instantly shocked by Longwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the slamming of the heavens and the earth, Gregory fell among the frost giants, causing the smoke of the sky. Several frost giants have been hit by the huge body of the sacred dragon! Gregory screamed, his front paws swayed, and he took a few terrible horrible wounds on the chest of a giant in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dragon turned his head and screamed at the Frostman who was just standing up and preparing to encircle him! Longwei is like an unrivaled huge wave, and once again the giants will be shocked! The rest of the giants also took advantage of it for a moment, and involuntarily retreated a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rare for the sacred dragon to remain silent, and did not seize this excellent opportunity, and the slap in the face of the master's flattering is to praise the master of Wella. In fact, the loyal Gregory is not brave enough to go to the extreme, but the fear is to the extreme, afraid that there is no terrible, the rest is desperate. Its silence is not that it has been transferred to the humble Gregory, but to be scared and not to be heard. The third dragon wave spread silently, but this time the impact on the frost giants is much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory screamed, and the magic of the whole body flashed, suddenly leaping and fleeing to the far side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dragon’s assault hit the giants by surprise, and its escape was also a big surprise. Until it had flown a hundred meters, the giants reacted. They saw that the sacred dragon seemed to have been wounded, always flying at low altitude, and the degree was not too fast, so they rushed to chase down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a giant who looks very young is left to take care of the injured companion. The sacred dragon's melee strength is not strong, but it is relative to their horrible magical ability. Gregory's solid all-out claw almost opened the frost giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young giant squats, bandaging the wound for the injured giant. In the standard of the Frost Giant, her movements have been extremely careful, but still accidentally tore the konjac leather arm of the injured giant. She just wrapped it in half and the action suddenly froze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injured giant’s wound was pulled a bit, and he couldn’t help but scream, and some strangely opened his eyes, just to see that the young giant’s forehead suddenly had a more Crystal war gun tip! The silver light in the guns seems to have infinite suction to absorb the vitality of the young giants bit by bit. The face of the young giant was quickly defeated, and the plump cheeks began to sag, like a flower was withering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injured giant was shocked and turned to sit up! He had a flower in front of him, and Wella, who was wearing a demon, had appeared in front of him. Wella's wrist turned, and the Dragon Soul Warrior took an electric light and fell into his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the giants are dim. Wella's left hand and five fingers, such as orchids, opened the giant soul to catch the soul, and then inhaled the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wena closed her eyes in the air, motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, her lips were slightly squirted, and a cloud of green mist was sprayed, then her eyes slowly opened, and it began to shine with golden light. The golden cross star emerged faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She frowned slightly, dissatisfied with the earth: "This is also considered the blood of the ancient giants? The power is too bad! I don't know if I can catch up." Complaints are useless, and no matter how you complain, it will not increase the power of the Frost Giant. She looks into the distance, and the sacred dragon is being chased up and down by a group of giants, fluttering around, and being embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina smiled coldly and couldn’t stand in the void. Every flash disappeared a hundred meters away from the hidden place, followed by the frosty giants. The moment has gone far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor is now in a state of turmoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete is so troubled, all the contradictions of the various forces have surfaced. In particular, after knowing the content of the goddess of the goddess of ice and snow, Rogge has dispelled all fantasies and began to kill the machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man never intended to let go of the silver sacred religion. His original fantasy was to pretend to reconcile with the sacred religion, and then find an opportunity to destroy the silver sacred religion. It is also possible to blame the crime on others. It is best to drop one or two political enemies by the way. He is very busy every day, all in the process of figuring out how to deploy the manpower, how to mobilize the troops, and how to push the plot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, most of the military power in the empire is held in the hands of Alexander and Pompey. Rogge can’t mobilize the army at all, but the imperial locals are sparse and cannot be carried out across the board. Blockade monitoring, so the fat man still secretly transferred the dark side of the Elf Moon and the Tickton Warriors to the vicinity of the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bauhinia butterfly that protects Ett and others from leaving the center of the storm with Rogge’s warrants, led hundreds of fine riders, and rushed back to Aleigong day and night. country. As soon as she went back, she used the name of self-respect and frequently mobilized the power of the Principality. Every training camp seemed to be in full swing. In fact, it was mostly the recruits of the year and the leaders of the nobility. Most of the Gongxuan troops had secretly assembled to the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is not going to solve the abyss gap for Straw. This thing will not be removed one day, and Straw will not dare to confront him one day. However, under the constant urging of Straw, Rogge had to do something, and to Tiffany, please Wendy to the emperor and his party. However, the temperamental Wenna was killed and refused to leave Tiffany. On the surface, Rogge sighed and sighed at Straw, but he was actually in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Palace once again remained silent in this battle. Rogge has tried several times to test the attitude of the bosses to the religious war. Whether he is knocking on the side, smashing the baggage or insinuating the metaphor, in the face of Sarah Wenger, all the skills are invalid. As long as each topic is smeared, Sarah Wenger is just like an old man, just shaking his head and looking completely unaware of what Rogge is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, Rogge only has a bitter smile, so I always take care of any action when planning any action. At these times, presumably Alexander and Pompey have also tested the attitude of the imperial palace, but they have no results, so their actions are as cautious and restrained as Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there is no room for warmth in religious wars. Here, you will only see how bloody and cruel are interpreted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the empire, the church of the Eye of Wisdom has been burned except for the one that Mora and the madman are stationed. Appointing a person, as long as it has a relationship with the eye of wisdom, will attract holy people to attack. There are also many people who are not motivated to take the opportunity to ignite. They may have conspiracy, or simply want to get some benefit from the riots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This all confirms the phrase "The goddess of ice is never a tolerant god". Whether O'Reilly is a tolerant god is still unclear, but the fat man is by no means a character with tolerance. Under his instigation, the believers who fully searched the silver saints in the Principality of Aray, once they were present, were secretly executed. Rogge also set up a heresy trial center with reference to the system of the Guangming Church. However, if there is a swearing in the territory of the Principality that dare to say that the goddess O'Reilly is swearing, first grab it and kill it, then throw it into the black prison. As for when to release, no one knows. The establishment of the heretical trial is still short, and it is still inaccessible so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Virgin Mora led dozens of mad believers and nearly a thousand devotees who firmly held the last stronghold in the empire. At these moments of rain, the Virgin Mora fully demonstrated the other side of her iron-and-blood decision, directly enchanting the city owner of Zolamu City and taking the actual control of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thousands of silver saints sang the hymns of the goddess of ice and snow to the city, ready to burn the last church of the eye of wisdom, greet them It’s the dozens of madmans who are lined up in the city’s head, and the fireballs that are overwhelming. Hundreds of victims of screaming in raging fire did not dispel the courage of the rest of the believers. These believers, who only carried simple weapons, screamed and charged the city of Zolamu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mora is different from Rogge of the time. The sacred woman who believes in life is determined and unwavering. She calmly commands the mad believer, after the three waves of fireball, it is the free time of the mad believer. At this moment, Mora’s body was shining, and at this moment, she was so holy that she could not be obsessed! Under her sacred radiance, the madman's ability to cast spells has increased dramatically. Although the magic power cannot be increased, the spell cast and power are improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If life is like grass, then Mora is a farmer at the moment, commanding the farmer to harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siege of the silver saints is more like a martyrdom. After leaving more than a thousand dead bodies, the rest of the believers are not allowed. Do not leave. This is the first big setback of the silver saints in this religious war. But how many thousands of believers in the goddess of ice and snow? The life of thousands of believers is nothing more than adding a pile of dry wood to the flame of hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe God is ruthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Reilly soon showed her power. Unlike the goddess of ice and snow, she does not show the majesty before the secular mortal, but in the eyes of the knower, the wrath of the Austrian Rex is more trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This late night, Xiusi sneaked into Rogge’s study and talked with the fat man for a long time. Rogge looked surprised, but then calmed down and discussed with Hughes, he took the powerful ones out of the nest and began to arrange overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Reilly, the goddess who lived in the city of floating, began to recruit the many powerful men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the destination is at the intersection of the icy ocean and the snow-capped mountains on the northern extreme border of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many strong respondents have different responses to this call. The most responsive of the reaction was to smother Winner, who was half-deceptive and deceived. He jumped up almost at the first time he was called, and shouted: "Aha! The city of floating, I am coming!" Then he grabbed a coat and hurriedly left Tiffany to the north. go with. The eyes of the Death Class were bright, and they followed Wena to leave. Anyway, except for a fine sword that never leaves, there is no other baggage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
