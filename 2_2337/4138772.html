			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Mora, Rogge took a break and set off for the military camp of the Tikton Warriors. The first 30 sets of heavy armor specially built for the Tiketon warriors have been shipped from the city of the gods. He wants to see for himself how effective the heavy armor is, and whether it is suitable for the soldiers of the Tikton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create this heavy weight is time-consuming and costly. There is a set of heavy armor, and ten sets of ordinary knights have been built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tickton warriors have fought with beasts in the mountains for many years, and have always been wearing short armor. The craftsmanship and armor craftsmanship of the Tikton people who have lived in the mountains for a long time are very rough. Not to mention that they cannot compare with the dwarves and elves, even the manufacturing standards of human beings are not comparable. Zagul’s giant bow is extremely powerful, but in terms of craftsmanship and magical attributes, it is not only far less than the weapon of the elf king’s bow, but even the magical longbow of the elves. It is a lot stronger than it. It is such a long bow that does not look like it was made by the Tikton himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Rogge, the lack of equipment in the Tikton warrior can not be compensated by extraordinary force. Equipment can be bought, and elite warriors can't buy it. Like the dark side of the moon, any damage to the strong and fierce Tikton warrior will make him feel very painful. With these outfits from the Elf Hand, the Tickton Warriors will increase their combat power or survival rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stepped into the Tiketon Barracks, the thirty Tiketon warriors in them had already put on the whole body that shined with the faint glow of the green. Various actions are being tested. They wowed and screamed, and they were not used to this kind of armor. There were also a number of elf craftsmen who escorted this armor. They constantly adjusted the position of the armor and recorded the requirements of the Tikton warriors for the armor. It’s just that these elf craftsmen are indifferent to the Tikton warriors, just like what hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are very uncomfortable with the heavy armor, they are very fond of the steel tomahawk that came with them. These tomahawks are extremely heavy, and even the thick axe handles are made of stainless steel, and the whole body shines with blue light. The blue edge of the Tomahawk's edge is faintly visible. It is obviously reinforced by the magical flame. The weight of nearly a hundred pounds is not a problem for the Tiketon warrior, but for ordinary human warriors, being brought to the side by such a tomahawk is a fatal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy arrow throwing spear that the Tickton warrior likes is also sent to the city of the gods for research. The throwing spear weight and throwing skills of each Tikton warrior are not the same. In Charlie's view, this unit still has great potential to dig, and the spears are only uniform, and the power can be maximized. In the eyes of Rogge, the length of throwing spears is a great waste. He decided that in addition to those soldiers with special skills, ordinaryiketon warriors use standard throwing spears. This is good production, and not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagour is also on the field. Seeing that Rogge also came, he put down the heavy armor in his hand and greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, Zachur, still adapt to these heavy armor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s a bit awkward to wear, and the movements are not so flexible. But these body armor is not really strong! Our craftsmen at Tickton can’t make such a good armor and tomahawk!” Zagul’s voice is heroic, completely Do not taboo the weakness of the Tickton tribe. "In my opinion, this thing will be of great use on the battlefield! When I played against the Principality of the Snowy Mountain, I once had a headache for one of their heavy infantry units. Their armor was very thick. It's hard to cut through the puncture. And these heavy armor, I think it's twice as thick as those worn by the heavy infantry. You can rest assured that Rogge, my children are carrying this turtle shell!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded. Gul adults can understand my pains. One more thing. I recently heard that there are a few unpleasant things about the Tiketon warriors and my elves. I want to know what is going on? “<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur’s glimpse, asked back: “Is this the case? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warrior Ma Yila who had tried with Rogby on the same day replied: "Uncle Zagur, this is the case." Yesterday, Tate met a few elf warriors. He felt that it would be a magician or any other profession to use the elf's body shape. It is just too weak to say that he is a warrior. Later... Later he had some conflicts with the elf warriors, and Tate injured several elves. But afterwards I had already apologized to the elves by Detta. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at Zagul calmly. Zagol’s face became more and more ugly, and a whisper cursed a tat and knew that it would cause me trouble. !Maila, you will not see it in the future, no longer let him step out of the military camp!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait! Majla, you just said that you apologized, not Tate's own apology? And," Rogge frowned, looking at Zagur: "Zagur, You have also done so many years of leadership, you should know that justice is the most important quality of a collar. Tate is injured by a few ordinary elf archers, does this help the reputation of the Tiketon warrior? And he is not willing to apologize, dare to do it, and dare not do it. He refuses to admit his mistake. Is this what a warrior should do? If you are in my position, you have this kind of thing. "What do you do with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue Master" Majla's tone is very respectful, "Tickton warriors only respect the real strong, elves It’s not wrong to cooperate with the warrior. Tate’s grumpy, but still temperate, the few elves are not heavy. It’s really that the elf’s physique is too weak to be beaten by Tate. The attack was wounded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the battle was almost killed by Rogge Roger Mayer pull treat the attitude is completely changed, as she said, the Celtics Dayton soldiers only respect the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maila! Shut up! Go and hang up Tate and smack him fifty lashes! So he can't climb up! Then He was not allowed to leave the military camp for half a month!" Zagul yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "Master Zagul, this can't completely blame Tate. If you want to blame, you should blame me for canceling the last two contests. You still Remember the swordsman Andre in the first game of the day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur's face was ugly, but he nodded. He is very clear that the strength of Voltaire by Androni is to end himself, but it can only support one more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All I can say is that there are more powerful fighters than Andrea in my elves." Rogge said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" Majla screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maila! Why are you so rude! Can Rogge lie?" Zagur snorted. He turned to Rogge again: "I am sorry for Rogge! My children are not used to the calm life in front of them, and they are not used to getting along with outsiders. I will restrain them in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, Master Zagul. The calm in front is only temporary, and soon I will send someone to explain the specific tactics of heavy infantry. Zagor is, you can rest assured, mention The Croton warriors will soon have the opportunity to prove their courage and value on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog thought for a moment and said: "Zagour Adults, I don't know much about the fighting style of the Tiketon warriors. If you think that there is something worth improving in our heavy infantry tactics, even if it is put forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the Grand Duke, Rogge stayed alone in the study and thought about the things of the Tiketon warriors. These warriors are used to freedom and arrogance, and there is almost no military discipline. Their combat effectiveness is also greatly reduced. Tate’s injury to the elf is not a big deal, but it’s also negligent. Although he is the god of the elves, he has the supreme authority of the elves, and can easily suppress the dissatisfaction. But if you reproduce this kind of thing in the army of the Terran, it is not so easy to flatten. It seems that the military discipline should be the most important part of training the Tiketon warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was meditating, the door was gently opened, and Froya came in. She walked straight to Rogge, sat on his large desk and looked at Rogge in a provocative way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, how come you? Look at you like this, must there be any good news to tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, there is good news, there is also a bad news, which one do you want to listen to first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog smiles lightly I patted the little hand of Froya and saw you like it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin eats a fat man and never forgets to take advantage of it. Are you taking less time these days? Well, tell you, the good news is Dragon poison has been refined successfully! It should be effective for Yinlong, but unfortunately it can't be tried. It has special effects for other dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge overjoyed, one He picked up Fu Luoya and turned it around for two laps, then he kissed him in one bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge asked, "What bad news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This poison is not only effective for Silver Dragon, but also for other creatures, and it is There is a miraculous effect. You think, even the silver dragon that is basically immune to poison is poisonous. What else is resisting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened, Can not help but frown. The dragon-shooting gun was too violent, and with this huge poison, it would not work with the point. In the future, it seems that there is no living under the gun. In that case, the dragon-throwing gun became a weapon that could not be used at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria's hands hooked on Rogge's neck and looked at his eyes deeply: "Little Rogge, why do you want me to study this poison?" Is there really a silver dragon to come to you to avenge you? Who was the "silver miracle" Nicholas that the death class said that day? Is it the silver dragon to retaliate? When we killed the silver dragon that day, it was very secret, how could the news leak? Going out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and asked me, where did I know? God knows why the silver dragon will find me. But the kind of death class should not be okay to run out to scare me. "There is still a layer of hidden worry that he did not say, that is, Xiusi will not give him such a dragon slaughter gun for no reason.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat man ! The Death Class took the initiative to send a chick to you, and you didn’t accept it. It’s weird. Are you getting better? Also, have you secretly had a few women carrying me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted, is it so easy to receive the chick? Do you think that I don't want to have a death class standing on my side? But this kind of person is not So I easily deceived it. I really don’t feel anything about that little girl. It’s totally deceptive to say how much she really treats her. When the time of death is the truth, this anger, I really did not ask for a death to come back? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stared deeply at Rogge's eyes, hooked his neck and slowly gathered, softly and femininely said: "Ronaldinho Ge, no, please, there are a lot of deaths around you! For example, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her red lips are round and tender, if they want to drip out water, Like Zhang, it is constantly expanding in front of Rogge’s eyes. Immediately, his lips came up with a feeling of cold and slippery, and a scent of fragrant scent penetrated his lips flexibly. Rogge's hands were tight, and the strength was so great that Froya slid gently in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was still cautious at the beginning, always paying attention to the response of Fu Luoya. She half-closed her eyes, her arms tightened and tightened, and her breathing was a rush, and there was no discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are closed, and concentrate on enjoying the rare warmth of this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the door was knocked open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roger, there is something big..." Charlie suddenly appeared in this fragrant scene, could not help but swallow the following words back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblins and Rogge are separated, and the two are thick, not far from what Charlie can imagine. Froya still sat on Rogge's lap, hugged his neck tightly, and did not mean to go down. After a Charlie walked away, he would continue to walk. Rogge saw that she refused to come down, naturally she would not take the initiative to catch her lower body, a big hand still holding her waist and not swaying up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie coughed, and concealed his own slightness, and restored the usual calm and calm: "Rogge, this news is also a bit with His Royal Highness Relationship. The news from the South said that the Bavarian Principal took a day to attack Rothschild, and the Magister Jerome and the Great Warlock Lhasa were seriously injured and managed to escape to the Rhine."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" Rogge and Froya exclaimed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roschel, who had the defense of two great magisters, was defeated, and it was so miserable, so thorough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge calmed down and said: "Charlie, is there a detailed battle report for this battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;Folk also lost the calm of the weekdays, jumped from Rogge and asked: "My master's injury is not heavy? How can he be injured? I have already sinned when I left. The country 'returned to him! Is it the hand of Prossian old bastard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible for Froya to put down the snack a little. My master has a magic wand. Although it can be used less often, it is okay to send two people after the magic array is arranged at both ends. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge repeatedly stepping through the house, he really can't suppress the shock in his heart!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp [&nbsp; For a long time, compared with the martial artists who received the holy name, the big magician is a more fearful existence. The magic of the top ten magisters is different, but for ordinary people, the power is the same horror. On the battlefield, a cloud of fire from Jero can easily kill the lives of hundreds of soldiers. A different space creature called by Lhasa, who can communicate with the ectopic plane, is also enough to tear dozens of knights into pieces. They didn't consider their infinite magical equipment, a lot of low-level magic spelling ability, etc. Once the big magician succeeded in moving high-level magic, the same-level Sanctuary warriors often had to flee.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the Great Magister is a symbol of invincibility.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Sanctuary can deal with the Sanctuary This is the deep-rooted belief of the people. The Dro Empire dares to confront the bright church and wants to In the marriage of the Union League, in addition to its own national strength, there is another important reason for wanting to recruit the two great magisters of Jero and Lhasa. The Rheinland League is located between the two empire of Austro-Hungary and Dro. However, I still dare to move around in the war, and I don’t put the bright church in my eyes. An important reason is because there are three strong people in the sanctuary. No country’s royal family is willing to sin at the same time to sin many people in the sanctuary. Can resist the attack of 100,000 troops, but destroy a palace, only need a sneak sneak into the big magician is enough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So despite Rothschild’s There are only 10,000 defenders, and the besieged troops of the Principality are full of 100,000 people. But with the help of two great magisters, there are more troops in the besieged city, and the best strategy is still to attack. Marshal Serio adopted this strategy, and only the fortresses of the two great magisters were not attacked. At the same time, the soldiers marched into the hinterland of the Rhine League and eventually forced the two magisters to withdraw to Rothschel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This time the Bavarian Principality coalition attacked Rothschild, and everyone still thought that Marshal Rosio would use the same tactics, splitting Rothschild, and fighting against the Rhine League under the Rhine. After all, under the guard of the city defense, big The magician can not attack his own safety, and he will attack the opponent with full force. The power will be multiplied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but everyone’s surprise, this time Marshal Rocherio even attacked Rothschild, and it was forced to attack the two great magisters after a battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The myth of an era was finally shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought for a long time, looked up and looked at Charlie. Although the two did not speak, they all understood each other's meaning. With a dozen, Rosscher is definitely unstoppable. So the key now is how many people Los Rosso has lost. The offensive has the big magician to defend the city's past recognition of the best strategy is to attack but not attack, the main reason is that the troops are too heavy casualties. Attacking a small city like Rothschild, if Marshal Rosherio lost more than 30,000 soldiers, it would be a failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie, do you remember the terrain around Rothschild?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checkpoint Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "Well, let's make a Rosscher's sandbox out as soon as possible. Let's take a good look at how this battle is going back tonight. Froya, come with you too. The magical power of Master Jero and Master Lhasa, you are clearer than us all. Right, Andrea is also called."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is finally bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, Charlie, Fulia and Androni came out of the study. Sleeping all night makes their eyes black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of this night’s repeated deductions are shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the steps and tactics of normal siege warfare, the two great magisters can appear in the most critical part of the attack in time, and use their own magic to the siege Take a fatal blow. Especially in the battle for the city, Rothschel, who has two great mages, is almost invincible. Combined with the results of various siege tactics, the attacker's losses will be more than 30,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
