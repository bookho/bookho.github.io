			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, even if someone can understand it, it will never be Rogge. Knowing that it can't be done for nothing, this stupid thing, Rogge, is determined not to do it, so he can't talk about Doyle's appreciation, and he has no intention of respect. Since Doyle wants to die, he will complete it, so that he will have trouble afterwards. Rogge turned his mind and the hand holding the tomahawk could not help but tighten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei stood in front of Doyle and shouted: "If you want to kill, kill me first!" Rogge's gaze Staring at Qi Wei, I saw Qi Wei shaking, and I was going to go forward, but I didn’t dare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s gaze flashed, and Qiwei’s breastplate suddenly moved, but this time it’s a half-length chain mail, but it’s not something that can be won. Rogge’s smile on the mercenary group’s standard is good, really good. "Qi Wei was shocked, and remembered the past, his face was red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s voice gradually became more severe: "At the beginning, our brothers met you at the pub. Although my brother has a little rude, it is you who first hit someone! ? Hey, at that time, we have almost no magical martial arts, but you are already experienced mercenaries, and you have to play more and less, and learn your name! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei bite her lower lip and wants to refute it, but she can’t think of anything. At that time, I wanted to come, several middle-level mercenaries were hurting Europe. The hairy head of the house is rogue. Although the other party has something wrong, it doesn't seem to be justified.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the time of the tavern, you Qiwei Miss, and your heroic and invincible companions, probably never thought that they would be beaten by several aristocratic teenagers! Indeed, our means are not glorious, and the style of play is not enough. But a few teenagers who have no level of combat experience, and who have never had any combat experience, are the masters of the mercenary who are at least eight, or the eleventh-level mages, or are they playing less, is it a duel? That is life! Although we are not glorious, but on the battlefield, the living is king, so I have no worries! We are despicable, but at least we will not be bullying when we are strong and weak! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s words are justified, and the impassion is arrogant, but it is not true. Different, in the case of less enemies and more can eat the other party, it is self-defeating, but also by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Qi Wei, you lose I lost, and I want to retaliate and kill afterwards. Is this okay? I am not lucky enough on that day, I am afraid that I have already become the soul of Miss Qi Wei’s sword! I really want to know, why should you come to me for revenge? First, I played more and less, and later I wanted to retaliate and kill. In the end, I was reckless and killed many soldiers of the City Defense Army. It was a dead and awkward death. It was not too much! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei's face is flushed, and the lower lip almost bites the bleeding. The audience sees Rogge's disappointment, and Wei Wei is speechless. Wei’s eyes can’t help but feel a bit more skeptical<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More people have dismissed the practice of Qi Wei and others. All along, the mercenary group has been more or less When the politicians are jealous, they are extremely cautious and careful when they act. They are not going to have no way to go, and they will never conflict with the government and the army. The country of mercenaries, known as the mercenary, has much less restrictions on mercenaries. Large-scale mercenary groups such as Ice and Snow Silver Fox, Hundred Warfare Mercenaries, and Devils Sirius. Relatively speaking, such large mercenary groups must be stricter. In return, Ron’s Principality is threatened by foreign enemies. At that time, the mercenary group must do its utmost to help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer has absolute prestige in this squad, it is the servants who saw him challenged Rogge. The way is almost to die, this is in spite of the rules of the mercenary community, to help each other. But lost the king of the kingdom defense army, the right The mercenary group is a very serious problem. What's more, it is not a person who is killed. It is a soldier. This is not just a miss. It is a servant group that has always been used to arrogance. This kind of thing will also hand over the perpetrators in order to avoid the disaster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei has not received any higher education since childhood, but only martial arts High, people are young and beautiful, there are many people in the pursuit of the family or the outstanding people, the mercenary leader is his own brother. When it is lonely, there are also people like Doyle at first sight. So since the wind is smooth After that, she had a lot of temper; after the big change, she practiced martial arts every day, only wanting to cut these scums one day, as to why she fell to such a degree, but never thought about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol is silent, and does not refute Rogge. Qi Wei is tearing down, looking up at Rogge, gnashing his teeth and shouting: " You are a pig from hell, if it is not you, my brother will not die! I will not suffer so much. Bitter! It's all because of you! it was all your fault! ! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge stood still like a mountain. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the fat man plus the whole body is close to the hand and mentions a tomahawk that is also a pound. If Qi Wei wants to kick him, it really needs to be It takes a little effort. Moreover, the protective field of 'reincarnation' has also shifted most of her strength. In the eyes of Rogge, the silver wire flashed, and Qi Wei immediately felt a sharp needle piercing the root of the thigh, screaming and falling to the ground. The tingling flashed away, and it was inexplicable, but it was born in the most secret place, and it was Rogge who was trying to come. At that time, Rogge, who had nothing to do, had made Qi Wei suffer a lot. This time, the fat man’s mental ability was not something she could deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei was ashamed and angry, and he was crying. Doyle sighed and struggled to help Qi Wei, and said to Rogge: "I don't think that Rogge's martial arts is so amazing. You just said it, and it makes sense. Since we are defeated, we should obey the promise, please Let's do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Qiwei, the heart is bitter, softly said: "Qi Wei, you are strong and strong, martial arts outstanding, people It’s beautiful, so everyone wants to get the upper hand. It’s just that there are people outside, there are days outside, and you just have to fight for it. There will always be times when you have a nail. When you are in trouble, you must think about yourself wrong. If you are the other person, you will How? From now on, I can no longer protect you by your side, so be sure to take care of yourself. The three years with you are the happiest time of my life. Remember, don’t want to take revenge again. Two words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer's voice is getting smaller and smaller, and later only Qi Wei can hear clearly. He screamed, "Crash!" He grabbed Qiwei and threw it out of the window, just on top of a horse. With a cry, a broken sword flew out and cut off the reins of the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse was frightened and went away. Immediately, Qi Wei’s brain was blank, and she felt as if she was in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dol’s violent action touched the injury, and the blood continued to flow from the corner of his mouth. He opened his arms and stopped Rogge's pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and stared at Doyle for a while before turning back to the boss of the subordinates to serve! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer was supported by one breath. At this moment, the robbery suddenly passed, and he could no longer support it. He fell to the ground and fainted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss is also very difficult to get off, the good wine and good food are kept coming up, and the caravans and the mercenaries are sunbathing for a while. The dragon and the beautiful knights are on the side. Drinking and eating, while slapping. Rogge is sitting and smiling, undecided, unpredictable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis is gone, Robsky naturally woke up. Once people recover their minds, the level of flattering on the table is different, and all kinds of shameless and absurd places, I am afraid that the people who shoot the horses themselves do not believe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like the dragons and the beautiful knights are very harsh, just saw the unpredictable means of Rogge, and the other side has surpassed the leader of Doyle, and the heart is grateful and fearful. Dare to reproduce things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber of Commerce will go to this place for the veteran, and he will give a drink to Rogge. Benjamin of the Lack Chamber of Commerce. Lord Rogge has a high magical power, and it is even more rare that he is very loyal and admire the old age."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog hurriedly stood up, Lana Benjamin sat down, and his face was full of perfect smiles. Don't say that, although I am a knight, I am also a little business. Therefore, I have always admired the elders of the Chamber of Commerce. Come and come to Roger Rivers, now the captain of the Dragon Knights and Beauty Knights of the Third Knights of the Bavarian Principality. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Benjamin did not give much resignation. When I sat down, I didn’t expect that Rogge’s skills were strong and people were so smart. I don’t know what business Rogge is doing. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger has poured a 30-year bourbon wine for Benjamin, laughing and saying: "I manage a high-level magic in Lille. The equipment store, in addition to doing jewelry, ore and military supplies business. Just started, it was only a few days, because I was eager to return home to see my parents, so I dropped the business."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin does not need to smile: "The old man is the elder of the Clark Chamber of Commerce, responsible for the business in the east. The main business is to do rare minerals and luxury goods, and sometimes into some overseas treasures. You are young and promising, open-minded and well-informed. In the future, you will be able to show your future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin laughed, why should you be too modest? It’s rare to see so many people walking in so many countries. Since Lord Rogge is doing the business of magic equipment, there are some sources of magical silver in the Chamber of Commerce. It should be helpful to Lord Rogge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, of course, need more, the more the better. I don't know what the price is?" Rogge's eyes are shining, but my heart is, the old guy is pretending to be a ghost. The means are so bad that you have to be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prices, it is better to press each of the two magic silver 80 gold coins, our Clark Chamber of Commerce can supply two pounds of magic silver to you every month." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked that the price of the silver in the Rhine League was 120 gold coins, and it was in short supply. How do I feel good about two pounds of magic silver? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," Benjamin laughed. "Lord Rogge, I can meet here, always have a fate." This is just a face-to-face ceremony. In the future, there will be more cooperation with the hammer of the god of war. It’s still a lot of time to rely on Rogge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile solidified on Rogge's face. The dragon and the beautiful knights felt the atmosphere was wrong, and many people's hands were placed on the sword." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That smile is just a matter of a moment, Rogge blinks and smiles very brightly. Jaime adults really have a problem. I want to ask, the hammer of the god of war only After three days of opening, I am sure you are still on the road, but how do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin is not in a hurry: "We do minerals and jewelry Business, the original attention to the magic equipment dealers. The fierce defeat of the ice and silver fox mercenary group, shocked the entire Ron Principality. Lost to Orphee Roques, the elite Snow Fox brigade was a little-known 'dragon With the beauty of the 'mercenary regiments destroyed, so that the hearts of people can not help but find out. At that time, Lord Rogge has already begun to show his talents, and the wisdom is eye-catching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Benjamin took a sip of his drink and continued: "When in Fort Worth, 'The Hammer of the God of War' created a blue crystal armor. Really famous, the real name, the old age is also very admired for the number of merchants of the God of War. I am not afraid of Lord Rogge, and since then, I have been very concerned about the hammer of the god of war and Lord Rogge, carefully collected a lot of information. I want to visit the city of Lille when I come back from the South. I went to visit Lord Rogge and I didn’t expect to meet him. I met Lord Rogge on this southern road!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The heart has calculated a lot, Rogge said: "There is no way to accept the Lu! I don't know what the Warhammer can bring to your business?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Build!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Rogge smiled slightly, Mr. Jie Ming is very human, it is fancy Tomahawk. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly. Lord Rogge's armor and tomahawk are extraordinary, and the old man has traveled all over the world. Apart from a few masters, the merchants who can make such a level of magical equipment are only the hammer of the god of war. The old chamber of commerce is not talented. There are some strengths in collecting all kinds of rare raw materials. We cooperate and it is worthwhile. He specifically emphasized the word 'raw material'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently raised the tomahawk, stroking the smooth lines, no other decoration except a piece of black crystal. Axe, faint should say: "Materials? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, raw materials! Benjamin answered with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, today is too hasty, when will Mr. Benjamin return from the South?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After about a month. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately said: "At that time, I should return to the city of Lille. Just do it. I am waiting in the city of Lille!" Let's discuss it carefully, how to make money together, hahaha. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the guests and guests are enjoying themselves, and Daoer woke up over there, struggling to come to Rogge's table and thank him.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you, Lord Rogge, for not killing! Thank you, Rogge, for letting go of the insider Qi Wei! Doyle was an unbelievers, and he also let Lord Rogge laugh, and then he will be treated by Lord Rogge! "The attitude of Nadall is somewhat embarrassing. After all, letting Qiwei go, it has already violated the previous vows, and it is inconsistent with his samurai identity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
