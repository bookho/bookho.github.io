			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章一真神<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is about to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the winter to the spring, it is the most easy time to feel lazy and dry, and it is also the time to rush to take off the bloated clothes. But those who have lived in the North for a long time know that the real cold is often born when spring is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unsettled winter. But this winter may be too calm compared to the upcoming spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers are not interested in the war and the power game of the nobility. What they worry about is that there is too little snow this year. It seems that the harvest of the new year is difficult to guarantee. Regardless of their New Year's harvest, the nobility lords will not lower their taxes. But they are all fortunate that they are not nationals of the Principality of Are. I heard that after the replacement of the new ruler, a greedy and glamorous female grandfather, the taxes of the Ayre Principality are surprisingly high. After paying taxes, people there can only maintain their reluctance to be starved to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the civilians in the Principality of Are are not much complaining about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are still immersed in the dream of becoming a strong country from a small country, enjoying the vanity and joy brought about by expansion and merger. Now among the Holy Alliance, apart from a few three or two countries, such as the Kingdom of Leighton, they have not put other countries in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest topic discussed by the princes and nobles of the Holy Alliance is the killing of Markurson and the addition of the Tickton tribe in the Rogge army sequence. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything in Marcus was passed to the ears of the dignitaries of the Holy Alliance, the voice of the Alliance supporting the Three Commons of the Highlands was immediately weakened. For the first time, these Principalities recognized Rogge’s determination and blood. They knew that the killing of Makur was what Rogge did for the countries. The meaning inside was clear. Whoever dared to interfere in the affairs of the Principality of Alai, Who will bear the same consequences! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebel forces that have been secretly supported by several countries have gathered 3,000 people in a short period of time, but even within a day, Rogge was also 3,000. The army was completely defeated. After slaughtering all the prisoners of war, Rogge swept the mountains, conquered the Tickton tribe that had never been conquered by the Principality of the Snow, and led the eight hundred fiercely Tikton fighters down the mountain. This gave the Holy Alliance countries a new understanding of the military power of Rogge and the Ayre Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Rogge’s leadership, the Principality of Aray is no longer a small country that can be ignored at will. If the Principality of Aray is a little bigger, if its population is a little more, then after another ten years, perhaps it will replace the status of the Kingdom of Leighton and become the first power of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, any country in the Holy Alliance will no longer dare to say victory in the face of the Ayre Principality. The dignitaries of all countries are not only worried about the magic of Rogge's horror, the terrible fighting power of the Elf Guard, and the newly added Tikton Warrior. What they really fear is the elf killer owned by Rogge. The countries of the Holy Alliance have fought with the Asrofic Empire for many years, and no country lacks brave soldiers and bold generals. However, the invincible star of the battlefield will be as vulnerable as the ordinary soldiers in the face of the shackles in the darkness or the poison in the tea. After all, there is only a small number of fierce fighters who are not afraid of death. Most of the great aristocrats in power in the alliance still cherish their precious lives. In the short period of life, if you don’t enjoy a little more wine and beauty, isn’t it alive? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the face of Rogge’s naked death threat of thousands of lives in Marcus, the rulers of all countries began to cringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Loren of the Kingdom of Layton has been completely lost by the elf Ikerel, and everything is told to her, although everyone knows Ikelay Never talk about politics, but no one doubts that she will swear to defend the interests of the Elves. That is to say, as long as it involves the interests of the elves, the most powerful Layton Kingdom of the Holy Alliance will stand on the side of Rogge. This situation has to change unless King Romon is dead. However, people are clear that even if the old king dies, this situation will not change. Anyone who has seen Ikel is dumped by her purity, exquisiteness, melancholy and indifference. They have no doubt that the successor of the Kingdom of Layton, no matter who it is, will take the same road to King Romon after receiving Iker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Holy Alliance, only the equally powerful Kingdom of Rivi and the Kingdom of Latvia are now worried about the situation and express their own annexation of the Three Principalities of the Highlands. The growing anger, claiming that it will never give up the efforts to support the restoration of the Three Kingdoms. After the Makur incident, the kings of the two kingdoms began to order increased readiness and mobilization of the army to guard against possible attacks by the Rogge and Layton kingdoms. They also increased the guardian power of the palace several times to guard against Rogge's killer. But the two kings still have a sense of reason, knowing that the full civil war of the Holy Alliance will inevitably lead to the intervention of the Asrofik Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty Astrofic empire just suppressed the possibility of further civil war inside the Holy Alliance, and gave Rogge an extremely precious breathing time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many troops in the hands of Rogge, but even if they are out of the country, there are only 7,000 troops. But the two thousand elf warriors can be regarded as the best archers of the human race. The killers and archers of the dark side of the moon have the absolute advantage of riding a shoot. Although the New Spartan Knights have only seventy rides together, one hundred and twenty knights will soon complete their initial training and become the reserve knights of the Knights. Of course, according to the standards of the original Golden Lion Knights, none of these new knights can meet Charlie's requirements, but Rogge strongly demanded that Charlie had to lower the requirements and expand a lot. He had to step up training on the basic skills and vindictiveness of the preparation of the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie would like to train a golden lion knight again, but Rogge’s considerations are completely different. At the time of the invincible Orpheek, the Golden Lion Knights had only five hundred rides after several years of exhibition. Although the individual combat power was extremely strong, the small number of them made the overall combat power greatly reduced. If the temperament requirement of a single Golden Lion Knight is reduced from ten to nine, then the number can be doubled to at least one thousand knights. If the requirement is reduced to eight, the number can be doubled to two thousand knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s still a little punk, Rogge has already understood the only way to win and win: He is not interested in being less successful, and knows that the pursuit of individual strength is more difficult to get to the back. So he is more interested in increasing the number of good warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reducing the requirements, the Spartan Knights will soon be able to add to the 200 reloading knights. These knights have the backbone of the original Golden Lion Knight. Under Charlie's command, they have the ability to reverse the battle on the local battlefield. But Rogge does not intend to put this trump card into the battlefield easily. Charlie and the Golden Lion Knights are like a hen that will lay eggs. As long as they are there, the excellent heavy-loaded knights will be trained one by one. In Rogge's mind, excellent knights and warriors are just consumables, such as Charlie and the Golden Lion Knight, who are truly irreplaceable and one must not be. Therefore, the fat man did not hesitate to put a set of precious dragon scale armor to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight hundred Tikton warriors simply let Rogge bloom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tickton Warrior has six hundred male warriors and two hundred female warriors, each of whom is tall and mighty, and looks very handsome. It is a relatively low female warrior, and is almost as high as Androni, that is, half a head higher than Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tickton warriors are extremely powerful, adult male fighters can easily swing a 40-kilogram giant axe, female warriors can also use the heavy infantry standard ten Five kilograms of battle axes. After trial and error, the Tickton male warrior can be equipped with heavy steel armor weighing up to 100 kilograms, and the female warrior wearing 80 kilograms of body armor does not affect the battle. This is a fortress of activity! What is even more terrifying is that everyone in the Tikton Warrior has a throwing spear stunt, and the lethality of the close range is extremely terrifying. Rogge himself deeply understands this in the throwing spear of Majla. Because of the power, some of the Tickton warriors who can use heavy hard bows are not weaker than the elf archers. The strong and lethality of their heavy arrows can completely compensate for the deviation on the crosshairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, these Tiketon warriors are the best reloaded infantry by nature and the natural nemesis of any cavalry. Their only drawback is that the number is too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Elf Shooter, the Dark Side of the Moon, the Spartan Knights, and the Tickton Warrior, Rogge has less strength and is extremely powerful. . Moreover, he also has many powerful people around him, Androni, Fu Luoya, Fengdie, Zagul, Frey, Raphael, and so on. Of course, the one that does not necessarily support the move can also count the first half. In terms of the number of strong people alone, the Principality of Alei can indeed stand proud of the entire Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small Ale Principality, for a time, hiding the dragon and lying tiger, the strength has grown tremendously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge also has troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of his troops is strong, but the number is too small. Needless to say, the great empire of Asrofiq is to fight with the second-rate powers such as the Kingdom of Layton. The other party can use Rogge’s favorite to fight more and less tactics, and the 50,000-60,000 troops will kill them in ten dozens. Naturally, it drowned the poor army of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Ayre Principality also has a female grandfather. Her madness surprised Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of training of the recruits, regardless of the amount of equipment required, is not a small number. Fortunately, as long as King Romone does not die, the Kingdom of Layton is the most reliable ally of the Principality of Are. For the difficulties of the Principality of Aray, King Romon completely disregarded the opposition of the ministers and brought a large amount of food and equipment to the Principality of Alai. Of course, under the obstruction of the people, the food that can be transported to the Ayre Principality is some old crops, and the weapons and equipment are also inferior leather armor and copper knife. Counting, just enough to arm 20,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the madness of Auntie, the countries of the Holy Alliance, including the Kingdom of Layton, did not agree. Not to mention how the equipment of 80,000 people is difficult to prepare, that is, the food consumed is by no means a small amount. This winter's snow is particularly small. The entire year of the Holy Alliance will be a year of poor harvest. The famine of the Ade Principality is almost foreseeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sacred allies do not know that there is a city of gods behind Rogge. After the restoration of the magic power, with the support of the huge vitality of the silver dragon egg, the enchantment of the elf old tree almost extended to the entire valley. The elves are also good at natural magic, and the ability to control plants is unparalleled. It is in the cold winter, the grain in the valley can also be cooked in January, and the grain produced can supply the needs of the 40,000 army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf craftsmen of the city of the gods are now fully preparing for the special heavy armor of the Tickton warriors. This kind of heavy armor is very difficult to produce, and it can only be slowly waited. But once the Tikton warrior is armed, it is the time when Rogge lifts the butcher knife again to the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the national strength of the Principality of Ale, to support the 80,000-strong army for a year, the national treasury will inevitably go bankrupt. It can also be said that Auntie has forced Rogge to the point where he has to gamble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to concentrate on the financial strength of the exhibition, Auntie has concentrated the luxury of the Grand Duke and is prepared to pay for the purchase of military food from the Kingdom of Layton. . Now the outside of the Grand Duchy of Dresden is still full of grandeur and magnificence, but once you enter, it will be a shabby sight. In other countries, there are no antiques and porcelains visible in the aristocratic palaces. The armor swords are only placed in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he first returned to the Grand Duchy, Rogge was also taken aback. When he saw that the aunt who came to meet him had no jewels on his body, he did not know what to say. When he saw Adair’s conscription plan and armament preparation progress, he couldn’t help but stun. He is also a gambling person, but he never thought that he could gamble so crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that the madness of the Ale Principality will certainly arouse the vigilance of the sacred allies, and now has to rely on the influence of the Kingdom of Layton to suppress opposition within the Holy Alliance. The voice, at least delayed the intervention of various countries for a period of time. At that time, when his army training was completed, he did not need to look at the face of any country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a full day of sitting, Rogge read the important official documents of the Principality of Ale during this time. In addition to books and necessary utensils, his study is now in vain, and all the decorations are taken by the aunts for food. Seeing all this, Rogge only smiled. He immediately sent an elf messenger to the city of the gods to mobilize the jewels. With the rich collection of the elves' millennium, the army of 80,000 people can still afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is busy now, but idle is more than before. There are Shi Lai in government affairs, Charlie in military management, and Auntie in financial armament also proves his ability. Now Rogge needs to think about the situation in the whole north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days are so rushing past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Rogge just opened a file and it sounded a soft knock on the door. Then a waiter walked in to the big man, and several people outside the Grand Palace wanted to see you, and they looked like a few magicians. They said that you will see them when you read this letter. Now the general manager has already entertained them in the living room. You see..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is undecided, opened the letter and immediately changed his face, immediately said: "Where are they? Take me over now! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked into the living room, four mysterious visitors were waiting there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp They wore dark black robes and looked like the standard dress of the magician. When Rogge came in, all four stood up, and the middle man took off his hat, revealing a beautiful face and smiling. : "Roger, we met again. Are you satisfied with the gift we sent last time? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl who visited was Mora, the sacrifice of the Eye of Wisdom, and the second coordinate of the world in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately remembered the embarrassment of the year when he led the crowds of wisdom, and his face could not help. However, in recent years, his face was thicker and he immediately returned to normal. He smiled and said: "It turned out to be the Mora." I didn't expect you to come in person. The last time you sent someone to the magic eye tyrant is too timely. Thank you very much, but please don't blame me for being rude. Why do you help me so much? I remember that I used to slap you over the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora Laughter, her golden light on her forehead continued to undulate with her laughter: "The day Rogge is a man... oh! Yingwu! Well, I came here to find you. God's will. It is also based on her gods after the seal of the tyrant of the demon eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, the eye tyrant should have survived In the abyss of the underground, how did it come to the ground? And as far as I know, the creature of the eye tyrant should not survive much in the ground world."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora sighed and should start talking to the Amorro adults. The former head of the wisdom of the elders, the master of the Baron, inadvertently appeared part of the sealed body of the Amoro adult: one eye. At that time, it was the magic eye tyrant who guarded this eye. It did not know how to escape to the ground world. When Barang appeared, the magic eye tyrant was already dying. But it said to Baron, it is the great servant of the great Amorro, who has been guarding this eye. Lord Baron brought it home, and according to its requirements, created a environment that allowed it to survive through a magical array and provided food for it. In return, it also provided Baron with several powerful spells. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a sip of tea and went on to say: "Balan is a great magician. He placed the magic eye tyrant for a few days and then sensed it." To the will of the Amorro adults. It is not easy to resurrect the Amaroodin, it is difficult to do it alone, so he summoned several magic apprentices and created the Eye of Wisdom. After that, he sensed the gods of the Amorro adults several times, and successfully contacted the will of the Amorro adults through the methods provided by the Magic Eye Tyrant. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Mora's golden eyes are dark, obviously remembered, and she was also a sacrifice of this 'method' on that day." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she still makes a smile because of this, Baron has always believed that this magical eye tyrant is really a servant. Until the call of the day, we finally got The true God's care. Our true God, the rank is much higher than the goddess of the Amorro, O'Reilly, finally came directly to the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking of the girl in the gray robes of the day, Rogge’s heart suddenly jumped, and the fat on his face shook a few times unnaturally. I don't know why, when faced with her, he always has a fear that is difficult for himself, and there will be an inexplicable heartbeat. Is this Olympus really God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora sighed with a lucky call by the goddess and became her direct spokesperson in the world. Her beacon in this world also changed from a sacrifice to a sacrifice. The saint of the eye of wisdom. When Carmon accompanied me back to the Eye of Wisdom headquarters, the Magic Eye Tyrant refused to admit the identity of my saint, and refused to admit the great goddess O'Reilly. But I have the care of the goddess, the spiritual control of the tyrant of the magic eye can not affect me completely, but it can affect Barang. During that time, with the help of Master Carmon, I also gathered a group of believers in the eyes of wisdom to try to fight against Barang. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But our strength is still thin, but the gods want us to take the body of the Amorous adults, so we can only persist. Fortunately, the magic eye tyrant can not leave the magic circle too far, my strength is growing every day, this is supported. Until recently, the great O'Brien once again came to the world, and her omnipotent deity destroyed all believers who were not determined in an instant, and sealed the magical tyrant who disguised the servant. In this way, I really took over the eyes of wisdom, and according to the gods, sent the magic eye tyrant to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger slightly looked at Mora and the three magicians behind her. His memory is not bad, still faintly remembering the wisdom of that day." The Eye Division, I have seen these magicians.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora smiled and said: "Roger, that day is the three of them. Put me on the altar. But now, we are both faithful believers of O'Reilly. In the face of faith, everything in the past is not important. Moreover, I would also like to thank them three. If they did not bring me to the altar, I would not be able to get the help of the true God, and I would be fortunate to have a part in the great cause of O'Reilly..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora smiles like this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stunned, haha ​​laughed: "Miss Mola, you will not be naive to think that a magical eye tyrant can buy my faith." Alright? How can the offer price be high? I am a magician. It is very difficult for a magician to believe in a god that is not famous. And anyway, the magic eye tyrant has been used by me, just want to return, it is not enough! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora chuckle, she has an ethereal temperament, so that a smile is more beautiful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Roger adults really as great as O'Reilly said, although very capable, but the rogue skills are more first-class! You can rest assured that this time I am not forcing you to join the eye of wisdom. This is the great Auger Reich said, she will come to talk to you personally. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What! Rogge jumped up immediately. Looking at the snickering Mora, he immediately realized his gaffe and sat down heavily. If nothing happened, he said that he was not afraid.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora is in front of the great goddess of O'Reilly, who is afraid of nothing. I am afraid that there is nothing to lose face. I am here, I want to ask you to allow me to be in the Principality of Are. The doctrine of spreading the eye of wisdom in the territory, exhibitors. In return, our believers will fully support your rule. You know, we already have 50,000 believers in the Kingdom of Leighton, and we can openly preach. So do we have it? Our support is not a trivial matter for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sinks up, this suggestion is very exciting. There is a precedent for the Church of Light. He is clear about the power of faith, and he knows very well the great potential and influence of a religion with a large number of devotees. But religion is a double-edged sword. It does help to rule in the early days of its exhibition. But once it grows up, it can be difficult to control. If you don't get it, you will take it down from the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, the belief in the Eye of Wisdom seems to be a problem. How did the former god Amorro look like a not very powerful democrat? Of course, Rogge knows that any Mozu who needs to be sealed is not a fuel-efficient lamp. At least these things are difficult to completely eliminate, which is enough to show their strength. Although Rogge himself is not so easy to be completely killed, but the gap with these Mozu creatures is still a big gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge’s insights are no longer comparable. He once saw a scale of the magical general Artes, and also fled alongside Elysses, who was a demon princess. He also saw the hanging of the pigs and the death of the pig king. In his mind, it seems that the Mozu characters seem to be just like this. How powerful can a middle and lower Mozu? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the current goddess O'Reilly, from the feeling of the day, it is not a powerful god. Rogge even had some doubts as to whether she was not as powerful as the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a god that is not overly powerful, isn’t it what you need? Rog thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge has turned a myriad of thoughts, he smiled and said: "As long as the Eye of Wisdom supports me, I can allow you to I am a believer in my territory and give you the right to establish your own temple. As for whether or not to tax you, I have seen the great Auger Reich before I say it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora is staring at the eyes and eating the authenticity: "Master Rogge! What are you talking about? Are you taxing the believers of the great goddess O'Reilly?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "I haven’t decided yet, just an idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge, who once served as the guardian of the Guangming Church, knows the importance of money abundance or not for religious communication. He is determined to seize the eye of wisdom from this. At least, this would be a good condition for bargaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora was still an ordinary girl, and now reunited, it seems that she has cultivated ten levels of vindictiveness, and the progress is very fast, obviously and that He is related. As for the three magicians behind her, they are also seven or eight magicians, and the magic is not weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are resources, Rogge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora looked at Rogge with a look of interest and suddenly smiled: "Roger, a god-stricken person, really You have seen the wind instrument of O'Reilly on the same day, and now I dare to bargain! I really admire it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
