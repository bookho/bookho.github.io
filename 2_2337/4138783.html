The incident can completely make the old king completely irrational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reports and intelligences that came back from the front line have turned into shredded papers, slowly falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals in the big account, along with Marshal Alams, dare not take a long breath. The two reports were shredded and could not even reduce the anger of King Romone a little. His eyes were red and bloody, and the sword was suddenly pulled out. The table in front of him was cut into several sections. Then he gasped and sat down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romon closed his eyes and meditated. He opened his eyes for a long time and slowly said: "What do you think? Just talk about it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One general hesitated: "His Majesty, this is a bit strange. It is reasonable to say that Roger’s strength is at an absolute disadvantage, why does he have to abandon the city and the Latvian army in the city? Is there a dead battle in the outside world? And his strength is not sufficient, and he has to divide his troops before the final battle..." The suspicion of the words is already obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, because of the relationship between Ikerel, there will be a great civil war of the Holy Alliance. The relationship between Ikerel and Rogge is well known, and many of the generals of Layton have been very disgusted with Rogge’s blatantly following the benefits of the Leiden Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Rogge may not be a military genius, but it is not an idiot." Marshal Alams also spoke. "From the intelligence in our hands, In the decisive battle outside the city, if the Latvians did not use the undead army, the Rogge may not lose. In my case, in this case, more than 4,000 people can be evacuated from the battlefield. It is the embodiment of Gaoming’s commanding art. Rogge may be too young and too impulsive. Young people always have some romantic ideas about war, so he will go to the Latvians to fight outside the city. But it seems that Latvians do not To be cheap, a total of 6,000 people lost before and after, especially when the cavalry was almost completely annihilated. The death of the main Adams was already a failure. After Rogge retreated to Bora, I thought it was impossible for Latvians. Then break through the second line of defense of Rogge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he gave up Leipzig! The 50,000 people in the city of Leipzig became the victims of Latvian anger "The one Military angry growl up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Bolton, Leipzig is your hometown, I can understand your mood. However, we have now occupied the three cities of the Kingdom of Livi and the Kingdom of Latvia In a city, have we slaughtered the city?" said Marshal Alams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general was angry, but he also knew that it was a little reluctant to add the responsibility of the massacre to Rogge’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, a commander rushed into the camp and presented an urgent secret to King Romon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Romon only looked at a few eyes, and the whole body could not be restrained and trembled. He suddenly closed his eyes and threw the rush to the generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of Marshal Arams is the most respected. He picked up this document and his face changed. Subsequently, he silently handed the document to the next general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the entire camp suddenly fell into the calm before the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This short piece of information was sent from Leipzig a few days ago to the King of Leighton and sent to the front line by magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writing on the intelligence is very scribbled. It is not so much a secret report to the military, but rather a short horror novel. It can be seen that although the intelligence officer did his due diligence, he was also scared. It is not only the slaughter that is born in Leipzig, but also the undead that wanders everywhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this letter was written incoherently, the generals will understand at a glance that the 50,000 citizens of Leipzig City are likely to have become 50,000 now. Undead army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Rogge’s urgent report was also sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge retired a hundred kilometers and gathered the originally dispersed army, including the local garrison of 5,000 Leiden Kingdom, currently a total of 20,000 troops Stationed in the city of Bora. He is prepared to defend against the Latvian army and their undead army by relying on the city of Bora, where the location is important and the city is strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the deposit of the city of Bora is not enough to feed so many people. Therefore, at the end of the letter, it is natural to ask for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all the two letters that will be read by the public, and the king of Romon will open his mouth. His low voice has an unshakable determination: "Building a country from the Kingdom of Layton Since the times, our warriors have never looked down in front of any enemy! Although the Necromancer and the Undead Legion are terrible, they can't let the Warriors of Layton yield! Send my orders and withdraw all the messengers of the Holy Alliance Council! The hero's Layton Warrior will never negotiate with the Latvian pigs collaborating with the Necromancer! Only the head of the Latvian king can rest the 50,000 souls of Leipzig. The commander will pass on the life of Leipzig to the whole army. Our warriors know what the enemy has done!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big account will make everyone's face gloomy and terrible. These generals who have been born and died for many years are all soldiers who are stronger and stronger. Only the face of Marshal Alams passed a shadow. At that moment, he seemed to grow a little old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy League’s parliament is also in chaos at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original situation is clearly different, the situation of the two factions has completely disappeared. Faced with the overwhelming questioning and censure, Latvia's envoys are gray-faced and frustrated, and they will only repeatedly say, "This is impossible!", "This is the conspiracy of the Kingdom of Layton!" The sacred kingdom of Latvia is absolutely not colluding with the Necromancer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, even the most staunch ally of Latvia, the envoy of the Kingdom of Livi, has been domestically Command, keep silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the undead army of the Undead Master has been difficult to think that the world accepts, turning innocent civilians into undead corps, is simply the public enemy of the entire Terran! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although still in the middle of the civil war, there are still the Principality that should form a fact-finding mission to Leipzig to find out the truth of the incident. However, this proposal was resolutely rejected by the Latvian envoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latvia is also hard to say, even if they are supernatural, they can't turn Leipzig's 50,000 bodies into living people. And among the 50,000 people, it is true that at least 20,000 people were slaughtered by the Latvian army. It is ironic that the reason for the slaughter of Leipzig citizens is to prevent more and more undead attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the day the Latvian army entered Leipzig, it was like falling into a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in Leipzig who are like crazy, red-eyed to the soldiers of Latvia, even if they are cut down by a knife, they still try to bite from the soldiers. A piece of meat comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latvian soldiers who have stepped up their guards have quietly increased their violent thoughts. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, a soldier who was placed on the order was thrown to the ground by more than ten citizens, and his eyes were bitten and bloody. However, when a group of soldiers received an alarm, they were horrified. The soldier, who was already dead, stood up and swayed and joined the citizens who had bloodshot meat on their teeth and shook. The soldiers were rushed over...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, since the time they entered the city, Latvian soldiers patrolling the city have been missing in a small team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, hundreds of zombies swayed and rushed to the Latvian military camp. Under the illumination of the fire, the sentinels were so many of these undead creatures. Wearing Latvian military uniforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bowstring that was tense for a day could no longer withstand this huge tension and was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more and more undead creatures, Latvia’s commanders can no longer control the fear and the hysterical spread among the soldiers. A massacre, finally opened...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Latvian soldiers did not notice the three pigeons that suddenly flew up and rushed to the sky. The middle-aged man who gave up the homing pigeon fell down, not because of fear, but because of a sudden incision in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire that rushed to the sky covered all of this in the flames. This fire is so inconspicuous compared to the fire that is burning everywhere in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Bora, which is more than a hundred kilometers from Leipzig, there is a tense atmosphere everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolabi is much larger than Leipzig, but the influx of more than 100,000 people has also made the city very crowded. But no one will complain, and every citizen who has some strength will take the initiative to strengthen the city defense to resist the horrible army that does not know when it will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the army of the Ayre Principality became the main force of the defense of Bola, Rogge did not give any favor to his troops, what the local garrison troops of the Layton Kingdom eat What the soldiers of the Ade Principality eat. There is only one exception, that is the Tickton warriors. As soon as you see these unusually tall, mighty warriors, the citizens of Bora will be much more secure. Therefore, no one will object to let these Tickton warriors eat and eat well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the more than 10,000 Alai Principal recruits, they learned that two thousand colleagues were unable to retreat in time because of insufficient training and all died in front of the Latvian Undead After the news, the training enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the big Bora city, except for a very small number of people, everyone is very nervous, ready to face the undead army they have never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as he arrived in Bora City, Rogge took the opportunity to occupy the city government. He leaned back in the chair at the moment and was closing his eyes. As for what he was thinking about, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is windless and self-opening, and a shadow gradually becomes clear, revealing Raphael’s handsome face with a hint of purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadow Knight and its owner communicate in a way that is unknown, and Rogge is very satisfied. In fact, all the exhibitions went smoothly to his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafael had just reported, and Charlie walked in with a gloomy look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raphael fell to Rogge and re-entered the shadows and quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie put a battle report in front of Rogge and asked: "What happened to Rogge, the undead army of Leipzig?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge lowered his high feet and stood up. For Charlie, he has always been very respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Charlie, Leipzig, what is the undead army, are you not as clear as me? Those undead are uncontrolled at all, if not killed by the Latvian army Hands, in less than two days, they will fall by themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie stares at Rogge, does not relax: "So can you tell me? What happened in Leipzig?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think this is a secret. Leipzig was slaughtered by Latvians." Rogge faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie said heavily: "If I sacrifice the lives of two thousand soldiers in order to reach the final victory of the war, I can accept it. The war cannot be separated from death. In fact, it can be seen as an intention to sacrifice the life of the warrior. However, it is not acceptable for me to sacrifice the lives of 50,000 civilians for the victory of the war. Without our arrangement, Leipzig will not be born. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie," Rogge’s voice also hardened. "If you occupy a city where citizens can riot at any time, you What will happen?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will step up my alert, collect all weapons, and limit the scope of the public’s activities.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If your soldiers are killed by mobs, what do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Investigating the truth, catching the murderer, and publicizing Kill the murderer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the city suddenly appears not to What about creatures?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie quickly replied: “Summon a small amount of undead creatures, almost every magician can do it. I will destroy these undead creatures, and Trying to find out which magician is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "Charlie, we all know that there is a lot of difference between the countries of the Holy Alliance. Contact. The citizens of Leipzig will never be rioted by the Latvian occupation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge said faintly: "In order to create a tense atmosphere and let countries think that Latvia is using the undead army, I have set up an enchantment in Leipzig that can transform the body into an undead. You know this. But this enchantment It doesn't last long, and it's impossible to summon powerful undead creatures out of thin air. In fact, the problem is very clear now. The undead creatures in Leipzig are not a few. So where did the original bodies come from?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie paused and thought for a moment, and he sighed angrily on the table: "It turned out that the Latvian army is killing civilians!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case." Rogge smiled. "I have framed them a little bit, but compared with what they have done, this is just to expose the true face of the Kingdom of Latvia to the world. If their commander is a knight like you, then this tragedy is How can it not be born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie apologized to Rogge and went out to inspect the city defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rogge came a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge didn't look back and said, "What's wrong, Anne? I don't know the layout of Leipzig. The end of this, the responsibility is not with me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sighed: "Rogge, I am not Charlie, I don't have any knight's creed in my heart, and I don't kill too few people." But 50,000 civilians... really is too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was annoyed: "In any extreme case, the massacre should not It is the choice of the occupier. I thought that Leipzig would pay thousands of lives at most, and who knows that Latvians would kill the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni In front of Rogge, he looked at him word by word: "At least half of the reason for Rogge, you are here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger brows tight Wrinkled, looking at Androni coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under his cold eyes, Androni was a bit comfortable, but she still said: "I just saw Raphael, I suddenly understood The original bodies of Leipzig are from Raphael's hand? And in your style, at least you will order Rafael to make a thousand bodies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s body was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni continued: "You have a triple enchantment of fear, bloodthirsty and death in Leipzig. Although the undead creatures awakened by death enchantments will only be unconscious. Attacking nearby creatures, but under the influence of fear and bloodthirsty, it is difficult for Latvian soldiers to lose control. Once the battle between soldiers and civilians begins, the massacre is very likely. Charlie does not know the fear and bloodthirsty enchantment. Exist. But I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Androni’s gaze, Rogge suddenly felt very tired, he came to the window and watched People who are busy around, faintly said: "Annie, you are very smart. Since you have already guessed it, I might as well tell you that this time the massacre in Leipzig is in my expectation. I can even say that the purpose of my arrangement is Let the Latvians slaughter the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But...that's 50,000 civilians..." Androni whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The 50,000-year-old life was exchanged for the immortal hatred of Latvia, the war that would have been ordered. It will evolve into an endless war. And since Latvians have done this kind of thing, they will inevitably provoke a strong rebound within their alliance. I think at least the six small principals will probably withdraw from the alliance. This is equal to ease. Broke their alliance. What's more, to deal with such evil enemies as the Kingdom of Latvia, no matter what means I use, I will only be considered as appropriate. Even I really summoned an undead army on the battlefield to attack. They can also be said to be the undead creatures who are out of control of the other's necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is also great for my next arrangement." Benefits. These, I will not talk to you for the time being." Rogge turned around and said to Androni: "Now I have made everything clear, what are you going to do next?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know So ask! "Andrew Luoni staring Rogge, sigh a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is really ignorant. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s stirring in his heart, holding Androni’s hands and saying, “Annie, I didn’t expect...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unforgettable, Rogge pulled Androni closer and wanted to kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit of a turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni used Rope to bring Rogge a few laps in the air, which drove him to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled the starry sky out of the scabbard, and this sharp sword was placed on the neck of Rogge, so that the fat man would not dare move. Androni said this: "I help you, but it doesn't mean the way you like to do things. Just because of the things you do, it's not too much to kill you ten times. Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's hands clasped his head, lying comfortably, laughing and looking at Androni: "In any case, now only you will help me unconditionally. I can I believe you are the only one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted! You don't believe anyone at all. You and my father and brother are the same people who think I don't know, you guys, for power and ambition, everything is done! I don't understand, what is the difference between right and power? My father's life, I am afraid I have not had a few days of easy life. In order to fight for power, he can even use his own children as a bargaining chip... Is it really important? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Androni’s voice was slightly stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took Androni's hand again and gently said: "Annie, we often can't help ourselves. Even if you don't want to fight for power, your family, your subordinates, your friends, or even your enemies will force you to fight for power. I have no retreat now. If I don't want to live in seclusion for a lifetime, I will only embark on the road of fighting for power. Maybe you think that my recent means have been poisoned, but I have to. After the power was held, I realized how terrible my enemies were and gradually understood their practices. Now even if I want to give up, they will not let me go. Recently, I often feel inexplicably scared. I always have a feeling that in addition to the pope and the Bavarian Grand Duke, there are several characters that make me instinctively feel scared. I don't even know who they are. And this fear is everywhere, sometimes I am suddenly awakened in my sleep. Ugh! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not talking about my father? "Androni's sword was pressed down intentionally or unintentionally.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "What am I afraid of?" It’s a last resort, you won’t be married? Can he still cut his son-in-law? "Speaking, Rogge fascinated Andreoni's fierce hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is now, unconsciously The hand has been held by Rogge for a long time. Her face was white, she pulled her hand back with lightning and rubbed it hard on her body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie Have you not changed yourself recently? Rog asked in a bad manner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What changes? "Looking at Rogge's expression, Androni snorted again. Miss temper is not good. You dare to move your hands and feet. Be careful when I am impulsive. I really cut your head."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, you would never say 'Ben Miss' before..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni A glimpse, began to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you were a man, if not, I don’t know that you are actually... I want to look at me so fiercely, I will never again Don't mention that time, oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is ashamed and angry, and will not know when he will be pulled out by Rogge’s hand. It is a punch on his belly! She did not have mercy under her hand, and the starry air of the silk almost made Rogge cut off. Androni's control over vindictiveness has become more and more subtle, and the vindictiveness of the input just allows Rogge to suffer the most pain without leaving him unhealable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Rogge is a good person, it is hard to slow down from this punch. His face was white and he gasped. "You can really taste this punch! It seems that you are not far from the sanctuary, cough!" A bloody smell came out of Rogge's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
