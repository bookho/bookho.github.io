			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the light of a golden lion, almost everyone will be dull. Not only because of his sun god's appearance, the outstanding life experience, the high strength, but also the king's demeanor, such as the spring rain, people's hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black flame behind Orphey Rox burned silently. Even the light of a golden lion cannot be concealed. The face in the flame is clear and cold, and people dare not stare, but they are engraved in the heart. When a few aristocrats were scum, they sneaked a sneak peek from time to time, and they looked around in a hurry, as if they were burned by the black flame. The black mage robes can't conceal the fascinating genius. The straight legs, the rich hips, the slender waist, and the thrilling arc-shaped chest, all the time, are turning people into beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, Lance, Franco, and Etter are sitting in a cramped manner, and the sudden visit of the Golden Lion is really surprising. A few people rushed to say that Orpheq sat down and asked people to send the best refreshments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lion licked the tea, and the leisurely movement was not awkward. Guard Richard opened a small pocket and poured out dozens of small gems of various colors on the table in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officrock smiled and said: "I came here to talk about the possibility of partnership." The house suddenly fell. "These gems are worth about 50,000 gold coins, even my deposit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally took his eyes off the gems and calmed down the mood. Dao: "You can't do anything, we seem to have the ability to do it." When the words were just exported, Rens rushed to grab the mouth of Rogge. "Don't ignore him, what do you have to do? I have no words in the flames of the knives!" The mouth was impassioned, but the eyes were staring at Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officok is very interested in watching a few aristocratic scums, no one has dared to stare at Elysses like this, really The ignorant is fearless. Several people in the eyes of Rennes began to show the fascination of color. Orpheek clearly felt that the murder behind him was spreading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course my cooperation is conditional." Orphee made a gesture, and behind him, a large piece of sheepskin was added to the table. map. He reached out to a central castle sign and said: "This is an abandoned small castle, the territory of my Bavarian Principality, recently occupied by a group of thieves. This castle is in the southwest of Farnburg. Less than 10 miles from the side. Devil Valley Forest, although the location is not important, but there are two towns and dozens of villages nearby. I don't want to give up my thousands of people, so I need you to take back the castle. The 50,000 gold coins jewelry Even if it is your starting expenses, as for whether you are going by yourself or pulling up a reloading knights team, I will not care. The commission period is half a year."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officrock went on to say: "As long as you have captured the castle, I will let my father seal the land to you. In the future, you will be the aristocrat who has the land. And I will invest 100,000 gold coins in the hammer of the god of war, and count the principal of my occupation. I want half of the right to income, huh, huh. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people listened with excitement and immediately surrounded them to start researching the map. Naturally, they didn’t even study it for a long time. Orpheek always smiled. A guard behind him is faintly revealing disdain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete suddenly looked up and asked: "We didn't have a soldier, how to defeat a thief group How many thieves are there, and are there any relevant information? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses said coldly: "Now think about asking for information?" "Etterden was flushed. Orpheus still replied without hesitation: "The thief group is actually a big team of the Ron Principality, the snow and silver fox mercenary group, and the combat power is very good. Of course, in the past six months, they also have the possibility of continuing to increase their troops. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pondered for a moment and asked: "These thieves, mercenaries, should not be in the eyes of the golden lion." If you go there once, you are alone, and you can scare them away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lion smile is just a small test. If you do, I hope that the Grand Duchy of Bavaria can have a few more loyal ministers."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falco’s pupils immediately narrowed down: “Bavaria Principality?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, the Principality of Bavaria.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
