			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Heaven in the Hells on the Eighteenth Heaven <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconscious in the coma There was a strange dark red, and the body temperature gradually rose. It didn't take long before it rose to an astonishing degree. The robes that he had just peeled off had started to smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi stared at Rogge in a coma, his brows gradually wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood in Rogge is boiling at the moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse of Rogge in the Barto Abyss demon lord Casinaras has been fully triggered at this moment, and the fierce abyss of lava has boiled Rogge The blood of the whole body burns his internal organs and even begins to threaten the stability of his soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another unknown curse is constantly emanating from Rogge’s soul. This curse is invisible, but can cause all potential defects in Rogge. status. It is because of its role that Rogge’s curse of Casinaras, which should never have been attacked, was fully ignited, and it will take a long time to see Rogge’s life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two curses are one inside and one outside, complement each other, accompanied by symbiosis, destroying Rogge’s ** and soul together. The lava curse does not destroy Rogge's body, and the unnamed curse is accompanied by blood flow, which constantly weakens Rogge's body resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Rogge’s body is strong and mentally powerful, there is no resistance in the face of the two powerful curses. It has been destroyed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi is hesitant. In this world, her power can be fully exerted, so the curse of Casinaras can't be cracked, and it can definitely be suppressed. After all, Casinas did not do his best when he set the curse, and Serafi could go all out when he suppressed the curse. Only she uses the most pure sacred power. In terms of the harm to Rogge's dark body, it is no worse than the strength of Casinalas. If she is fully motivated, even if the curse is not fully attacked, her strong sacred power will surely purify Rogge from the soul to the **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more observation (fine look), the more she understands the dual evil nature of Rogge's darkness and the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What am I doing? Why would I want to save such a dark and evil person? He... he has no way to return to the road of light!" If it was before..." Serafi suddenly surprised the thoughts that came out of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up at the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night sky, there is a round of bloody moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed faintly, and the cross sword lay flat above Rogge’s body. Slightly urging the amount of power, the sword began to slowly radiate a soft light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse power in Rogge seems to have sensed the challenge of the Holy Light. It started to frantically surge. With a bang, there were countless tiny flames coming out of Rogge’s clothes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi sensed the power of the curse in response to her challenge, so she gently turned the cross sword, and the faint light formed a transparent mask , hang Rogge in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraffy looked at Rogge in a coma and suddenly smiled uncomfortably. Her hands clasped with the hilt suddenly tightened! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred mask is turned from dull to dull, and faint. If it is repeated three times in an instant, it will disappear completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sanctuary three times, it’s a pungent smell and a strange meaty smell, and Rogge’s painful roar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indescribable pain caused Rogge to wake up from a coma, and he suddenly sat up, and a dark red pillar of fire slammed a few meters from him. high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pain in the whole body immediately caused Rogge to fall again. He only felt that he was wearing a red-hot armor, which was extremely painful and bound his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi had nothing to say: "Nothing, you are only half cooked. Now there is only one curse in your body that is still going on. Do you need me to suppress it? It’s weird, how come you are so inexplicable Curse, is it too bad to do too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the sound of Serafi, like a drop of ice, Rogge’s heart was loose. He is also a very strong-willed person. He ignores the pain in his body and just looks at his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Serrafi said. He has indeed cooked a little! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi uses a purely divine power to motivate the cursing power hidden in Rogge’s body, and then in a very short time, she is huge To the invincible sacred power, the power of the curse and the power of the curse have been hardened three times, completely destroying the power of all the cursed seduce. Only this time, Cassinaras's lava curse was weakened by a third. Although the remaining cursed powers are hidden in the depths of Rogge's body, they can only rely on the fat man to work hard to dispel them in the future, but at least in front of them, the cursed lava spell has been quietly quiet, and dare not continue to move. It has given the stage of the event to the strange curse of the sudden attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high temperature generated by the lava curse can turn a creature into coke, and the main damage caused by Serrafi’s divine power to Rogge’s body is cauterization. . The result of the two power wars is that Serrafi has won a great victory. But Rogge as a battlefield is not very good. At least his entire body surface was burnt, and a lot of the meat below was cooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This burn is fatal in the average person. However, it is only a minor injury to Rogge, who is ** resilience comparable to the troll. Rogge gaze at the unknown cursing power that is still in the body. As he became more aware of the power of the curse, his face became more and more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a way to suppress it?" Serafi said faintly: "This curse seems to be a kind of soul blood curse, very powerful, to you The physique can last up to another day. Do you want me to suppress it? The price is that you have to lie down for half a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge whispered: " No! This curse I naturally have a way to deal with it. I can't walk now, you can take me to a safe place to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Serra The Philippine throws a coke-like Rogge in the loft of an abandoned building. At the request of Rogge, the giant sword was inserted on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge struggled to sit up. The left wrist was forced to draw on the sword front of the Great Sword, and a blood immediately came out of the wound. Then his right wrist was equally stroked, and then he sat there, watching the blood rushing out of his hands and wrists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! Serrafi didn't know where to get a vat, threw it under Rogge's hands, and picked up the blood he had flowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughs and laughs, but has to ignore the fact that this action is always inexplicable. Just silently give yourself blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick blood gradually passed the middle of the barrel, and Rogge was still calm. Just as those blood is not the ones that flow out of him. If the wound solidifies, he will make another stroke on the Great Sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you know how this curse came from?" Serrafi asked boringly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This curse turned out to be on my body." Rogge replied indifferently, but with a hint of murder in his calm tone: "But I didn't think she could meet the two conditions of the curse trigger at the same time, so the curse retorted, and now the cursed person became me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serra Philippine boringly kicked the iron bucket with silver boots, watching the thick plasma ripples inside, and casually said: "It is a very strange curse. Actually able to cast this curse, it seems that you are not simple! But you What is the complexity of making a curse? Wouldn't it be used to deceive the wind butterfly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blood flowing more, Rogge is becoming weak. He was amazed at the keen insight of the servant who was as convinced as he was, but he never refused to admit it in the bad things he had done, and he would never admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have a very powerful ability to use... well, how to say it. Used to discover the secrets of others. You are already on my side. After standing for so long, what can you see? You see it yourself, and ask me what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge smiled weakly and said: "Observation, thinking, reasoning, this is enough. This thing only needs the mind. No need for invincible power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serafi snorted: "The use of this ability requires a lot of power, and it is a waste on you. I might as well ask directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the incarnation of Serafi, Wella's speech is often not true. For example, this time she did not say that the process of listening to ** is also a kind of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the wound on the wrist solidified, Rogge did not cut the wrist again, allowing the wound to solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge’s curse on Wind Butterfly, the only target for the ground is blood. Although the fat man did not believe that the wind butterfly could break the curse at first, but in case of the accident, Rogge still reserved a retreat for himself in the curse. Once the curse is reversed. After the curse power is fully launched. Rogge can release most of the blood that is full of cursed power in the body, so that. Originally a powerful curse that could have been deadly in a short period of time, the power was greatly weakened, and Rogge could slowly expel it on his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this approach is obvious, but few people will think about it. If it is not the fat man who owns the body of Warcraft, and changed to another person, letting out so much blood has long been a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge struggled to stand up. With his movements, the burnt black flesh of the body fell off a lot of small pieces, revealing the new pink meat below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge saw Serafi and said: "I want to repair the burn of the body's appearance. The situation in one place is not something that ordinary people can afford, you If you feel that you can't stand it, it's best not to look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi faintly said: "What do I have when I wander around in various planes?" Haven't seen the land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog nodded, he took off his ragged robe, stood up and began to fully promote the body's ability to regenerate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every piece of meat on his body seems to have his own life and begins to wriggle wildly. The charred flesh of the body surface is detached, revealing the new meat that grows and squirms. Perhaps because of the reason for the excessive blood loss, only a thin layer of blood is oozing out on these new meats, and then the oil is absorbed and slowly condensed, and finally transformed into a soft new skin in a light black gas. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge’s body was full of flesh. The whole body is covered with a layer of matte new skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the almost transparent new skin, you can clearly see that the muscles, blood vessels and even the internal organs of the inside are constantly squirming and growing. This is the burn that Rogge suffered in repairing the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the horrible and weird scene, Serafi was not afraid, she just looked at the swarming pink meat mass and suddenly sighed Asked: "You have transformed yourself so much... you think. Can you still be a person now? Is this price... really worth it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Rogge's recovery process is almost complete, and the skin color of the whole body gradually turns to normal. I heard the words of Cerafi. He was silent for a long time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed to be back in the dark attic. Just before his eyes, the towering cross, the blazing flame, burned his heart again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a long time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, everything is still like yesterday? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly smiled in the sky and calmly replied: "I certainly can’t be a person now. But what is it? I need strength, as long as I have strength. I don't care what it looks like!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi nodded and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Rogge has fully recovered. It was only experienced by two powerful curses, and was burned several times by the sacred force of Serafi. At this moment, Rogge was very weak, and there was almost no strength in the whole body. However, Serrafi did not add any strength to him this time. She just waved her hand and fixed Rogge in a mask. next moment. The fat man has been thrown into the Pompei House from the air. The weak fat man wants to take the opportunity to take advantage of the cheaper plan to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge knows that there will be hunger and thirst after the bloody battle of the wind butterfly, but her remaining elf nature will prevent her from falling completely and will not become a flower idiot who only knows men. Since the curse on her is triggered, it is inevitable that the person who betrayed her has been subconsciously recognized by her, no matter what she approves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is now. Who is this person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey and Alexander know that Wind Butterfly is a Rogge, and these two talented people are absolutely impossible. Their men's discipline is strict, even if they see the fallen wind butterfly, they don't dare to just start. And Rogge’s own men, who has such a courage to dare to move his woman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the wind butterfly takes the initiative, who dares to suffer from this flying Yanfu? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards on the way saw Rogge, and they were all chilling. Although the fat man lost all his strength at the moment, he murdered like a numb, and it was a great smother to murder in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger thought about who really dared to touch his woman and entered his own courtyard. Step by step to the upstairs bedroom. While passing by the study. He grabbed a stack of magic scrolls and put them in his sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye. Rogge, who converges on the whole body, has quietly stood at the door of the bedroom. Even if the room is a sanctuary, Rogge has great confidence that the other party will not find himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the subtle voice coming from behind the door, Rogge regained his mood and hesitated a little. Since this person dared to start with the wind butterfly, I must not put him in the eye. At this moment, Rogge is weak, and the only trust is that there are several magic scrolls in his hand. If the dog jumps on the wall, it can be considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man thinks about what might happen after the door is opened, then smiles coldly, pretends to know nothing, pushes open the door . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his luxurious big bed, the wind butterfly after the carnival is stretching his body, leisurely holding the quilt, has fallen into a quiet sleep. Her ivory, soft, shiny skin still has a burst of red tide, and the fine sweat is visible on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room’s floor-to-ceiling mirror stood in front of a tall figure. He just put on his shirt and slowly tied the bronze button. Hearing the door, he turned around in a whirlwind, and asked coldly: "Who? Dare to sneak here, is it not to be killed?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s Andrei, looking at the face of the handsome man who is full of joy and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the red-looking windy butterfly, and then looking at Androni’s invisible face, Rogge understood everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face turned from horror to anger, looking at Androni silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge’s fierce gaze, Androni suddenly had some guilty conscience. Her gaze consciously avoided one side and whispered: "You... how come you suddenly came back? Are you not caught by Straw?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh?" Rogge raised his eyebrows and asked, "How long do you want me to be caught? If I don't come back, wouldn't I know what you did?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni slightly lowered his head and whispered: "I and the wind butterfly... Well, you have seen it anyway. But there is nothing here, are you angry because of this?" Hey, you...will not eat my vinegar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not angry and laughs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed twice and said: "We are playing outside in the dark, your Missy is hiding in the room, Merry! I want to wait for me." Dead in the hands of Straw, can you accept these beautiful people around me? Your eccentric hobby, can't you wait for the situation to calm down and enjoy again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Rogge’s cynicism, Androni couldn’t help but be angry. She took Rogge over and said, “I’m just like this! I’m weird, I’m not normal! You are not the first day to know? You are blaming me for moving your butterfly, well, I am leaving! After that, you will look at your woman!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
