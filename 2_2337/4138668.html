			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This world has become the road to the strong, nothing more than the magic of the two ways. Magic is divided into eight systems, and martial arts is more genre, professional complex. I come I ask you, a big magician is fighting with a sword, and who will win and lose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pondered for a long time, said: "If it is two If a person is alone, Juggernaut may win; if each army is armed, it is undoubted that the Magic Guide will win. This is the key to winning, but it is still time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rodriguez nodded, the staff waved, a small chess board appeared in the middle of the two, smiled: accompany me to the next game. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge, although somewhat puzzled, still started with the words. The two necromancers of the young and the old soon made a dozen moves.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodriguez said as he played chess: "In terms of power, the magic of the Magister is far stronger than the martial arts of Juggernaut." However, in the one-on-one battle, the magic guide will almost certainly be defeated, the reason is that there is one more factor, time. This time is rooted in the control of power. Although the power of Juggernaut is small, it has absolute control over this power. The magician inspires the magical energy between the heavens and the earth to hurt the enemy. The power can be shaken, but it takes time to gather magical energy. Therefore, before any magician fights, all preparations are for the powerful magic to fight for time! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chess players made a difference, the old master explained in his mouth, and his men were not idle. In a moment, they even ate two small soldiers of Rogge. Broke his ranks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people of this world often think that having power is strong. It is like thinking that a five-level magician must be stronger than a four-level magician. For example, after I am here, on this board, it is far stronger than yours. "Speaking, the hand lifted, and then flew out of the battle, ate Rogge's white box, and settled in the plate. For a time, the whole game was suppressed by Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger meditation, the old Necromancer's leisurely voice did not stop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some smart When people reach a certain level of power, the powerful power is not everything. The understanding, control and use of power are also very important. So they began to delve into this aspect, such as David Rosello's sword skills, not because of the power, but the control of the subtle, so can be smart, weak and strong. Look at the fog, not a few pounds of strength, but can easily break through the hardwoods comparable to the stone, relying on a thorough understanding of the material itself, and the highest skill of strength. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come here!" Rogge glimmered, rushing up a small soldier, reorganizing the formation, forcing Rodriguez to take back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, comprehension is very fast. In fact, the truth of magic is the same, the winning magic is not necessarily the strongest magic, but the most correct magic. In this respect, you are born with this instinct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking and chatting, Rogge’s chess has been eaten, only After Yu Sanbing was one after another, the five soldiers of the old Necromancer were one after another. And the chessboard is broken, and after seeing a few steps, the king has no way to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Necromancer wand has a wave, the board has turned a circle, and now they are changing chess to come down! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two took the other's chess and started to get down again. Although Roger is far less powerful than the old Necromancer, the advantage on board is too great. And the whole board is controlled in the hands, the old Necromancer is no longer strong, and there is no power to return to the sky, barely struggling for seven or eight steps, and finally the mountain is exhausted, and after two more steps, it will be killed by Rogge.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, my chess is much higher than you, why are you now under you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought for a moment that absolute power is the foundation of everything. The gap in power is so large that it is no longer possible by skill alone. David’s sword is beautiful and beautiful, but unfortunately it’s not useful. It’s not a power. It’s not as good as a sword. It’s straightforward.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s great to know this. In fact, your understanding and mastery of power is far beyond David. David also dares to claim the essence of power. Oh, it’s ridiculous! However, the vast majority of the so-called big six in the world can only stay at his level. In terms of the control of power, even if it is Orphey, it is not necessarily deeper. If you limit your power to the same extent, they can't fight you. However, the absolute gap between your strengths is too great, and it is no longer a skill to make up for. This is like a fully armed mouse. In the world of mice, it is invincible. Even cats can fight, but in the face of tigers, rats with good equipment and high skills are powerless. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a long sigh, Rogge was a little dejected. He thought he could not work as hard as before. It seems that it is still meditation every day to grow the magic, but is there a way to do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, the fat man smashed the Necromancer with a heavy blow, although it was a phantom, but hitting people is the same pain. "Which is such a good thing? The increase in magic is only by your own efforts. If you work hard, you will get a point!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue smiled, didn't dare Think again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's see again, what is the nature of this technique?" Rodriguez replayed a game of chess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two played again, this time the difference is that Rodriguez is pointing down and pointing to Rogge. The Rogge is also smart, and it is a bit more thorough. After a dozen steps, although it is still being beaten, it is much better than the last one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The essence of this technique is the rule!" The voice of the Necromancer is suddenly as heavy as a thousand, and every word seems to have a stalwart. Long blew in Rogge’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A game of chess has rules of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family has a family law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country has laws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water flows to the low stream, the tree to the sun, the deer horses live by the grass, and the migratory birds migrate according to the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the day, there are also rain and wind, and there are four distinct seasons. In this place, there are also mountains and lakes, as well as the earth's veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things in the world, the sun, the moon, and the stars, do not follow the rules. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s brain is like a thunder and lightning, but the fascination is inextricable, and his hands are full of frequency, and the situation has been pulled back in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The world's many powerful people are nothing more than strength and skill, and then skill and strength. There is a tree, a flower is a flower; a tree is not a tree Trees, flowers are not flowers; and flowers or flowers, trees or trees are three realms. In fact, returning to the basics, returning to the ancestors, is still outside the door. I have been the top ten magician, and you are The person I chose, (of course, there is no other choice at the time), how can I not lose face! How to grow the magic, the days are long, the urgency is also urgent. But if you see the vision, still stay in the flower or flower, view The tree or the tree layer is too much to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two players are glued together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, what you see on that day is above all the rules, the most basic law of the world’s operation. It’s just that you are not strong enough now. All comprehend. Now you have seen it, but you have not seen it; one day, you will see everything is empty, but you still see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the game, the game has turned sharply, Rodriguez is already in jeopardy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child, one day, when you face someone who understands all the rules and masters the supreme skills and strength, how do you win? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stunned this time, and the hand that will kill Rodriguez will never let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment, finally dropped the chess piece, will die Rodriguez, and depends on how he cracked the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodriguez smiled secretly, the game suddenly changed, and the king flew a big slash and hid in the corner of his own camp. At the same time, all the soldiers will rise in the same place, but Rogge will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You actually play rogue? ! "Rog is too angry to say anything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, take a closer look, am I a rogue? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger mobilized his spirit to carefully explore the entire board and suddenly screamed: How did the rules change?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real power is to make rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is thinking hard again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he stood up and waved his hand, and all the games were gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't play!" said the fat man with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha", the old necromancer, Yang Tianxiao smiled, although he could not escape the light of judgment, but with you and ***, this world is perfect The order of the order has already been broken, and I will not be afraid of my life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer in the sneer laughs from the bottom up, suddenly lights up, and the body is swiftly made into countless spots of light, scattered in the air, and then disappears without trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I can also use this as my own." Rogge muttered, and there was another chessboard in front of him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog here is a king, and the old Necromancer is only a lonely king. And the bomb can't be moved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodriguez finally saw this game before he left, and there was a gratification in his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only small building that is very lively, but this moment is extremely empty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time, a drop of water fell, splashed a few A small blank.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blank.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great blank.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge doesn't know how to fill this gap, and doesn't want to fill it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire in the fireplace is gradually extinguishing, small The building was slowly filled with chills.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite chair, not long ago, still sitting Rodriguez, the greatest dead spirit Master, for more than 100 years, he has been ranked as the Great Sixty Magi. It is now that all the greatness of the past has passed away, and only the ordinary chair is still standing there silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mu Xiu Yulin The wind will destroy it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least nine of these great mentors, why did the light of judgment simply find Rodriguez?<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodriguez’s bleak voice is ringing in the bottom of my heart: “Every big necromancer is a master of the soul. This is probably the most important thing for the Protoss to kill the Spirit Master. reason. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it must be for this reason. The soul should be the realm of God, so God uses the light of judgment to destroy all the sacred gods. Correspondingly, the light The church uses the stake to deal with all heresy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the father who is high above you, the father of all beings, you are a loving and peaceful person, holy Under the light, all living beings don't share your glory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to mourn your name, only listen to your teachings with all your heart, follow you Instructions to bring your gospel to every corner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you believe in your name, the painful ones will be redeemed; the hungry will surely eat The cold ones will be warm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a gift, why not allow a little bit of heresy?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be the greatest Necromancer, and now even the mark of a little soul has not been left. After a few decades, remember that his people have gone with the dying, I am afraid that no one knows that there has ever been such a person. But this chair, which he once sat, is ignorant, strong and lasting, and may experience more than a hundred years.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long life, and the spirit is easy to get early. What is the reason?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is a soul bead, Rodriguez Gus wants to escape the light of judgment, and he has been relieved for hundreds of years. He is definitely not a problem. Why must he choose the road to confront the Protoss? Why do you give up almost endless life, but also cast a little bit on the order of the world? Variables?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sat quietly in front of the window, next to the game that had just started. He thought hard, but he did not know that he had already burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling your twenty-three years of life experience, it seems that there has been nothing missing. In the moral scholars, he can be regarded as no evil; in the nobility, his own actions are actually not up. Killing, setting fire, violent, framing, and even doing good deeds have done a lot, but what is behind this all-around behavior? No matter what is good or evil, there is always a goal. Where is your goal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that in the past 23 years, this so-called meaning of life is a blank? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog is surging, *** quietly crosses the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the *** and suddenly burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The huge bones are wide open, and the Rogge is gently covered. Under the bones is a warm world, just like the last shelter in this world. Generally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ray of sunshine shines on Rogge’s face, reminding him that a new day has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly stood up and looked around, and now he has returned to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little activity, the hands and feet that have been numb, the screaming, the fat man spit out a sigh of breath in his chest. "Ah, ah!" He learned the same as the orangutan and slammed his chest. "嗵嗵" jumped again in place. Suddenly he stopped and smiled slowly on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are engraved on the floor: "Alive" uses the Gothic flower body used between the great aristocracy and the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, alive. As long as you live, there is hope, as long as you live tomorrow, it will always be unknown. What is the meaning of him, what kind of doctrine he cares about, he must live first, and he must live a better life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is gone, Rogge has come alive again, as if to put down a huge bag of incomparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this ***, when did you learn to write, and also wrote the dragon and the phoenix dance, quite self-awareness, Rogge knows that he and *** are more than calligraphy. Just like the gap between a magic apprentice and a big magician. The fat man squatted down and gently traced his fingers along the nicks on the ground, feeling the thorns of the wood thorns at the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets are getting more and more noisy, and occasionally a carriage will roar. Roger was slightly groomed and ready to go out for a walk. He pushed open the door, and a gust of wind ran into his neck with a chill, letting him take a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street is full of joy, the side of the rich area of ​​Binshe Avenue, mostly the deep house compound, various colored ribbons, colored balls and sculptures illuminated by magical light, will These big families are decorated with flowers. On the other side of the boulevard, it is mostly a small building like Rogge, which is suitable for people living in the middle of the upper class. In contrast, it is much bitter. The Binshe Avenue is very wide. There is a green area in the middle of the road. The evergreen shrubs are neatly trimmed. Every few meters, a cedar is planted and the two sides are intentionally and unintentionally isolated. Although the people living on Binshe Avenue can only be regarded as reluctantly mixed into the upper class in Lille, this intermittent green belt makes them feel a real distance from the middle class. Although this sense of security is only psychological, it still makes the land price on both sides of Binshe Avenue more and more different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the festive atmosphere of the city, surrounded by the beaming pedestrians, Rogge felt the huge, unfillable gap in his heart. Although the *** message made him temporarily suppress the sadness in his heart, it was not enough to make his empty soul refill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a homesickness comes to mind, maybe, it’s time to go home and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rogge hasn’t had much attachment to his family, he has completely broken contact in the past year, but after all, he is a close relative of his own flesh and blood. When he was a child, Old Rivers would take people out every time he was drunk, and sometimes Rogge would be unlucky to meet him. But no matter what, he is his father after all, go home and have a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go home. This thought together can no longer be suppressed. Maybe you just need some affection or feelings to fill this gap in your heart. But no matter what, let's go back once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
