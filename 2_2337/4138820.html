			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hymns in the temple screamed fiercely, and the light of the angels of the sun flew to Rodriguez as the rain. The necromancer had a staff, and the gray flame erupted from the body to form a protective wall. Numerous holy light bullets violently impacted the flame wall, and each explosion caused the flame to dim. For a moment, the Necromancer has been hit by hundreds of Light Bombs, and the wall has been faltering. It was this moment of breathing, Rodriguez's spells are ready. As his finger crossed the last complex symbol, his left hand was completely turned into bone powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge array of fascias emerged on the ground behind Weina, and black flames rose from the sky. In the void above the array, a huge boneless skull was discovered. The bone dragon stared at the light angel, and the huge body slowly came out of the air. Two-thirds of the temple hall has been occupied by this unprecedented giant bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena completely restored to the light angel battle form is not afraid of the strongest undead creature of the bone dragon. However, the bone dragon in front of it has a taste that cannot be said. The average bone dragon is not such a big one. At most, it is only two-thirds of the size. The skeleton is pale or dark gray. Due to the years of sleep, the skeleton often has dust and cobwebs. The whole body is a dark black skeleton, and several looming charms appear from time to time. The uneasiness in Weina's heart became more and more intense. As a light angel, I should be able to deal with the two skulls. Why are you afraid? "Is it wrong, as if I have never heard of the bone dragon summoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina two-wing recycling, white robes without wind, the shrine of the temple Got the highest peak. Weina released the strongest magic of the light angel "Light Angel Guardian", a spherical milky white mask to protect itself. "I said it, the Supreme God did not bless you." The cold voice of the Necromancer once again sounded in the heart of Weina. The two wings of the skeleton of the dragon have been fanned up, and they are heading up to the sky, and a silent roar spreads rapidly. Outside the temple, the imperial creatures are slamming into the temple, and the knights and the priests who are trying to rush into the temple. If they are hit hard, some of the weaker knights spurt a blood and slowly fall to the ground. Wella’s wall also showed a wave of volatility and was stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just that the dragon screams can’t afford it, if it’s a dragon...” Weina couldn’t think about it and turned and wanted to escape. At this time, there is no silent interest. Wella's protective wall fluctuated violently, and it was hidden. Suddenly a glare, almost blind glare, accompanied by a sudden storm, swept everything in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything calms down, Wella has been embedded in the wall of the temple, and the white robe has been torn into a rag, such as ice and snow. Most of the skin is naked and covered with blood. As the storm subsided, Wella's body slipped to the ground, leaving a shocking blood mark on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it’s a light angel, I have suffered a dragon's breath, but there is only a little flesh wound on my body, but your power has been exhausted." Spit a blood, barely pulled up the broken robe to block the naked out of the **, said hard: "You should know that everything you do today can't escape the eyes of the Father in the sky, even if your power goes beyond I will not be the opponent of any one of the main gods. The light of the judgment of the cough will soon come, no matter where you hide, you will not escape the fate of purification."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you still don't know what I want. As a necromancer, my strength has reached the limit of this world. No matter what I have done, the light of judgment will come, isn't it? God Rodriguez shook his head. "I have been hiding for three hundred years. I have no longer want to hide. Now, my lovely light angel, take your soul." give it to me". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What! No!! Na suddenly screamed and screamed, and there was no sacred look like a light angel. "My child, let you see The evil of the world, "The Undead Master sang the spell again, and the arm of the left arm was turned into ashes. With the completion of the spell, the figure outside the temple slowly came in. It was Bishop Brunn. He maintained a good face on weekdays. It was the color of the iron blue, the eyes were sluggish, and the blood was covered. The wound blood in the throat had already drained, and the flesh and blood that turned open was pale. Bren found Wei Na, and his eyes gradually gathered in the white, straightening It was covered with blood and bruises on the thighs. The ** before the birth was strengthened by the undead spells, and the bishop's throat screamed like a beast, thrown on the light angel.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina calms down, gathers the only divine power, ignores the cardinal who is scratching her body, and laughs at the necromancer: "You think this can be done." Got my soul? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
