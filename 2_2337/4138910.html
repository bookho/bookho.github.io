			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counting, the city of Sidde has been trapped for five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Rogge is a bit strange, and the city of Sidde can support it for so long. However, the information sent back every morning shows that the city of Sidde is still standing under the attack of the Serk people. Rogge immediately decided that the army turned, and the military front pointed to the Burton Pass between the Empire and the Principality of Cékelay. As long as you capture this mountain pass, you can cut off the retreat of the Serk people. Then, after being attacked from the back, it echoed with the city of Side, forming a situation of encirclement. At that time, as long as the city is in the next battle, you can annihilate all the main forces of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rogge’s current number of troops is only 10,000, there are no more people in the Selecle, but all are elite soldiers, and the strong players in the array cloud. In addition, the Sergey people can't attack the city of Sidde for a long time, and the morale is low and the supply is getting more and more difficult. If this is not to win, Rogge will not need to mix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the support of the City of Side? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the floating city flew away, Rogge suddenly became a little used to it. In the past, due to the existence of dragons and many powerful people, the battlefield of thousands of miles was completely transparent in front of him. The small-scale detective rider naturally has a strong person to clean up, and the enemy brigade has always had a chance to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, although he still knows the movements of the enemy on the battlefield, there is no such thing as the innocence of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge had just set a plan for the battle, and then there was a news that shocked him because of the loss in the siege of the city. The Sergey people actually withdrew! Rogge immediately marched in the direction of the Polton Mountain Pass, in order to intercept the army before the Seychelles returned to the territory of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is now rich in wings and has the support of the Asrofic Empire, so the philosophy of war at this moment and the university scholars specializing in politics between big countries Man has quite a similarity. The most famous place of Henman is that the naked advocates the violence of the great powers, claiming that only a greater war can stop the war. Therefore, in order to prevent violations, it is necessary for a country to madly retaliate against every violation. Scholars who had hostile schools summarized his claims into two sentences: people bite me and I kill the whole family. Henman laughed and laughed, and even said that these two sentences have fully represented the essence of his doctrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man can endure a temporary failure, and can even endure the Seychelles to capture Schild, but he can not tolerate the entry of enemy forces to leave. Although the war was provoked by the Asrofik Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a day and night of rapid marching, the Imperial Army finally grabbed the Bolton Pass before the Serk, and built simple fortifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray Baldon Mountains rushed from south to north and stopped before the red clay wasteland. The sunset is like blood. The cliffs that stand on the mountain pass face to face, and the whistling north wind blows people unstable. There is a chill between heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogley is at the peak and looks into the distance. When the red smoke began to rise on the horizon, he couldn't help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is a carnival in the city of Silton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time in the city of Serkers, the old man of the city, John Stone, knew that the three thousand weak troops could not hold the city of Silton. However, the human nature of the Northland, Silton City is another gathering place for many adventurers, mercenaries and even criminals. Therefore, he took the initiative to open the warehouse immediately, recruiting adventurers to defend the city with a large number of gold coins. John Stone is still a natural agitator. He does not mention the tragic ending after the break of the city. Instead, he links the city to the dignity of the man of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old general’s speech was short and powerful, and ended up with a big sentence: Are you a man? ! Then call the Sergey, who is raised by the bitch, back to his hometown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just half a day, almost all the adult men in the city of Silton were assigned a weapon and simple armor, and then boarded the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the killing begins, the murder of the northern country and the fierceness in the blood vessels are completely ignited! Under the city, killing the sound, the blood flows into the river. Everyone has already killed the red eyes, only the war dead, no back! Later, the city head not only had a heroic battle, but some women who had died husband and son also became a head lioness, smashing and biting the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, John Stone not only fulfilled all the bounty, but also prepared a large amount of spirits to allow the active adventurers to drink. And he himself is busy with the imperial warriors who died in battle. John Stone knew that his trespassing of the national treasury had seriously violated the imperial rules. If he fell into the hands of Rogge, who had always been sinful, he had only one dead end. Therefore, the veteran general simply fouled and hoped that all the soldiers of the war dead would go down before Rogge returned to the division. Although the soldiers left by Rogge were from the Principality of Aray, John Stone was a real soldier. In the side-by-side battle, he has already cared for these soldiers as their own sons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these nights, the sadness and carnival in the city of Silton coexist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the harsh metal friction, the weather-sealed copper door of the "Sword Bay" pub was opened, and a cold wind screamed Drilled into the pub. However, the hot air in the pub rises, the atmosphere is warm, and the red-faced alcoholic drinker is stunned by the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance is a beautiful and proud female warrior, dressed in a scarlet warrior suit, covered with light blue inlaid with various colored stones, waist Hanging a gorgeous sword that is magnificent. As soon as the female warrior appeared, the pub was whistling and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For adventurers who have a bloody career, the jewel-encrusted armor is the worst defense, and the flashy weapon is just a noble toy. If you change the time and place, this kind of woman with a lot of valuable decorations will be the best prey in their eyes, but at the moment there is absolutely no rotten guy who dares to come up with manual feet, even the idea of ​​borrowing wine and madness No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, the female warriors have been fighting alongside them in the city, and most of her people have already seen it. Even in the worst places to kill, the female swordsman is also calm, as if walking in his garden. Her sword skills are unpretentious, but they are also the most direct and effective. Every time a sting can see clear tricks, but killing the enemy has always been a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rose is beautiful, but it is thorny and every thorn is deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor that makes these alcoholic people dare not mess up is the one-eyed dragon owner, Corbetian. During the city defense war, this low-key tavern owner did not know what kind of feelings he touched, and recalled the happy time when the murder was arson. So he casually took the Tomahawk, leaned up and went to the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One eyed dragon saw the blood, and the scars on his body were shining with red light! A huge battle axe circling in his hands, if a light butterfly. Unlike the female warrior on the other side of the wall, Kirbytian never kills the enemy with an axe. Under his big axe, the blood is splashing and the flesh is flying. Almost every enemy will be cut into three or fifty axes in an instant, and then will be sealed by an axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this war, those drunkards who used to have troubles in the Bay of Wine will wake up from a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warrior walked through the crowded wine table and walked to the bar. The adventurers immediately gave her a spacious road. No one dares to take a picture of her hips, and the cost of offending her is at least an arm, and it is very likely to catch life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in front of the bar, her lips slanted slightly downwards, staring at the one-eyed dragon boss. Kirbytian was busy commanding the only two maids to count the number of bottles the adventurers drank. He turned back and asked John Stone for money. As for the female warrior in front of the bar, he only saw such a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s finger tapped the bar and smiled: “Corbian, the more you pretend to be invisible, the more guilty you are!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub owner reluctantly snorted, a fierce one-eyed shot, staring at the female warrior: "Lentini! You are not at ease to be you The princess, nothing to run to this red squid without a hamster. What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini smiles more beautifully, still in the second Ten years ago, she knew that the more such a one-eyed dragon looks, the more fierce it is. She smiled and said: "I didn't expect that Corbetian in the East China Sea would go to this small town to open a tavern. Are you ready to do a big deal? This pub has been open for a few years. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corbitian smiled for 15 years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini glanced, the smile on her face faded away. She couldn't believe it: "Don't you... after that thing, you will Have you been hiding here to open a pub? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini suddenly said: "I am going to the South."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cortitian's face changed slightly to go, what does it have to do with me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just lost once, and actually hid it for 15 years! Lost you have been with De Klerk teacher for so long, the teacher’s perseverance, you have not learned anything at all? Are you so afraid of Prossis? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub owner was alone in the eyes, and then went to silence. He said faintly: "You were still small at the time, many things you didn't know." of. But everything has passed, and now I really like to be a small boss quietly. In the teacher's flute, you and Pross are the highest talents, and have created their own unique sword skills. This time you suddenly decided to go south, is it already sure to restrain his starry temper? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lentini shook her head and found no good way. But I heard that he gave the blue sky to a young disciple, and the sword is here. I am here, so I immediately rushed here, I want to see if I can grab the blue sky and have a blue sky, Prosses is not my opponent! In addition, I heard that the magician Naqba It’s here to live in seclusion, I want him to see if there is anything else that can be improved in this hurricane.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kebutian shakes his head and falls It did appear here, the person who took it was a very young girl, and it seemed to be a disciple of Prossis. But what I didn't expect was that she actually had the power of the sanctuary. Rossis was a genius, and she could teach such a young Sanctuary! However, you'd better not hit the idea of ​​a starry sky. I heard that the girl is a member of the Asrothic Empire, and that guy is not something we can sin. As for Naqba, he is already dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead? Lentini frowned and sighed: "Forget it, die and die." Anyway, my hurricane is very easy to use. Rogge is the guy who holds the double flag of blood and throws Tiffany all the way? I heard that his younger style is fierce and poisonous, and it is very my heart. But as long as you help me, why does he stop me from grabbing the stars? "Breakian sighed: "I still want to live two more years, and I don't want to be enemies with at least five of the Sanctuary's strongmen behind him." Don't come to me if you explain this to death. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five Sanctuary! So the rumors of the floating city and the dragon are true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is not important, isn't it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lentini looked fiercely at Kirbytian and suddenly smiled: "Well, I will no longer play the idea of ​​a starry sky." But you have to accompany me to the South. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combine sighs and loves hateful women is terrible! After so many years, you still want to kill him. But I am already five Ten, now I just want to save more money, and then find a quiet place to retire. Besides, I have not moved the sword for many years, and I don’t want to move the sword. The martial arts have regressed so badly that I can’t help you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini was suddenly chilling, and she said with anger: "You are always like this, don't dare to do it, don't do anything, so you are like It's not like Pross! You don't mean you don't want to move your sword anymore, what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed into thick oak Made on the bar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire bar was covered with cracked fine lines in an instant, and then slammed into pieces of irregularly small pieces of wood. With a bang, a rough sword with a red copper sheath fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sword does not know what metal and craftsmanship to make, and the contact with the bluestone ground is like a loud bell, which rang through the pub and pressed the country. The alcoholic people were silent for a moment, and they brushed their eyes to the two. However, they only saw Lentini and Corbetian contemptuously, and occasionally their lips moved a little, and everything they said could not be heard. The front of the wine merchants looked at each other, and then they saw Lentini look back without expression, and glanced at the audience, and the right hand touched the hilt inadvertently or unintentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people immediately resumed the action of the moment before, drinking, chatting, and banqueting the maid, and the pub was once again overwhelmed by the noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the great sword that fell to the ground, Kirbytian’s face changed rapidly, and the one-eyed eyes looked awkward under the beating ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the pub door was suddenly pushed away by a violent force, and a young man who was very excited was rushing to Kirbytian. He noticed a place to be awkward, but because he was too excited and did not care about it, he only said to Kirbytian: "Uncle! You still don't know? Rogge is all stunned by the escaping Sergey. At this moment, the army has entered. I was going to the military camp early in the morning, and the prince’s army would not recruit new recruits! In case I was lucky, I was chosen to be the guard of Prince Rogge, that would be great!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combine took a lot of young people’s shoulders and almost sat down on the ground, then smiled: 'It’s not a joke on the battlefield, you are now Still tender. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s face is red and arguing: 'I am already eighteen years old! And I also participated in the defending city and also killed two Sergey. People! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combinean shook his head with some helplessness and opened the subject: "Is Luo Ge’s adult already in the city? How many prisoners did he bring? Come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Capture?" The young man was somewhat puzzled: "I didn't see any prisoners!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentini and Corbetian looked at each other and their faces changed slightly. The wind and sword saint took a long breath and sighed at Kirbytian: "This little guy... is really embarrassing. It seems that you are right, or it is a trick to provoke him. How to go with me to the south "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corbitian picked up the giant sword on the ground and gently stroked it with his hand. His face was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, at the headquarters of the Chaoshan Legion, Rogge was sitting in the Chamber of Deputies, and his face was gloomy and closed. He is actually extremely angry with John Stone's assertion. At the beginning, he tried his best to forcefully pass the Tiffany's plan and tried to look back at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparsely populated, less powerful Sergey Principal dare to attack the Rogge road after the soldiers of the country, and besieged in the city of Sild, has been given to Rogge A slap in the right face. In the eyes of the insiders, John Stone opened the military arsenal and recruited mercenaries. In the eyes of the insiders, it was undoubtedly a slap in the face of Rogge’s left face waving the emperor. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time in the city of Sirde, even in the troops brought by Rogge from the Principality of Aray, Johnstone’s prestige has reached its peak. At this moment, if Roger wants to dispose of him, he might even provoke a mutiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a vague footstep outside the hall, and Rogge sat down, putting his face in a gloomy position and replacing it with the most brilliant smile. After a few moments, almost all the important subordinates of Rogge have arrived and are listed on both sides of the Chamber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Rogge frowned. He leaped to the ground, trotting all the way to the front of John Stone, the veteran who had already been smashed with frost, and then picked up the military emblems on the ground and carefully placed him on the military uniform. When he wore the emblem that represented Johnstone in his rank, Rogge stopped. He looked at the brass badge that decorated the three long swords and represented the colonel, and smashed it into a scrap of copper. On one side, then sigh: "How can our heroes of the Chaoshan Legion be just a colonel? From now on, the Major General of the Empire has carved a drafting instrument and asked General John Stone to the Emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside John Stone, he knew that he and Rogge were not guilty. He had offended him before the expedition, so he was greeted with Rogge with a mortal heart, but who thought of it not only No punishment, but promoted to the office? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge Adult! Thank you for your appreciation, but I have violated the rules of the Emperor..." Old John Stone is a very honest soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha laughed for a while, and holding the old general’s shoulder intimately violated the rules of the emperor? I do not know how? Haha, don't worry, here is the emperor's rules that I explained. I didn't think that the Sergey people dared to cover the road. It seems that I have to ask you a lot more about the war. Now, at the beginning of the battle. I will leave you five thousand soldiers to defend Sirder. I am going back to the Imperial City tomorrow. After you have arranged the defense of the Sidde City, I will allow you to take a month's holiday and take time to go back and see the family! By the way, we should have a grand reception this evening to celebrate our hero becoming an empire general! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Stone's heart finally swelled. He paid for it, maybe the past was really a prejudice to see the young prince.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge’s smile suddenly solidified, and he looked up and sniffed in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ability of this little guy to sneak is not bad, but unfortunately, the murderous heavy weight is just not suffocating!" Hughes said with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two guards have just died. This guy is a good guy." Rogge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni lazily said: "He actually sneaked from the main entrance, very smart! It is estimated to use arrows."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and came to me. But I want to kill me like this, is it too naive? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Androni grabbed the starry sky and he started, I will stop him again!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of officers in the hall heard the dialogue of the three people are confused, completely unclear what they mean, only the face of Rose instantly pale, and immediately returned to normal. But these slight changes did not escape Rogge's sharp eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breeze plunged into the hall from the door of the door of the Chamber. Falling in with the wind, there is a long and half-fat, silky and strange long arrow, or called a needle will be more appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the goal of John Stone’s back, but Rogge has no doubt that with its penetrating power, it can easily pass through the old general’s body, and then Drill into your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man pulled John Stone aside, then reached out and grabbed the silky long arrow between the two fingers. The black gas on the arrow, like the vitality, quickly caught Rogge's fingers. The fat man smiled faintly, and the two fingers smashed. The fine arrow had been crushed and the black gas on the fingertips quickly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poison on the arrow is already very powerful, but any poison that can't turn over a dragon can't help the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when, Androni in the hall has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night sky outside the window suddenly flashed a beautiful blue light band, and then there was a faint sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mer's face was completely white, but she bit his lip gently, adding a little blood to the gray lips, and then the face returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sneaked in from the window and threw a tall man in black in his hand on the floor. Rogge stepped forward and rolled over the man's kick. When he saw the man's face, he first glimpsed and then laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man kneels, pats the man’s unusually handsome face with his hand, and the warmth of the laugh is like a spring breeze: “Is this not Raleigh? If I don’t have If you remember the mistake, you are a great poet, a good lurker, a great killer, and a dream lover of the entire imperial girl! How can such a great task suddenly fall to such a place? Hey, hehe, haha! Is there any special reason why you are so arrogant? It doesn't matter, the road to the emperor is far away, we have time to talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo snorted, But nothing can be said. He almost always has a few brilliant stars on his joints. Under the eros of the starry atmosphere of the haze, Relo went all out and could only support not to faint. From the point of view of the constraints, only the top magical shackles can be better than the stars. Only those who have been locked up by the starry sky for a long time will suffer great damage to all aspects of the body. Of course, neither Androni nor Rogge will worry about the health of Relo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is proud of this fat man, at this moment, Relo has been guilty of killing thieves, unable to return to heaven. The lingering light in his eyes suddenly reflected in the face of Rose. Her skin color has been very clear, but in the past it was white with ruddy whiteness, and now it is morbid pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo’s heart was anxious and painful, and finally fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky in Richelieu is gloomy and heavy, and large swaths of snow fall into the air. This fashion is in the afternoon, and some of the light that should have been blocked by the extremely thick lead clouds. Whether it is the street or the residents, the various lighting sources are illuminated. Under the dark sky above the city, it seems that the morning fainting is reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial prime minister, Straw, pushed open the window of the study, and the cold wind and the cold snow made him wake up, but he could not reduce his heart. Deep uneasiness and irritability. In the past six months, the white on his head has been a lot more, and his face has gradually lost his look. He still holds the power of the empire, the forces in his hands are still strong, and he has decided to stand in the political arena of the empire after he has made a timely decision and abandoned the former allies and the city of Frederick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
