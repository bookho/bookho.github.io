			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows how long the arena has been idle, perhaps hundreds of years, maybe thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is called the big arena because the battlefield is vast. In fact, this battlefield is full of dozens of kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Arena is actually a natural little plain. Around the small plains, there are more than ten peaks standing tall, and these mountain peaks are the auditoriums of the big arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has always had only one audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most prosperous arena, each agent has a master. Nowadays, if there are only five spectators around the big arena, there will be no more prosperity in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lonely tall figure in the center of the big arena, which should have been the owner of the sixth mountain, the ninth knight Heinrich. But today, he is a fighter on the big arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a thousand miles, no undead creature exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the big arena of the world of death, only the great arena of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich is quietly standing in the middle of the big arena, like a statue without life. His phantom horses spewed a faint gray mist from the nostrils from time to time. The ends of the four hooves could not see the iron hooves of the general ghost horses, and some were only four clouds that could not be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual fluctuations of the kings straddle over the big arena. They have received a response from the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** is flying from afar to the big arena, even though her degree is recognized as the world’s number one death, no momentary help, to arrive It will take a long time here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most not lacking in the world of death is time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the long life of the kings, the time waiting for *** is just a drop in the ocean. They have enough patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know when it will be time, the auditorium here will be filled again!" The fire of wisdom is the longest of all kings, it The spiritual fluctuations also carry the unique desolation of the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has been a seat that has lost the owner, and will immediately vacate two more seats..." The dragon of the abyss sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich said: "The soul of the magic Hectoria has no powerful body, and it should have been shredded by the storm of space." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Heinrich, there is still some time away from the arrival of ***. Can you really control the power?? After all, I am the best *** opponent." A strange sound sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich faintly said: "In the world of death, existence or destruction is meaningless. The strength of our death knight is fast, but once Growth can't be reversed. This time in different space travels, I have to upgrade my strength. At most, I have to go to the cemetery of the king for another hundred or two hundred years. Dear Bone Emperor, I thank you for your kindness. But don't worry, maybe there are hundreds of years, there will be the tenth Cavaliers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Emperor sighs a respectful Nine knights, we have only been together for more than seven hundred years, it is too short. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Kings, I think this solution is not appropriate. The Emperor of the Black Warrior suddenly spoke up. "Now we have the last time, why not find a solution?" Paying such a big price is just to eliminate ***, I don't think it is wise. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*** must be wiped out!" Lich Elgar slammed the ground: "The honorable black warrior emperor, your history as a king is too short, I don't know why we would rather pay such a price, and we must also eliminate it. This is not because she offended us, and even her disregard of the first law is not the main reason. The most important reason is because she is a heterogeneous king, and her existence will endanger the entire world of death. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor of the Black Warrior sighed heavily with a fire of respectful wisdom. I respect your wisdom, although I do not agree with your argument. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big arena has once again quieted down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the sky seems to be The lead cloud that never changed in the past suddenly moved, and the big arena once again woke up from a deep sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint white light flashing between heaven and earth,* ** Falling from the sky, falling in the center of the big arena.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of the devil are opened like petals, a pair of white wings In the back of the *** can not stretch, and finally proudly stretched out in the gale of the outside world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a piece of lead gray death world, this pair The white wings look so eye-catching.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the demon mask slowly open, and the flowing silver halo has an indescribable pride. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Silver eyes slowly sweep over five peaks and finally land on the ninth knight Heinrich.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you? *** I asked coldly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich replied: "It's me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The brow is slightly wrinkled and coldly: "It's a weird decision." How much do you have to overcome my grasp? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only half. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The eyes turned cold, the right hand was caught, and the Death Scythe appeared in the hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Her death knife slanted to the ground behind her, and her left hand reached Heinrich, faintly said: "The coordinates are brought. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich's right hand covered with heavy armor turned into a shadow like a solid body, taking a small group of nearly transparent light balls from the chest. Come.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The left hand and the five fingers close together and gently crush the ball of light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I promised in the name of the kings of the world of death, this is the only coordinate to the world, and we will not enter the world again in the future, to attack the man who took the dark dragon of Elgra. Heinrich said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Cold and authentic: "Good, then let's get started!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five peaks are lit up one by one, and the surging power does not flow from the kings, it is endless, endless!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames of five different colors ignited above the mountain peaks, which illuminate the entire arena.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of the kings stretched in the air, and finally merged in the center of the big arena. In the blink of an eye, an invisible force field has enveloped the entire arena!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, the faint light blue brilliance is filled with empty space, replacing the original five-color flame, shining on the big arena.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heinrich looked up at the pale blue sky, and did not know when there would be such a sky in our world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After feeling Heinrich Put down the mask of the helmet, reach out and grab a hand, a three-meter-long horror double-edged sword appeared in his hands!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great sword is close to the sword The handle is inlaid with a fist-sized blood red gemstone. The first half of the blade is a sharp blade, and the second half is a row of huge sawtooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible sword is as light as nothing in the hands of Heinrich. The ninth knight's wrist was slightly shaken, and hundreds of swords and shadows flickered in the air. A light blue flame first ignited on the giant sword and then spread to the ninth knight. In a blink of an eye, a fierce cyan flame column rises in Heinrich!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple electric fire was also raised on the sorcerer's sickle, and her strength is still rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the canopy of the five kings, *** and Heinrich can use all the power to fight without worrying about the heavens By. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole earth is shaking slightly, and the small sandstone begins to float in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghosts and horses are so red in their eyes that they are so bleeding, it suddenly rises to the sky, the invisible shock waves spread, and the sands floating in the air have been shocked. Broken into stone powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** A little surprised, she never thought that Heinrich’s ghost horse also had such power. It seems that this battle may not be as good or bad as she expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Gregory is here, presumably want to scream the Ninth Cavalier to hit two? But the power of the bone dragon is really far from the ghost of the ninth knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Rogge is here, it’s almost the same...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The chaotic thoughts, the silver in the eyes was getting colder and colder, and her body suddenly shook a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Heinrich’s command, the ghost horse leaps forward and instantly appears in the sky of tens of meters!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge death sickle appears strangely, silently passing in the original position of Heinrich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of *** is still standing proudly in the air hundreds of meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the figure of *** suddenly broke, and disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***After disappearing, Heinrich also followed. The figure of the Ninth Knight was strangely smoothed out for dozens of meters, and then he backhanded a sword and stabbed the empty space below the ghost horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Scythe once again passed silently from the original position of Heinrich, and the ninth knight’s sword tip passed through the *** Chest!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the figure of *** once again turned into nothingness, the ninth knight stabbed, but it was a virtual shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very strange battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** and Heinrich are like each playing, a sword in the east, a knife in the west, it seems completely irrelevant. The Ninth Cavaliers can still leave the moving track as if they are completely separated from the Death Scythe. The figure is flashing everywhere, and the Death Scythe is like a spirituality, flickering and smashing. knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is here, the two kings are only trying to test each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings are watching the duel quietly, and there is no spiritual fluctuation in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** and Heinrich suddenly stopped and yelled in the air again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost of the horse spurted out two gray fogs in the nose, roaring, and the four hooves rushed over! The fire flash in Heinrich’s eyes Bright, the green flame on the giant sword dragged a long trail behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich shouted, the great sword swayed and slammed from the bottom up! The power of this sword is so great The reversal of the sword alone makes the ghost horse only vainly swaying the four hooves, but it is impossible to advance!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***In the eyes of the silver light Flash, the Death Scythe flickering, and the ninth knight's giant sword is smashing!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Scythe and the Great Sword are silently approaching... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small group of dazzling light suddenly appears in the center of the big arena!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a sudden darkness between heaven and earth, and a giant tornado suddenly appeared. The top of the tornado slammed into the pale blue sky, exploding a cloud of smoke that was a few kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of imaginary voices flooded the entire arena in the next moment. This road is enough to make people's crazy sound waves intertwined, echoing, for a long time, only gradually quiet down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke is scattered, and the ninth and the ninth knight are far away, just as they have never moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the giant sword of Heinrich blasted a huge gap of more than a foot, and the gap was almost half the depth of the sword. The blade has completely disappeared!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Starting to slowly dance the Scythe, all the surrounding space seems to be gathered on the blade of the Death Sword, and then constantly The ground collapses, shrinks continuously, and becomes dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the dance of *** was anxious and slow, and it seemed to be getting more and more difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a new huge blade of death. This blade flickers and looks like a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the kings know what the horror of the Death Sword is now. This shadow is made up of countless collapsed spaces, enough to cut all hard material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, there began to be a spiritual fluctuation carrying uneasy emotions. The kings were asking each other, and *** had mastered this level of attack skills. Yet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich’s giant sword suddenly shattered, and every piece of debris turned into a blue flame, and then reconstructed a whole entityless Great sword of fire. In the mouth of the ghost horse, a large group of thick fog began to spurt, and the figure of the Ninth Knight gradually fell into the thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are occasional gravel drops in the sky, and these gravels are rolled into the sky by the storms that Heinrich and *** . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally a piece of gravel passes over the edge of the dense fog that Heinrich hides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of the gravel that has not entered the fog has disappeared, and the fracture is as smooth as a mirror, as if it had been cut by the sharpest blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, the fog has spread to tens of meters, and then it no longer expands, just tumbling in the same place...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two kings’ decisive battles are now officially started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The hand is tight, dancing with a death knife and stunned! She screams and turns into a thick fog!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick fog is first shrinking, then bursting suddenly! A small group of small smog splashes all over the place, and if it falls on the ground, it will erode a bottomless bottom on the ground. Small hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, *** is another whistling, flying out of the fog. Her appearance is a bit embarrassing, and the streamers dancing around the demon lotus are less than one-half. The erected demon lotus leaves are not beautiful lines. Their tips seem to be corroded by something, and the sharp corners become Irregular blunt shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog of terror gradually dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Ninth's Flames are now only a small group of faint cyan flames, and more than a dozen robes on the armor that shines in the faint blue light. Traces, the pony tail of the ghost horse is gone. But it seems that he is still more fluent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich snorted, the green flame on the giant sword re-ignited, and the ghost horse again spewed a thick mist. In a twinkling of an eye, another thick fog rolled in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***With a milky white flame trail, once again into the dense fog...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This time it was an earth-shattering explosion!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The figure was thrown helplessly from the fireworks, rolling hundreds of meters in the air This is barely condensing the body. The streamer of the demon lotus has completely disappeared, and the protruding part of the nail leaf seems to have been melted. The edges of a pair of wings also have some black marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of the desperate struggle, the stunned space fragments of the scorpion slashed, the sharpness of these fragments is unparalleled, that is, Heinrich can not bear, can only dodge to dodge. But there are so many space debris, and there are still more than a dozen pieces that have been shot through his powerful body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost limbs were also cut off by the ***, and although they are still able to fly in the air, the flexibility is far less than the original. The bloody red eyes of the horses once again looked at the ** and there were some fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich screamed, the Great Flames once again returned to their original state, and the ghost horses gasped sharply, spurting the fog. After a short time, the thick fog group appeared again in the arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the right hand of the knive grip has faintly trembled. The kings have already seen that there is a golden blood that is slipping down the knives of the Death Scythe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whistling sound, *** once again entered the dense fog!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dense fog Dispersed and gathered together, gathered and scattered. Although it is getting thinner, it is still incompetent and reborn again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Heinrich's thick fog and flame sword, the degree of *** is completely impossible, she only relies on unparalleled melee The attack power and the ingenious use of power are hard to fight with the Ninth Cavaliers. However, the time to become a king is too short. Compared with Heinrich, who has been through the millennium, she is far from being inferior in strength. Although the result of each fight is a small loss for Heinrich, but the disadvantages of the battle are more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just her arrogant heart that has never wavered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly breathing, *** still rushed into the fog like a wind!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This time her time in the fog is exceptionally long...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another violent explosion, but this time the storm is no longer the first It was enough to discolor the heavens and the earth during the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich fell from the thick fog and fell heavily on the ground. The green armor in his body has completely disappeared. There are dozens of holes in the gray-black strong body, and there is no faint smoke. There is only one hilt in the sword in his hand, and there is no one-and-a-half-point green flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, the ghost horse also fell from the thick fog, when it was still in the air, it was a mourning, only the remaining body suddenly divided Dozens of pieces have fallen to the ground, and in a twinkling of an eye they have become a piece of gray and strange stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the body of *** once again flew out from the thick fog, this time with her, except for the broken knife that broke into several pieces, still There was a white feather that fluttered in the sky and a golden drizzle that suddenly appeared in the sky...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil was suddenly smashed, and the petite body under the gray robe was completely The beauty and the delicateness that do not belong to the world of death seem to have no weight, floating in the air, falling slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silky black is smashed by the wind...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup in Rogge’s hand was suddenly crushed and the hot tea splashed The opposite of Xius and the next Froya were all there, only Ai Luoote behind him was not affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to die, fat man! How do you suddenly end up..." Froya is full of tea and broken porcelain on her chest, she is ashamed and angry. I still have a heart-warming and precious tea, and I can’t help but make it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she just screamed and stopped, and a pair of green eyes looked at Rogge’s hand in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stream of blood is spilling along with his gripping fingers, apparently broken by the broken porcelain, but he is unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s strength is incomparable. If he has the heart to resist, just slightly strengthen it, let alone a small broken porcelain, that is, let Froya take a knife to cut him. It may not be able to cut through his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
