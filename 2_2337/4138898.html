			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s temporary office is located in the most luxurious private residence of Solato, where the original owner has become the soul of the Scarlet Doubles, but I don’t know There is no place in the crystal of Elgara. The city that has been devastated has already returned to order, and the arrival of the 70,000-strong army has made the city of Soratu still busy, but the crowds are full of dead air but can’t get out of the city. In Rogge's eyes, the heavens and the earth are full of souls that are everywhere. Their power is too weak to get into the eye of Elgra, but the emotions and strong souls of the moment before their birth are generally strong, so they will not be scattered for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that whenever and wherever, it’s always in front of Rogge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the scene with the most appearances, that is, the beautiful woman who is sleeping in the middle of the sorrow, is not the moment when the mask is picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he saw was in the squally wind of the dead world, the top of the lonely peak, the demon that was almost withered, but still standing tall, was the quiet wipe To the soul of the imprint, rather quietly destroyed ***! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge locked himself in the room alone, looking at the countless *** that seemed to be true and illusory, letting time pass quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the night fell again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, and the soldiers who have been busy in the city for a whole day have entered the dream one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge opened the door and strode to the temporary headquarters of the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, more than a dozen senior generals were summoned to the conference room to discuss tomorrow's expedition. Within the day of the army, there is also a city of Feilun. But compared with Sorato, Fei Lun is far from being in the city defense or the population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge directly on Feilun, is the target of the next offense, and then let the generals make their own how the army marches, how to replenish, How to break into the plan of the joint attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just listened, but his thoughts had already flown to the dead world that had already been destroyed. It is a lead-colored sky, an endless hurricane, an endless wilderness, black armor, white wings, and a white feather that once touched the fingertips. Rogge pressed the next picture and floated a new picture. "Master Rogge, this is the plan for the next few days. Do you still need to make any changes?" Wallace asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the same!" Rogge did not listen to the content of the plan at all, just said: "Burn the original flag! Embroider my coat of arms to the blood color double On the flag, in the future, this is the flag of our army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals were shocked. Rogge’s move will only force the enemy to fight against death, increase the casualties of the soldiers in vain, and add unnecessary variables to the war. But seeing Rogge's calm contains a murderous face, and then think of the horrible existence of this army, who would not want to say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the generals just wanted to leave, Rogge suddenly sighed: "Wait! The strictest gods also have their generosity, so we have to give Those who are willing to trust us have a chance. In this way, every time before the siege, they will ask each other if they are willing to surrender. As long as one person does not drop, the news of the massacre will find a way to inform the Delaware!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the generals have left, and only Rogge is still sitting alone in the conference room, until the first line of light pierces the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning cold wind, tens of thousands of troops slowly stepped out of the city of Sorato to the next goal. The light ride in the army took another step, going to attack the enemy and cutting off the back road of the small town of Feilun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the army went out of the city, the long dragons in the city of Sorato were ringing, and the soldiers in the march turned back and planned to see the dragon again. However, the soldiers who are back are all stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate Rogge seems to be aware of it, and suddenly returns! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it’s not just the two dragons that rise from the city of Sorato, but also a shining castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary floating city, this is the glory that only the gods of that day can enjoy alone! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge castle, under the escort of two dragons, took the light flames away from the light, and slowly flew over the heads of tens of thousands of troops. The huge shadow, almost tens of thousands of soldiers are shrouded under it, even the most brave, most disrespectful wild warriors, finally worshipped under this miracle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Floating then rose to the sky and gradually disappeared into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when, tens of thousands of troops have mostly squatted on the ground, and the prayers and praises of the goddess are boiling. Only Rogge stood in the same place, silently watching the city of floating into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of Feilun has no suspense. In the small town, even the army and the people together are less than 30,000 people, and the city defense is short and old. The only thing that will be remembered by Feilun is that the people here not only love their hometown, but also the blood of the brave country of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the bloody double flag, they refused to surrender! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has been replaced with a new focus. Because of the overnight work, this steel armor is extremely rough, the only advantage is that it is thick enough and heavy, and the weight of the double-edged axe in Rogge's hand is that the strong orc warrior does not necessarily win. The huge axe of the one-meter circle is shining with chilling cold light all the time. The thick handle of the curved bend also reminds people of the fierceness of this giant axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The adults are really brave!" Robsky also put on the armor, and the sword stood next to Rogge. Although he is afraid of his heart, he has always had to face up with difficulties. In the midst of the chaos, the great military lord will be the safest place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robertsky, you step back. You will die next to me." Rogge faintly. His voice came out through the gap between the helmet and the mask, which seemed a bit dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult! Even if it’s dangerous again, I want to." Robsky is about to seize the opportunity to show loyalty, and suddenly the chills come from the left and right. He almost frozen him in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two black robes don’t know when they are standing around Rogge. The one on the left was unusually tall. He slowly tore off his black robes, revealing the dark black armor, and the two-handed sword in his hand was no less than the double-edged axe in Rogge's hands. The black robes on the right only protruded from the double sleeves with two sharp bones. The body is still wrapped in the black robes, but the smog of the light brown can not escape from the bone edge, around the front. The blade does not condense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robertsky, you will die if you come back! You will attack the city with the army." Rogge said again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky's face was pale, his hands could not hold, and he could barely hold the sword. He knows that this is a great opportunity for loyalty, but don't say that he is actually very timid, even if he is brave and brave, it is absolutely impossible to bear the natural pressure of the two black robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at the head of the city of Feren. Although the soldiers in the city knew that they were in Jedi, but everyone was Shen Yi, the city’s flag was not chaotic. No one has walked around indiscriminately, welcoming the enemy's army several times in his own right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even with these low-income civilians, you can have a courage!" Rogge felt as he walked toward Faeren. His dull footsteps sounded the last death knell for Ferrin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard that Rogge seemed to have something to say, the Black Warrior Emperor and the Bone Emperor did not say a word, silently followed Rogge to Ferren go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of troops immediately opened up and pressed to Ferren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defenders on the city of Ferren are very confused, why are the enemy forces not ready for siege equipment? Do they have to climb into Ferren by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer was quickly revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the earth tremble, Ferren’s weak wall suddenly split a few big seams! Rogge only went a hundred meters, and a section of the wall of Feren collapsed! When the smoke is in the air, the bricks are all under the sand, and many soldiers who cannot escape are buried underneath!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Warrior Emperor and the Bone Emperor stepped on an invisible ladder, and the higher the line, the more parallel with the Wall of the Wallen, so that the air would be as smooth as it is! The soldiers at the head of the city were shocked for a moment, and the few arrows shot by the stars could not even touch the bodies of the two kings. A commander with considerable combat experience shouted: "The bow hand concentrates! Aim at the concentrated shot on the left, even if he is a sanctuary, we have to shoot him!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, nearly a hundred archers have just been lined up in the city, a low and strange whistling whistling from far and near! A big deep blue ice hockey flew high and flew to the city! It doesn't fly very fast, but with a high spin, there are countless blue ice needles flying around. The size of the ice hockey is shrinking rapidly, and when it flies to the city, it suddenly blasts, pouring countless ice needles into the archers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ice needle rain, if the big city head, only a few soldiers can stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor of the Bone and the Black Warrior have already entered the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the city, Rogge has already walked to the front of the city. He looked at the gates of the thick iron-clad foreskin, and suddenly screamed, and the whole body flashed silver, and the double-edged giant axe smashed on the gate! The giant axe could not withstand this force, and the axe handle had been severely distorted, but a large crack had been opened on the gate. Rog smiled coldly, shouting again, picking up the huge axe that had been deformed, and chopping it down on the crack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a loud bang, the gates of Ferren were actually cut off by Rogge! He stepped into the gate and looked up at the city. The city's head was full of blood and rain and residual limbs. The black warrior emperor and the bone emperor had turned into two black air, hovering, harvesting the unyielding soldiers' lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prelude to the massacre has been opened, and courage is useless in the face of these deaths dedicated to harvesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the city, the tidal corps warriors waiting in a row, with a burst of rhythm of 'Huo Huo' cheering, reloading the regiment began to slow down Advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Rogge was standing on the terrace of a gorgeous private house in Feren, silently looking up at the sky and clouds, the dreamy floating sky. city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know where the flying city came from, but he knew that *** was in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge can no longer sneak into the floating city. He clearly felt that the entire castle was enveloped in a layer of magical barriers that he could not understand. Even if Rogge had a way to climb the city of floating, he was not sure to sneak into the castle without disturbing anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, Rogge sighs, what is the use of it, how should he face the ***? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, and the city of Feren is finally quiet. There are not many people in the city, so the work of cleaning up the body is not too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger sat in a room without a burning lamp, holding his lower jaw with his hands, and quietly watching a group of floating green light in front of him. This group of green light flashed for a while, it seems that the subsequent weakness, and gradually dimmed. Rogge relaxed his mental strength a little, and released the goddess of the natural goddess a little, so the room was lit up with a few green eyes, these are the seeds planted by the goddess divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the connection between the seed and the goddess of nature is cut off again, the greenery that jumps inevitably dims. In this way, Rogge repeats such steps over and over again, concentrating on the process of the rise and fall of the natural goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is already present, even if it is derived from the divine power of God, it is not completely uncontrollable. For example, at the time of the Imperial Palace, the goddess of the natural goddess will never be made. Of course, this may also be because the wrath of the natural goddess has not yet grown. And when there is a strong presence around him, such as Macbeth, the activity of the goddess of nature will be relatively quiet. In particular, Macbeth, a high-ranking angel who served in front of the order of the gods of order, could not clear the power of the goddess of nature, but when it comes to suppressing and preventing the power of the heresy, the full-time dealing with the heresy of Macao can be a solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around O'Reilly, the natural goddess's divine activity is even weaker. So that the fat man can even release the power of the little bit to study. In the study that is being carried out all the time, Rogge has faintly felt that he is already touching the pulse of another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge glimpsed, and the figure flashed a few flashes, and it appeared in front of Froya’s door. He gently pushed open the door, now Fu Luoya is covering her head with thick brocade. From the shoulder that can't live, she cried very sadly, but she didn't want people to know, so desperately Suppressed the sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just wanted to soothe her, and suddenly Froya feels different today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that she is a little weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately gathered his mental strength and swept it over Fu Luoya, and finally she was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s magic turned out to be two levels by air and turned into twelve! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked. He sat on the edge of the bed and gently took Fu Luoya into his arms and whispered, "What is the life of Fu Luoya? How can your magic suddenly drop so much?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria turned back to see Rogge, slammed into his arms and burst into tears! This cry is simply unstoppable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge patted Froya’s back gently, while comforting her, wondering what might be causing her magic to suddenly drop Two levels. Rogge whispered, "Froya, who are you permanently blessing magic effects?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is in his arms, sad Sigh a little, gently shaking his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rong’s voice is a cold road, someone used a spirit to grab you? ! who is it! tell me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stood up and his face was already frosty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit is Death is a very vicious spell in magic, which can extract all or part of the magic of the victim for the caster. When the magic is exhausted, the caster does not increase the magic level. However, the target is often extracted. This will permanently lose the magic. This magic is a magic weapon for the undead to perform magical battles with other magicians, but the difficulty of the eighth-order casting is also commensurate with its power. Rogge has already thought of this around. Who is the undead mage who can give the spirit, but who else besides Elgra?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a few corners of his eyes and sits slowly Around Froya, she took her into her arms and whispered: "I know who did it. Froya, a little forbearance, now we have no way to turn them face. But don't worry, I won't take long to break the lich into bones, get it back for you, let you burn it to ash! ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoya raised her head, and the beautiful green eyes looked at Rogge. She seemed to hesitate, but still shook her head heavily, you could not I have been fighting the Lich! Anyway, I have no use for you. Even if the magic is taken away, it doesn't matter. I can make potions. It doesn't need to be so deep that the magic doesn't understand, but in short, you can't die. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger took Froja’s arm tightly and smiled slightly: "Who said that I am going to die? Magic is not the decision." The only factor. Although I definitely have to pay a price, I must have a way to break it into bones!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s green eyes pass A line of accidents, there is a hint of joy. She suddenly smiled: "What!! Dead fat, you guessed wrong, this thing has nothing to do with the lich! My magic is lower because your goddess has stolen my lost paradise." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?" Rogge was shocked. Froya was able to blend with artifacts and still let him sigh the magic of the magic world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s completely ridiculous that the paradise that has been completely integrated with the soul can still be taken out! Losing the support of the lost paradise of the artifact, Fu Luoya's magic only dropped two levels, it is not bad. After all, she is able to cast sixth-order magic at her age, and it can be called a magical genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly realized that he would feel very familiar when he saw the floating city. Because that is the artifact lost paradise! It’s just that he didn’t think that when the Paradise Lost was hosted by Auchen Reich, it would turn into a floating city like a miracle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought a little, then smiled: "The paradise can be taken out, but it is a good thing to celebrate! Your magic is far from being able to fully control this. The degree of ghost things, even if you don't use it, it will absorb your vitality all the time. Although you take the keel grass, it can't support it for a few years. Besides, the keel can only be taken once! Why cry? What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
