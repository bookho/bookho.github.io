Rogge suddenly felt a huge twitching pain on his head. The huge mental power was like a pot of boiling water, and he could not stop rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so hard to calm down the mentality of the movement, which slowly opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a dream, a dream that is truly unclear to reality. Rogge didn't know why he had done so many strange dreams during this time. He has a feeling of faintness. These should be more than just a dream of nothingness. They are likely to be the tributaries of real existence. But this is only a guess. The scenes in the dream are all places he has never seen before, so there is no way to know whether it is true or false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dream that just ended, Rogge concluded that this was a war in the Devil. Isn’t the Heaven and the Devils already fighting? Is the world in his dreams a reflection of the war that has taken place in the past, or is it a ongoing war, or is it coming soon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man knows that the little figure on the corpse of the battlefield is powerful! Its fighting style is incredible, and the seemingly clumsy jump can always fall into the sky as an electric angel. This is really incredible. But after personally experiencing its head-on blow, Rogge knew that this strange way of fighting must be real. He didn't understand it because he couldn't understand the way it was composed and used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his eyes completely and sat up from the bed. Effie had already left at this time, but Rogge still had her lingering fragrance on her body. The room is lit with light and soft magic. The window was already dark, and it looked like it was late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog trousers got out of bed and suddenly smelled a mixture of blood and stench that could not be opened. He glimpsed a little, this taste is very familiar, just the taste of the battlefield of the devil. Rogge tried to find the source of this taste, but whether his body or clothes were as clean as ever, there was no stain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned. Going to the mirror, I want to take a closer look at what is wrong with me. Just stood in front of the mirror. He immediately stopped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rogge in the mirror, there is a very fine bloodline under the eyes! Rogge's hand trembled, slowly touching his face, and then putting his fingertips in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a little blood on his fingertips. At this moment, Rogge was a bit embarrassed, and he couldn’t tell which one of the world and the devil was a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the fat man is a crisp and neat person. If you don't understand, then simply throw it aside and say it. There is something big to do in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked out of the room, just in time to meet Androni in the hallway. Apparently she was already mad and going crazy, but she promised that Rogge could not leave the range of 100 meters around him. What does Androni say is also a sanctuary strongman. Since he has promised something, of course he can’t say it. However, in this way, she was bored and died half a day later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, have you seen Adrienne and Miro?" asked Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni shook his head. Pouting: "How can I know where they are going? But, are you sure that these two demons are credible? But that Adelene is not very good, but it feels very comfortable. I For the first time, I didn’t feel aversion to the Mozu.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge froze as he walked to his magic lab: “Annie, Ed How strong is Renee's magic, even I can't detect her bottom. And I never know what she is thinking about. So you better not to provoke her, let alone try to do something for her. You are not her opponent now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni followed Rogge into the magic lab, snorted and sneered: "You test Without the bottom line of her strength, it means that I must not do it? It is arrogant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was furious and his hand was holding the stars. Sen Han said: "Dead fat! Don't think that you are high. You can do whatever you want, in such a small room. It is not easy to use your despicable means!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and said: "Annie, did you still feel stronger than me? How do you sound so guilty now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Her face finally red, this moment is amazing, and let the fat man involuntarily remembered the happy time in the Green Dragon Cave of the day. The fat man ignored the threat of Androni, but looked up and down her, his eyes brighter and brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni just wanted to attack, Rogge suddenly said: "Annie, do you want to improve your strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s in her heart. Of course, she wants to improve her strength. It is because of the gap in strength that the distance between her and the wind and moon will become more and more distant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger stared at her and nodded. "I can see that you want to improve your strength, and I think you should be very clear. Power means to you." Whatever it is. Every time you increase your power, you will be closer to her in the sanctuary. But in fact, we all know that she is moving too fast, and it is almost impossible for us to imagine. The point! So in fact, the two of us are gradually being thrown away by her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sighed softly and said: "Yes. But compared with me, your strength is progressing much faster. That time... um, after that, I can kill you at any time. But in a short time, your strength is like this. I easily surpassed me. I can't even compare you, how can I catch up with her? Right, dead fat, how do you cultivate, how can strength grow so fast?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "In fact, my strength is not strong, now It’s compared with you. It’s not much higher...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s face was cold and angry: “Dead fat, what is it with me? Isn't it much stronger? I am very poor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man laughed and said: "No, no, how can I say that you are poor? In fact, absolutely The improvement of strength is very difficult, but it is much easier to use the power of skill. To put it simply, it is to beat the opponent in the right way at the right time. As for what is correct, only the inner running rules of the entire plane have After you understand it, you can understand. This way. Anne, if you really want to know the rules of the plane running, I can help you. But this is not without cost. If you want, we might as well make a deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What transaction?" She faintly felt a little bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can let you touch the power of powerful gods. As for how much you can understand from it, it depends on your own. Of course, this will not give Your power brings direct improvement. But it will make your strength grow rapidly. When you can see the road ahead, it will be much faster to walk than a person in the dark." Fat laugh It is like a kind fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s heartbeat is getting faster and faster, even if the factors of the wind and the moon are thrown away, the power of further strength for each sanctuary is no Ellenby. Because if there is no fanatical paranoia about power, it is almost impossible for a person to enter the sanctuary. She carefully prevented her emotions from being exposed on her face and guarded the tunnel: "What are the conditions for the transaction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple, in exchange. You want Give birth to a child for me." Rogge slowly said his condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible!" Androni cried. She turned and left, but Rogge did not stop her. Androni was tall and long, and although he was getting slower and slower, he walked to the door in a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally stopped and turned. Anger said: "There are so many people who can give you a baby. Why do you come to me? And does Mary have your child already? Change the conditions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge indulged, said: "Annie, my body is very different from before... so my child will follow changes. I personally estimate that only a powerful woman is now It is possible to leave a child for me. As for Mei, I don’t trust her at all, and I won’t trust her. And the child in her stomach may change whenever and wherever. You don’t really understand the nature of this war. I don’t know what kind of existence has been opposed to the millions of troops on the battlefield. In fact, no matter what kind of power, I can’t guarantee that I can live to the end of this war. I am the same. I hope to leave another child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni finally looked up and met Rogge's gaze and calmly said: "The deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was surprised, she did not expect her to agree It’s so crisp and neat. Androni looked at the smug fat man and said: "Less there is smug. I promise you, for another reason, it is impossible to see you. And my physical condition is clear, too big. When I can't control myself, I will fight back. This problem you solve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and said: "This is simple, first stun you." It’s all right...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat voice didn’t fall, and it’s rushing to shrink, letting Androni’s scabbard sweep. Rogge smiled smugly, leading Androni, who was on the verge of eruption, into his magic lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully passing through several portals, the two finally came to a very spacious hall. There is almost nothing in the hall of the 100-meter radius, and the entire ground is occupied by dense magic symbols. This magical array is huge, complex and obviously costs a lot of money. The entire magical engraving is engraved on the floor, the symbols are cast in fine gold, and the lines connecting the magic symbols are made of magical silver. On the important nodes, there is also a piece of magic crystal with different properties of the top. Androni was born in the giants, and the price of these things is heartfelt. She knows that this is only one hundred pieces of top quality magic crystal, its value is more than one million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array is like being immersed in water, and the surface is swept across the road from time to time. The magical array, whether it is crystal or magic symbol, will be slightly distorted with these flaws. . The magical screams are low, and the sound sounds very sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni knows. There is no water at all above the magic array. The shackles of the road are not because of the light and darkness of the light. It is the distortion of the space. Above the entire magic array, there is a twisted strange space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distorted space is filled with a touch of green light, in the middle of the space, there is a little girl with a whole body of blue. She is naked and her hands are on her knees. Just floating in the air like that. It seems that she is standing up straight. In fact, it is only one meter up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of light blue, the little girl’s hair flutters like a algae. Her body looks like red luo, but if you look closely, you will find that there is a faint and complex pattern on the skin, which makes it impossible to tell whether it is armor, natural armor or natural skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sleeping little girl, Androni didn’t know why, the body trembled uncontrollably. She couldn't help but retreat a few steps until the back leaned against the wall, and it stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...what is this?" She looked pale and her face was already bloody. She held the handle of the blue sky with one hand tightly, while the filigree fingers of the other hand subconsciously grasped the wall behind her, seemingly looking for a dependency. At this time, the little girl with blue eyes seemed to feel Androni's gaze. She suddenly looked up, like the emerald eyes welcoming Androni's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between moments. Androni only felt that there was an invisible force that held her heart tightly. In the face of this power, her fragile heart has long been overwhelmed, struggling to fight, trying to jump a few times to send blood to all corners of her body. However, her heart's beat is a bit weaker than just a few efforts. Her heart was no longer able to struggle, completely stopped beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was pale and pale. She had a fish that accidentally jumped to the shore, trying desperately to try to inhale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are dim quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge only held his palms wide in front of her eyes, cutting off the deadly jade eyes. Then the fish that had fallen on the shore returned to the water. She greedily sighed and sighed, enjoying the joyful heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this short time, Androni has been out of the body, his legs are soft, and he has to rely on the blue sky to support the upright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and stretched his arms. Androni grabbed it immediately. Leaning against his arm. After half a day, she recovered a little bit of strength. Struggling to stand up straight and look at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that you want to experience the power of God. How is it that the natural goddess is not very good at anger?" Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the goddess of nature? How come, she was imprisoned by you? You... can you imprison a god?" Androni could not imagine Infer by yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and said: "Yes, you can say that the goddess of nature has been imprisoned by me. But I am not imprisoned by the whole natural goddess, but only her very small In a very small part, relative to her body, I may have only one of her hair imprisoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Androni still does not Understand that in the four Druids, the power of the sky and the power of the Prophet of the Earth are extremely powerful, far beyond the general sanctuary. Inferred from this, the power of the natural goddess behind them should be even more terrifying, and how could it be imprisoned by this fat man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If God can lower the miracle, then imprisoning a god, even if it is only a small part of the power of God, can be called a miracle!<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge seems to know her doubts, saying: "I have inadvertently found a way to re-grow the goddess of nature that is free. The Magic Array creates an independent plane that cuts off the natural goddess' sense of the power of these gods in my hands. Growth is a feature of the natural goddess, so it doesn't take long, the initial insignificant little power is long It became what you saw."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andronei suddenly understood what he was, staring at Rogge: "Do you say your power..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and shook his head and said: "I don't have the ability to devour the power of the goddess of nature. But the growth of my strength is indeed the power of her. In fact, it is very simple to say. Whenever I have time, it will be as straight as you were. Regarding the eyes of the natural goddess, bearing the baptism of her divine power. If it can survive the blow of the power of the past, if it can't die, the induction of power will naturally improve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You..." Androni really didn't describe it well. After a while, he said, "You are crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "Yes. In order to gain strength, I am already crazy. Come with me. I will let you see something more crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge with Ander Ronnie walked out of the hall and he covered the door with his hands. Then pulled a switch next to the door. There was a slight roar after the gate, and then the magical array in the hall disappeared in Androni’s induction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a long corridor, Rogge took Androni to a small room. The room is small and empty. There is only one elf in the center of the floor. The center of the circle is a little green and green. As soon as I saw this, B. Androni immediately trembled. Subconsciously grabbed Rogge's hand. However, she immediately reacted. This point is very weak. It is exactly the same as the little girl who floated in the imprisoned position, but the degree of power is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s face was unusually red, and he hurriedly let go of Rogge’s hand. She didn't dare to look at the fat man. She just said: "What do you mean by madness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a great gnome who once said that the power of divine power is two-way. At the same time, the gods display the miracles with divine power. They also provide an opportunity for the common customs to touch their bodies. Of course, there are definitely those who are unconcerned in these common customs, such as me." The fat man smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Androni’s incredulous gaze, the fat hands are entwined with silver, and these radiant rays of pure spiritual power contain powerful destructive power. . Then he removed the barrier of the magic array and took a hand. The Bihua, who floated that point, sucked into the middle of his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, are you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, the fat man’s intentions are already obvious, Androni's eyes widened and he still couldn't believe what he was going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spirit of the spirit that has been isolated now has been removed, and the natural goddess must have sensed the existence of this distracting power..." The fat man smiled and gnashed his teeth, which seemed incomparable: “Yes! I just want to let the great and beautiful natural goddess know that I am touching her body!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That point of distraction is very weak. But it is extremely tenacious. In the hands of Rogge, he refused to dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room is getting dignified. There is an invisible pressure that has shrouded in silence. Androni only felt creepy, and she had no wind and no wind, and slowly floated up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sees sweat on his forehead, and he has no idea that destroying this seemingly insignificant divine power will be so wasteful. At this time, the time dragged on for a little longer, and in the midst of it, the breath of the natural goddess began to increase rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man provokes the natural goddess to move, although he is crazy, but he definitely does not want to introduce the natural goddess of the avatar in the space crack. The fat man still doesn't know whether the goddess of nature has taken back the detachment that drifted away with the celestial celestial flow. However, from the point of view that she can isolate her sense of free power, this opportunity should be small. As long as the avatar can't be recovered, the goddess and divine power of the natural goddess will be hit hard, and the possibility of sending another avatar is much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a small chance may also occur. At this time, Rogge does not want to take risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly screamed, the power of rapid increase caused a fierce storm in the room, and the silver light on his hands instantly took the room. Everything color! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a group of green flames blasted between Rog's hands, and the free natural goddess of divine power turned into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the daytime, Androni seems to hear an angry scream in the void, but the sound of the drink just started, with the green in the hands of Rogge The flames disappeared together. But the endless majesty and supreme power that the screaming represents is still lingering in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are crazy, I have never seen anyone dare to provoke a god like this." Androni stared at Rogge. Called involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt that the front of Rogge had completely become a stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger rubbed his forehead and smiled back and said: "You are not as crazy? With your physical characteristics, in order to improve strength, actually Willing to give me a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't like it, I promise you, there are other reasons!" When it comes to this question, Ander Ronnie couldn't help but gnash her teeth, and as soon as she thought about what the child had to do, her face began to become pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head and tried to drive these ideas out of my heart, and asked: "Why are you so afraid of the natural goddess, she is not afraid that she will drop the punishment, or Send a servant to punish you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just respect her, will she let me go? Speaking of the servant, now at least There are two big Druids hiding in the dark, even I don't even know their names. If the natural goddess is willing to let them clean up, then it would be better. As for her body, it does not belong to us. The scope of this plane, we need to target only her agent, plus a maximum of one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni thought I know that Rogge also makes sense. She looked at Rogge and said: "Dead fat, you promised to let me touch the field of divine power, wouldn't it be finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: How is it possible? As long as you like, you can bear the baptism of the goddess as I do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." she hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, I will be by your side." The fat man is gentle and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni nodded silently. When she heard this, she suddenly felt a lot of peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ordinary person is angry and will throw his fists, leading up to three or five people in Europe. An angry person can be involved in a wide range of strains and one party. The anger of a king of a country is enough to make a thousand miles of charcoal, and the corpse is everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the wrath of the god? What kind of price is it necessary to make this anger subside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
