			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This winter, the entire Bavarian Principality has become a huge war machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of this machine is Lille City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille has long since ceased to be spotless, and now it is noisy, dirty, and crowded. In the cold wind, there will be a strange smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous fleets transport all the much-needed supplies of war from the Principality and Allies to Lille City, and then hoard, distribute and transport them to Lille City. Go to the front. The warehouses in Lille have long been filled with food, dried meat, fodder and armor. A heavy carriage not only turned snow into snow, but also crushed the road. In addition to the city where the Grand Duke is located, the main roads in other urban areas are full of mud all day long. The crowds of crowded vehicles push and scream each other, and the cries of children are mixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wars are not all romantic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the Lille urbanites first felt this is that all food and alcohol prices are skyrocketing. Rich people can also avoid the skyrocketing prices and maintain their extravagant habits as usual. But in the topic of the banquet, the price of a certain brand of red wine has doubled, and the topic of a certain year's whiskey has been out of stock, and so on, has begun to occupy a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary people really feel the hardships of life. They no longer think about whether they are eating better, but are racking their brains to study how they can fill a family's stomach with limited silver coins. The price of bread has doubled, and cheese has risen by the same price. The bacon with local flavor is already a good price for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harshest side of the war exists outside of Lille. There was a large open space surrounded by cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a temporary morgue where the remains of the soldiers are placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morgue is so large that when more than 300 bodies are placed, they can only occupy one of the small corners. The guards of the morgue are all veterans for many years. But every time they enter the morgue, their face always has the color of fear that can't be concealed. How do outsiders ask, they are not willing to tell what is in the morgue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veterans of the keeper’s morgue knew that the bodies of the morgue were only the first. The war has just begun, and there will be corpses that will continue to be shipped here. When you see the scale of this morgue, you can guess the upper level's estimate of the damage to the war. That would be a chilling figure when you think about it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these veterans are already used to the blood of the battlefield, now it’s winter, stop the corpse The field will not have the stench and blood of the sky, for them, this should be considered a paradise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ones that deeply fear them are the bodies that would not have caused them to react at all!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Under the white cloth, more than one hundred bodies are a pair of coke. And more than 100 bodies are incomplete. It is the complete body of each part can also be seen to be mysteriously torn into more than ten pieces, which are completely combined later, and even the hands and feet of some bodies are obviously not the current owner!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, normal corpses are really pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veterans’ eyes subconsciously shun these bodies, and even in their hearts are reluctant to think of them, just because of the horror of the makers of these bodies!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the name of two taboos, the great Magister Jerome and the Great Warlock Lhasa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the great magician is incredible is the nightmare of all soldiers. In the face of the horrific magic that comes from the sky, even the veterans who have fought in battles seem so small and helpless. They are completely unable to withstand the power of the magician's magic, and they can't escape the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All they can do is wait for the coming of death and pray not to die too much. Being able to keep a complete body is a luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war between the seven-nation coalition and the Rhine League in the Bavarian Principality finally started a month ago. In an impassioned speech, the Bavarian Grand Duke accused Louis IX of tempting the wicked banshee, Elise, to seduce Orphey Roque and completely degenerate him into a demon! Whether as a devout supreme god Believers, still a sad father, Dagong can no longer tolerate the blasphemy of Louis IX!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is tantamount to an alliance statement with the Bavarian Principality!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time in the history of the Church of Light to formally intervene in the war between the world. The major powers that got this information immediately began to assess the situation after the Bavarian Principality annexed the Rhine Union. In this war, no one will be optimistic about the prospects of the Rhine League. Even if the three empires confront the bright church, the outcome is hard to predict. What about the Rheinland League is only a second-rate power? After the split of the Bavarian Principality, it can only be regarded as a third-rate power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the war, all the nobles of the Principality were excited, and they seized all possible occasions to attack the dark devil’s allies, Louis IX. The ridicule and the irony of the things, and then in the eyes of the aristocratic girl's worship, and the numerous declarations of victory against the infidels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of aristocratic children have put on the most magnificent armor, and through various relationships, they are required to participate in the army of the infidels. But what disappoints these passionate young people is that regardless of the relationship, they will be vetoed in the Grand Duke. It is rumored that in the early days of the war, apart from the existing army, the Principality will no longer recruit any nobles into the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rumor is like a Mars, quickly igniting the anger of all aristocratic young people who are interested in getting a ticket on the battlefield! They flocked in front of the Grand Residence and demanded a reasonable explanation of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield was originally a stage for aristocratic youth, and this kind of win-win war is an opportunity that every nobleman will strive for. How can these events bring them to the side? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Catherine who calmed the bloody aristocratic youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first beauty of the king appeared at the gate of the Grand Duke, the crowd immediately became silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her elegant face is so perfect, and the noble temperament that is inadvertently revealed is not the ultimate dream of one of the most elegant aristocrats. Every tiny piece of jewelry on her body, either fashion or quaint, can be a model for aristocratic clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled a little before the burning flames of countless aristocratic youths, and her mellow voice once again made these young people crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Sirs, you are the youngest elite of the Principality of Bavaria, the cornerstone of the Principality, and the only hope of the upper class! This time you are not allowed to rush On the front line, it is actually a painstaking work of Dagong. As everyone knows, there are waiting for the team at the front, not only a strong enemy team, but also a mysterious big magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocratic youths are swaying, they are screaming, to use their blood and meat to lay a road to the big magician! There must be one among them, with his sword inserted into the heart of the Magister, and dedicated to Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled, his hands pressed slightly, slightly calming the blood of the youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never doubted your loyalty and courage! But you are the aristocrat, the duchy, the grand prince's hope! You, the youngest elite of the Principality We can't have unnecessary damage. Even if the Principality has a setback for the time being, as long as the fire is left, one day our anger will burn the land of the infidels! So, respectable gentlemen, don't swear by sacrifice! Your wisdom and swordsmanship, the war is still far from the end, I promise, you will have enough opportunities to use your sword to win your glory in the flames of war!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocratic youths are excited! They screamed and held the sword in their hands again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to wait until they calm down, Catherine said softly: "But, respectable gentlemen, I have a small request! I ask you, in good condition." The land is coming back from the battlefield; I hope to have such glory and accept the spoils that you brought back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grassland of the aristocratic youth, by this one Mars is completely ignited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they still can't get on the battlefield, their vanity and self-esteem are greatly satisfied. There is also a place where the most precious loyalty of the nobles and nobles has gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognized king is the first beauty, noble, elegant and perfect incarnation, Catherine Roscherio, on this day became the object of countless aristocratic youth vows allegiance . The ancient knighthood once again rose in the Principality of Bavaria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition led by Marshal Rosio was frustrated against the Mullen Fortress in the Rhine League. In a tentative attack, Lhasa and Jero's wide range of magic easily sent back the more than 200 soldiers in the forefront to the arms of the Most High God. Marshal Rocherio, who is heavy, is no longer willing to attack easily. He just traps the Mullen fortress outside the magic range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalemate of the battle quickly made the nobles of Lille City lose their original interest and enthusiasm. The civilians have gradually become accustomed to life in wartime, and they have been able to fall asleep as usual in the roar of carriages and soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day was bright, in the Grand Duchy, Catherine stood up from the large writing desk and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, looking at the direction of the Rhine League. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door opened, two beautiful maids walked in lightly, they held a thick file and placed it in one hand On the left side of the table is a pile of files. A maid picked up the documents that had been reviewed on the right hand side and quietly quit the room. The other maid took a snow fox and draped over Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Catherine, you must take care of your body! Most people don’t get up now, you have been working for two hours! It’s not a good thing for your little baby!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s face is always a noble, elegant and perfect smile, and there is no point of tiredness at all. She reached out and squeezed the face of a maid, and this very frivolous movement became very noble in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you afraid of? This child has the blessing of the Pope himself. It is destined to be an ordinary person! You have been with me for so long, don't you know me?" How can work make me tired? Without it, life is really boring! You see, in this direction, there are thousands of miles of mountains and rivers, there are countless people. Their destiny will soon be mastered. In my hands. If I am happy, their life will be full; if I am angry, they will endure hunger and fear! What a wonderful feeling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s eyes are rarely revealing fanaticism, and at this moment, the restraint has been completely left behind by her. Her hands subconsciously grasped the sleek and smooth shoulders of the maid, and the pointed nails fell deeply into the flesh. However, her gaze has already been cast into the distance, and her eyes crossed the Rhine Union, and there is no end at all...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid listened to Catherine’s thoughts, instinctive Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine showed her the same, chuckled and said softly: "You are afraid to hear too much, are you? You are very embarrassed, never I haven’t said a word in a mess, and I’m not so timid, so I won’t be the same as a few of them. How can I be willing to lose such a small thing that you can’t find? A good maid is harder to find than a brave knight. And, you are really good to me, how can I not know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, someone knocked on the door, a maid reported: " Mrs. Catherine, the Marquis of Tamariton is waiting for your call."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Tamariton has been an assistant to the military of the Bavarian Grand Duke for over twenty years. Now he is over half a year old, short stature, and there are not a few heads on his head, shining brightly. It looks like a rough old aristocrat. But Catherine put on a perfect expression of restraint and respect. This respect is not a false sense of truth, but a true self-respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamariton handed a few pages of thin paper to Mrs. Catherine, Catherine, and I checked all the information about Orpheq and will The parts that may be of interest are taken out. Look, if there is something dissatisfied, I will prepare a more detailed item for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine brows slightly wrinkled, flew through the pages and looked up: "Tamariton, I am very satisfied with your work." In fact, I can't find a better report. You have told me everything I want to know. By the way, you said in this report that the two round table knights left the city of Lille with the rest of the Golden Lion Knights? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The two round table knights went to St. James's Cathedral yesterday and should have seen the Pope. When they came out, they summoned the 82 golden lion knights who were still alive and left Lille. You know, after the death of Orpheq, they announced their withdrawal from the team's sequence and got the consent of the Grand Duke. They left this time and it seems that they also got the acquiescence of the pope, so I did not stop them. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's going north, going straight to the Central Mountain Range. Mrs. Catherine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine sinking, slender and slender fingers slammed with rhythm desktop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her finger suddenly broke, and Tamariton’s heart immediately tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The words of the Pope... Don’t worry. You immediately mobilize a thousand elite knights, be sure to intercept them in front of the Central Mountain Range, all kill, one also Don't let go into the Central Mountain Range, then take their heads and return to me." Even with such an order, Catherine's voice is still gentle and gentle, but Tamariton always feels incomprehensible. chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She once again scanned the report in her hand and said softly: "This person named Rogge looks very interesting. Ophrod and the church attach great importance to it." He, there will be no reason. I want all the information about him, the better the better. Also, you can arrange for me, I want to meet Kate in the afternoon. Is Franco currently in Syracuse? I want to inform him, I hope that I can see him here at this time of the day after tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Tamariton has a small book, one by one Catherine’s instructions, retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid outside the door said softly: "Mrs. Catherine, Fiore, asks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Catherine’s sharp face like a knife has finally raised: “Please come in!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open, a figure whirlwind In front of Catherine, his voice was low and sweet, revealing surprises and pride that could not be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine! The goddess of my dream! Since the day I saw you, my love for you has never changed! You can feel me. The flame in my heart! It is this flame that made me a miraculous breakthrough in three months! You see, I am already a Templar! In just three months, I have upgraded a whole Level of vindictiveness! This is completely the power of love! Do you believe in my love for you now??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to the situation, suddenly clinging to Catherine, Kissed her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s lips are soft and smooth, she has no resistance, letting Fiore’s hot tongue sneak into her mouth. But the chill of her tongue on her lips quickly cooled Fiore's boiling blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiere made some disappointment and let go of Catherine. He wanted to say something, but he didn’t know what to say. Under Catherine’s cold eyes, this Young people who are geniuses in martial arts have involuntarily lowered their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore is very tall, with a fascinating charm on his handsome face, a brown-black long bundle of black ribbons Rear. He is one of the Pope's escorts and has recently been qualified as a Templar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Fiore, I know what the title of the Templar means, and know that you can have a 16th-level temper at your age. A miracle. But if you want to restrain me like a woman who doesn't know martial arts, I don't need any vindictiveness, just relying on your arm strength is enough! You are the right hand of Pope's majesty, I have forgotten what I just said. Now, if If you are not prepared to take further action, can I ask you to go out?" Catherine's voice was as cold as frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore was completely overwhelmed, his pale lips shaking and suddenly squatting in front of Catherine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My goddess! Please don't be so cruel to me! I dare not ask you to understand my rudeness, just ask you to give me one for you. Opportunity! Please give me this opportunity, I will prove my love for you! Certainly! You can't find a knight who is more loyal than me! Anyway, please don't shut your heart forever. "Oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was a little hesitant, Fiore had a turn to see things, and immediately sweared to swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Catherine sighs when I have a hard time and will ask for your help. Is this okay? "{< /> /> </ br> ;The voice of the maid was also trembling with fear: "Mrs. Catherine, Kate is waiting for your call!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate stepping into the room and half a year ago A big difference. There were a lot of mulberry in his face, and he was arbitrarily scattered, obviously without any modification. A number of criss-crossed scars added a lot of murderousness to his original handsome face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird thing is that one after another bloody suffocating from Kate's old scratched armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate stood far away from the other side of the room, calmly said: "Mrs. Catherine, I really apologize, I kill too many people, this strange I can't control myself because of bloody suffocation. I hope that you won't be too unhappy. Can you summon me as a idler, what do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine brow wrinkles , stood up and walked to Kate. Every step of the way, blood stasis is a point. When she walked to Kate's front step, the bloody suffocation was as thick as it was, thick, cold, and slippery, making Catherine uncomfortable. But her face was only white, and she restored her perfect smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate’s eyes flashed in surprise and then changed to respect. He was a tribute, Catherine could see that this time is the real respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long have you been idle in Lille?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the old lion heart knight After the dissolution of the regiment and the Golden Lion Knights, they have been idle and led to dryness. In front of this one-sided war, the above people will not let us go to grab the merits." Kate is very straightforward, in the cruel lion tooth camp After a long time, he has been reluctant to pay more attention to the idea of ​​any privilege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine walked behind Kate and gently stroked the scratches on his armor and suddenly asked, "Do you think this war is one-sided? I You need to know your true opinion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate sighed and thought about it before he replied: "Although the Rhine League has two great magisters to help out, but Still can't resist our offense, the glue in front is only temporary. But after the fall of the Rhine League, the real enemy will appear. At that time, the real war will begin. As for who is our enemy, the result of the war What is it, my status is low, I can't see it so far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that these are geniuses. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine turned to Kate again, she stood so close, Kate felt the breath of her exhaling.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her hand and gently stroked the scar on Kate’s face. The ice-like finger was like mercury, flowing on his cheek. Kate’s heart suddenly became hot.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is so bloody, no woman dares to approach him, Kate is happy to be immersed in the world of vindictiveness and military strategy. On the cruel battlefield, These assaults are at the forefront of the Cavaliers, the strength is a strong point, the chance of coming back alive is a little bigger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate’s heartbeat has increased, so Near the distance, Catherine's beauty has an extraordinary power. Not to mention, she is the first woman to completely regard his bloody suffocation as nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate immediately thought of the Grand Duke of Bavaria and excluded all distractions from his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine felt as if he felt his inner change, took back his hand and asked: "How many knights are there in the Lions Camp? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate has some accidents. In the past, the lion tooth battalion was not a junk or a monster. The glory of the knight is not named for them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still one hundred and fourteen people, madam. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! From now on, all the crimes of the Lion Knights are forgiven. They will be your personal guards in the future. And you, from today, are the Baron Kate and Colonel Kate. There will be a thousand new Lionheart knights obeying your command. These appointments will be issued this afternoon, and you will be out tomorrow, to report to Marshal Rosherio and listen to his assignment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate thought about it and asked, "Mrs, do you have any special requirements?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
