			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony in St. James's Cathedral is finally over. The harvest was far beyond Rogge's expectations, and they did not even devote all of their surpluses to the ‘God of War.’ The ability to form a new Guardian Knights means that Rogge will master two Cavaliers from then on. Bishop Gonard Hart personally presided over the sub-division, which will enable Rogge to equip at least one thousand cavalry without any objection! The only limitation is how much money Rogge has and how many cavalry he can equip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a good thing, of course, it is necessary to have a celebration party at night. Bishop Hart is indispensable. As for the location, it is still ‘Helen’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Rogge and others and Hart’s bishop had just had a time of euphoria at the top of Helen. Bishop Hart sat in the middle, and Rogge, Kate and others sat on both sides. The dishes were still fresh and live. A main course turned out to be the dragon brain of the young two-legged dragon! The pale yellow whole dragon brain is immersed in the deep yellow juice, which is very attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that the young Wyvern can be domesticated, refining it as a summoned beast, or used for military purposes, so the price is extremely high. The bipedal dragon is of poor quality. Although many parts of the body can be used as magical materials, there are not many places to enter. Although this dragon brain is delicious, it is not a peerless dish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the words of Jinge: "This thing is good, it’s not good, then it’s not good, it’s been my glutinous juice. A dip, the taste is not much worse. The key is that there are few things, you can't eat anywhere else. There are more delicious things, but you can buy them with money, it is not a good thing. If you can't eat it, you can eat it. This is status. This is the gap! My 'Helen' is not a delicious, but a gap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If it is not for Steinich's special care, Rogge wants to eat this dragon brain, it is not the door. At the beginning, he listened to Jing Ge’s words, and he was deeply impressed. He admired the five-body cast of the hammer of the gods. How to prosper in the future, naturally, there are more experiences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate poured a glass of wine for Bishop Hart and took the opportunity to ask: "Bishop, tell the truth, Selesburg is really a block. How can you think of that place in the barren hills? Isn't this self-deprecating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart put a large spoon of dragon brain in his mouth, After sighing for a long time with my small eyes, I sighed with satisfaction and smiled and said, "I thought I would have been safe in this life, but when I saw you, the old man suddenly had some energy and wanted to You young people are going to marry the world. The place in Reyesbourg is poor, but the location is important, close to the Principality of Ron. The war between the Rhine League and the Principality of Ron is inevitable. When the war is over, the Bavarian Principality is naturally It is necessary to take the lead in sending troops. The place where the brigade arrives will be the place where the bright church arrives. Can the credit of the parish enlargement fall into Griffin or Taylor?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, and Rogge quickly poured a glass of wine over it, and Hart drank This is what follows: "I will ask you, the current tide in the city of Lille, the Grand Duke, the Bourbon dynasty, the church and even the two empire of Austro-Hungarian and Dero are all intervening. Everyone knows this situation. Who are you to analyze the current situation for me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pondered for a moment and replied: “The bishop’s adult, the forces in front of him are too chaotic. We are still young and have no knowledge. It is really impossible to see the situation! Bishop, you can give us some advice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot Bishop laughed a few times I really don’t want you to say that I can’t see the situation. This is like a big whirlpool. Except for those who really drink water, the rest may drown in the whirlpool. The old man thinks that he is not the one who has this ability, so of course he has to avoid this vortex far away! There is a very intelligent proverb in Dongfangda 6. How do you say it? By the way, the wise man is not standing on the edge of the collapsed house! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s current sorrow and sorrow to Bishop Hart’s sorrow is really admirable. Immediately flattering: “My Lord, the bishop is really erudite!” The villain has read a few books from the Eastern 6th, but he is very embarrassed. He always thought that this sentence is a wise man who is not standing on the edge of the wall. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Hart said that I have nothing to do, but the size is a bishop, Griffin and Taylor often see me not pleasing to the eye. This time I took the initiative Far away, let them clear their eyes, you can fight for your life and death! Although the water can only fish, but this water is all sharks, the hand should not stretch too long. Wait for these sharks to fight Tired, naturally, dead fish will turn up, we just have a cheap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the banquet was quickly dispersed, Hart asked again: "This time, Burke’s adult specially allocated 50,000 gold coins as the construction cost of the Salles sub-district. I roughly calculated that it would take two thousand gold coins to build a small church. The rest I will For you, to form the Knights. But Burke is very valued by your Knights. What are your thoughts and talk about!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated that less than 300 cavalrymen were training in the small towns in Saleres, and it is estimated that they will be qualified in two months. There is money allocated by Burke adults, and equipment is not a problem. Just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some problems with the origin of these people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the origins? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...does not dare to marry you, these people used to be thieves!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Where did these people used to survive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rhein The southern part of the Confederacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to say, not within the parish, have not robbed believers, and have not had contact with other believers?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly, the bishop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then the problem is not big. I have heard from you. Say, you have accepted 300 believers in the territory who are devout believers? That's them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge, but soon returned to God Come back, replied: "It's them! Bishops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did these people do before, where did they come from?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They were persecuted by the infidels, so they wandered around in all directions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, you How are you going to treat them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He They are willing to sacrifice their lives for the pagans, and the villains are ready to call them into the Guardian Holy Knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that their beliefs are not so firm. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bishops are relieved that within a week they will become the most devout believers of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Within a week?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Within a week!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hart went far, and several aristocratic youths took the carriage and returned to the 'Knight of the God of War' to prepare for the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco said: "These thieves will not know more than one hundred words together. How can we let them understand the light within a week?" To teach those brick-and-wooden scriptures? If the Burke adults come to Selesburg, what can we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "Whoever said that devout believers must be familiar with the teachings? We just have to pass a message to the side of the Sallesburg, let the thieves regardless of any situation, no matter what the problem, just read the The article will do: God is always right. When God is wrong, please refer to the previous one; God refers to the East, I am to the east, God refers to the West, I am going west. God wants me to die, Laozi will immediately ignite!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last one is a bit of a problem. Those thieves will be stupid enough to commit suicide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Franco, you drink too much today. Which god will be stupid enough to let them commit suicide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the Doyle?" < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He prides himself on making thieves a believer and should be right in his arms!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Qi Wei is also there, in case she is upset?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! Give her money and let her go to Lille City to buy a moon, Is it OK to leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge immediately replied: "That is of course! God wants to be omnipotent and omnipotent. Just because you are darker than the Mozu, can you practice sacred vindictiveness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sits on the carriage and feels comfortable. The thieves have changed and become guardian knights, which is a bit strange. However, this necromancer can be the guardian of the knight, what is wrong with the thief? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by the water, Princess Froya finally came to Lille after a month of trekking. This time, Princess Froya came to the Principality of Bavaria in the name of the patrol. However, the nobles were very clear about the true purpose of Princess Froya’s patrol. Only the relationship between the Principality and the Alliance’s royal family is subtle. If the marriage is not successful, this will be an unprecedented shame in the Bourbon dynasty. Even if the Conquest of the Bavarian Principality is immediately conquered, the Bourbon dynasty will always bear this shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escort princess came with a thousand royal guards, the rookie of Rocherio, the disciple of the starry sword Saint-Pross The sergeant is governed by the rate. After Andrei became a teacher, only one month after his appearance in Rhineland, he was hailed as the first beautiful man of the Bourbon dynasty, known as the "brightest star of the Rhine." This time, the escort princess went to the city of Lille, and the strength of the limelight was even overwhelmed by Princess Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guards Knights have a total of 5,000 people. Since the establishment of the Rhine League, they have served as the royal escorts. They have always been the most well-equipped and powerful knights in the league. group. In the years when the Rheinland Armed Forces were lax, their fighting power was in no way inferior to the Knights of the Knights of Bavaria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess car drove into the city on the day, the Guards Knights four people in a row, rifle high up, neatly stepped into the city of Lille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria sits on a carriage decorated with royal coats of arms, and the curtains are already rolled up. Every one of her looks is extremely elegant, and even the most strict court ceremonial masters can't pick up a little problem. Orphee Rocco is accompanied by the car, and the hands are thrown into the room. This man and a woman are accompanied by each other. The man is the hero of the world, the woman is the world, and the crowd of people on the crowd pushes me to squeeze. I want to see more clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more cheers were given to Andre. This 'Let's brightest star' body full of silver armor blue robe, behind the Fu Luoya car, the beautiful face, led to the screams of countless girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the attic of a four-story building on the street, Rogge is standing by the window and admiring the magnificent princess car. Princess Froya on the carriage seemed to be weak, but if the cheering people knew it was ten days ago, she had just had a big fight in Lille, and she didn’t know what to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sneaking into Lille, Froya and Andre apparently did not care much, and did not spend any thoughts to keep secret. Rogge glanced at the big and small aristocrats behind the carriage, thinking: "There are many people in these people who know that Froya and Andre have come to have a fight yet? But now everyone But the tacit pretending to welcome the princess with no knowledge, the human psychology is really strange. The nobles are the monsters in the monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head. Suddenly a gaze fell on him, and Rogge’s instincts were extremely sensitive. He immediately looked back at the sights, just in time for Froya’s deep bottomless eyes. Rogge was shocked, and Froya smiled slightly and regained his gaze. She slightly inclined to Orfey Roque, talking to him in a low voice, and occasionally smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre responded to the cheers of the crowd with the most standard etiquette, but occasionally there were some killings in Orpheq’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short gaze of Fu Luoya has made Rogkin sweaty, he fell into his chair, gasping and whispering What is it. At this moment, he was deeply impressed by the deep meaning of the words of Bishop Hart. In the whirlpool of Lille, between Froya, David, Andrei, and Orfey Roque, it is like a small fish playing with a group of sharks. Maybe when you think you are smart and flexible. It will crash into the shark's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, relying on his own care, caution, unscrupulous behavior, and some little luck, he has been in danger of being in the giant shark Shuttle. Although he is now, as it was originally, it is already a much fatter fish. But because of this, in the eyes of the sharks, they have become much more delicious. The sharks are eating for a long time, and the comfort is temporary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of his own weight, Rogge knows that he is still unable to participate in this game, and it is the best policy to get out of this whirlpool. The question is, will Orfirock let himself slip away? However, it took so much effort to get rid of the church's relationship and let Rogge breathe a sigh of relief. Froya’s actions are more unreasonable than their own, and they are lawless. If it really provokes this witch, Rogge does not think she will hesitate to kill herself. This is an intuition of Rogge instinct against natural enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of Princess Froya is a major event in the social affair of the Lille city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of grand court banquets are conventions. The aristocrats, both large and small, smashed their heads, hoping to get an important banquet. After a series of banquets in the Grand Duke, it was a dinner hosted by the great aristocrats for the princess. The sequence of holding the banquet is also a battlefield for the great family to fight for the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these intrigues of the upper class can’t afford Rogge’s interest, and take advantage of the rare opportunity for most of the real powers to be dragged by the banquet. Busy with a mysterious guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a month of travel, the caravan of the Ron Chamber of Commerce in Ron finally returned to Lille City from the Southern League. Elder Benjamin visited Rogge in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When nightfall is complete, the entire city of Lille is immersed in joy and luxury. Rogge returned to his small building with Elder Benjamin. The two entered the courtyard door and left the road without walking, but they walked around in the flowers. It was so easy to get to the door and open the door into the living room. Rogge was holding the elder Benjamin standing at the entrance to the living room. After a minute, he stepped into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin is very interested in the layout of the small building. He has seen a lot of experience in this small building, and the organs are heavy. Although the level of the trap arrangement is not so good, and some even see him as a layman, Benjamin believes that this is not so simple on the surface. Just one minute for the two to stand at the door, let him guess what kind of trap to avoid. He couldn't help but raise the evaluation of Rogge to the next level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Benjamin prepared coffee and refreshments, Rogge said: "Elder Benjamin, you can come to see me, it really makes me feel so honored! How was your harvest in the South?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time the harvest is quite rich. Five cars in the South Seaport, the rest are tea, spices , corals, gems, a complete sea dragon and some rare mineral deposits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sea Dragon?!" Rogge almost jumped up. "Is there really a dragon?" Kind of creature? God, a complete sea dragon! Fiss knows that it will be crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin smiled and looked at Rogge, it looked like a pole An old fox. "It is Sea Dragon, but it is only a yalong. It is only five or six meters long. This time it is bought and prepared as a specimen. It is a private collection. The eyes of the 'Knight of War" should not be so short!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s face turned red and turned to the topic, asking: “Elder Benjamin, the last time you said that we supply our magic silver, fine gold and other rare The mineral deposit..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is easy. Our Chamber of Commerce can supply you with magical silver, blue crystal and glazed gold at a cost price. Even Tofre magic crystal It can also be supplied. The price is at least 30% cheaper than the price of the Rhine League!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Toffre Magic Crystal! This is something that Ron is absolutely forbidden to export. Elder Benjamin, you have such excellent conditions, and the rewards you are asking may not be low!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin is seated securely and looks confident:" Rogge, our Clark Chamber of Commerce in the southwest of the Rhine Union, several small countries and city-states There are very special interests in it. We hope to have exclusive products of the 'God of War' in the current sphere of influence of the Clark Chamber of Commerce. In addition, there is a very good iron ore mine in your territory, as far as I know, Due to the road, this mine has not been able to produce at all. We hope that you can supply us with one thousand tons of steel every year, of course, you can use fine iron ore in the early stage. Finally, we have some special customers, for magic equipment. The requirements are very high, I hope that 'Knight of the God of War' can design and manufacture the corresponding equipment for them. For them, money is not a problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge pupil Shrinking, replied: "I am afraid that the last one is what you really mean? Are there some troublesome characters in these customers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge I am afraid that trouble will never make a lot of money. In the immediate situation, only the strength of strength as soon as possible will not be afraid of trouble. The little man is troubled at all times. Mr. Rogge, in your Principality of Bavaria .! & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp lines and status, we should not have so many concerns to think about it "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Benjamin's eyes brightened, and the old fox keenly sniffed out the hidden mystery of Rogge's words. He squinted and asked: "How many people do you plan to send to protect our caravan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hundred and fifty people." Rogge Smile like a little fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin’s eyes are brighter, but the surface is not moving, but Rogge has already felt his mental fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One old and one less sit down and talk, not bargaining. Perhaps it is the same reason for the profiteers, the two people turned out to be more speculative. But once it comes to business, it is a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war money is always a compulsory course for the profiteers. Although the Rhine Union is still alive with Ron Principality, well-informed people have already perceived the tension in the dark. The Ron Principal, known as the 'Mercury Country', is rich in minerals and the weapons industry is very high. The Clark Chamber of Commerce operates several large weapons workshops. In the current situation, the major domestic mercenary groups and the regular army of the Principality are madly purchasing weapons and armor, resulting in rising prices. Even with the price of stainless steel copper soared. Now it is finally the turn of all kinds of raw ore prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, the mines in the city of Sellesberg have been piled up like mountains because of the impassable roads. After Rogge built two smelters in Salles, the situation eased. However, due to various factors, in addition to the self-use of the 'God of War,' the remaining ore and steel were all hoarded and not supplied to any weapons workshop in the Alliance. Now that the Rhine League has not issued any embargo on the Ron Principality, this high-quality inventory is definitely hot in the Principality of Ron, and it is a good time for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin and Rogge slowly lifted their wariness and began to discuss the real illegal business. After a lot of hard bargaining, driven by the common interests of war money, the two finally reached agreement in all aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clarke Chamber of Commerce’s caravans will purchase about 50 cars of grain, timber and other goods in Lille. The new caravan will be escorted by Rogge, who will stop in Selesburg on the way, repacking it into ore and billets and transport it to the Principality of Ron. The slave traders led by Jinge will also secretly sneak into Sellers, where they will join the Clark caravan, become a caravan guard, and enter the Ron Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the action to capture the dwarf, the dwarf slave will be hidden in the Clarke caravan and shipped back to Seiler with the weapons and equipment ordered by Rogge from the Chamber of Commerce. Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf’s secret tribe hides and is not far from a large mine at the Clark Chamber of Commerce. There are only a few sporadic villages in the middle, and there are not many people. For the slaves, it is a very ideal environment. Benjamin also coveted the dwarf slaves, but Rogge firmly refused to give in at this point, and the old fox had nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning that the weapons were used to equip the Knights of the Principality, Benjamin immediately reduced the price by 20% and said that he would leave the most superior weapons. Give Rogge. He also promised to send artisans to assist Rogge in the establishment of a weapons workshop in Sellersburg. Rogge understands that this is the expression of the Clark Chamber of Commerce betting on the Principality of Bavaria. Like this big business association in several countries, the loyalty is only the interests, not a certain country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to come to the Clark Chamber of Commerce, there must be another core person to contact the upper level of the Principality. It is not something that a small role on the edge of its power system can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Rogge traveled between the parties and kept in close contact with Jingo, Benjamin and Orphee. The big bosses like Steinaki and the Grand Duke of Bavaria naturally do not know about these things, and they will be clean if something happens. After all, the dwarf empire is not so irritating. From the control of the region, it is equivalent to one third of the territory of all human countries. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northwestern part of the Great 6 is dominated by mountains and plateaus, scattered with dozens of dwarf empire, and history has been arrested by humans for the capture of dwarf slaves. After nearly a hundred years of war, the powerful dwarf warriors eventually forced the Terran nation to jointly sign a statement announcing that all Terran countries began a total ban on the trade of the dwarf slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, driven by profits, the dwarf slave trade in the dark can never be completely rooted. The ban has greatly reduced the number of dwarf slaves, but it has also increased prices and risky profits. However, this time Rogge planned to attack the tribe of the dwarf tribe. If the wind is revealed, the Bavarian Principal will definitely categorically deny participation in this matter, and may even chase Rogge in turn. If things are done cleanly, Rogge can certainly push it all out. Anyway, similar things are not the first time, and will never be the last. The key is whether the upper echelons of the Principality have resolutely defended his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mysterious temple stands among the distant eastern mountains. Zhou Zhou’s magic enchantment blocks all prying attempts from the outside. The hall is extremely majestic, and the curved vault is 40 meters high and is supported by two rows of bluestone pillars. At the end of the hall is a huge altar of fire. There is a high-backed chair decorated in front of the altar. A man is sitting in this chair. In this hall, he is so small, but at first glance, the momentum seems to flood the entire hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man wrapped in a black cloak is kneeling in front of him, reporting the situation on the Gloria Big 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the chair was a little angry, his low, strange voice sounded through the entire hall. "Enough! I don't want to hear any news about the useless Terran Little Pig! If you and your men are collecting this kind of thing all day, it's better to go to the dragon as a snack!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General adults! But, the villain thought..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! My patience Not as good as your little reptiles doing nothing! Read the information about Elysses again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult! Here is... Three days ago, His Royal Highness Elysses and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was busy, but still took time to go to the 'Night Return' hotel Three times. Only at Liliths, he will feel tired and have real relaxation. Lilith will rejoice every time, let Rogge relax and enjoy with all the ways a woman can think of.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never asked Rogge. When Rogge was very upset, she would listen to his complaints quietly and then accept his stormy conquest. Rogge was always so busy, and every time he was in the sky, he left in a hurry. Lilitho hoped that he could stop and say to her: "Go with me!" "However, every time is disappointing. Liliths knows that Rogge is not willing to face this problem. The nobles are like this. The girl knows that Rogge is very tired and very tired, so she chose to put these words in her heart. I chose to wait, waiting for one day, Rogge could say to her: "Go with me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandpa was killed by the "Wolf Knights", but those people were killed by Rogge, and Lilith would no longer hate anyone. She used the money that Rogge left for her to adopt three orphans, and together with her to maintain the operation of this small hotel. The girl is very talented to cook, and 'night return' is becoming more and more famous among the neighbors. Now, with this small hotel, Lilith has been able to maintain her own livelihood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the 'Wolf Knight' came to make trouble, Liliths always From time to time, there are several big men hanging out at the door, sometimes they are also drinking tea in the hotel. At first she was a little scared, but after the appearance of these big men, the hooligans who often harassed in the past have disappeared.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunrise Sunset, Lilith is happy to run this small hotel. It’s just that at dusk, I can’t see Rogge’s rushing figure, the girl will be a little embarrassed. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some hard work, finally come out This action was called "hunting" by Rogge. Fifty gold lion knights have secretly entered the Clark Caravan camp. Three hundred 'Dragon and Beauty' knights have also replaced the mercenary costumes at Rob. Under the leadership of Ski, he joined the Clark Caravan. This action, just in case, Rogge, Lance, Kate, Franco and Fes were all dispatched. As for the flying dragon that was hiding, it was really looking for a moment. If you can't get him, you can only stop.
