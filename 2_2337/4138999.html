			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth day of the book is destroyed on the fifth day (1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is absolute darkness, darkness There is no light in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat quietly in this windowless, dull room, like a sleep. It is the night of the secret, he is waiting, waiting for the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun jumps out of the horizon, he is about to set off to harvest the last godhead for the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to choose between two windy months, Rogge did not think much. Now, everything is in his grasp, and by that time, the answer will naturally emerge in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat quietly in the dark, his eyes closed. However, the whole picture of the mainland is slowly flowing through his heart, just as he has a magic map in his heart. The four places that the Pope pointed out for him were full of faint brilliance, which represented a sense of divine power in this area. In addition, there are several places on the mainland where the power of glory is emerging. But what Rogge wants is just a godhead that can pull the wind and moon out of purgatory. Today, he is not interested in these residual spiritual powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Nafi’s figure suddenly appeared in the heart of Rogge, it seems that she is walking like a ghost. Rogge's cold and stiff body regained heat, and he slowly spit out a cloud of clouds and opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flash of his eyes is the darkness that devours all the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the door opened and Nafi came in silently. Naifei suddenly found that Rogge was staring at her, and her mouth was slightly open, and she was scared to make a low exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nefie, is there something?" Rogge asked warmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie suddenly shuddered and shrank his neck. Just like the cold wind with the bones in the sentence of Rogge. Indeed, although Rogge's tone is mild, there is no warmth in the interior. She looked at Rogge, her face slowly turning pale and slowly receding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and stood up and extended his hands to Nephie. Nafi said this cheers. The fly flew into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nefie, is there something?" Rogge asked again. This time. There was finally a warmth in his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie smiled sweetly and said: "When the day is bright, are you going to kill again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This time is not just killing." Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie’s green eyes stared at Rogge and said, “Would you bring us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge indulged, said: "I will bring you. And this time, I will bring a lot of people to the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie crisp A smile, said: "Let's take us. In fact, I just ask her!" She earned her from Rogge's arms and walked outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nefie..." Rogge stopped her and smiled. "I am going to the land of the goddess of nature this time, you are also ready to go." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go! Why don't you go? Going there will be a power to take it!" Nephi answered with a crunch, and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dawn of the dawn, the church began to make trouble. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A team of neat, heavily armed Templars and War Mage emerged from different halls and began to assemble in the square in front of the main hall. Almost all formal churches appear in the square. Even members of the church who specialize in military strategy and are not known for their personal strength are no exception. Thousands of preparatory churches are also busy, carrying a heavy box and placing them in the designated location of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the first rays of the sun shone in the square, Rogge’s figure suddenly emerged from the air. He was expressionless, carrying his hand and walking through hundreds of churches. When I first entered the transmission hall. Behind Rogge, Feng Yue and Nai Fei went on the line and followed him into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in the feelings of the church, their mysterious, ruthless lord of the church has no sense of existence, and it is completely dark. And the two beautiful women, Feng Yue and Nai Fei, who grew up in a short time, have shown the terrible power of horror more than once! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the churches carry the equipment box. Followed by Rogge into the transmission hall. Stepped into the transmission magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time more than just the piano, all the sacred luck is good. No one is lost in the space storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small town Nestor is quiet and quaint. It is located in the southern part of the mainland, only a few tens of kilometers away from the endless sea. In this autumn season, the sea breeze blows through the town under the high sky, and it floats for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only 20,000 people in the small town, living leisurely and comfortable, it looks no different from other small cities in the southern part of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such early morning hours, most of the people in the small town should still be asleep. It was only in the small temple in the middle of the town that there was a sudden sound of a sudden bell in the small temple that was not eye-catching. It was the bell of the police! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells spread all over the town in an instant. Almost at the same time, everyone in the town, including the elderly, women and children, looked at the direction of the bell at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leisurely and slow movements of the town residents immediately became agile and simply. They dispersed, and in a twinkling of an eye, they walked out of their houses. Everyone is covered with a fine workmanship, with a variety of strange weapons in his hands, quickly and orderly gathered into the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a dozen old people have entered the small shrine. For a moment, an old man will walk out of the temple to the townspeople who have gathered in the square and are fully armed. They announced loudly that there will be a strong enemy to invade, so that all the townspeople will defend their defenses according to the expected plan and launch magic for the elders to gain time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The townspeople are well-trained, and there are early contingency plans, and there are dozens of leaders who immediately stand out and lead the towns and towns to go. Defensive everywhere. Another hundred townspeople were faintly blurred and gradually merged with the surrounding environment, and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The townspeople did not panic, although the bells represented the highest police. But in the history of the past hundreds of years. A similar siren has sounded more than ten times, but until today, the town still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tornado on the plain outside the town that suddenly rushed into the sky, and there was another thunder! After the thunder, hundreds of churches have appeared out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you look around, the Church has opened the equipment box and taken out countless magic scrolls, magic arrows and other consumables. Arm yourself. They are busy and not chaotic, and everything looks orderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is standing in the air. Staring at the distant town. After a while, he turned his head to Fengyue and Nephie. "You see, this should be the hiding place of the endless ocean. He hid it really well. If it wasn’t a natural goddess here, I am afraid that I and the Pope. I can't find this place either. Well, the Prophet of the Earth, the Fury of the Sky, the Flame Tyrant... Among the four Druids, there is only the endless ocean that has never been met."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Moon and Nephie listen quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the town again. In his eyes, a light-colored light rose in the center of the town, rising higher and straighter into the endless void. Seeing this, Rogge said again: "You don't need to intervene in the battle for a while. When these Druid elders' summoning magic is completed, there will be some natural goddess guards. At that time you kill the guards." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... what about you?" asked the windy month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at her and smiled and said: "I will go to see the goddess of nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Speak. Rogge slowly raised his right hand and pointed to the town! So hundreds of churches were divided into dozens of battle combinations, and they joined the town and killed them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The townspeople on the wall have already set up hard bows, aiming at more than ten churches in the forefront. Although they are all outstanding Druid fighters, I don't know why. At this moment, like a recruit, my heart is full of tension! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the arrow in the city's city is flying, in this pair of shots. It turned out that the sacred churches, which were completely unoccupied, occupied an absolute upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When hundreds of Templars are also entering the magic range. The Druid warriors, who were barely able to support them, began to fall in pieces, and the solid defense line collapsed instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands in the air. Slowly drifting forward. He watched the Templars jump on the wall and watched the Sanctuary in the Church fall into the center of the town, watching the battle gradually become a massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A massacre of 20,000 sacred goddess of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is surprisingly clean, almost no smoke is seen, and few houses collapse. Because Rogge had requested beforehand, all the churches could only kill and not set fire. Therefore, the Templars and the War Mage are killing people cautiously, and any powerful weapon is not afraid to use it, let alone a large-scale killing magic. Fortunately, they are also very good at the fine way of killing, so in addition to the slower speed, the advancement of the church to the town center is smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of these churches, all rebels are enemies, whether they are old people, children, or women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the shrine in the center of the small town suddenly burst into a dazzling green brilliance, and the huge magical atmosphere surged. In this glory, an old Druid slowly ascended into the air and looked at Luo Ge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people who dare to offend the goddess of the land will burn in the wrath of the goddess!" The old Druid’s voice was extremely loud, and even suppressed the battlefield. The cellar kills the sound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge replied indifferently: "Don’t talk nonsense, take the anger of the goddess out and show it to me. The endless ocean, where does he hide? ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat voice is plain and gentle, but it is also clearly spread in every corner of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Druid angered: "The arrogant man..." When he said half of it, he was completely overwhelmed by two long and bright dragons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind swept through a small city that had already been soaked with blood, and then a row of giant waves suddenly appeared in the distant sea. In the wave, two huge sea dragons Jumped out of the sea and roared and rushed to the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trembling! The sorcerer, the guardian of the natural goddess, the unrivalled sea dragon will punish your crimes..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Druid suddenly stunned like a song, and he suddenly saw that the two weak and beautiful girls behind Rogge actually rose to the sky and met each other. A fierce sea dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is still halfway through, the huge death sickle has appeared, and began to spin in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is getting faster and faster, and the body is also beginning to emit a brilliant silver brilliance. In an instant, she has turned into a silver meteor, and the sea dragonfly in the air Hit it together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent collision, but no sound, the people killed on the ground can only see the dazzling silver in the sky flashing away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly, the wind appeared in the air behind the sea dragon, and the Death Scythe in his hand slowly stopped spinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailong paused in the sky, and then made an earth-shattering dragonfly, a huge body suddenly squirted dozens of blood arrows, one planted to the ground . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Nafi has a sweet smile, open his hands and fly to Hailong. It seems that she wants to embrace the sea dragon. The beautiful face of Nephie was reflected in the dragon's eye, and the anger in the dragon's eye quickly faded. When Nephi flew near it, the sea dragon snorted, letting Nafi's hand touched its drooping faucet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefei simply turned over and stood on the top of the sea faucet, commanding this behemoth to fly in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle in the sky made Rogello smile a little helplessly. But the old Druid can hardly believe his own eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
