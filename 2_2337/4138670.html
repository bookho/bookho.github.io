			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is more interested in the relationship between Qi Wei and Doyle. A pair of smiling eyes kept looking at them, capturing every subtle expression between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer is wearing a khaki half-length steel armor, and its defensive power is second only to the whole body warrior armor and paladin A. Each piece is neat and tidy. , sparkling with shine. Under the armor, it is a navy bottom, and the material is made of fine gastrodia. A wide, high-rise neck can be seen in a silk-colored white shirt, which is very irony. Doyle also made a two-handed giant sword. The hand guard was made of mahogany copper. The hemp of the hilt was tangled neatly, and a ruby ​​was placed at the end. Rogge's spirit quietly explored the past, except that this sword was once strengthened by magic, there is no other special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer’s brows are locked, under the double pressure of the Chamber of Commerce and Qi Wei, the hearts of the hands are constantly fighting, the hands wearing leather gloves continue to grab the hilt and then Put it down again. Cheeks are constantly screaming, sometimes gnashing when you bite your teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Dole’s leather gloves, Rogge’s heart suddenly moved, and a drop of oil juice flew out of the dish in front of Doyle, slamming On Doyle's armor. The expression of the mutation is as if you have just eaten a dead mouse. He took two steps back, took out a white handkerchief, carefully wiped the little oil stains, wiped it over and over for a long time, and then left no traces, only to dislike the handkerchief far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you evaluate your smile, the fat smile is definitely the best. If the smile of the girl can light up the world, the smile of the elder can soothe the soul. The smile of the fat man is the understanding, that is, the ordinary, the laugh between the old friends who have not seen for many years. When the fat man smiles, his eyes are awkward and happy. So when the fat man laughs, no one is now shining silver in his eyes, not to mention the silver wire is so small, that is, no eyes, no one will pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei looked at the face of Daoer’s fortitude, only she knew how much sweat and blood Daoer had paid for her status today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old head is impartial and unreasonable, and the requirements for this son of Doyle are much more demanding than others. When Doyle’s merits were enough to be promoted to the three captains, the old head of the team appointed him as the mercenary captain. Only she knew that Daoer would practice swordsmanship in nowhere every night, and in the morning, he would rise up earlier than anyone else to practice vindictiveness. Only she knew that Daoer’s ambition was deeply rooted in her heart and her passion for her career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only she only knows how much Doyle paid for her. Three years ago, when she was chased by the Allied forces, her companions were exhausted, and when she had nowhere to go, Daoer accepted her. In three years, how many times Dow used his sword, his shield, and even his blood. Is your own wing under his arm? On the night of marriage a year ago, Daoer, who was not drunk, was drunk for the first time. After drunk, Daoer cried with Qi Wei and said that he had buried his heart for thirty-five years. . What is more like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Qi Wei has a very good attitude towards Doyle. Doyle, who pursues perfection in everything, also has a shortcoming, clean. At the time of Dao’s marriage proposal, Qi Wei, who had already loved Daoer, did not dare to say the past three years ago. There is always a selfish side in human nature, and Qi Wei, who has experienced too much pain, does not want to give up the happiness that is not easy to get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three years later, the bureaucrats of the Rhine League have long forgotten the wanted small mercenary group. Qi Wei and Doyle returned to the Rhine League. Unexpectedly, I met the magic star Rogge here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Xin sighed, and Daoer’s bloody wrists appeared. When the two men came out of the mission, they met the big team of Warcraft and were forced into the Tashkent Desert. After two days in the absence of water, Qi Wei finally could not support fainting. Doyle carried Qi Wei all the way, biting his wrist from time to time, continuing the life of Qi Wei with blood. One day later, the two men finally met the caravan passing by, and this was saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the time when Qi Wei’s dead heart was resurrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, why! Let me experience so much pain, let my happiness be so short!" Qi Wei is crying in her heart, but her face is Put on a calm expression, took Doyle's hand, softly said: "After Doyle is dripping with ice, the woman's intuition tells her that this is Rogge's gaze.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Haha Smile<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei was very angry in her heart. At this moment, she was not the little girl of that year. It was natural that she was actually trapped under Rogbu, but now she can’t do it. Only she stares at Rogge and gasps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dor’s indulge in a moment, he is not a stupid person. The original police force of the Rhine League was chasing Qi Wei. Of course, he knows that Qi Wei’s origin is not simple. . It was only a long time, and Qi Wei finally revealed to him the bitterness of the past, but only passed the section of humiliation. At this moment, Qi Wei is so excited, this Rogge is naturally one of the murderers of the year. Qi Wei’s performance at the moment is actually not willing to destroy his own future, but he would rather let go of killing his brother and enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge and others were just a few unsuccessful aristocrats, they were able to use the police force to kill Qiwei. At the moment, it has only been three years of hard work. In the eyes, this Rogge has become the captain of the Knights. Look at his smile, this calm effort is admirable, but there is no momentum in the master. I think it must be by conspiracy or filming, and it is not enough. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Doyle’s 20-year mercenary career, with a long-sighted attitude and extraordinary knowledge, immediately thought of the wrong place. Although Rogge only brought ten knights and one...etc., how do people look more and more like thieves? No matter how much, the number of ten knights is absolutely inferior, but there is no fear. The handcuffs are so powerful that under such a close distance, everyone in the room fears that only they can hide. Once the war started, the party must have suffered heavy casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly looked around the subordinates, everyone is arrogant, just waiting for their own orders, they will be attacked. Qi Wei is very beautiful, martial arts is extraordinary, and is very popular among the mercenary groups. The mercenaries are mostly brave and desperate. The mercenaries of the hundred wars are also a large mercenary group. The people in the regiment have long been accustomed to saying the last sentence. At this moment, they saw Qi Wei’s enemies, and they have already been eager to try. There is a person who is confronted by a smashing arrow, and his face is full of fear, but it is strong and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dragon and the beauty knight, there is a lot of excitement in the face, and a few people can’t hold their lips, obviously there are countless bloody bloodthirsty hands. Butcher. Look at the equipment, it is extremely sophisticated, although not magical equipment, but the quality of the fine, is the equipment of his mercenary captain is also not enough. This is clearly the elite of the Ace Knights! The dough flag is compelling, but I can't remember which flag of the flag group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although between a moment and a half, this may not be able to fight, but the dragon and the beauty knights have not slackened. Robsky looked at the look of Doyle and whispered a few words with the knights around him. The knights of the knights all turned, half pointing to the apparently young and inexperienced warfare mercenaries, and the other half pointing to the merchants. The leader of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clarke Chamber of Commerce has changed a lot of elders. Only the old man who is the Tao is still calm. Rogge met and rebuked his hand: "This dispute is a matter of me and the mercenary group. How can I involve the Clark Chamber of Commerce's elders?! Is there any common sense? Let me put the bow down!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several knights immediately said that the bow did not let go, but turned the direction, the five bows were pointed to Qi Wei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clarke Chamber of Commerce old people looked a lot better, they wiped the sweat quietly, and looked at Rogge’s eyes full of gratitude. That is the old man who smiled at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer suddenly sighed and said: "Everyone puts down the weapons!" Although the mercenaries are puzzled, the order is the order, or the sword is lowered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robosky praised: "Knowing the time is a handsome!" followed by a scream, but was raised by Rogge and thrown heavily on the ground. . Robsky knew that he had taken the wrong place and laughed on his face. He carefully reviewed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer reached out and tore off the mark of the mercenary of the hundred wars on his chest, calming down an older man in the mercenary behind him: "From now on, You are the captain of the Seventh Brigade of the Mercenary Mercenary, responsible for safely escorting the Clark Chamber of Commerce VIPs to their destinations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Wei panicked, dying I lived in Dole's arm and cried: "What do you want to do! Do not do stupid things." She paused and glanced at Rogge, and her confident smile made her feel chilly. Er's arm does not let go. "Dawer admits the wrong person. He was not one of those people. I was just a misunderstanding with him! I beg you, let's go, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Dauer smiled lightly and caressed Weiwei's head. "Qi Wei was shocked, numb, unable to move, and looked at Doyle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doyle looked up at Rogge, and he slowly said, calmly said: "The things of the year are not grudges, we all know well. As the captain of the mercenary of the war, I should entrust the guests to the highest interest. But now I am no longer a mercenary, but a husband who loves her wife very much. Life is alive, there must be something, something is wrong. Lord Rogge, I hope you can have a knight's minimum dignity, accept me last The request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer took a deep breath, and the reddish glory shrouded the whole body. Here, I would like to challenge Lord Rogge and all of his subordinates! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other figure is also a step forward. Wei, I would like to challenge Lord Rogge and all of his subordinates!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life and Ho Huan, fear of death, although thousands of people and I am embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently mentioning the battle axe, Rogge smiled and said: "Do you really challenge me and my subordinates?" The subordinates emphasized a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duoer Station is like a mountain stop! But I still have a small request. I hope that no matter whether I win or defeat this battle, Lord Rogge will not bother me these subordinates. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned to look at Qi Wei, she is also a look of perseverance, Rogge sighed an enemy, you are not too demanding. But Qi Wei, you forgot to remind Mr. Doyle, I am a magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel suddenly screamed. The samurai warfare with a magician with a small team of knights is no different from suicide. The hotel owner saw two people fighting in their own store, and they had already turned white, but they did not dare to stop it. At this moment, I heard that one of them was actually a magician. God, a magician, a fireball, everything in this store can be scrapped! His eyes turned and he finally fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer is also pale, but seeing that Rogge is not half-smart, he is wearing the strongest knight to wear the bright silver Full body armor, hand-held long-handed axe, if this is also a magician, then I am afraid that the orc can also be a magician. Qi Wei’s mouth groaned, remembering the past, the sound is bitter: it’s really a magician! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom! Let's go together and kill the rabbits! "The hundred war servants were screaming, and the sword was lifted again, and they stayed up. A very mighty big man squatted with a heavy hammer, stood in front of the front and pointed at Rogge: "You fat pig." I still don't wipe my neck myself. Is it necessary to wait for the grandfather to do it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled, how do everyone today yell at the squad leader of the Allied Knights? It seems that I am arbitrarily killed." No, Robersky! The intention of the Rheinland law is to kill the Confederate officers!? After that, the voice is extremely severe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky was also a high school student at Dro's Academy, and there was a lot of stuff in his stomach. Since the transfer of the Rheinland League into a mountain thief, the job is to study the law of the alliance, who can't move, and what can be done, and the study is clear. Since then, robbery has not been committed, and small mistakes continue. The local policing agencies were unable to encircle the police, and the things they committed were not worthy of the regular army. Therefore, the thief’s career was like a duck, and it was soaring until it met Rogge. It is really a crime of non-war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Rogge’s question, how can this flatterer not come forward to make fun? "Lord Rogge, attacking the Confederate Officer (the adult you are the captain of the Lieutenant Colonel, absolutely an officer) is one of the twelve death sentences of the Alliance Code. The gathering of the intent to attack the Confederate army, the evidence is conclusive, the attacker and the attacking alliance officer The same sin is between five and fifteen years of hard labor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Rogge looked at the big man, "I killed him." Is there nothing wrong with it?" Where the gaze went, the big man was acupunctured and painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, adults. The shopkeepers in this store, the townspeople and alcoholic drinkers, are witnesses, this person is indeed intended to gather people to besiege the alliance officers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawer has already seen it wrong, and said: "All live! You all retreat! Today, which hundred war mercenaries are not allowed to intervene!" In the mouth is hard, "You fat pig, just come over, look at the uncle, I hammered your turtle shell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha laughed and shouted "You are a small mercenary, actually arrogant to such a point. How about the ice and silver fox mercenary group?! Snow fox is not dead in my hands! Today I am not jealous of you, but when I am afraid you can not!" After all, a white halo rose from the foot, and the shouting shrouded the whole body. It was the 'power of the bulls' that had moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daoer was shocked and shouted: "There is no mercy!" The big moxibustion illuminates half of the hotel! He rushed up and saved people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man was afraid in his heart, and he said in his mouth: "Look at me and smash your broken axe!" The hammer looks at the shape of the soul. It’s more than doubled. It’s not a big deal to say that it’s gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hammer and axe intersect, and a slamming sound, 'Bounding the soul' is a light and clever way to cut the hammer head in half, the big man is struck by lightning, and the mouth is squirting blood. . Rogge smiled, his wrists were again, and the ‘Bounding Soul’ drew an arc and once again fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer is rushing at this time, swinging on the sword rack, vindicting to the sword, bright red like a flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black light flashed in the space, the big man was slanted into two sections when he was on the road, and the blood column rose to the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge scythe came out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knives turned around and the shank flashed thunderously to the Daoer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer is so cold and straight, he has never been so close to death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Millennium was over, Doyle screamed and the whole body collapsed. Finally, the handle was held only two inches from the throat. The magic knife of hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bang, a group of purple electric fire blasted on the handle, and Daoer flew out far away, and fell heavily on the ground, small and small The electric light is smashing, and every electric light is moving, and Doyle twitches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***This has come out of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogden is very big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the *** is half a head higher than Rogge. The bones are black and shiny, and the bones behind them are the last time they saw Rogge. It was much bigger. It was nearly one person wide open, and the bone wing was covered with a black film. The huge sickle was lifted in the hand, and there was always a purple electric fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An invisible force field spread from the foot of the ***, and the person affected by the force field immediately mourned, crying: "Devil! Devil !! Even rolling with a belt, only to be able to stay away from the ***. The mercenaries who had been prepared to swarm up were immediately cleared of a 20-meter open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the dragon and the beauty knights are much stronger. Everyone has been with Rogge for a long time, and they have seen ***, although every time I see *** is different, but after all, the heart is prepared, much better. In addition, everyone is also determined and daring, and the resistance to this fear field is very common. Although everyone is ugly at the moment, they are still standing still. However, every time the Cavaliers saw the *** once, the more they believed that Lord Rogge must sell the soul to the devil, and then contacted Rogge on what he had done, which is what he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gods, the devil, as long as you stand on your side, it is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Roberts is basically timid, at this moment, it is even more arrogant, can resist and not cry, it is not bad. There was a dragon and a beautiful knight who saw him too shameful, and he thought about it, and picked him up. The short knife hit the waist, and Robsky just stepped back and cut the knife into the flesh. This is a daring way to practice, and Robersky did not dare to move any more, but it was scared to faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a quiet sigh in the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***On the scene, looking around, but I can’t find an opponent who dares to go forward, and finally aimed at Rogge, the flames in the eye are getting more and more popular. Staring at the fat man and watching it all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was sweating immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is desperately trying to communicate with ***, all kinds of known spells are silent all over again, three please ask, but also make countless ambitions, wine The broiler chicken and duck have long been on the table, and the beauty of the car is more unusual. This is the return of the comet to the outside world, and it is reluctant to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***After leaving, Rogge coughs a bit..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gently A sound is like a thunder in the ears of everyone, and the hotel is suddenly a ghost, a wolf, and a wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
