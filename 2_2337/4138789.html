			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle with Silver Dragon Nicholas not only razed the city's capital to the ground, but even the buildings within 100 meters of the city's main government were not spared. The casualties are not too big. Those who can build houses around the city's main government are some large and expensive families, and the homes of the mansions are not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unintentionally, Rogge and others gave another heavy blow to the upper class of Bora City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the fierce battle, even Charlie could not get close to the battle circle, let alone ordinary soldiers. In the face of a huge storm that almost no humans can compete, Charlie was shocked. Although he did not know what happened in the center of the storm, there is no doubt that there are people in the sanctuary who are fighting in desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how suddenly there will be people in the Sanctuary fighting in the city government? Where did these people come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie is worried about Rogge’s safety, but this is a violent storm of violent energy that is not something he can resist. It was not until the fierce battle stopped and saw that Rogge was safe and innocent, and Charlie was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, Rogge explained in an understatement that several enemies wanted his life last night, but they were repulsed by the guards. Since the reunion, Charlie has known that the mysterious characters around Rogge are endless. Since Rogge didn't want to elaborate, he wouldn't ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is such a big thing in Bora City, thousands of casualties, how to give the public a confession. Rogge had long thought about the rhetoric. He asked Charlie to announce that everything last night was lurking in the city's evil Latvian magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie can’t help but feel a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully watched the scene of the battle. Within a few hundred meters, not only the buildings on the ground were destroyed, but the foundation was almost shaved. Empty! The power of such horror, if it is the evil Latvian magician, then this magician must be a big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil Latvians are too powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie said his concerns, Rogge immediately said nothing. He said to Charlie that the more powerful the Latvians are, the better. In order to defeat the evil and powerful enemies, all means, including the recruitment of troops, are justified and reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Rogge made a fuss about the "secret Latvian magician" who secretly sneaked into it, not only to announce the full takeover of Bora City, but also The city was martial, and the housekeeper went to the house to search for the magician who did not exist. Naturally, this search is bound to be fruitless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the city search has no results, Rogge has begun to encourage the public to secretly sue "suspicious people, etc." The suspicious people who came out in the first few days were mostly exiles in the city of Bora. However, as the whistle-blowing activities expanded, many disputes between the neighbors and the usual enemies began to take the opportunity to enem the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ‘suspicious people who have been exposed are not to be said to be comparable to the magic of the Magister, and even the words are not recognized. Many people have lived in the city of Bora for decades. How can a 'great magician' lurk for so long, just to put a magic in the war decades later, killing the lords of the place? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge doesn’t care about any interrogation records at all, just telling the bureaucrats, all the accused, all must be arrested, and No matter who they are, they will torture and fight for another round. Then the bureaucrats will put the materials listed by the confession in front of him and let him defend himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who have been beaten and beaten by the unprovoked imprisonment. Naturally, they hate the accusers, and those who scream are screaming. More people are fangs. , take a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officials of Rogge are very responsible, and they have taken the people who have been bitten, and after the same torture, tell them who told them. Let them defend themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then naturally is a more fierce and more vicious round of back bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a few rounds, in the city of Bora, everyone was in danger, and they were afraid of being caught by others and then arrested in prison. Suspicion, hatred, and despair are growing day after day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hateful object of the public is always easy to point to the most significant, or the most familiar, target. Now the goal is very obvious, and that is the informer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens understand the Rogge behind the scenes planning. After seeing the ruins of the city's main government, the people of Bola are worried, just want to get the ‘evil Latvian magician’ as soon as possible. Most of the deaths this time are rich and powerful, but the next time I don’t know who it will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hearts of ordinary people, survival is always the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also specifically sent people to disclose the news of Latvians in the massacre in Leipzig. In a twinkling of an eye, the tragedy of Leipzig’s birth is well known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a moonless night, Rogge secretly used magic to blow up the city gates of Bora, with dozens of places in the Kingdom of Layton The garrison soldiers were sent to heaven. Although the Latvian army did not attack the ‘inside’ when it was in chaos, the false alarm of the Bora citizen was no small feat. After all, everyone was afraid that Leipzig’s tragedy would be born to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is arrogant when taxing people, taxation depends on income, each household levies one to several tens of gold coins. The fat man claimed that he would use the money to consolidate the city defense. When life is threatened, many people don't care so much about breaking money. Even if you care about it and dare to make trouble, the tax collector will grab an excuse and grab it. When all the prisons in Bora were overcrowded, no one noticed that more people were arrested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Layton is really rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ‘war tax’, Rogge enlisted 150,000 gold coins. The fat man is still conscience, and half of the gold coins are really spent on rebuilding the city of Bola, and the family members of the soldiers who died in the war. Rogge only succumbed to half. This proportion of corruption, compared with the huge bureaucratic system of the Layton Kingdom, is at most half a catty. Therefore, from the surface, Rogge’s political performance rate is much higher than that of the dead lords and nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a small war money, Rogge can make up for the loss of buying magic scrolls to the eyes of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a great pleasure to solve Rogge’s feelings of confidant. He sometimes looks through the interrogation records of the people who confess to each other, and the seeds described in it are shameless. Crimes, even fat people feel that the eyes are wide open. Over time, the bureaucrats under the fat man tried to figure out the preferences of Rogge adults, and they specially provoked some bizarre interrogation records, and occasionally Borogg smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bleak city of Bora, people are praying for the coming of the Savior every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classics of major religions have almost all the examples described, at this time, how God saved the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bola City is such a big city, how it will not be ignored by God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than ten days of martial law, this day, at the time of the day, a group of strange travelers came to Bora City in the afterglow of the setting sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are the clergy and wizards of the Eye of Wisdom, leading the team, it is Roger, who is very familiar with Rogge. According to the plan, he will spread the grace of God to this already tormented city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Layton, the Eye of Wisdom is already an influential religion. Many great aristocrats and wealthy businessmen have become faithful believers in the eyes of wisdom. Of course, how do these ordinary people resist the natural charm of the Virgin Mary? Judging from the past history, the eye of wisdom, a less glamorous way of displaying the congregation, will sooner or later attract the intervention of the big sect. Rogge, who is familiar with the history of the 6th, knows this well, so he has already begun to prepare for this. At the moment, the two largest sects in the North are the silver sacred goddess of the Snow Goddess and the Northern Druid Alliance. The brightest church is likely to interfere in the future. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is ready to use the secular force to counter the interference of these two sects, while at the same time relying on the power of faith in the eyes of wisdom to consolidate his power base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Karmon arrived, Rogge ushered them into the city of Bora with a grand and exaggerated ceremony. The welcoming ceremony was so grand, even the elders of Carmon did not think of it, and some were flattered. Looking at Rogge, who respectfully leads the way, Carmon can't help but feel a little guilty and a little scared. When he saw it at the beginning of the year, Rogge was just an ordinary magician. But after the reunion in the North, every time he saw Rogge, he felt that Rogge’s strength was blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Rogge's magic is always clearly there, the eleventh level magician. But Karlmont always has an intuition that everything he sees is not true. Perhaps because of the piety of the goddess O'Reilly, Carmon has recently felt that his instincts are becoming more and more acute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that makes Rogge feel sorry is that the charming Santa Claus, who is so charming, did not come together. According to Calmon, the saint is preparing a very large religious ceremony in the kingdom of the Kingdom of Leighton. At this ceremony, she will personally explain the teachings of the goddess O'Reilly and inspire more people to join the eye of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When worn, it is more efficient to arrange a large magical array to increase her natural charm effect to the maximum call. Rogge thought of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save the city, the first thing in the eye of wisdom is to capture the 'evil Latvian magician'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the guidance of the goddess, the magicians of the Eye of Wisdom are really extraordinary. Just that night, a magical war broke out in the city of Bora. In the magic fireworks, dozens of homes and hundreds of lives have become the victims of this 'hunting'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Rogge announced immediately The 'Evil Latvian Magician' has been killed and killed in the battle last night, the martial law has been lifted, and all the arrested 'suspicious people' have been released. For a time, the joy of the city of Bora is thundering.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To soothe the heart of the Bora urban people, there are two most effective ways, one is faith.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Eye of Wisdom is extraordinary, defeating the Latvian magician in a stunning magical battle, saving the whole Bo They also made Rogge lift the martial law and released all the arrested people. Rogge also allocated 10,000 gold coins to help the families of the victims in the two previous 'magic wars'. In the singer's voice, the clerics of Rogge and the Eye of Wisdom seem to be covered with a halo.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gold coins are not from anyway Rogge’s pocket, the fat man is not heartbroken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Carmen seized the opportunity and held several speeches in the following days to promote the teachings of the goddess. The glory of the goddess is spread. Every speech is a gathering of listeners. Although there is no natural charm of Mora, but there are still many believers in the eyes of wisdom after the speech.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another good way to confuse people and divert attention is to do military work.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is busy with the internal affairs of Bora City, but His gaze has never let go of the Latvian army less than 100 kilometers away.<br /><br />&nbsp ;######### This does not mean that the two armies are calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge concentrated on dealing with Nicholas, all military transfers were handled by Charlie. Rogge even handed the dark side of the moon to Commander Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a military officer, Charlie strictly abides by the order that Rogge can't fight the Latvians, but will never let them stay comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of day and night, every day there are several griffin knights in the sky around the Latvian army, monitoring the every movement of the Latvian army. In the early spring of the Northern Kingdom, except that the weather is still very cold, it is basically sunny, and it is suitable for the gryphon. The flight of the Griffin Knight is very subtle, just outside the magician's maximum range, so that Latvian magicians hate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie gave the Griffin Knights a magical fire arrow, screaming at the night, igniting the Latvian munitions library several times, and burning a stable As a result, the Latvians lost a lot of cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark side of the month was also sent out by Charlie. Every ten people were a team, and they could not swim to hunt the Latvian reconnaissance cavalry. The Latvian reconnaissance cavalry is not the opponent of the dark side of the moon. After a few days, it was destroyed by more than a hundred rides. Latvians quickly couldn’t stand the heavy loss of scouting cavalry. They simply sent a team of 500 troops and began to conduct reconnaissance of the surrounding area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie pro-two hundred Spartan knights, and gathered all the dark-faced knights of the month, swooped over to a Latvian reconnaissance unit. After a short and fierce battle, Charlie almost completely smashed the 500-strong force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, Latvians have never dared to send small units to the city for reconnaissance. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the full-scale contraction in Leipzig, now Latvians are wary of the cold arrows that do not know when they will shoot from under the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Rogge’s prior instructions, Charlie dragged the hundreds of bodies back to Bora City and hanged them on the door of Bora. Nearly five hundred bodies floating in the wind still look very spectacular. The confidence of the Bora urbanites in the preservation of the city by Rogge adults has increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these military merits, it invisibly dilutes the depressed atmosphere in the city of Bora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he went to Nicholas for a long time, Rogge still handed over the specific military mobilization power to Charlie. In this respect, the fat man knows that it is impossible to do better than Charlie. After all, the omnipotent genius does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Charlie, who went out to the city to hunt Latvian reconnaissance cavalry, came back. As in the past, as soon as he returned to the city, he went straight to the study to see Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge was already sitting in the study room and meditating on the magic map of the Holy Alliance. Charlie can't help but admire. After the reunion of the North, he has seen many of the many characters he has seen so far, but he is certainly the most diligent and self-disciplined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie repeatedly called a few times, and Rogge came back from his meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roger adults, Latvians are a bit strange. From all aspects of intelligence, they seem to be packing up and preparing to retreat."<br />< Rogge nodded and now has troubles! I want to attack us with insufficient strength, and the main battlefield is defeated again, because the undead army and the massacre almost broke with the allies. More than 30,000 troops have to spend their time on the battlefield, and it is better to withdraw from the country and help defend the main battlefield. If it were me, defend a strong fortress with 10,000 troops, block our way, and then put other troops into the main battlefield. If they really withdraw, Charlie, do you think we are going to pursue? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie will definitely want to think about it. But our elite troops are only over 6,000 points, and the rest are undertrained recruits. Their quality has improved rapidly since time, and it has been barely qualified to take the defending city or carry out the positional battle, but it is certainly not possible to pursue the pursuit. My suggestion is to draw our most elite cavalry and form a mixed force of two thousand riders. The chasing and harassment of the enemy on the way back can kill a large number of enemy troops. It would be better if you could find a chance to kill the other magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge meditation, fingers consciously knocking on the table, and said for a long time: "I see Latvians will retreat these days, we have to chase, but can not play too much, it will be ready to install, try to put a few more Latvians go back, which will be good for our future arrangements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly asked: "Charlie, how are our recruits trained now?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am focusing on training their combat skills and physical strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned and thought: "The most important thing in front of you is the military discipline! Others can relax for a while. However, the military discipline must be required to meet the highest standards. It is not good, you can find an excuse to kill him to emphasize the importance of the military discipline."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie wondered and asked: "Rogge, why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because they will soon become the occupying forces. For the occupying forces, The strict military discipline is the most important thing. Don't try to buy the hearts of the people with great pains, but let a group of soldiers who are disturbed by the people ruined! Charlie, the countries of the Holy Alliance have very close links in culture and descent, the kings The marriage between the nobility is also very common. That is to say, if we succeed in eradicating the royal family of a country, as we did in the Principality of the Snowy, it is easy to integrate the newly annexed country into the Autonomous Principality. All that is needed is patience and In this process, the military discipline of the occupying forces will directly affect the results of our efforts to integrate the occupying power. Now time is running out, I don’t ask these recruits to fight the warriors who have fought in battles. It’s fine to suppress the insurgents. Of course, if their discipline is strict enough, I don’t think there will be many insurgents.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge did not say, he would not ask. Charlie is cautious, and he has seen that Rogge is getting more and more important. It may be the most sensible thing to do something for such a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two then discussed the current battle for a while, and Charlie was ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the morning light shining through the window, Charlie saw that Rogge’s face was somewhat abnormal gray. After all, he and Rogge are not simply a relationship between the monarch and the minister. They are slightly hesitant. Charlie still said: "Uncle Rogge, we are not doing things overnight. You still have to pay attention to your health. If your injury in that day is not complete yet. If it’s good, then my sacred vindictiveness is very good for restoring the injury.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart was moved, and he was crying and laughing, and he quickly declined Charlie’s kindness. Send him out the door. After the incident in Leipzig, the relationship between the two had a certain stalemate, and after this morning, it recovered a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Charlie, Roger’s face was white and suddenly coughed. Charlie looked right, Rogge did have a wound, but the injury was not from Nicholas, but from Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning Silver Dragon Nicholas into Elf Nicholas, Rogge finally went to a big heart, and he immediately remembered the promise of Androni. ', immediately can not press a lively heart. Late the next night, he finally waited until the darkest moment before dawn, and immediately sneaked into Androni's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Roger’s silver eyes, the darkness in the room is not an obstacle at all, and everything is in the eyes of the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is still wearing a tulle nightdress, holding a quilt to sleep well, and the seductive curves are looming under the nightdress. Her chestnut head has been a little longer, it seems to be less heroic and more charming. Like the habit of peace, her sleeping position is also very indecent, and her limbs stretched out, firmly occupying every corner of this big bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a little, and couldn’t help but think of who would have smashed Androni and was afraid of being bullied at night. But in the blink of an eye, he screamed at himself two times. How can such a beautiful and beautiful person be allowed to give it to others? If you don’t accept it and leave it to yourself, you’re too sorry for your conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Androni seemed to feel someone in the room, but she rolled over, hugged the quilt, and slept heavily. It seems that at dawn, it really is the time when she slept the most. In the past, when Rogge touched the room, although she was still not awake, her ears had already stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This turn over, Androni's nightdress almost turned over the thigh root, and an extremely tempting long leg was completely exposed. Perhaps it is the reason for practicing the starry spirit, and the skin of Androni is not as full of old man or scars as other female warriors who practice martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her skin is flawless, crystal clear, and faintly transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which angle, Androni's legs are synonymous with perfection and temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge only felt dry in the moment, and in that day in the Dragon Cave, Androni’s appearance appeared in front of his eyes. Single temptation, that time is not as good as the half-faced. Rogge no longer thought about it. He whispered and rushed to Androni!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Rogge will be Androni’s The quilt was firmly in his arms, but her people were gone!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog followed a whirlwind, and there was a sharp pain in the vest, then I fluttered out of the window and fell heavily on the ground, unable to climb for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni yawned and closed the window, plunged into the bed and slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very heavy fall, Rogge can no longer kill the room of Androni, had to go to the study office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at dawn, Rogge’s encounters were roughly the same, and even if Androni’s fingers did not touch, they were inexplicably thrown. Out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest of these two days is not even as good as the sneak attack on Androni in the past night, when Rogge at least under Androni’s boxing Can struggle a few times, full of eyes, take up some dew is cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he faced the sleeping Androni again, he completely covered his breath with his mental power and approached her silently. Rogge stretched out his right hand very lightly and ignited a little black inflammation on his fingertips. With this spark of black fire, his fingers are like an invisible blade, slowly cutting the nightdress from the back of Androni into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Androni’s back, Rogge held his breath for a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still suppressed his impulses, gently opened her nightdress, then slowly explored her right hand, smacking her wrists . Rogge kept this position for a long time. After a long time, until there was no reaction in Anderney, it was lightning-fast gripping her wrists with her right hand. Her left hand held her body tightly in her arms. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly attacked, the body swiftly twisted a few times, instinctively to counterattack. However, her hands were tightly held by Rogge, who had not been able to break free after earning a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge buried his face in her maroon short, and the faint aroma made him feel very intoxicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni earned a few more, but was still firmly pressed by Rogge. His left hand has begun to walk up her wet skin. The hand slid over her smooth belly and continued to look down. In the blink of an eye, she crossed her last line of defense and entered the mysterious territory, then gently tightened her hand...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni, who is struggling, suddenly does not move!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s heart suddenly rises awkwardly, he is no longer If you don’t want to steal the incense, let go and let go all the way!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s already late...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge suddenly filled with dazzling blue brilliance, like a real starry temperament flame almost filled the entire room!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that there was no Resist the strong force, then involuntarily flew backwards, hitting the wall heavily. One of the stars and the vindictive spirit will never stop the attack and attack the body of Rogge!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s eyes have completely turned into silver, he desperately resists the starry sky The temperament of the vindictiveness, but could not be supported in the blink of an eye, so screams, a large mouthful of blood spurted out!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is full of vindictive flames The tide has returned to Androni's body, her body reveals a faint blue light, such as the most beautiful crystal statue. A strange sense of oppression filled the room, and Rogge sat down on the ground, and was forced to be unable to move by the invisible pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly saw that Androni was floating in the air at the moment!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Androni opened her eyes, her eyes are now like two shiny sapphires, revealing the murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When her eyes fell on Rogge, she suddenly stayed and exclaimed: "Rogge! How are you?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the blue light on her body was clean, and in the scream, Androni fell into the bed with awkwardness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she jumped up in a blink of an eye and couldn’t take care of herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also struggled to stand up, and he did not care for the heavy injury, surprised to see Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only one thing that two people care about now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of knocking down Rogge, the power that Androni uses is the power of the sanctuary!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sighed, and the starry temper again exploded, but this time it was only the starry flame. Although this is already a very powerful force, no matter how hard she tries, she can no longer reach the power of the sanctuary. After more than a dozen trials, Androni finally sat down on the bed exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no such fragrant feelings for both of them now. Androni scrutinized Rogge's injury. Now that there is no fatal injury, he hurriedly put on his clothes and jumped out of the window with his blue sky. She is looking for a quiet place to rediscover the way to use the power of the sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
