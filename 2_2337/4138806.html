			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five fifteen days later, two grand weddings were held at the Imperial Palace. Rogge and Kerry each returned a princess and also got the prince's prince. However, Rogge started from scratch to the right, and Kerry was reduced to an affiliated prince by an independent king. His mood was very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the dinner and the dance, it was already late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Malika has taken off the heavy wedding dress, sitting in front of the vanity mirror, and she helped remove the makeup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is wrapped in a bathrobe, humming a little song, and walks out of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue Master!" Lili blocked her in front of Malika and looked at the fat man with a look of caution. "You don't forget." Commitment to our princess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled, not yet answered, and a soft knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茱丽 ran over to open the door and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wind butterfly outside the door. She was like a cage in a light smoke, and the faint golden color slowly flowed down from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the elf is not like being in the world, and she can’t look directly at her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you at Rogge?" Wind Butterfly asked lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茱丽 has not recovered, instinctively said: "He is. But it is so late..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's very late. At this time, he should be in my room." The words of the wind and the butterfly are as thundering in the beautiful ears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..." The beautiful words have not been finished yet, and the wind butterfly dragged Rogge to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika and Julie face each other, and for a moment they can't understand what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this!" Marika lost her voice: "Is it not me to marry today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly swept the things on the dressing table to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning is quiet. When people are still dreaming, they are already thriving with the nameless grass. This is Rogge's favorite moment of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a little faint but with a sharp wind awoke Rogge from meditation. His eyes just opened, and he was attracted by everything he saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning of the room, there is a faint smoke rise. A brilliance of the flow of brilliance, entangled in a dancing figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge wheel saw is like a piece of butterfly wing with no weight in the wind butterfly, and she flies around with her filigree fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint morning light, the wind butterfly’s pale gold can’t grow, and it’s changing under the cross-cutting mapping of the wheel saw Guanghua and the morning light. Brilliant colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is only wearing the most close-fitting clothes, and the perfect skin is exposed. In the extremely limited space of the bedroom, she tends to retreat like a illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a misty orchid in the corner of the house, and its slender leaves can't shake in the soft wind. The brilliance of the flow turns into a little bit of light, which, like the morning dew, rolls down the veins. In the beautiful but deadly brilliance, the blue leaves of these green drops are not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original bedroom that only shows secular luxury is now a fairy mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the wind butterfly, she was amazed by the dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a martial art, but a dance that has been played several times in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, it’s not just time, but thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly turned and turned and looked at the Rogge who had already stayed. The golden sunlight spilled from behind her back, and it was a bit painful to see Rogge’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that golden brilliance, he only saw the beautiful figure, and the slowly falling pale gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence, a drop of water suddenly slipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before falling into the dust of the world, it reflected the seven-color iridescence in the morning light, and the final erosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fantastic morning, why is it so beautiful and... sad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly stunned. How long has he not experienced grief? In addition to seeing the Orpheus blood-stained long street on the same day, and the statue of Elysses in the flames into immortal statues; in addition to seeing the lost luster in the world of death, and the wings with undead blood In addition to seeing the elf woman who turned into a golden meteor at the cost of life, she went away...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, how luxurious is it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't do it." Wind butterfly is like a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't forget him, I have more of you in my heart; I can't break your curse, and I can't control my feelings; I can't put hatred, but... ...the elf's nature does not allow me to betray what to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighs, the song refers to a bomb, a gentle wind has gone to the butterfly Tears on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want me to cancel the contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly shakes his head and does not know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, I have been helpless, confused, desperate. At that time, I was only able to accept the fate, and I didn't even have the qualification to participate in the outcome. Until now, what I struggled for was still just a chance to sit at the table. As long as you sit on the table of destiny, the pain card in your hand can go to other people, and you can even arbitrarily give people who can't sit at the table. This is the privilege of the player. Since love and hate make you so painful, let's put it first! There is no road in front of you now, but if you climb one step further, maybe the road is there. Even if there is still no way out, at least you have a goal now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and waited for the day you were able to kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind There was a mist in the butterfly's eye, and gently said: "But... the end of power, what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "I I don't know. So I want to see what's there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind sighs insignificantly, leaning helplessly on Rogge in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the Winter Palace is noisy, and angry screams come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the courtyard where Rogge lived, he gathered more than a dozen young people dressed in costumes and was confronting two elves who were full of armor. The appearance of these people seems not small, even the defenders of the Winter Palace are only whispering persuasion, not to mention the drive away, even the obstacles are not dare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge living in the hospital is not very irritating. The old guardian knows that this kind of guarding the frontiers and holding the heavy armies is a murderous character. Rogge is quite happy with the great emperor, and he can't offend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment he was so anxious that he was sweating. He can't afford to be offended on both sides, but if he doesn't help, it's likely to become offensive on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, these young people are fierce now, but there is no need to be hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the two young people who have mastered the 'secret fighting technique' have already tried hard, and the result is that both hands look slim and weak. The elf female warrior gave a stunned play. These two elves are hands-on and there is no legendary elegance and tolerance. Their movements are almost exactly the same, elbows, knees, and finally a punch, very hot and ruthless. In the twinkling of an eye, the young man who just thought that he should be slightly pity for the beauty elves would become bruised and have a long nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These young people are frequent visitors to the art salon he presided over. They usually talk about poetry and music together, and naturally there are women. They are all born in a prominent family. For example, the two men who had just married, one father is the grand duke who manages the frontier province, and the other father is the key member of the emperor. Now invisible, Rogge is equal to both families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have heard the noise outside, and Malika hurried out of the room. She has a makeup and is glamorous. Just a slight shadow on the eye, it seems that I didn't sleep well for one night. On the stairs, she happened to meet Rogge who was also going outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and asked: "Is going out so early? Are those people outside you a friend?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika snorted and frowned: "Today is the day of our art salon gathering, they are coming to me. Why don't you let them in?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "I am a little bit identifiable. How can I live in and out of the place? Without my command, my guards will not let people in."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika is cold and cold: "Master Rogge, I am afraid that your guards will suffer a bit. Among my friends, there is a lot of fighting skills! Your hand is considered, you should not set up a card to stop people in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rughaha, a guardian who laughs really does not have any fighting skills, they Only kill on the battlefield. But since you are open, I will let your friends go to the Winter Palace at will. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茱丽哼道: "You count." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled undecidedly: "Then I will send you out." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Froya is coming in. This is a fascinating little goblin, which is a kind of style.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at Marika’s master and servant, and said something low in Rogge’s ear, and then a meaningful chuckle, and grew away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika stared at the back of Fu Luoya, and gnashed her teeth for a long time: "Who is she?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not important. Rog smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise at the entrance to the hospital became more and more fierce, and the guardian of the Winter Palace suddenly saw the figure of Rogge, in a hurry, in a hurry. I ran over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people saw Marika, and they seemed to have won, and after a while, they gradually quieted down.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger went straight to Relo’s face, although the young people had disdain for him, but for some reason, they subconsciously gave Rogge a way, no one I want to try this fat man's fighting technique.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked up and down the famous poet and composer, then nodded: "It really is talent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue adults may not be able to judge my talent. Relo sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge did not understand at all, just said: "It was a misunderstanding. Later, when you come to Marika, no one will stop. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo was a big surprise, he stared at Rogge, for a long time: "Roger is an adult, art is always full of **, today's salon will be An unforgettable experience. It’s rare to see the princess’s wildness! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people laughed meaningfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "I only know Making money and fighting, you know nothing about art. My territory is not very peaceful, so I will have to go back soon. A Lei is a remote place, there is no artist, let alone an art salon, and Malika will be very lonely there. If you can accompany her more than these days, it would be better. Mr. Relo, are you going to visit Aree? Experience the mountain village style, maybe it is good for your poetry. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo did not know how to answer for a moment. How much do he know the fate of the fat man, how dare to sway in the old man's nest?<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the youths crowded with Marika on the carriage, the guards of the Winter Palace wiped the cold sweat on his head, but the sorrow on his face was even heavier. In two years he will be able to retire, and now he only hopes to spend the next few days safely. If you must have something to eat, don't be born in the Winter Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pangpei’s residence occupied the entire island. In addition to the position and footprint of the owner's power, there is no luxury that Rogge expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the reception room, in addition to Pompey and Rockefeller, there is an older woman dressed as a priest. She looked arrogant, her face was sullen, and she couldn't help but look at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller Road: "Master Jimmy is the most powerful oracle of the Faith, and is the only one of the sacred churches who have experienced the power of the goddess of ice and snow. Sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jigma stared at Rogge and looked at the right, then said in a slow, hoarse voice: "According to the sacred collection, this frost It doesn't look like a normal cockroach. Its power comes from the goddess of the goddess of ice and snow. But the goddess of ice and snow is very unpredictable, and it will attack the creatures without faith. Inadvertently touching it, it is likely to be killed immediately. In case, just in case, I made a mirror. It can reduce the damage of the goddess to the holder, on the other hand, it can also detect the frost. The general position of the cockroach. Of course, the power of the Mirror is not comparable to the Frost ,. The holder must be strong enough to be completely harmless from the goddess.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge took the mirror with doubt. Although the work of this mirror is rough, the power contained in it is very powerful. And this is not the ordinary magic, but the magical power of the goddess of ice and snow. It seems that this Jima old woman is not a simple character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Peidao: "The adventurers have already confessed to the location of the Amoro Temple, which is very good. It is located at the junction of the Empire and the Holy Alliance. Please do not hesitate to give to Rogge, I will let the Duke of Dolyak fully cooperate with your actions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asked: "So what to do Those adventurers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the position of the temple is confirmed for two days, all them are disposed of. Free Druid to make a fuss. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger nodded: "This is the best. Does Master Jimmy go with me this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei sighed out of the army of Doriak, and this time we may not be able to provide you with any help. I just got the news that the seal of the Abyss Gate suddenly loosened, and a large number of very terrifying Warcraft rushed out. The three thousand sea god warriors left behind in the local area suffered heavy losses. I have ordered them to stay at all costs, in any case to support for more than two days, to the main army to come back. I and Rockefeller and Master Jimma are about to go to the gates of the abyss. If you let these Warcraft out of the blockade, the consequences are unimaginable. "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimma intervenes: "The seal was arranged by my late teacher. I personally checked it before Pompeii transferred troops. The state of the seal was very complete. If there is no external force factor, it will not be necessary to reinforce it in a hundred years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed... Is it Druid? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pangpei sighed: "If it weren't for them, no one else could cross my defense, approaching the door of the abyss, I was invited to fight for it, good." The crime of leaving the job is estimated to be unsuccessful. Straw once again told us in front of the Great, I am afraid that the best result is to erase the merits of conquering the Holy Alliance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned, and he did not expect that the Druids would actually make such a hot resort. This situation immediately reversed, not only greatly weakened With the strength of the Poseidon Corps, Pompey and the silver saints are also likely to fall out of favor. Druid defeated the dark forests and was able to pull back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Pompey took two laps in the room and sneered: "The empire is not in the bag of Druid! Druid's poison at least this time will kill at least 5,000 soldiers. Some of the soldiers are not dead on the battlefield of external conquest, but die in the conspiracy of their own fight! The soldiers of the empire have always valued the lives of their soldiers. In the past, any battle in politics will not affect ordinary warriors. This time, the Druids have crossed the border. I will inform Alexander of this. If the two glacial soldiers who did not help each other would support us, the situation would be completely different! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey nodded and although he supported the city of Yunxiao, he was still a real knight. Now his ‘tidal’ corps is fighting on the southeastern border of the empire, and this should not be known. By the way, Master Rogge, I heard that you and Princess Marika are not happy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge faintly said: "The prince will be fine." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei frowned: "This is not so simple." According to our inside line in the Imperial Palace, all the jade cards on the day were engraved with the same name. And I have sent people to investigate the identity background of Relo, but nothing. Rogge, it seems that Druid has planned to deal with you. You must be careful when you go south this time. Never let the frost fall into the hands of Druid. Also, your territory is still turbulent, beware of the Druids intervening. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "You can rest assured that I will be careful." Now I am going to meet the adventurers and see if I can ask anything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the border of the empire, the mountains that have been lonely for many years have suddenly become lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team’s people are marching in the middle of the forest. Rogge in the middle of the team is riding on the big horse and looking forward to his own.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual explorers will form a small team to search for places like the remains of the palace. Rogge is not. Now he is in power, if it is still a team with several partners, it is reflected There is no advantage in power. So this fat man simply transferred three thousand soldiers from the Duke of Doliya, and urgently transferred a large number of elf magicians and engineering units from the Ayre Principality, and entered the mountains and treasures in a mighty manner. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many benefits to such a large group of people, such as how good people can do things, such as preventing Druid from attempting to misbehave. Rogge also attacked an accident on the way. The Drew base point. To deal with this kind of Dru’s basis, there is no point It’s not a fat thing. It’s just that in the mountains, a Druid has not been able to run away. This is a small manifestation of some of the fat man’s commanders.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After a few days in the mountains, a meteorite palace finally appeared in front of Rogge, and I don’t know who left such a magnificent building in such a desolate place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Luo Gezhi stood proudly at the gate of the stone palace and looked up at the gate. In front of the huge stone gate ten meters high, Rogge looked so small.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central part of Shimen is engraved with a huge magic symbol with a few meters of square circle. I don’t know which big magician left it. The function is obviously the seal stone gate. Rogge touched the stone gate, and then looked up for a long time. Looking at the magic symbol, the slight admiration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria Yingying stepped forward, looking at this stone door, it is also a magical defense on the door. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked back at the wizard wizard behind him, To use magic could not be stormed these two Shihmen. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has scanned the spirit, this stone door is one meter thick, because the seal can resist a considerable amount of magical damage. So heavy The Shimen, I am afraid that only the legendary storm giant can push.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought for a moment, smile.<br /><br />&nbsp; Under the command of the fat man, the elf engineering unit sprinkled countless seeds under the stone steps of the gate, and then promoted the growth with the secret method of the elves. In the twinkling of an eye, countless trees and vines rushed from the cracks. Exploring the head, growing wildly with the identifiable degree of the naked eye. The power of the cockroach grows almost irresistible when the plant grows. Rogge looks at a piece of boulder and can't keep loose, just smile.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly there was a loud bang, a stone door suddenly tilted because the foundation was loose, revealing a gap of more than half a foot wide. Rogge ran to the gap a few steps, carefully looking inside It took a long time before it began to be laid out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;After a moment, more than ten large ropes were wrapped around the stone gate. Under the command of the officers, three thousand soldiers simultaneously, and the shouts shook the whole valley!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten-meter stone door vibrates, and a huge magical symbol suddenly spurts a group of orange-red fireballs!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the power of one person will not be able to match thousands of fighters. After more than ten earth-shattering screams, the huge stone gates finally fell down, and even the stones above the stone gates collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of warriors worked together and quickly cleaned the gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog snorted and looked at the dark and deep stone palace, and finally walked slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone palace has been closed for a long time, and the undead and undead are almost a must-have for this type of building. But for the fat man, there is no dead spirit that is worthy of fear. All kinds of World of Warcraft insects with venom are not to mention. Under the blaze of the magical flame, the dark environment can be said to be bright and white in front of the night eye of the elf, and the exploration is going very smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria and the wind butterfly followed Rogge, and they were all guarded. In this dark and humid environment with snakes and insects, the two little women were instinctively afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge seems to be walking easily in front of him. He is actually very vigilant and has been sweeping his surroundings with mental energy. In front of his mental power, the devil and the undead are invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly pushed open a door and led everyone to an empty, empty room. The fat man suddenly reached for a finger at the corner, and Froya immediately threw a few lightning balls. More than a dozen pale gray little warriors suddenly appeared, they screamed, rolling around, trying to blow the electric fire on their faces, but struggling for a while, they were completely silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pointed to the ceiling again, and the wizard wizard behind him immediately had a flame wave. On the high ceiling, there was a sharp scream, and dozens of huge green bats slammed into the fire and fell one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stepped forward and explored the air in the air, a faint shadow wrapped around his fist, unable to struggle. The shadow is getting darker and deeper, and the struggle is getting weaker. After a moment, Rogge loosened his hand and the shadows restored his freedom. It immediately flew out of the room, and after a while, returned to Rogge. The luster on the shadows does not fluctuate, it seems to be communicating with Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded and looked at the mirror and led the crowd to a stone wall. Until the fat man passed by the wall, the wall behind him was just a phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood still in front of a stone door and reached for three fingers at the door. Two large-waisted warriors stepped forward and picked up the giant hammer and squatted on the stone wall. In the smoke and smoke, the wall was pulled out by a large hole one meter square. There was a scream of the emperor in the stone room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge simply ignores what monsters are in the stone room. He waved his hand, and the fireballs one after another were generated between the hands of the Elf Masters and cast into the stone room. The flame of one repeatedly plowed every inch of space in the stone room, and even a stone of more than one meter in the stone hole on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven or eight fireballs were thrown, the stone room was finally quiet. When the smoke was slightly scattered, Rogge stepped into the stone room. In the room, there was a high-pitched black-body corpse, and the four walls were all weapons and rusted weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved, a Druid warrior with a ragged shirt and a wounded body was pushed up. He coldly commanded: "Moose the weapons inside! If you dare to come, I will kill your partner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See The captured warrior moved the last weapon from the stone room to the corridor, and Rogge was slightly disappointed. He was silent and walked to the depths of the stone palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s preparations this time are not perfect, he lacks the most critical person to explore the remains, thieves. Originally, the fat man has been trying to contact the Death Class and Hughes, but he has never responded, and he does not know where the two old foxes are going to harm. However, the fat man is self-defeating, and he no longer waits to explore the stone palace directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the way, after spending most of the day, Rogge finally approached the center of the stone palace. The dead spirits and resentments here are more and more powerful. The most headache for Rogge is that there are more and more traps in the organization, which are becoming more and more difficult to remove and dismantle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a break, Rogge led the most elite people into a hall. There are countless stone statues in this nearly 100-meter-wide hall. The fat man knows that these stone statues will become Warcraft stone ghosts. In the first hall, dozens of warriors who wielded hammers were under the command of the fat man. Before the full rush, the hammer was swung. In the bang of the thunder, more than ten stone statues were still activated in the future, and they were smashed by heavy hammers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
