			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the heavens under the nine chapters of the heavens <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter has been here, Rogge has to be hard The scalp led the team to the 'Wind Rift'. In his heart, he had already told the army commander who said that there was no abnormality in the ‘wind rage and rift,’ and did not know how many times. He was ready to go back and immediately executed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the fat man knows that this matter can not blame the military command. He can send ordinary cavalry. If the dragons don't want these people to find out, then there is a way. Looking at the distant dragons that are still flying in the distance, the fat man knows that most of these dragons are only arrived today. Those cavalry returns are a few days ago. At that time, the 'wind rage rift' is of course normal. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved his hand, and the five hundred squats behind him lined up in a neat queue. The hoof roared and slowly entered the ‘wind rage.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Wind Rift Valley’ is a very wide valley with four walls that are extremely sharp and steep. There is a wasteland around the valley, there is no water at all, and almost no green is seen. Therefore, the rift is uninhabited, and it is suitable for a duel battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogby has the heart to arrange a few traps in the 'Wind and Rift Valley' one day earlier, but in retrospect, this battle must be carried out in the air. It is also useless to place traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been dragons who have discovered Rogge and his party, and the sound of dragons has come and gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved again, and the five hundred knights stayed in the ‘wind rage valley’. There are many dragons in the Rift Valley. These ordinary knights and horses can never resist Longwei. When they turn their backs and flee, they can break the prestige of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central part of the Rift Valley has been swaying a majestic and tall silver dragon. Its pair of deep amber eyes are looking at Rogge. Behind it, there are two small silver dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the magic, Rogge and others have understood the meaning of these dragons, knowing that this majestic silver dragon is the silver dragon king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge four slowly rushed to the front of the silver dragon king. At this time, all four people have entered the Longwei range of the Silver Dragon King, but the horses are quiet as usual, and there is no fear of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there were several gale in the sky. The dragons that had been hovering in the sky had gathered their wings and landed around Rogge and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked around. In addition to the three silver dragons, there are three black dragons, one green dragon, two red dragons, a pale wind dragon and a dragon with a small body, but more than ten meters long. This dragon is very strange, and the body seems to be transparent. Through its crystal-like scales, you can see that the translucent dragon has a beautiful color flowing slowly under the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the size of this dragon is a very weak type in the dragon. However, it seems that those green dragons, red dragons and wind dragons are quite afraid of it. Even the three giant black dragons that are in the distance have no arrogance in their words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colorful Dragon Tedelia, Rogge only knows such a name from the Dragon language. Obviously Tedelia is not willing to talk more, just a little flapping the wings, even if he has greeted many dragons in the field. The fat man does not know that the so-called colorful dragon is a rare dragon species, or just the title of Tedelia. However, the fat man has already felt that the brilliant colors flowing slowly under the Teddya dragon scale are actually extremely powerful energy, but the power of the attribute is not separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger frowned. He never thought that there would be so many dragons in this duel, and there was an unprecedented colorful dragon! As long as one-third of the dragons in the venue are in trouble, then these people don’t want to leave the ‘wind rage and rift’ today, and they can’t escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon King’s eyes illuminate in a blink of an eye, and they look at them one by one from Rogge, Death Class, Androni and Hughes, and then Asked: "Which is a heroic challenger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is moving forward. Dao: "She will arrive soon. Dear Silver Dragon King, I have a little doubt, I hope you can give me the answer. The Yinlong family has always been known for the noble and holy in the Dragon, and today it is supposed to be a fair decisive battle. But why do I see so many dragons here? If the decisive battle is no matter what the outcome, we have to be buried in the 'wind rage', then just do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong Wang turned back and said: "Don't say it again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned its head again, gentle but without losing its majesty: "The glory of the silver dragon is directly in the ancient times. Inheriting from the Dragon God. You can rest assured that in the eyes of Yinlong. Glory is more important than our lives. Today, I can guarantee in the name of the silver dragon kings of the past, you will definitely get a fair battle."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge is obviously not satisfied. He still said: "I believe that only the vows issued in the name of the Dragon God will be binding! I am not trying to insult the reputation of the silver dragon kings of all ages, but your entourage has threatened me just now. Maybe after a fair decisive battle, We are still waiting for the attack of the Silver Dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon King slowly said: "Humans are really awkward and cautious creatures. Ok, I, Silver Dragon King , Verram. Sky, swearing in the name of the Dragon God, today will give a fair battle to the immediate human race, and obey the agreement, if the decisive battle fails, from this month, the Dragon City can no longer pursue Chris Ferrena and Nicholas "Those things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time a huge, awkward red dragon snarled, and it roared: "You humble creatures dare to be in front of the dragons. Arrogance! I can't let you all kneel down with a little dragon of 'Right Red Rage'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It flutters, maybe Rogge, etc. The reason why people are too close to the Silver Dragon King, the huge red dragon 'pure red anger flame' disk After a round, I turned to the 500 cavalry in a neat array at the Rift Valley! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Longwei of the Red Dragon Pei’s outbreak, five hundred cavalry have fallen, but they have climbed up immediately despite the pain in their bodies, and they can’t help themselves. The four fled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s face is iron blue, he knows that under such a dragon. These ordinary warriors will never recover again. In the corners of his eyes, except for the Black Dragon and the colorful dragon Tedelia, the green dragons, red dragons and pale dragons who are inferior are a little bit tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and screamed! This whistle rumbling, reverberating in the rift! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war horse under his seat suddenly screamed, then fell to the ground, and the original fat and bright body quickly shrank. In a blink of an eye, it becomes a dry corpse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A light gray aperture spreads out like a Rogge lightning, where the aperture passes. In addition to the powerful dragon, all the vitality has been swept away! Even the Death Class, Androni and the Warriors also fell to the ground. Of course, the three men would not be able to withstand this wave of death energy attacks by Rogge, and they would fall to the ground if nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray aperture passed between the 500 cavalry and their horses in the blink of an eye. The next moment, thousands of corpses are scattered throughout the valley! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The Pure Red Rage’ was shocked, but when the gray aperture passed over its body, it only felt a little discomfort. The red dragon snarls arrogantly: "Humble humans! You can only use this kind of painless attack to kill the same kind of weak ones! Try the power of my spit!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not finished yet. I saw a dark gray rifle flying out of the Rogge hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of Mo Ming’s fear makes the scales stand up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deep fear comes from this dark gray energy pistol! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragons are trying to dodge, but the dragons are too big, their movements in the air are awkward, and the ‘pure red anger’ is no exception. It only had time to move a few meters to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark gray pike is silently immersed in the chest side, and flies out from the back of the wing, looking straight at the hard red dragon scales in nothing, in 'Pure red anger flame' left a large hole with a diameter of half a foot. The flesh and blood around the wound turned gray and white, and in a twinkling of an eye, it began to emit a burst of rancidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon is rolling in pain in the sky. It was so hard that it suppressed the pain of the wound, and his eyes stared at Rogge who gave him such a heavy blow, and could not help but snarl in a low voice: "You... these humble humans! The ugly little bugs dare to hurt. Noble dragons! I... will let you turn into ashes when I spit hot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xius took out an unremarkable ruler from his arms and twisted his hands. The steel tube is stretched at the knot, and finally a sharp gun tip is ejected at each end, one is pure black and the other is pure white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class and Androni also each took out their long swords and looked coldly at the red dragons that were far in the sky and waved their wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The anger of pure red anger’s heart was shocked and angry, looking at the four humans who should have bowed their knees before it, and it felt fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the Red Dragon is known for its temper and arrogance, and the constant anger in the heart continues to push it forward, turning them into hot vomiting ash. But on the other hand, the fear from instinct is desperately preventing it from impulsive. Intuition tells it. These four people are not easy to provoke. The wound left by the gray pike was still in pain, just if it was slower. Maybe this long gun will have its life directly. It instinctively felt that the weapons of the other three people were able to break through the hard scales that it was proud of, and the terrible things that easily hurt it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Silver Dragon King said: "The anger of pure red", although they are human, but also like the dragons, is the former Come to watch the guests. If you attack them now, it is against the Moonlight Dragon City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tyrannical red dragon and silver dragon are not bad, but Their strength cannot be compared with Yinlong, so they dare not be as enemies as the Black Dragon. What's more, the words of the Silver Dragon King just gave the Red Dragon a step. The ‘Right Red Rage Flame’ snarled a few times to Rogge, and flew to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Dragon King then watched Rogge and said: "Young human beings, at the expense of a thousand lives, cursed by the gods in the spells of the undead." The Wrath of the Hell of the Hells, is the meaning of life so light in your heart? Have you prepared this spell, which is to be used on me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge's face is still very pale, his voice also brought a little weakness: "Respected Silver Dragon King, I also look forward to a fair decisive battle. So I can honestly tell, 'Hell's Wrath' is this Prepare for it! If your people prepare for us after the final battle, then at least pay a few lives at the cost!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's hand Silver Dragon, who had been troubled by him after the Silver Dragon King, immediately snarled in a low voice, which seemed to be a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon King is gentle and authentic: "Young humans, you don't have to worry about my ability to bind the people. Maybe our decisive battle should begin, the dragons have waited too long. My opponent, where is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sky suddenly passed a strange dragon: "I haven’t seen it for a thousand years." The Wrath of Hellful Enemy'! The little thing kills a thousand lives as soon as you raise your hand! Good, good! It fits my heart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon It’s very weird. Every word has two resonances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked up and passed a huge black shadow in the sky. In a twinkling of an eye, another dragon fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy and extreme sense of oppression enveloped the entire ‘wind rage.’ The inferior red dragons, green dragons, and wind dragons involuntarily retreat, and they look at the newcomers' eyes full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the new arrival of this dragon, Rogge has completely exhausted his strength and seems to feel that he has some dazzling eyes, he blinked his eyes and looked forward to it. I couldn't help but be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not mistaken. On the huge body of this dragon, there are indeed three dragons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ista Laze!" The Silver Dragon King also seemed to be taken aback and said: "Why are you cursed by the Dragon God? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three dragons' singular dragons sound like laughter: "Velham, you defeated me a thousand years ago, but now you have Old is not what I am, I am still afraid of you? I heard your pride, the great silver miracle Nicholas actually turned the weak people into elves? Haha! But Cris Ferrena died very badly, she The beauty of my heart makes me feel good! Hey. I was cursed by the Dragon God, but you can't go anywhere now? Look at the faint glory of Moonlight Dragon City, you know that you are also abandoned by Dragon God! Ram, you are welcome, I am here today to see how you were killed. If you are lucky, then I don’t mind fighting you again. After a thousand years, can you still Beat me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ista Laze!" A huge black dragon suddenly spoke up: "Today's decisive battle is a major event in the world of the dragon. I will not allow you to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ista Laze's three faucets turned together, staring at the black dragon in disgust, and after a while it turned to look at the beautiful colorful dragon that has been silent: "Beautiful Tedelia, you What does it mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful dragon Tedelia finally spoke up: "If you intervene in this decisive battle, I don't mind becoming your opponent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ista Laze has six different colors in the eyes to spurt the flame, it stares at Tedelia, and finally just smashed One, there is no such thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s at this time. A warm and sultry golden light scatters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This golden glow contains an infinite sacred atmosphere. Rogge's face changed, quietly launching the mental power to wrap himself firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ista Laze and the Black Dragons are propping up the mask around them. Keep the golden light out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful demon lotus appears quietly from the golden light. Like a step on an invisible ladder, Wella slowly stepped toward the Silver Dragon King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-prisoned prison gun in her hand has been completely surrounded by the Holy Flame, in stark contrast to the black-colored demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, not to mention Rogge, Silver Dragon King already knows that Wella is his own opponent. It has wings, and the huge body slowly floats up to the sky until it is opposite to Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked up at the demon in the sky, his face complex, I don’t know what to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stood in the air, completely without movement, it seemed to be turned into a statue, but the brilliance in the eyes of the devil’s mask was not Live and flow. However, no matter who is a dragon, the presence of the prisoner in her hand can sense the amazing energy contained in her prison gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the gun is hollow, the empty space is a dark black void, only occasionally a flash of light can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong Wang waited patiently for a long time and finally said: "Your strength is enough to get my respect, can our decisive battle begin?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly said: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the devil's wings, Wella with a shadow Going to the Silver Dragon King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Dragon King roared, and a front paw hit the Wella heavily. Wella's left hand stretched out and even blocked the claws of the Silver Dragon King! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the silver dragon is so great that Weina was immediately hit by a blow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After flying dozens of meters, Wella stopped the castration. But a large piece of silver dragon flame has already rushed to her face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and rushed into the dragon's flames, and then the beautiful figure rushed out of the silver dragon flame, flying soaring! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina in the air gently shook his body and shook the silver dragon flame still burning on his body. She used the prison gun to refer to the Silver Dragon King, and said coldly: "You are old, I have 80% confidence that I can kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon King did not chase It is just looking up at the Wella, who is constantly pouring out the sacred flame, and gently said: "For me who has come to the end of life, the 20% grasp is enough."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If all the silver dragons vowed never to be enemies with me, then today's decisive battle ends here. The situation of Moonlight Dragon City is not good, you should consider for the tribes, they are indispensable You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the Silver Dragon King is still gentle and majestic: "There is no eternal dragon in this world, nor a dragon city that does not die." Only the glory and glory of the ancestors of the eternal life." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
