			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Year of the World is entangled in the Sixth Anniversary of the Yearbook<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like other metropolises, Richelieu is also a In a city rich and poor, the northern part of the city is rich and expensive, or at least a decent person can live here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north of the city, a small but exquisite courtyard with the other districts of Richelieu ushered in another cold dusk. There is a three-story building in the courtyard. In a room on the third floor, Miro has a dark black silk gown, which is gathering and painting. On the canvas in front of him, a woman of all styles is now in its infancy, but her face is still blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro's painting skills are extremely exquisite, although the woman in the painting is still not completed, but it is extremely fascinating. From the perspective of physical clothing, he painted Fu Luoya! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miroli held the brush in his hand in front of the easel, but could not drop the pen on her face anyway. After a long time, he finally sighed and put down the brush in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, there was also a heavy and hoarse sigh outside the door, and the warrior who had wrapped himself up forever was coming in. He looked at the easel in front of Miro and shook his head in desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro washes the oil on his hand in a basin of cold water and asks: "When did Adrienne arrive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior made a metal-like voice: "There was just news from His Royal Highness that she had a little trouble on the road and had to delay for two days. It is expected to arrive in Richelieu three days later." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro snorted, disappointment was beyond words. He wiped his hand a little irritably and asked unpleasantly: "How is she so troubled? Did she say that it was because of what was wrong with the trip?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Bushido: "The whereabouts of His Royal Highness Adelene was discovered by General Artest's men. She had to personally pursue the eyeliners that were ready to report, so I needed to delay a little time. You know, we must not let A General Tester knows that His Royal Highness has come to this plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro snorted and asked: "You need her to kill a few reports." Is it true? Is her dark knight all dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The samurai sighed heavily and said: "Miro, do you forget? It is impossible for His Royal Highness to bring the Ghost Knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro is stunned. Silently speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior looked at Miro and suddenly said: "Miro is a big man. You are now so unconstrained for a human woman, and it has completely placed my family behind. In my opinion, we should let Zakazab inform my lord and send another person to come over, so that I will not mistake my family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro Suddenly turned and angered: "I naturally know this thing. It is me and not you who preside over the overall situation. I hope you don't forget this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The samurai did not give in. He said: "If you really think about my big things, then of course it would be better. But what is your preparation for Adeline's Highness, you are also very clear about your temper, she hates someone to calculate her. Once she knows your true intentions, I am afraid that a big battle is inevitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro sneered and said: "I will be afraid of her? Noord Hart You don't want to say anything to her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nordhardt as if you didn't see the meter Faint beating like a flame on purple fingertips. Still not too slow to say: "I can't say anything. But you can't stop your temple for a long time, then... oh! Although you and your Highness are both my geniuses, if you fight with the temple, you are afraid to win. Isn't the chance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro's face is mad, and his purple fist and black flame are constantly changing. It seems that he is trying to restrain his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nordhardt turned a blind eye to Miro’s anger, but said: "Miro, I just remind you, since you and Adeline are already I came to this plane. If things don't go well and Zakazabu asks for assistance from my host, do you think about who will come next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nodha nodded and said: "Miro, no one will want to work with that person. I see you are no exception. So please take a moment to think about the great cause of my family. As long as the big things happen, no matter You will change the Adelini Temple. I will not set any obstacles for you. However, I still have to remind you that you must be prepared to bear the anger of His Royal Highness Adelene." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro smiled coldly, his eyes slightly picked up and looked away to the east where Adrianne was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nordhardt sighed heavily as he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the far south, Constantine also sighed. But his expression is much happier than Noord Hart. Just looking at a long corridor to be scrubbed in front of him, he smiled a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A door came out, and Effie appeared from behind him and said, "My homework is done. You are not hurt enough. Do you want me to help?" You?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin smiled and shook his head and said, "No. If you have time, go to practice the holy cut."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie immediately said: "Do not practice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She simply refused to let Constantine The foot slipped, squatting on the bucket, almost fell to the ground, and the wounds that were not healed all of the pain. Constantine was pale and pale, but he still insisted: "Why not practice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie said: "The power of divine cutting is too small. Exhausting all my strength can only give off two cutting ripples. These ripples are very difficult to control, and they don’t open anything at all! What kind of light chain, undead expulsion, holy sacred look you teach They are much stronger than this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and added: "And the sacred cuts are silent when used, there is no other The spell is beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin only smiled after listening, he seemed to hesitate, but finally made up his mind, to Effie: "Ai Mayfair, the other sacred spells I teach you have limited power in the future, but the sacred cuts are different! It will continue to increase its power as you master the depth and the sacred power of your own. If one day you can break through the limits of power, It is possible to turn the sacred cut into a foot that can be threatened God the skill out of order cutting "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"! Cut out of order "Effie child a pair of clear eyes blink staring at Constantine?. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, cutting out! If you come into contact with the strongman above the sanctuary, you will understand the power of disorderly cutting." Constance Ding Yi’s face is solemn and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." Effie didn't think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you... don't want to learn to cut the order? Don't want to learn this is enough to threaten the skills of the dark gods?" Constantine can hardly believe his ears . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are I going to provoke the gods of darkness? It is your business to knock them down, it has nothing to do with me." Effie looked at Constantine as if Look at a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Constantine said with a smile: "What do you want to learn? Your sacred magic is progressing very fast, you can't just meditate, you have to start a lot." Practice the sacred technique."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie frowned and thought for a long time. After taking a look at Constantine’s sacred magic book for a long time, she pointed to one of the pages and said to Constantine: “This looks very interesting. I will learn it!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin came over and frowned. "Prophecy? Indeed, prophecy will eventually become a great prophecy, and you can directly quote the power of the gods to attack the enemy. But this spell At the beginning of the first stage, it can be said that it is completely useless. The power of high-order is directly related to the degree of piety of faith. Effie, although your soul is pure, but now you can’t talk about faith at all. It is impossible to practice big prophecy. Instead of spending your time on this, you should practice sacred cutting that has nothing to do with faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will learn this." It is an elf with a stubborn peculiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Effie's long ears suddenly shivered. She ran to the window and looked out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Effie, what's wrong?" Constantine moved to the heavy footsteps and chased him. Although the sacred spells have a special additive effect on healing, the rich death scent of the kings will continue to increase the damage, and the two phases will conflict. Just offset each other. Therefore, Constantine has a sacred power that is proud of his peers. At this moment, he still has to endure the recovery speed of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good bloody suffocation..." Effie’s face began to pale, looking at her hard look, seemingly vomiting **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin also came to the window, he closed his eyes, deeply facing the wind, took a breath. For a long time, I opened my eyes in confusion and said: "Nothing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie smiled and said: "Nothing, it seems to me. Wrong. Ah. There is still a place that is not cleaned! I can't miss it. I will come back to study prophetic with you at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment that passed by. Constantine suddenly saw that Effie had always had some desolate faces on her face. He couldn't help but ask: "Effie, do you have anything to worry about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie looked at him strangely. Road: "You are very curious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin stunned, said: "I am not curious... well, how to say it, this is As your teacher, no, it’s a friend, it’s not right. So, as a cardinal’s concern for a supreme believer, is it OK?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I have not yet promised to be a believer in the Most High God." Effie's refusal was crisp and neat, and once again defeated the conspiracy of Constantine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the poor cardinal and said: "But I can tell you why. I haven’t seen God for a long time, I want to He went to bed. Satisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Effie’s pure face and unmarked look, Constantine could not accept her appearance and speech. A huge contrast between the two. Yin wants this big sin. When she says it, it is just like saying that eating and drinking are the most common things in daily cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the soul be too pure, but there will be problems? For the first time in his life, Constantine began to doubt his own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the extreme gloom, Const had no choice but to smile. Pick up the bucket and continue your cleaning work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arctic Ocean, in this frozen country, the floating city that is solitary in the sky is mysterious and beautiful, but it also looks extremely backward. Since the windy day of the day, the entire flying castle has broken the ice-defense enchantment of the goddess of ice and snow, the little goblins flying around the floating city have fallen, although Wenda has tried his best to repair it. But it is only to make it barely able to re-float. To completely repair the lost paradise, it is impossible to do today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of floating. A piece of lifelessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark main hall, the snow is flying at this moment, and the windy moon is floating in the snow alone, contemplating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when she got the goddess of ice and snow, her eyes looked farther, her ears heard wider, and her knowledge was not limited to Pull, but can listen to the prayers of the highest level of devout sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real and powerful field of God brings her a whole new experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a short life. The flying insects that once survived in the midsummer suddenly entered the winter as never seen before, and the windy moon was also in vain for the new field. She carefully explored, experimented, and tried to master the capabilities of this vast polar field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the battle with the goddess of ice and snow, Fengyue still does not feel any difficulty in mastering her godhead and field. However, what you see, there is a gap beyond imagination that is always felt with the real. Even if the field of the goddess of ice and snow is not complete, compared with other gods, the power is not as strong as it is, but this is the case, the vastness and complexity of her field is far beyond the expectations of Fengyue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the wind and moon are still far from the power left by the goddess of ice and snow, but her consciousness has begun to be affected by the goddess of ice and snow. Everything in the past, the life of the mortal seems to be away from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon are trying to absorb and understand the power of the frozen country, she even began to try to use the power of this field. Of course, the attempt of Fengyue brought disaster to many creatures under the ice ocean. And those who feel keen and powerful are already trying to lurk into the deepest part of the ice world. Because for them, in addition to the above-mentioned a goddess of anger, another very terrible guy has entered the ice ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ice, these powerful creatures have more or less spiritual connections to each other before, so when they sense that their powerful companions fall down one after another Immediately realized that the danger is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another thing that upsets the wind, is that more and more people dare to hit her mind! Of course, some of them are not intentionally offending the windy month. They just inadvertently violated certain areas that Fengyue values. But if the goddess of ice is not a tolerant goddess. So what about the windy month? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Hughes. Feng Yue adults, that is always very vengeful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue is the perception of God. I have passed these bold people one by one, preparing for a solution to the confusion of the power of the field, and finding a way to walk in the world as an ordinary person. She will let these daring guys pay the corresponding price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Fengyue suddenly felt a burst of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and looked at it, and suddenly there was a sharp and screaming panic in the dark hall. The gnome of the earth did not know where it was given by the wind and the moon. come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy moon glimpsed, she thought she would catch a sacred dragon, but the result was to find such a small thing, look at this time, Gregory Most of the time, it exists in the form of underground gnomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue looked at Gregory, thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory instinctively felt a bit of chills. It just came out of the wind and the moon, and immediately turned over and turned into a long-lost sacred dragon form. The most elegant, courteous and sincere attitude, said: "The most beautiful master, you come to me, what is your order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faith is not stable. You Going to discuss with Mora, it’s time to show the miracle.” The wind is faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Dragon is destined to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later in the morning, many of the citizens of Richelieu were awakened by the sound of dragons screaming in the air. A little lucky early riser, seeing a dragon wrapped around the glory of the cloud, swooping down, slamming the wind, thundering on the still high goddess of nature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge rush of the dragon brought the natural goddess to slowly tilt, and then there was a roar of the earth’s slight tremor!<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon rises from the dust and gravel, circling slowly, and then flies down to the statue of the goddess of ice, which is opposite to the natural goddess of the distant, under the eyes of thousands of people. . The square in front of the Statue of Ice and Snow is vast enough to accommodate the next dragon. After learning about the riots outside, the temple of the Great Snow and Ice Temple opened wide, and Mora took all the high-ranking clergy to the fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy and beautiful Mora stands in front of the Ice Goddess, accepting the dragon with her unique sweet voice instead of the great goddess of ice and snow Worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is screaming in response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the servant most valued by the master! We are just playing a show now, don't think that your position is really above me." The dragon quietly threatened the Holy Spirit with spiritual fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will tell what I know, all your disrespectful actions, tell the goddess truthfully." Mora whispered back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare!" The sacred dragon roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
