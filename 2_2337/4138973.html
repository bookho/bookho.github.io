At this time, the sacred agreement has been basically completed, including the two empire of the Asrofik Empire and the Dro Empire. A total of twenty-six large and small countries on the mainland joined the sacred agreement and agreed to fight against the Bavarian Principality and the Bright Church. This is also the largest anti-church alliance on the mainland since the establishment of the Church of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long ago, it was rumored that the imperial government of the Austro-Hungarian Empire secretly arrived in the city of Lille, the capital of the Bavarian Principality, and the special envoys of six or seven small countries also arrived in the city of Lille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the entire situation is getting clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day when Rogge stepped into Ossia, under the auspices of the Pope, the Crown Prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Grand Duke of Bavaria, Catherine, formally at St. James. The league’s declaration was signed in the church and it was agreed to fight against the infidels. There are less than ten affiliates of the Austro-Hungarian Empire that signed the declaration together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the sacred Allies, this alliance is called the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the two major war groups in the north and the south were formally established, and an unprecedented civil war of the Terran was kicked off. It seems that the turmoil within the Terran has been detected, and countless interracial countries around the mainland have also rioted, especially those races that have had thousands of years of hatred against the Terran. There are a large number of alien empire such as orcs and dwarves, as well as the unusually powerful races of the giants of the Froststorm, and even the dark creatures hidden in the underground abyss are eager to move, counting on the ability to fish in troubled waters. More or less the benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the two camps have become clear, at the junction of the southern border of the Dro Empire, the fighting has become fierce and the scale has escalated rapidly. The wars have occurred from time to time, and the number of deaths has also risen. But this is still only a tentative battle. The two sides are still guarding the current theater and not easily taking a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the upcoming war. Both camps are accumulating strength and mobilizing troops. In almost every country, the war machine is running at a high speed, even if it is a small number of countries that are temporarily neutral. In order to prevent this, all of them have begun to mobilize all the forces that can be mobilized. These countries know that the taste of being sandwiched between the two camps is not good. In the event that the commander of the camp suddenly wits in the air and attacks, it is the disaster of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful O'Siyah has completely turned into a war machine that integrates barracks, workshops, hospitals and magic bases. The beauty of the past has long since disappeared. . The world has no color other than the black of the one-piece armor and the white of the sword. Rogge's carriage went all the way. All that was seen was a team of soldiers, a deafening sound of iron, a tower of magical flashes, and a carriage that transported war preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Rogge was riding a full-marked carriage. Otherwise, once recognized, the fanatical believers will certainly make him unable to move. The Rogge horse car sneaked into the side door of the church ice temple. Although the Sophie Palace is luxurious, it is inconvenient after all. The fat man has a lot of secrets that he can't let the Drodi room know. So when the Icewind Great Temple was set up, Rogge immediately moved in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro is indeed versatile. Under the sacred work of the ice-cold temple, which has no abnormalities on the surface, it has become a magical fortress comparable to the iron wall. The second half of the hall has been completely remodeled by him. Adrienne, who is proficient in space structure, has multiple portals and traps in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear part of the Icewind Great Temple is a restricted area, only one portal can enter and exit, only a very small number of people are eligible to enter this area, so the entire hall The department is quiet and almost can't see the figure. Rogge walked quickly through the complex cloister and returned to his magic lab. He carefully covered the door. After crossing several portals, the fat man finally entered a small room in the innermost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the door opened, a husky scream of pain was heard from the room, and the screams were mixed with intermittent choking. Rogge smiled with satisfaction and stood in front of the magic test bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a crystal tray placed on the test bench, which contains half of the deep purple liquid, and the crystal of the radiance reflects this deep purple, revealing a strange . The liquid stands in the Orchard's Great Sacrifice, Ogan Heller's head. It seems that it has been soaked for too long, and the green color of the big sacrifice has become very light and invisible. A few thin metal rods stand around the crystal tray. The club head emits a thin lightning bolt from time to time. Kneeling on the skull in the dish. Every time lightning strikes, Ogan Heller will fall into a state of near-madness. The entire face is distorted and terrible. After the pain subsided a little, there will be a new lightning bolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge took the crystal and explored the memory of Augen Heller recorded in the crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbearable pain has afflicted the orc's great sacrifice to the unconscious, the memory of the past unconsciously from the deepest part of his soul, and then will be The crystal is recorded. In order to record the memory of Augen Heller, Rogge reluctantly used a broken crystal left by a prophet of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved his hand and tormented Ogan Heller’s lightning disappeared. The Orc’s Great Sacrifice finally recovered his mind after the pain slowly recovered. He saw Rogge and saw the crystal in the hands of Rogge. The annoyance and self-blame quickly filled the tormented face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat down in front of Ogan Heller and said slowly: "You don't have to be too blameless. So far, no one can bear the soul. The torment doesn't reveal a little secret. Even if you are strong enough, this endless pain is enough to smash your mind and let you know what you know in the subconscious."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flipped through the memory of the crystal while chatting with the big sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller was born in a strange orc tribe in the Central Mountains. This tribe is far stronger than other orc tribes. It is just that Ogan Heller is different from other orcs. His mother is an elf who flows in the mountains and is captured by the orcs. The elves' pedigree made Ogan Heller's body weaker than other orcs, but he also brought him far more wisdom than the same family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs live in the middle of the Central Mountains. Every year, a large number of small orcs die from hunger and cold. This is nothing in the eyes of other orcs. They only think that this is a matter of course. It is the means by which the Dark Lord chooses strong orcs. But Ogan Heller is different, he has wisdom. He longed for the happy life of the powerful orc empire in the orc legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that day of changing destiny, a boulder on the Horde’s holy mountain suddenly had life. This is the Prophet of the Earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prophet of the Earth guides the orcs to realize the contempt of the dark gods and bring the brilliance of the beast and powerful magical power. Ogan Heller became one of the orcs' fastest masters of magical power because of his different elder bloodlines, and thus became the great sacrifice of the entire orc empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days that followed, the Prophet of the Earth used a mixture of multiple intelligent races and orcs to guide the orc's wisdom, and many strange new ones were created. Species. Most of these species are failures. But there are also a few successful examples, some of which evolved and eventually became the beasts of the orcs. At the same time, the Prophet of the Earth also brought knowledge of all aspects of smelting and forging to the orcs, and laid a solid foundation for the establishment of the orc empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prophet of the Earth is always sleeping. The condition for awakening it is the soul of at least one hundred elite orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a decade of secret development, Ogan Heller finally found out that to inspire the wisdom of the orcs. Only the mixed with the elf is the most successful. The Prophet of the Earth helped the Great Sacrifice to directly hear the gods of the beast, and thus mastered the magical array of soul operations. This magical array can extract the power of the individual souls of the intelligent race and use this as a key to open wisdom for the orcs. If wisdom can be measured, then the wisdom of the orc's ascension is far less than the original wisdom of the intelligent race, and the soul is extracted from the power. Those wise races will turn into a walking corpse with only biological instincts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierceness and cruelty of this method did not make Ogan Heller regress. After decades of secret development, the orc empire has enough power to implement a plan to open wisdom. At this moment, Ogan Heller’s grand plan to completely open the orcs’ entire racial wisdom is the vast lack of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Rogge sighed. He looked at the orcs who had only the remaining heads, and the mood was quite complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller has no spouse and no descendants in his life. He has dedicated all his time to the beast and dedicated to the future of the orcs. To some extent, his paranoia and beliefs have something in common with Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man shook his head and looked back at his memory. This time. All his attention was placed on the rituals of the sacrificial beasts, the rituals of the beasts, the curses, and the tremors of the souls when the spirit of the great sacrifice touched the consciousness of the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, Rogge restarted the magical array, and the electric fire began to burn the soul of the great sacrifice. The fat man walked out of the room, closed the door, and also slammed Ogan Heller’s voice forever behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked quickly to the meditation room. Ogan Heller’s memory provided him with too much news about the goddess of nature, and he needed time to digest it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge came out of the meditation room again, it was seven days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven days are enough to happen. One of the most important ones is that Feuerbach finally led the Imperial Guards Corps into the Dro Empire and joined with Alexander and Pompey. Today, Astrafik’s army in the Dro Empire has exceeded 400,000, far exceeding the amount agreed by the Divine Agreement. But at the moment, what can the Dro Emperor say more? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach had just settled down and immediately sent the messenger to call Rogge to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge rushed from Oshini to the residence of the Imperial Army. The boss Sarah Wenger has long waited for him for a long time. Under the leadership of the boss, Rogge stepped into the temporary palace built for the Emperor Feuerbach. And Androni, who accompanied him, was not allowed to step into the imperial palace and could only wait at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as soon as he stepped into the door of the palace, Rogge was amazed and stopped involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two different worlds inside and outside the gate. At noon at the moment, the bright sun is hanging high in the air. The glare of the halo scatters in a circle and scatters the blazing sun. Bake the world outside the door. However, only one door across the palace, emitting a gloomy, humid atmosphere, the darkness of the big group is as real, from time to time will flood out from all corners, filling every inch of space here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the palace is open, but the sunlight outside the door is completely out of the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this gloomy world. Rogge suddenly felt dizzy, his hands and feet were weak, and almost fell to the ground. He was shocked and immediately gathered his mental strength to try to stabilize his body. However, the faint silver light in his eyes is very conspicuous here, like a bloody sea in the sea, attracting the darkness of the surrounding, like a shark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness contains incredible power, and they completely ignore the physical existence of Rogge. Directly invaded into Rogge's spiritual world, like a wave of heaven and earth, repeatedly washing his soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge screamed a painful scream and couldn’t stop the silver flames. The bursts of light and rain just flashed, and the darkness was immediately extinguished, and even the buzzing sounds still sounded in the future. Before the pressure of the Kuroshio. He felt that he was like a negligible ant, trying to move a thousand boulder pressed against himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling at that moment is so powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Rogge’s pressure suddenly turned light, and Sarah Wenger’s voice was weak in his ear: “Rogge, here is now In the realm of the Dark Lord God, all the resistance you are doing now is disrespectful to the Lord God of Darkness. Relax and let the darkness pass through your soul. You will find that the Lord God of God is very tolerant!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has no other way. I had to give up the resistance. really. It was just that there was a mountain of pressure and the darkness suddenly turned into a wind and a wind, and gently smashed the soul of Rogge. Then grow up and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in an instant, the fat man is already sweating, his body is weak, and he wants to collapse. He took a deep breath and finally settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara Weng nodded and praised: "The understanding of the nature of the plane and the domain of the gods by Rogge is really extraordinary. It seems that the goddess黛Reh is really far-reaching and has chosen you as her agent in this position. It is no wonder that she has been able to make such a big leap in such a short time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was taken aback, but he definitely didn’t want to draw attention to Sarah Wenger and the Emperor, so he immediately said modestly: "Sara Wenger, you are really Too much reputation. My magic is nothing compared to your strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the fat man and said it profoundly: "The size of absolute power is not the most important thing. I think you must have understood this truth already. Come with me, don't let the emperor wait too long."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sarah Wenger led Rogge into the study of the Emperor, but a ritual room. In the middle of the room, there is an altar carved entirely of black jade, and there is a group of erratic darkness above the altar. Rogge immediately sensed that the atmosphere contained in this darkness is exactly the same as the darkness that almost destroyed his spirit. The only difference is that the power represented by this seemingly weak darkness is greater than the darkness in the palace. Tens of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the darkness that almost prevents Rogge from resisting is a drop of water, then the darkness on this altar is a vast ocean that is not marginal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be surprised, what you are feeling is the power of the great dark Lord's body! In the face of the Dark Lord God, we should be humble." The voice of the Emperor from Luo Passed behind the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took his gaze from the darkness, turned and squatted, and slammed into the room of Feuerbach the Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor waved his hand and said: "You don't have to kneel down. In this room. You and I are no different, they are a negligible servant in front of the Dark Lord God." "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great stood before the altar and stared at the flowing darkness. In the heart of Rogge’s secret doubts, according to his understanding of various religions, the actions of Feuerbach’s emperor at this moment can be said to be greatly disrespectful to the Lord God of Darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach seems to know what Rogge is thinking, he smiles low and turns: "Rogge. The Dark Lord is extremely tolerant." He doesn't care if we obey the red tape of those sacrifices. As long as there is a true faith in our hearts, this is enough. I am looking for you this time to tell you something before the start of the war. Just look at you already. If you don't care about the size of absolute power, you can know that your understanding of God's kingdom is getting deeper and deeper. Knowing this will help you a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Again, I was shocked and the cold sweat rolled down. His understanding of the domain can be said to be derived from the book of Hilo, and it is only understanding, why is the Emperor and the boss always almost eager to see him? Fat people don't know if they know that they have read the book of Hilo. If you know it, that wouldn't be great. Thousand years ago, in all the records, the great elf of the war, Hilo, was placed among the gods of light. The fat man does not have to think about it, and Hilo and the Emperor believe in the relationship between the dark Lord God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor smiled and said: "Don't panic. I don't have the ability to see through your strength material, it's the darkness of the Lord God's omniscient eye insight. Your secret. The Lord God of Darkness has just lowered the gods. He has decided to join hands with O'Reilly, who you believe in, to fight against the heavens. As for the troubles that O'Reilly has encountered, it has been noticed by the eyes of the Lord God. Then all the troubles will no longer be troublesome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach’s words are too swaying, completely ruining Rogge’s consistent pride And self-sustaining. At this point, Rogge only felt confused in his mind, and he had to say it again and again. But a sentence behind the emperor suddenly touched his nerves. Rogge immediately asked nervously: "The goddess O'Reilly is in crisis? What kind of crisis is it, can the great dark god have a god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Emperor shook his head. Tao: "Since the Dark Lord decided to solve the crisis for O'Reilly, then why bother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Rogge not worry? Only since the Emperor has already said this, he can no longer continue to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge remembered again and cautiously asked: "Your Majesty, should the Holy Church should worship the Dark Lord at the same time in the future? If so, how do I Can the power of faith be directed to the Lord God of Darkness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach said: "It is time to tell you something. As you can see, Behind the Astrofic Empire is Barcelo Dimogan, one of the great gods of the darkness! Rogge, you have a pair of eyes that can see the gods, just presumably you have deeply felt that the dark god can not The power of the description. In fact, the great Basaro Dimogo's roots are set foot. It will transform itself into a kingdom of darkness that dominates everything! The power of darkness he possesses comes from nothingness, and never ends. So you don't need the power of faith at all. Continue to let your followers worship O'Reilly, and expand the number of believers as soon as possible. This is what the Dark Lord wants you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since he was on the throne, Rogge has been so excited for the first time. He doesn't even know how he returned to O'Siyah. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning of the darkness of the Lord God of Barço di Mogogen directly on this plane on the day of the decisive battle between the two sides? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps for the first time, Rogge saw a glimmer of light in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach actually confirmed what he was worried about, that is, Fengyue has always been in crisis. Rogge has some understanding of the gods, but he still knows nothing about the crisis that has already been sealed. It’s just that the Great is right. When the eyes of the Dark Lord are watching the Wind, all the crises will no longer be a crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When stepping into the Great Wind Temple, Rogge calmed down the turbulent mood. Re-seduce and begin to examine the current situation. After repeated thoughts, Rogge finally decided to do a big job. He was originally a gambler who had to bet on a gamble. It was just that the chips in his hands were too small to be completely lost, so he was willing to be a little cautious. But now that we have found the big backing of the dark Lord God Barsaloz Moggan, don't take the opportunity to do a big job. Once the opportunity is over, it will not come again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current major event is no more than the number of believers. Although the Emperor himself did not say too clearly. But the millions of victims and the power of faith to supply the wind and moon are obviously to be found in the believers of the Holy Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands in the lobby of the Great Wind Temple, watching the statue of the goddess on the altar, for a long time. At this moment, he made up his mind again, whether it was cheating or turning, or threatening to induce. He has to pull more people into the Holy Church and transform them into believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Pope standing in front of the Statue of God, the high-ranking clergy in the Great Hall of Icewind ran over and waited quietly for him. Commanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge waved, and several cardinals immediately gathered around, respectfully waiting for Rogge to order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has arranged several tasks at random, although his tone is very dull. However, the contents of those tasks have made these cardinals secretly chill. However, they dare to say more, but they can only do it separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood in front of the statue of the gods for a while before entering the back of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the empty meditation room, Rogge could not settle down anyway. In desperation, he only got the room and went straight to the room of Hughes. Do not know why. Not to discuss this old fox, Rogge always feels uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space in the back half of the Icewind Great Temple is much wider than it looks on the surface, so the residence of Xius is also very spacious, just a big one. There are more than ten meters square in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes seems to be doing nothing all day, as long as Rogge goes to him, he must have tea in the room. In the other corner of the living room, Effie holds a small hammer in her hand and stands in front of a large table, smashing dozens of gems on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge saw it, she knew that she must be practicing prophecy. It’s just that Effie’s prophecy is different from anyone else’s. The magical props used to launch the prophecy are also strange. The number of magic materials she used was not the same every time Rogge saw it. The sacred code that Constantine handed to Effie. It has long been secretly copied by the fat man, so Rogge is very clear about the principle and casting of prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man himself has no faith, even to the goddess O'Reilly, he is also disrespectful and dominates. Therefore, although the control of the fat man is superb, but if you want to cast prophecy, there is no door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But according to the Holy Code, Effie’s prophecy is like a mess, and it is reasonable to say that it is impossible to succeed. However, her predictions have a surprisingly high success rate, and almost every prediction has a response. However, perhaps because of the messy process of her spellcasting, the results of the prophecy response are mostly confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time I see Effie, Rogge always feels a little relaxed from the bottom of my heart. He smiled and sat in front of Hughes. According to the usual practice, he reached for tea. Only he got the teacup in his hand, nothing, nothing. The fat man looked up and looked at the tea cup in the hands of Hughes, which was full of steaming and sultry, and thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge indulged for a moment, he finally said something about the dark Lord God Barça di Mogogen. This time, the face of Hughes rarely condensed and asked: "Do you sense the breath of the dark Lord? How does that feel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge Oh, it reminds me of the thrilling moment when I touch the power of the Dark Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the sea, the boundless dark sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, it was slowly said: "Roger, the elf empire, there were many great elves who touched the realm of the gods. They left a lot of records about the gods. Among them, the chapter of the dark god is especially mentioned. Very few people in this plane can sense the existence of the Dark Lords. According to the Elves, Banks analysis, this is because most of the Dark Lord does not need the power of faith, so there is no agent in our plane. For the sake of man. What kind of god has been never recorded in Barcelo Dimogan, but if Feuerbach’s words are true, only his existence is enough to transform a plane into a dark plane, then he It should belong to the rank of the Lord God, and the coming of his avatar can completely determine the ending of the whole war. After all, according to the history book of the Elven Empire, in this plane, there has never been a existence that can directly confront the Lord God." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Luo Ge’s heart is set, and he said: “It’s just a million souls. It’s easy! If you can make the dark Lord’s body come, then I am afraid of anything! Of course, let go!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes thought for a moment, said: "Rogue Master, the great O'Reilly is very kind to you, but you can let her help you take this cup away from me. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed, replied: "A little thing that is so boring is that I insisted that she could do this kind of thing?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes said: "This is it. Rogge, the power of the Lord God is not what we can. This war is in the eyes of any country. It is the most important event, even in the whole plane. But who can guarantee that this plane is very important in the eyes of the Lord God? We think that the big things may be in the eyes of the Dark Lord. Insignificant boring little things. In fact, just like a king of a country will not pay attention to the struggle of small villages. Similarly, I think that the more powerful a god is, the less important we are in his eyes. So Rogge, you can't pin everything on the dark Lord, the power in your hands is the real The power that can be relied upon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded and said: "I understand. Right, Elder Chess, do you know Adelaide? Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen her early today. She seems to have left the temple with Miro. As for what to do, my old man does not know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger frowned, didn't say anything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was with a few strong men that day A deep talk, asking them to listen to their own command, as long as they won the war, everything will be said in the future. At that time everyone agreed, but the results are no different from before. For example, Adrienne and Miro leave so arbitrarily. I don't know where they are and what they are doing, and Rogge can't get in touch with them. If there is something wrong at this time, where can I count on them?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rog snorted and stood up and wanted to leave. He already knew that he wanted to let the strong man obey the command honestly, that is impossible.
