At the very moment, Achilles has already engraved the orientation of the two followers of the Church of Light in his memory, together with their strength, and their strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath of cold wind in the cold night, but always could not wave his heart. At the moment when Froya faced Achilles alone, his choice could not be said to be wrong. But he just didn't know how to face Fu Luoya in the future. Since when, this eccentric, elf fairy has occupied such an important position in his heart? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nowadays, in the gradual clear competition between the two sides, he can only play a negligible role in killing the bright church reinforcements. For those really important battles, he couldn’t get into it. Even because he couldn't understand Ark's level of fighting, he couldn't even do some preparatory work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked along the road. He stepped out every step of the way, which is a distance of tens of meters. The seemingly idle pace is like the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man doesn’t know why he believes in Achilles’s words, but he made a special trip to kill O'Reilly! But what Rogge knows is that he is also the same as O'Reilly, the same light angel from heaven, nothing more. Perhaps Achilles is invisible, quietly affecting his mind and will, if this is the case, then Rogge will recognize. His most powerful is the spiritual power. If the will is not affected by the influence of the people, then he has no rebellious qualifications. Even if it is to be alive. He should also do what Achilles said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle will be the second big magician of his frontal battle, and there is a fifteenth level with this big magister Sacred vindictive, warrior with agility and magic defense. But Rogge is not afraid. What really makes him fear is just the unknown, and all the secrets of the two visitors to the Church of Light have been exposed to him. Achilles left Rogge with something, not only the professional, vindictive and magical levels of these two men. It also includes power attributes, good at war skills, and even the attributes of all the equipment on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge doesn't know how Achilles did it. You know, many of them are the biggest secrets of a warrior or a magician, and even the closest people don't necessarily know. How did Achilles know about it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered Achilles’s glamorous red eyes that penetrated everything, and his heart trembled. The fat man finally realized from a side that a little light angel is awesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly set his mind, closed his eyes, and removed all volatility from consciousness. The battle will come, he must fight in the best condition. Face any big magician. It won't be a pleasant and relaxing thing. Even with his current physique, if he is completely in the magic of a big magister, it is likely to be destroyed. When he came along, Rogge had already developed a combat plan based on the information Achilles had given him. Of course, with his character, it is impossible to fully believe in Achilles. Naturally, he has to arrange several articles for himself. After the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge opened his eyes. Two figures have fallen in the distant sky, and one of the female mage has a faint sacred magic light. In her magical light, she also carries another warrior. When the warrior was still a hundred meters away from the ground, he jumped from the magical light, and if it fell, it fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out a long, crystal-clear sword. I don’t know what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the female magician is floating in the air. Although the distance is far away, Rogge’s eyesight can see everything. In the magical radiance, her looks are very beautiful and look like she is in her early twenties. It is unimaginable to reach the level of the Great Magister at her age. However, there are many ways to delay aging in magic, alchemy and medicine. For example, after serving the keel grass, the face of Fu Luoya will no longer grow old until a few days before her death. Therefore, the true age of the female magician is in addition to her own. Maybe no one can say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you. Why are you blocking the road here?" the swordsman asked alertly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female magician and the samurai looked at each other with a glance at each other, and their eyes returned to the sacred flame that Rogge released, and he was at a loss. The two of them have been cultivating in the bright church, although there are not many people walking outside, but they also know that the Astrafik Empire is completely occupied by pagans. When did this great empire state have become the territory of the Most High God believers? But look at the sacred atmosphere of Rogge's flames in the week, although not powerful, but extremely pure. Although the magic power of the female magician has reached the level of the great magician, but the purity of the divine magic, but not Rogge. Among the churches she knows about, there are only a few bright Masters and several high-level sacred knights who have such pure sacred power. Of course, if you say that you are beyond Rogge, then she will know one. However, that person has left the Great Temple of Light and traveled to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Mesley, he looks like a believer in the Most High God! Is he also a church person, how have I never heard that we have an empire? Domestic activities?” The swordsman on the ground asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messley in the air replied: "The church certainly has activities in Asrofik, at least I know that a cardinal has arrived in the north. Maybe All this is what he did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, her heart suddenly passed the faith that floated with countless magic symbols, Buckle on the man's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! What happened to you?" The swordsman saw her look different and asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messley replied calmly. Faintly said: "I'm fine. You ask him, who is the leader of the Lieutenant's middle-high god believers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two unanswered answers, obviously Don't put Rogge in his eyes, but he is no longer hostile as in the beginning. A common belief is the best way to build trust between strangers. Moreover, Rogge's sacred attributes do not pose any threat to them, and the magic of the 12th level of the fat man is really not strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge seems to be irritated by their contempt, so he screams. I took out a magic scroll from my arms and looked at it after opening it. Just follow the spells described above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order chain? Mesley only listened to a spell, and he identified the magic recorded on the scroll. When Rogge read another sentence, even the swordsman recognized the very common divine magic. They can't help but smile, and they are completely sacred attributes to lock them in order. What is the difference between using this one for the undead? It seems that this fat man has talent, but there is really no fighting experience. And this kind of scroll that can't be regarded as a high-order can only be launched by full mourning, then his magic control can be said to be bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messley’s heart is a move. The sacred power of the fat man is extremely pure, but the magic control is not good. This is the perfect choice for the magician! Is it really that person who taught him divine magic? Her heartbeat was a little bit rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman knew that he had been locked by Rogge, but he looked relaxed and completely unmoved, waiting for the moment when the fat man was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is getting louder and louder. It seems to be raging with anger! He finally spit out the last note, and with a cry, the magic scroll in his hand has burned to ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several chains that shine with golden light appearing out of thin air, and the swordsman can't open his mouth in disbelief, thus keeping this horrified expression and being staggered. The magic chain is locked in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog seems to be extremely confident in his magic scroll. Instead of paying attention to the effect of the chain, he looked at Mesley in the sky and began to mourn the spell of attacking magic. But obviously, he is not very familiar with this spell, and he reads it intermittently. His face is full of thoughts and expressions. It seems to be trying to remember the spell, and remembering one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messley is incredibly successful in the success of Rogge’s order chain, but the fat man’s current fireball spell is so difficult and how much Some relief. There are so many incredible things in the world of magic. Maybe the fat man is just a little better luck. Moreover, it was trapped for a while by the order chain. Will not hurt the score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t see any movements, just between the thoughts. A magical shield that absorbs the flame is shrouded in the body. The style of the big magician is undoubted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of Roger's intermittent spell, there is also a silent spell that is directly driven by mental power. In this way, a complete magic spell was split into two parts, chanting and tacit. The chanting spell sounds like a fireball spell, but when combined with the silent part, it is completely another magical spell, a magic that is enough to surprise Mesley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark sequence, this horror magic that occupies a prominent position in the entire system of dark magic, can simultaneously cause decay, disintegration, aging, and petrification in the target organism. The effect has a certain chance to ignore the target creature magic defense, especially for the creatures that use the light power. Rogge decomposes this dark magic with his superb magical control, taking only its aging effect, greatly reducing the difficulty of casting. But that's it, the difficulty of casting has reached seven steps, so Rogge who lost the alien spell and purgatory still needs to mourn the long spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fat man swears to the last spell, the Messley face that has been watching the performance of the younger disciple has finally changed, because she sensed Rogge That can no longer conceal the rich darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s spiritual touch accurately captures Mesley’s physical condition, and her slightly pale, beautiful face does not truly reflect the darkness of the order. The overall effect, inside her body, several major organs are rapidly aging, the sudden reduction in performance is not enough to support her manipulation of the magic. Therefore, Mesley's magical shield in the wild is flickering and her body will fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse of the darkness is driven away. The damage it causes to the body is also permanent, which is the horrible thing about this magic. But Rogge knows that relying on a aging effect is not fat enough. In any case, he can't let Mesley launch the magic attached to the canon of the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s left eye once again showed the dragon's eye, with a heavy mysterious power on the face of Mesili. Just looking at it, Roger’s magical light in the week is quickly diminished by the excessive consumption of magic. The fat man took a big step and ignored Messley. Instead, it rushed to the swordsman who was still tied in place, and the long blade of the shadows protruded from the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messley only felt the numbness in his body. The temperature around the head is rising sharply, and the burning scent brings an unbearable sting to her tender skin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a faint and sharp wind passed through the scorching heat and boasted on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messley flashed the pair of sly hands in front of her eyes, and her consciousness fell into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messley’s entire upper body suddenly turned into a very fine blood mist, which was carried by the wind to the distant night sky. And until this time, a group of burning viscous flames similar to the silver dragon breath, violently burned. But it can only be empty from the burning of the female magician left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s shadow long blade has been lifted high, but stayed in the air and never fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in front of him, the swordsman’s face showed a strange and mysterious smile, as if enjoying the things that make him the most happy in the world. . However, on his face, cyan, black, dark gray and dark green alternately appear, and sometimes they appear in four colors at the same time. It seems very secretive and terrifying. Not only his face, but also his neck, presumably his skin is also changing color. The swordsman was completely ignorant of his terrible changes, and his expression was finally fixed on a satisfied smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden chain is also stained with thick black, they can no longer maintain a stable magical form, and it’s a mess of messy mess. flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swordsman fell down. His body seemed to be a soft pocket, and he had begun to lose his shape in the process of falling down. When he fell to the ground, the leather pocket finally burst, and a large group of dark cyan rot was spouted! Where the rot is falling, the ground within a few tens of meters is turned into cyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge held a long shadow and looked at the front with a dignified look. The countless splashes of rot can't be close to his body, even if it falls directly on him, the sap formed by these magical waves can't help his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge has retired, he is secretly condensing the magic, ready to escape. It is the horror magic that acts on the swordsman to let him back down. That is the complete darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
