			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the eleventh chapter of the township <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chapter eleven township<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the way to the wind and rain, Rogge finally rushed back to the emperor Richelieu. After he replaced his rotten robes, he immediately went to see the boss Sarah Wenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time his energy and physical strength have reached the limit, Androni is far away from the city of the gods, so when you see the boss, it is also fat When you take a break. Because as long as Rogge is in the Imperial Palace, the wrath of the natural goddess will not occur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a remote house in the Imperial Palace, the boss, An An, sat firmly in the chair, and a pair of murky eyes looked at Rogge without expression. The dim magical flames are constantly jumping, and the dim yellow light makes every wrinkle on the face of the boss seem extraordinarily clear. It seems that the old man who has lost his age can fall to the ground at all times and sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and the boss have nothing to offer and chill. In the face of this unfathomable old man, the less you talk, the less mistakes you make. So going straight to the theme is a good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned, his mouth, spit out a large piece of dark brown moss, and the unbearable stench immediately filled the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the boss’s turbid eyes immediately have a look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his skinny hand and trembled to take over the moss. His other hand was spotted in the air, and several light balls lit up immediately. The bright light is staggered from different angles, illuminating every corner of the moss without leaving a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is a bit stunned. These light balls are not magical rays, but are condensed by vindictiveness. And it is a non-attribute temper that does not have a light-emitting function. It’s just that these vindictiveness is so condensed that it gives off a dazzling brilliance. Although this hand can't compare with the horrible test of the natural goddess of the day, it is also a rare skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, the boss has grown a sigh of relief. He looked up and slowly said: "I don't think you are willing to go to the dragon's graveyard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The keel can be taken for the emperor, and then dangerous It’s all worth it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss has nodded. He stood up and took out a black satin box. Put the keel grass carefully in. This is to sit down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a stench in the house, but this is the stench from the keel. The keel is extremely precious, and it is not something that mortals can think of. For many elderly people who are already at the end of their lives, even if they smell a little keel, it tastes good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss has indulged for a moment and finally said: "The last time the empire went out to the dark forest, the purpose was precisely for the keel grass that would only appear in the dragon's graveyard. The Emperor is ambitious, and his ambitions have not yet been completed in his youth. Of course he is not willing to sleep. In fact, the deepest part of the dark forest has a dragon cemetery. The empire has already known, but has never sent troops. This time it is possible to enter the army. The real reason lies in the cloud. The Druid of the City said that it can pray for the goddess of nature and suppress the flame tyrant that has been inhabited in the gaps of the abyss. If you want to enter the cemetery of the dragon, you must pass the territory of the tyrant of the flame. Successfully suppressed the flame tyrant, the Empire army will use the life of most soldiers to attract the attention of the cemetery guarded by the tomb, and then the strong will attack the cemetery. Take out the keel grass. Hey, but the army has not yet reached the territory of the flame tyrant. It has already suffered a lot of damage from the endless Warcraft in the dark forest. Hey! Druid can't even suppress these World of Warcraft, how can he suppress the darkness? The master, the flame tyrant in the abyss gap? The emperor was suspicious of this, so he ordered the withdrawal on the spot. I thought it would be impossible to see the keel in my lifetime."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss said such a long sentence, it seems to be a little tired, just breathe a few breaths and then asked: "I can see that your achievements in the magic of the dead spirit is not low, stunned The guardianship of the tomb of the Tomb is still possible, but what is your escape from the tyrant of the flame and crossing his territory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge: "Sa Lawenge adults, the villain's luck is better, this time the flame tyrant did not know what the reason, actually left the abyss gap. So I was able to easily cross his territory and retrieve the keel for the emperor."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was overjoyed and immediately thanked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a few bright smugglers in the room have disappeared, and the room has returned to dim. The boss always turned his eyes into turbidity. He leaned back on the back of the chair. He heard that the night wind whistling outside the window and slowly said: "Winter is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge, you can only vaguely follow: "Yes, you must pay attention to the body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss seems to have no When I heard Rogge’s words, I said to myself: “Winter is the cruelest season in the north. There is no food on the snow-covered land, and there are no grasses for cattle and sheep. Every winter, there is no knowledge on the land of the North. How many young lives have been abandoned in the snowfield, let them become the food of the snow wolf. When the spring season comes, the only major event in the tribe that wanders on the land of the North is to prepare for the next winter food. In the South, there is actually a simple reason for food killing, bloodshed and war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened, forehead It began to exude fine cold sweat. When the voice of the boss stopped, he immediately asked: "Now the imperial power is strong, as long as there is money, you can exchange it for food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, food can save lives, but gold coins can't be eaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded heavily and sighed: "But it is winter now... see Only ask for help from friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the winter, food is the first. Although there are indeed friendships beyond life, most The foundation of friendship is still built on the quicksand of interest.” The boss’s voice was low and hoarse, and he knocked on Rogge’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has been silent for a long time. Finally said: "I am too smart, I really can't think of a solution. I have to ask you to give me a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a kind of blue-backed magic on the wasteland. Wolf. In the winter, they can move thousands of miles for food and prey on the ground. If you can't find food and endanger the survival of the entire ethnic group, the wolves will fight for the position of the wolf king. The weak are eliminated. And it will become the food of other survivors. Therefore, no matter how long the winter is. How rare the food, the blue-backed wolf can always survive on the northern plains, but in a winter, the wolf king is changed a few times. Or it’s still the first one, it’s not known.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger nodded and said: “I understand. Then prey But some of my former friends may have different ideas. Their voices are still very loud."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the night comes, people will rest, The same is true of the Great. As long as the sound is not too big, you will not . Wake the Great "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; see CEOs pipe exposed a little tired, this Rogge retire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he went out, Rogge suddenly thought that he would not know if the boss would leave some keel for his own use. Compared with other smart races. Human life is often much shorter. However, the relationship between strength and longevity that is manifested very clearly in other intelligent races is completely unrecognizable in the human power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the historical record, as a sanctuary, local people can have hundreds of years of life, while others live. It is similar to ordinary people. Looks like this question, I have to ask the old fox of Xiusi in the future. This will not only help the fat man to understand more about the world of these mysterious old guys. It also allows him to have a clear understanding of the enemy's strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of Hughes, Rogge could not help but hate it. This old thing comes and comes, wants to go and leave, every day, there is no ghost. I didn't appear for a long time, and I don't know what he is doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to his residence, Rogge immediately began to handle government affairs. His trip to the Tomb was a lot of time, so when he came back, various documents, secret reports, and letters had piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned from the letter for a long time and pulled out two secret letters. One was written by Prince Kerry of the Principality of Layton, and the other was written by the Duke of Dolly. The contents of the two letters are similar. They gave a very enthusiastic response to Rogge’s request to buy food from both places a month ago. It indicates that the food is being mobilized, and it is inevitable that enough food can be transported into the Alai Principality before the end of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Rogge stepped out of the Central Mountain Range, the Principality of Alle has been in chaos. After the disintegration of the Holy Alliance and the incorporation of the Principality into the Asrofic Empire, the Bauhinia Butterfly led the rebellion in the territorial war zone and wounded the Principality. Since then, the policy of arrogance of the martial arts promoted by Auntie has mobilized a large number of young and middle-aged military training, and largely abandoned a large number of agricultural land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After successive annexation of several countries, the Principality of Aray has not only expanded its territory several times, but its population has also expanded several times. However, the war burned the earth, and the pasture and wheat were trampled by horseshoes. When the autumn harvest season approached, Rogge suddenly realized a serious problem, and his people would have to face a winter of hunger and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge actually couldn’t care about these internal affairs, but after the death of Shi Lai, the aunt who lost the child also had no government. Losing these two major boosts, the ills and ills of the old and imposing bureaucracy of the Ayre Principality were exposed, and the private party, the party reported that it did not report worries, and bullied the shackles, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severe situation of extreme food shortage is still informed by the general information of Horne to Rogge. But General Horn is capable and loyal, but he is busy laying and consolidating the intelligence network. For the Principality, this matter is equally important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the other hand, Horn is a very good hound, but not a diligent farmer, he is not suitable for government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog stood up and walked around the room with a gloomy face. Behind him, a chair quietly stretched and became a monster of more than a dozen cats. Their mouths stretched out two inches of long fangs, and they rushed to the back of Rogge in a light, silent step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly turned back and snorted, more than ten small beasts were placed on the spot, not moving! Only one escaped the shackles of magic and slammed it up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sneered a bit. Stretched into the volley and caught the beast, a force, it was torn into two! Despite this, Roger’s heart was still not vented. He strode forward, one foot, one will be fixed in the original place, the fierce beasts stepped on one by one, which calculated the bad breath in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man will be gasping. The angry heart was a little calmer. He walked over to the big map of the empire and the surrounding terrain on the wall, and carefully thought about the future situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days. Rogge was accidentally summoned to the Imperial Palace. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Maple Leaf Hall, which is famous for its late autumn scenery, more than a dozen empire’s most important powers have been sitting inside. On the throne of the central throne, Feuerbach’s emperor looked red and full of spirits, and seemed to be ten years younger. The emperor’s mood was obviously very good, and he couldn’t help but talk to the ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge entered the Maple Leaf Hall under the guidance of the waiter and sat in the lowest position. The door of the Maple Leaf Hall was closed after him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great looked around the audience. Opening the road: "Not long ago, the Duke of Frederick suddenly suffered from serious illness and died. This news has already been known to you. This time you are called to discuss the ownership of the 'tidal' legion and the strategy of the southeast front of the empire. You don't have to be scrupulous, speak freely! Alexander, let's get started!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexie thought about it and began to state the strategy of the southeastern front of the empire, he said eloquently For a long time. However, nothing has been mentioned about the ‘tidal’ regiment. Next, Pompey talked about all the strategic tactics, completely avoiding the affiliation of the ‘tidal’ regiment. After Pompey, the ministers followed suit and avoided talking about the ‘tidal’ army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ownership of the ministers, they finally got Rogge. Although the fat man wants to fight back to the South, he has not considered the strategic issues of the Southeast Front. Before Frederick committed suicide. That's nothing to do with Rogge. However, in this situation, the fat man still has to cope with it. He copied the East and West, and moved all the opinions of the people who had reached consensus before, and the right was shaken out as his own opinion. In this way, although he can't have any place to shine, he will never be ugly on this unprepared issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that everyone has been 'speaking freely', Feuerbach’s cough snorted and the Maple Leaf Hall was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 'tidal' legion is divided into two, one or two corps is placed under the command of Pompey, together with the Poseidon Corps to attack the Lusen Principality Alliance. The corps is commanded by Rogge. Then four thousand troops are drawn from the Principality of Ale. Responsible for attacking the Cypriot Principality and the Delaware Empire. This appointment takes effect immediately! Rogge, Pompeii, you each go back to prepare. You will arrive in a month. Frontline station. Just like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the faces of the ruling ministers were all wrong, but even Rogge himself opened his mouth and could not believe the order that the emperor had just given. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three major empire of the empire have been fighting for a long time, and the military is a soldier with strong fighting power. The ‘tidal’ regiment has a total of 80,000 troops, and the combat power can be imagined. Most of the special arms and squadrons of the ‘tidal’ regiment were assigned to the 1-2 Corps. From the perspective of strength, the first three corps also accounted for 50,000. But the last three corps with 30,000 soldiers are also a huge force. In the eyes of the emperors, the rookie new army in the Principality of Rogge was also assigned to the ‘tidal’ army to dig the fortress and raise the ordnance. If you really want to fight against the enemy, I am afraid that the role of the land is still more negative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Rogge also has self-knowledge. In addition to the less than 10,000 veterans in the Principality of Alei, all are recruits with insufficient training. The dark side of the moon, the Tickton warriors and the Spartan knights, together with less than 2,000 people. In a large-scale war, this amount is simply not enough to reverse the situation. Therefore, the Emperor Feuerbach gave Rogge the transfer of 40,000 troops from the Principality to the southeastern front, which was just a step for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is another layer of deep meaning in this. According to the tradition of the empire, when the squad is recruited, the munitions equipment and salaries of the recruited troops will be borne by the empire. . In normal times, this expenditure is nothing to a country. However, for the current Ayre Principality, where the treasury is empty and the granary is bottoming out, this is equivalent to spending money from the empire to help Rogge raise 40,000 troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the charcoal in the snow, Rogge can't think of a better adjective at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rogge, who is sitting in a country, is already a real power minister with a lot of empire, and now he has the most elite 30,000 'tidal' warrior, right now. Going up a step. A group of powers looked at him, and it was completely different at the moment. It was only on the face that suddenly became more enthusiasm, how deep doubts could not be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the most elite half of the empire be handed over to a surrender leader who has served the empire for less than a year? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are puzzled, but the results are unchangeable. However, these old and slick guys only looked at the results, regardless of the process. As soon as they saw the power of Rogge, they immediately changed their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey and Rogge left the Maple Leaf Hall side by side, and he said intimately: "Uncle Rogge, I really didn't expect to fight alongside you so soon." Frederick spent more than ten years not doing things, we may not be able to do it! Rogge, you must work hard on your shoulders, you must work hard! Don’t be the first to copy the Delaware Empire, "Take it off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and revealed his arrogance: "I don’t care if I am a big man!" But I will not take it lightly. But then, you Also be careful that several small Principalities in your hand fall into my hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked all the way to laughter and walked outside the palace. As soon as he arrived at the gate of the Imperial Palace, Pompey finally opened a distance with Rogera and left without saying goodbye. Rogge knew that Pompey knew that he was in the wrath of the natural goddess. As long as he walked a few more steps toward the gate of the Imperial Palace, the mysterious power of the Emperor's Palace to suppress the wrath of the natural goddess would disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Pompey is very aware of the existence and scope of this mysterious power. Beyond this power, staying with Rogge becomes a very dangerous thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the figure that Pompey had left, there was still a slight smile on the corner of the fat man’s mouth, but there was no smile in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he returned home, Rogge immediately sent a number of secret letters to the Principality, instructing the Bauhinia Butterfly to immediately complete the army, picking up 40,000 potential recruits, ready to The southeast front of the empire marched. On the other hand, Rogge sent people to the Central Mountain Range to find the whereabouts of Doolin, and he needed to determine his exploration results and whether he defected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man hesitated for a while and finally wrote the third secret letter. In the letter, the Tiketon Warrior and the Spartan Knights were prepared for war preparations. When he arrived in the Principality, he immediately went with the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is ready to return to the city of the gods and bring the elf forces together. Once these elite troops are lost, they will make him very painful. However, the poets often say that the fate of the warrior is to sleep on the battlefield. Although the ghosts of Rogge do not believe this, but if they often experience the baptism of war, the powerful army will slowly become mediocre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
