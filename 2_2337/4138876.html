			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the tenth chapter on the watch <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章十守望<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight dragon city slowly emerges from the distant horizon. Against the backdrop of the setting sun and the clouds, the silver moonlight dragon city is dyed with large pieces of fiery red and golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thin cloud, there are faintly visible figures of several dragons flying around the Moonlight Dragon City, although the phase is still far away, but occasionally blowing from the front In the wind, you can also faintly hear the dragons that are clear and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangke Bakala stopped for the first time, and the huge eyes narrowed slightly. In his dark red eyes, like the magma flowing, the image of Moonlight Dragon City was quickly zoomed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Silver Dragon, a little less awkward and restless, a little more calm and determined. Don Kebala has some doubts about his feelings, but the flame tyrant who stands at the top of the dark creature pyramid knows little about the delicate things of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two emotions he is most familiar with, one is his own anger and the other is the fear of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangke Bakala leaned down slightly and wrapped his hands around his chest, making a low-pitched squeak. In the thunderous snoring, the surface of the huge body of the flame tyrant squirmed, and the black and red hard skin could not crack, and a large piece of magma emerged from the crack of the skin. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold winds of the wilderness, the hot magma of the moxibustion just emerged and a large amount of white smoke emerged. The sky of smoke will soon be huge. The body is shrouded inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the smoke disappeared, Donk Bakala’s body was covered with a thick layer of rock. The pale blue fire tongue can't be ejected from the cracks in the rock, and their rare high temperature makes the weakest part of this rock become a trap of attack and defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangke Bakala lifted his foot. Under his horrible power, the surrounding ground was cracked, and a flame sprang up! In a twinkling of an eye, the ring of flame shield began to rotate around his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame tyrant who completed the battle preparation started again and began to approach the Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver circling in the sky noticed the arrival of the flame tyrant. In the bursting of the dragon whistle, several dragons flew out of the Moonlight Dragon City. More than ten silver dragons were arranged in a neat battle formation, hovering directly above Don Kebala. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dragon above the center of the Dragon Array caught the attention of the Flame Tyrant. It is obviously different from other silver dragons. Although the size is slightly smaller, the natural noble identity has distinguished it from the silver dragons around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred Dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the sacred dragon that almost appeared in the legend, the violent and violent flame tyrant could not help but become dignified. He looked up at the sudden emergence of the sacred dragon and secretly assessed its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a weak and sacred dragon. Obviously, any Silver Dragon warrior flying under it can easily defeat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for the first time in the life of Don Kebala, he felt some hesitation, he could not see the strength of this sacred dragon! Who will believe it. This legendary dragon power will be worse than the lowest green dragon? Although the sacred dragon is powerful in the power of the dragon, it is the strongest of the world, but even if it is only melee, it can easily deal with three or five adult green dragons. This is the minimum common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that can be said can only show that this sacred dragon has hidden its own strength, and Donk Bakala simply can't see its disguise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the testimony of the flame tyrant, this strangely small sacred dragon is flickering. Tang Ke Bakala clearly felt that the sacred dragon seemed to stay in the air, but in fact his body was constantly jumping between the world and another plane. Because of this, the general attack method is basically ineffective for it, because it is difficult for the attacker to lock its position first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the same is not afraid of fire, but Achilles is immune to fire, and the flame tyrant is fire absorption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragons are powerful, but they can really give the flame tyrant a fatal blow, only the dragon magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the old dragon king Veram is still there, with his powerful dragon language magic, even if he is fighting in the dark forest, he can completely lead the silver dragons to repel Don Kebala. But now the dragon magic power of the two wise men in Silver Dragon is far from the level of Verlam, the magic they emit. Don Kebakala can be hard to pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Nicholas is still in Moonlight Dragon City. Then Donk Bakala has long been beaten back to the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas is dead, and Verlam is falling in the duel with the unknown. In the eyes of the real strong. The world is so small. In a short period of time, the news of the two powerful silver dragons has been scattered all over the world, and naturally includes the abyss gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current strength of Moonlight Dragon City is still enough to stand out from the Quartet, but in the face of absolute power, the weakness of Yinlong has been exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just died a Verlam, how come a sacred dragon? No matter which angle you look at, the Dragon Dragon magic of the Holy Dragon will not be weaker than Verlam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Tangke Bakala on the ground knows that the sacred dragon in the sky is also suffering at this moment. Gregory has experienced countless abandoned places and travels in this world, and the understanding of space is no small feat. However, even if its strength grows ten times and eight times, it is impossible to get a near-invincible defensive posture of high-speed jump between planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is now in this state, but not active, but passive. It’s hard to be thrown away by the two masters in different planes. At least the stunned stun is a form of torture. However, from the respectful attitude and stunned eyes of the surrounding silver dragons, Gregory also received the supreme vanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The glory of the sacred dragon. Even the silver dragon that is comparable to the dragon will feel dazzling..." Gregory in pain and vanity Think about it all over the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Dragon suddenly stopped the jump between the planes and slammed into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangk Bakala, who has fought many times with the dragons in his long life, knows that this is the harbinger of the coming of the big dragon language magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war does not require any declaration of war, nor will it last for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three silver dragons swooped down, as the first wave of attack power, opened the battlefield. The dragon language magic of the two silver dragon wise men was also launched, and two small explosions occurred on the body of the flame tyrant. Several boulders flew from the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling! A few meters of lava couldn't help but screaming at the silver dragon that swooped, and a silver dragon was forced back into the sky by a piece of lava that flew in the face. On the other hand, the silver dragon, which was less experienced in combat, was scraped to the tail by a piece of lava, giving a painful embarrassment. Only the most powerful silver dragon successfully rushed to the back of the flame tyrant. He resisted the burning of the flame on the shield of the flame, and seized a crack in the rock with two dragon claws! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the angry dragon howling, a rocky armor with a radius of a few meters and a thickness of nearly two meters was peeled off from the flame tyrant! The silver dragon greeted the light blue flame in the body of Don Kebakala. A pair of dragon claws forcibly explored the body of the flame tyrant and stirred a few times. This turned around and flew off his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangk Bakala’s painful screams even shook the earth! There is a new magma in his body that repairs the huge wounds behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the silver dragon wise man dragon language magic, the silver dragon warriors fly around the Donk Bakala roundabout, always dive down from Tang Keba Grab a rock on the rock of Kara. Cranio also constantly launched Dragon language magic, but her magic power is too low, so her main task is to enhance the properties of the Silver Dragon Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Donk Bakala was busy dealing with the attacks in the sky, Ston flew. I sneaked into the flame shield. This time, his goal is Donk Bakkara's knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a sudden bang, the balance lost Donk Bakala fell heavily to the ground! For a time, all the silver dragon fighters flew down. Press the flame tyrant below, frantically destroying his huge body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence on the battlefield. The battle could have made the Silver Dragon Warriors feel dangerous at almost the same time and flew high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangke Bakala climbed up, and the lava surged out of the large and small breaks on the rock, repairing his body. Repairing the wound in battle is a way of extremely depleting energy. With the powerful power of the flame tyrant, it can't be supported several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry flame tyrant whispered the mysterious language, and his hands seemed to be lifted slowly, as if he had an invisible rock mountain between his hands. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangk Bakala's hands are a little darker for every point he raises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high temperatures that are not climbing make the scenery around Donk Bakala twisted. The earth also began to soften and melt. The wasteland is gradually turning into a boiling lava lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the flame tyrant’s hands raised above his head, the space hundreds of meters around him has turned into a dark red world. In this dark red world. A group of magma emerges from the air in a random manner, and then bursts into a pontoon of magma rain, falling into the ground that has become a boiling lava. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio silently looked at this dark red world. Although she did not understand the power of Donk Bakala, she still knew this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lava hell...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark magma hell is randomly scattered in the magma. Lava. The magma formed by the violent force of the tyrant of the flame has several times the temperature of the ordinary lava, and the drop of the invisible magma can easily burn through the scales of the silver dragon, burn the flesh of the silver dragon, and evaporate the blood of the silver dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the creatures that are completely immune to the flames, entering the lava hell is a gamble at the expense of life, and the lava that smashes in the air does not appear in the lava. Beside yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangk Bakala's incomparable anger! Lava Hell is his last resort. This horrible magic consumes the same amount of power. He can only perform once with his vast power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lava Hell is now under Moonlight Dragon City. This means that the war has come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the dragon magic of the sacred dragon in the sky has not yet been completed! Need to spend so much time to prepare the dragon language magic, once released, what is the scene? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark red lava hell, the silver dragons in the sky are all jealous. The Silver Dragon wise man tried to crack this magic with Dragon Language Magic, and tried to attack the Flame Tyrant through the Dark Red World, but all their efforts were in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame tyrant Donk Baccarat proudly stands on top of the lava. Telling the silver dragon in the sky with that thunderous commemoration, another deadly magic is about to fall on the silver faucet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is speed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the war is about to be decided. Cranio suddenly found that all his concepts about speed were overthrown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful demon lotus appeared in front of the lava world, standing in front of Don Kebala, and floating behind the flame tyrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three simultaneous appearances, clear and clear beautiful figure also subverted Cranio's awareness of power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver band that stretches for kilometers and runs through the lava hell at the same time. At the two ends of the silver band, there is a dragon soul gun with a dazzling silver light. The master of the hand and the hand of the hand holding the dragon soul gun is vague, making it completely impossible to see clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge body of Don Kebala. The silver ribbon is like a shiny silver thread. This silk thread is passing through the chest of Donk Bakala! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the time of the Moonlight Dragon City is like a condensation, and it seems to be flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All through! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the unseen Northland wilderness, Rogge took a big step and flew towards the Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is heavily involved. But every step down, it will span more than ten meters, so the fat body looks cumbersome, in fact, the speed of movement is very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the wrath of the natural goddess, Rogge did not dare to fly, and he ran faster. The more you want to improve your mental strength, the more you will be wary of the sudden wrath of the goddess of nature. Therefore, every time he steps down, he will involuntarily make a great effort, just like the wild hatred under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you on the road?" A soft voice like a scorpio came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes any man feel turbulent, just behind Roger, almost sticking with him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge continued to fly and replied: "Yes! Although it may not be too late, I still have to go and see the result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man replied while looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a pair of eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swaying red is almost drowning the whole consciousness of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are in the same direction, don't mind going together for a ride?" This time. Rogge saw the source of the soft voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two lips. It also covers all the beauty of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is a small gangster, or a heavy hand, control the power of a country to kill. Rogge’s erotic heart has never stopped. It’s just that later, he has to think too much about too much, and the hobby of lasciviousness has already been squeezed into the edge of consciousness by countless major events. Although the weight of the fat man is now in his hands, he did not dare to think about it when he was young. However, if he said that he was happy, it seemed that he was more than a broken aristocrat and a rough dancer in a tavern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Rogge is lascivious, the color of the woman who appeared quietly behind him is somewhat beyond his tolerance. He suddenly felt that it was so beautiful that it had transcended gender and time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time the stunned one went, the fat man’s heart chilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bald-headed Allure is only wearing a black robe, such as the light fingertips on the snow and the toes of the feet are a little red. She floated in the air like this, and instead of staying behind Rogge, she left only four red bands behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is like no effort, but Rogge runs fast or slow, and can't change the distance between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man no longer looks at her, just drooling forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman did not appear next to Roger and walked side by side with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's rare that anyone who meets in a desolate place is a loyal follower of O'Reilly." The bright red eyes looked at the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of the heart was easily broken, so the soft and charming voice was heard in Rogge’s ear, and it was like a thunder. The fat man only felt that the palm of his hand was all cold sweat, and the meat on his face shook involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been courageous and secretly tempted the mysterious woman around her, but only saw...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blooming Red Sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is my glory to be able to work for the goddess. I have seen her miracles more than once, and naturally there will be a firm belief. What's more... ... not to mention she is still so beautiful." Fat man replied honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it turned out to be the same. The glory of Auchen Reich is so beautiful and obsessive. In fact, I am also her faithful believer. However, I am still Her friend. The person who meets can actually have a common belief. This feeling is really good. Um... Since you are so faithful to your faith, will O'Reilly give you a reward?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
