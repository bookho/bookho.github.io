			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death, the abandoned land in the mouth of Weina, has been deserted a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings are hiding in the depths of time and space, falling into a state of semi-slumbering, and the land is no longer prosperous. In the era of prosperity in the world of death, groups of undead creatures are wandering everywhere, and fighting for the sake of strength is always alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the world of *** growth, a world of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the world where Bone Dragon grows and grows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the kings of the dead world, the length of the bone dragon is undoubtedly extremely fast. But Gregory's wisdom grows far beyond its power. After the rebirth of the world of death, it became a great joy, arrogance and ruthlessness when it turned into a dragon, and became cautious and careful. Everything was aimed at the owner's favor. The arrogance and conceit of the dragon is born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory holds most of the memories of past lives. According to common sense, the character of past lives should also be preserved. However, the transformation of its character is so natural, so natural. Especially arrogance, this is the deepest thing that exists in the soul of every dragon, and it is the trait of the dragon that occupies the top of the pyramid composed of various species. But now Gregorian is not only arrogant in front of the two masters, even the dignity can not be taken care of, even can be said to be disregarding shame, as long as the two masters I am happy, but I am not shameless, I am afraid that there are too few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon does not know why this change will occur. Maybe under the pressure of survival, anything is possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time of memory, the bone dragon has a feeling that it seems that no matter which direction it is flying, the wind always blows in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind whispers through its bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon looks down on the earth. The peaks are still tall and straight, and the bones of the prehistoric behemoths are still scattered all over the earth, allowing later people to think about the unimaginable huge body of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the world of death is now quiet. When the earth is empty, how can I do it, and I can't see an undead creature. Gregory actually knew that he could not find anything because the owner of Wella was flying slowly thousands of meters above it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lines on the Weina demon battle armor are always flashing. Bone Dragon knows that every flash will have an invisible ripple that will not be weakened until far away. This ripple is fatal to any undead creature, it directly vibrates the soul of the undead, and extinguishes these very fragile flames a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current world of death really took its name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the wind of the world of death, Gregory smelled a sense of loneliness, and it suddenly felt a bit of sadness. If ever, it will certainly delight in this new change. Having emotions is the hallmark of its wisdom growing again. But now, it just tastes the faint sourness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind hits, and the bones that are losing their spirits are caught off guard. It struggled to flap the wings, and it was hard to restore balance in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, what's wrong with you? Can't you control the Holy Power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory immediately said: "The divine power is a truly noble force. Only the truly powerful people who are high above can control it freely. And I am just a bone dragon who has just embarked on the road of salvation. If you can master this now, A powerful and powerful force, that is your embarrassment to give me this power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and didn't need to flatter! Now the divine power is equal to hard being on you. As for how to convert your whole body and strength into divine attributes without damaging your soul, I have not thought about it. If you can control your body freely now, then it is strange. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones of the bones have finally controlled the body, stretched the wings, and steadily glided forward in the wind. Its four thin wings have been Weina took it and replaced it with a pair of fleshy wings with a soft creamy white color.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is the appearance or the strength contained in it, Bone Dragon is extremely satisfied with this new fleshy wing. Although the sacred power is not as good as the gloom of the starry spirit in terms of attacking attributes, this power is almost omnipotent. This is not the starry temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the divine power will undoubtedly conflict with the death energy of the bone dragon itself. These powerful forces from Wella will easily destroy everything Gregory favors the attributes of death and darkness, including strength, body, and the fire of its soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena's solution strategy is to separate the two energies of Gregory with a pure energy barrier, and then slowly seek to transform the soul of the bone dragon. Way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the soul is sublimated is the real salvation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was once integrated with ***, Wella always couldn’t understand how *** used the power of sacred and death to be integrated and used freely. All her wisdom is in combat. For other fields, she is not good at the body. Death and divine power are equally powerful, complement each other, and there is no conflict. However, each test of Wella on the bone dragon ended with the sacred power almost destroying all the death energy of the bone dragon. In the process, the bone dragon is of course tortured to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creatures that originated from darkness and death, and the pain they suffered when they came into contact with the divine power, Rogge had a deep understanding of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina was really unable, and finally had to savagely set up a simple energy barrier with her own power, forcing the sacred and death forces to be forcibly separated. This is only a temporary measure, and the energy barrier is constantly under impact and will slowly weaken. Every time, Vera had to add energy to the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Gregory, a small life is equal to the hands of Weina. When Weiner stopped adding energy, the end of the bone dragon arrived. Of course, Wella wouldn't think of this aspect at all. If Bone Dragon dares to betray her, then she will not find a place to hide. But the clever bone dragon adults would rather think of the bad things, even if the other party is the light angel Weina, you must first guard against it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in order to eliminate the aftermath, the bone dragon is desperately trying to find out how to make a big shot of Winner’s flattering, so that she can try her best to transform herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a sacred dragon, although Gregory can no longer return to the devil world, to see the people of the demon dragon, but unprecedented power and prestige The degree is enough to compensate for the vain soul of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If *** or Rodriguez sees the results of Wella's transformation of the bone dragon, it will certainly be a big surprise. Although Wei Na is not very good at shaping the soul, she can create sacred energy out of thin air in this dead world, and let the divine energy be stable in the space filled with negative power, and can also use the bone dragon, which is difficult. It is no less than Rodriguez created the *** with the origin of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, in the recognition of energy, power and space, light angels have a unique advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena and the bone dragon slowly move forward in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the far horizon, the starting point is a spark. Bone Dragon knows that this undead is not burning and is burning under the endless power of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the increasingly ‘clean’ world of death, Bone Dragon felt a bit sad again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly said: "I found them. Do these cowards think that hiding in multiple parallel spaces can escape my search?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon mask of the demon lotus mouth, spouting a small ball of light consisting of wireless tiny gold wires. The ball of light flies forward, and the golden thread of a strip extends instantly to hundreds of kilometers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, countless golden threads have plowed all the parallel spaces. In front of Wella, a faint light ball slowly emerged, and in the light ball, the hall of the Lich Elgara was faintly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only remaining kings in the hall are slowly waking up. At the last moment of judgment, they were very calm. From the day they became kings, they knew that Judgment Day would always come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four kings stood side by side in the square in front of the main hall, looking at the far-field sky with a dazzling golden glow of Vena, all without yielding. The fire of the longest life has been hiding for nearly 10,000 years, and the Bone Emperor and the Lich have also experienced thousands of years to avoid the heavens. But at this last judgment moment, they must stand at least in front of the judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though they have lived through humiliation for a lifetime, the final dignity is not tolerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really envy the Ninth Knight..." The black warrior emperor suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings are silent. They certainly understand the meaning of the Emperor of the Black Warrior. At least the Ninth Cavaliers were gloriously destroyed in the decisive battle with the ***, and what about them? Now I can only wait for Verna’s trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aelgra's spells also limit the power of all kings while hiding the hall in multiple space labyrinths. And the power of Wella is far beyond their understanding, she can find the location of the hall in the multi-space maze, and the hall together with the space to seal it out to extract the space maze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current kings are like caged birds, and Wella does not have to fight at all. Just put a sacred fire under the cage and you can easily destroy it. These four kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina does not directly imprison four kings, it will be a very difficult battle, she chose to confine the space of the seal temple, so only cast This magical Elgar can directly confront her. The Lich has tried to unblock the space several times, but the space around it has not responded at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, space is the most loyal powerist. Whoever has the power and rules is more thorough, and whoever has the power to use and control the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina smiled coldly and the prison gun was lifted high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead cloud of the entire world of death is slowly rotating around the prison gun, and one after another large pale gold lightning falls from the clouds, on the ground. Hit a huge pit. The tip of the prison rifle began to light up a little bit, and the pruning guns were shaking slightly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tremor of the prison gun, the entire world of death begins to tremble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Wella will throw out a ruling that will destroy everything, and destroy the space that seals the four kings directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mad thunder represents the highest skill of the Light Angel, which even incorporates the characteristics of many judgment lights. The ruling of the ruling will directly erase the mark of the existence of the target. Although the power of the singularity is not as good as that of the other skills of the singer, it is the best way to deal with the heresy. In particular, many heretics are masters of magic and soul, and it is difficult to completely kill or destroy them by ordinary means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina Master, etc..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory faint voice The moment of the storm is so insignificant, just like a bird in the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its voice is so great, because at this moment in the entire world of death, this is the only discordant voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to betray me?" Weina was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon looks up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Wella is like a golden sun, illuminating the entire world of death, and the bone dragon can barely see a little demon in the golden light. In the golden brilliance of the swaying, the bones of the bone dragon are smoldering with blue smoke, and only the fleshy wings of a pair of sacred dragons are uploaded to create a comfortable feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The owner of Wella is for your sake!" The bone dragon was already scared to faint, but still insisted on trembling the sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted and waited for it below. This is still the first time she used such a huge force in the world of death. It really felt a little hard. The stronger the sacred power, the more she sees that this bone dragon is not pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon did not wait for the ruling of a ruling in the expectation, finally the shock was a little bit, trembled and said: "Because after killing them. Lonely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wella asks: "Lonely?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, lonely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon Although Wei Na is only a few tens of meters apart, it looks up and can only see the strong golden light coming on the way. In this golden brilliance full of sacred atmosphere, Gregory has the possibility of disintegration. But it did not know where it came from, the courage to actually talk to Wei Na. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, you have destroyed almost all the undead in the abandoned land, and now there are only these four kings in the abandoned land. They are weak in the past, But after all, they have powerful power. In a way, they can understand your thoughts, your realm better than I. If you destroy them, then you and me will be left in the entire abandoned land. I am just A stupid bone dragon, I don't know when power can reach the realm of the king. At that time, if the world is long, you don't care about the followers and servants, but you can't always have an opponent, or even a person who can understand you. There is no loneliness in existence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harshest punishment in heaven is not destruction. For angels, destruction is nothing more than a process of returning to the source and regenerating again. The most severe punishment of the heavens is to be sealed in a space of emptiness and experience the eternal death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Wella, a near-eternal existence, loneliness is indeed her most fearful punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the enthusiasm of the bone dragon, how many times have returned to the ass: "With the owner, you are unparalleled and crowned all levels." Beauty, wisdom and strength, how can you not have an opponent and at least understand the edge of your realm? Are you afraid that some of them will one day threaten you and become your opponent? The monarchs are unyielding. Will, now, has finally had the courage to take some responsibility, but their wisdom is too limited, and it looks so ugly, how can it have the same strength as you! If the world can succeed by hard work, then no Stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon is inexplicable, the incomparable flattering seems to have a sentence that tells the heart of Wella. She was stunned for a moment, thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory worriedly looked at the tip of the prisoner's gun, and did not mess with it, and even dared not disturb Weiner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now its owner suddenly fell into meditation, but the ruling on the tip of the prison gun is not a joke. The more the bone dragon looks at the gunpoint, the more afraid it is. So close to the gunpoint, the possibility that the ruling of the ruling falls on its head is too great. It was even more afraid of something that disturbed Wella's thoughts. Her hand trembled and the ruling of the ruling was a bit too high. It is very likely that she would give the bone dragon a ‘salvation’ on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has begun to regret not to be nosy. Willa’s loneliness let her go lonely, wasn’t she more likely to destroy herself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Wella’s eyes suddenly opened. Her hand trembled, and the ruling thunder screamed at the bone dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that the bone dragon is so close to destruction. Its fragile soul could not bear the horror and finally fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, the bone dragon woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned over and screamed: "I am born again? I can be born again under the ruling of the ruling. My Gregory is really wise." The memory that is too great is preserved! Where is this, the devil, or the heavens? I am the dream of the Gregory adult to become the king of the dragon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The bone dragon looked up and saw the innocent land, the sky of the lead color forever, and the quietness floating in front of it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon is planted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina reached out and the bone dragon was set in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon Cry is a little bit, look around, this is the world of death has long since restored peace. The ruling of the ruling did not know where it disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly said: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon just had a loose heart, just listened to Wella: "You just said the real thoughts in your heart." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape, or not?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clever bone dragon has a heart and tamed to stay in front of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina gently smiles Gregory, you are a very smart bone dragon. However, for the first time, I saw a bone dragon that would be scared! Haha! When it came to later, Wella couldn’t stop it anymore, and the crisp laughter fell from the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone dragon heart is loose, knowing that it has passed Guan. Being ridiculed by the master of Weina is not a shameful thing, it can even be regarded as a kind of glory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tries again and asks: "Weina master, those What about the king? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's let them go! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed softly and said: "I am not afraid of loneliness, but even those weak kings can regain courage, and I am again." What are you afraid of? The coming, always come. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, what are you talking about, how can I not understand? With your beauty, wisdom and strength in all levels, what are you afraid of? At least my limited wisdom is unimaginable. It’s just that all the kings in the abandoned land are together, not your opponent! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly said: "Gregory, you don't know the origin of the abandoned land." Once I find a way, I will try to get rid of the shackles of this world. Don't worry, I promised to redeem you and will take you away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory wants to say, 'Don’t bother you, I’m staying here very well.' But this sentence is rolling around. Go, after all, not the courage to say it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina slowly closed her eyes and stood silently in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, what are we going to do next? "We have been in contact with Weina for a long time, and the nature of the bone dragon has been committed little by little.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you waiting for?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for those who should come." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon doesn't know what it is supposed to be. It feels that Weiner's mood is a bit strange today, so I dare not ask more questions, just bored and Weina waited together, waiting for those who should come.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the bone dragon suddenly appeared that his two front paws did not know when it turned red. It feels very strange, and when you look closely, your body has turned red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks around, this is not just yourself, the whole death The world has become a red world. This red light comes from the clouds in the sky, when the clouds of the entire dead world are burning!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One golden The light suddenly radiates from the distant clouds, just like a golden sun hidden behind the burning clouds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone dragon looks at the distance with awe Clouds, it pre-feels what big things are going to happen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more golden rays are transmitted from the clouds Then, after a bang, the lead clouds of Half the Sky are burned out, revealing the dark, starless and moonless sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the bone dragon Once I saw the sky of the world of death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon suddenly opened his mouth and couldn’t move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the emptiness of the night sky, there is a door that shines with a soft golden glow of up to 100 meters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gate of Heaven!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the door of the heavens swayed the soft golden light of water, and the golden gate was added to the gate of the heavens, extending to the bottom of the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina master, who is coming? Am I hiding first?" The bone dragon trembled as he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly said: "I don't know who will come. If you can't hide, just stay here!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious music sounds, coming from the door of the heavens in all directions, seems to be welcoming the sacred existence that is about to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gate of Heaven is finally open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of Heaven has just opened a gap, and countless shining little angels swarmed out from the cracks of the door, and could not fly around the gates of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door of Heaven was half open, the two angels flew out of it and stood on either side of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon looked up and looked into the door of the heavens. Except for a dazzling glare, it could not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gate of Heaven is finally fully opened, and a giant of up to 100 meters steps out of the door in a thunderous pace! The large ladder was like a narrow path in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants slowly descended under the two angel-like angels. The bone dragon seems to see that the golden ripples of the extremely light and pale roads are not scattered from the giants, and have disappeared far away. These golden ripples are transmitted through the bone dragon without any hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is stunned, and his soul, thoughts, and even memories cannot be hidden under these golden ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant stood on the final step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this position, Wella is just able to look at him. It's just that the giant's finger is much larger than Wella. In contrast, Wella is just like a flying insect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant seems to be staring at Wella, the golden flame in his eyes squirting a few meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Giant finally spoke up: "Dear Lord O'Reilly, you are here too. It seems that your mission is not going well."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant's spiritual volatility with an unspeakable breath almost scatters the soul of the bone dragon. The clever bone dragon immediately mobilized the divine power on the flesh to wrap himself tightly, even if it was not enough control and caused damage to the body, it did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is cold and succinct: "Dr. Tairedes, don't underestimate the dangers that face different planes. I have encountered many unexpected problems. It will appear in this abandoned place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant nodded the angel to adapt to the different planes of combat ability is God personally endowed. Although the history of your creation is very short, I have no intention of questioning your ability. My duty this time is simply to investigate what happened in this abandoned land, which will lead to the destruction of the patrollers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wena said: "The respected Teraides, in the past, had the predecessor that the patrol was destroyed." It is customary for a few low-level angels to clean up the abandoned land. Why is this time coming from you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry Dess Road: "Fulian Mille felt a little uneasy, so he specifically designated me to investigate this abandoned land." Master O'Reilly, I am going to start work. You know, the princess of the main squad, Frye Mill, has always been patient. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is cold and cold: "Dearly, Master Terredes, you don't have to investigate." The patrolman here has offended me and has been ruined by me. I have also cleaned up this abandoned land, and then I will continue my mission. You will return to the Fleminger! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terredes's gaze once again fell on Wina. The fruit patrol really offended you, then you really have the power to dispose of him. But I I can't return to Frye Miller in this way. I will investigate everything that happened in the abandoned land, including you. Since the things here are related to you, the Austrian Heavenly Earth, I have no right to dispose of it. Report everything to the Fleminger and ask him to make a ruling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Tyredes is still not fluctuating, just as I don’t realize the threat of Wella: “The dear O'Reilly, the light angel has no godhead, but the fighting ability is still on the angel. I have no intention to challenge you. But I must complete my investigation. All the disputes that have arisen, the Flemish Mills will make a decision together with the Tillamis,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Na is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terredes' golden eyes lit up, and another golden ripple spread from his body, covering every corner of the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terredes suddenly looked to the side of the bone dragon, Reich adults, you have collected a dark evil bone dragon as a follower! This is a felony! But as a high-ranking angel, you have the ability to have the highest gods and cannot be regarded as ordinary angels. If you destroy it now, then this sin can be eliminated. Or you can give it to me, it's the same. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena is still silent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory suddenly said: "Vena Master, I will let them deal with them, you should not be embarrassed. Master, you have done too much for me! "Bone dragon flutters the flesh and wants to fly to Teraddes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its flesh is taken a few times, still it is still moving, it has already been Weina is locked in there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stared at Thaledes: "Although it is a skull dragon, I have promised to give it redemption. I am gradually transforming its body and soul. Don't you feel this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terredes shook his head: "Respected O'Reilly, only the transformation of the soul can constitute salvation." But the soul of the skull dragon is still full of darkness. I can't see a little light and sacred place at all, so the reason you said is not true. Salvation is the scope of Isaac's adults, and the Tirah the Great you belong to has no right to redeem the fallen soul. Master O'Reilly, your current behavior has violated the order of the heavens. It seems that Fleminger has foreseen this, so he will send me. Now, I will thoroughly investigate your actions to determine if you have other crimes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina no longer speaks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terredes suddenly said: "Olympic You are a fallen man! I saw arrogance, vanity and conceit! In order to eliminate the avatars produced by the origin of God, you have committed a series of sins, which is completely the act of putting the cart before the horse! Any of these sins is enough to cancel your consciousness and return you to the original form! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly said: "I know that I should complete the fusion of God's origins by erasing myself and my avatar." In this way, Otto Reich will be reborn in the heavens and continue the unfinished mission. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry Deers said: "It should be!" Wait, what I saw again! This is oh! O'Reilly, your avatar has created his own religion and dared to accept the faith of believers, and you have used the power of faith without authorization! This is God's restricted area! O'Reilly, come back to heaven with me, you will make atonement for yourself in the eternal loneliness! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed and thought: "Can't you still avoid it?" **It’s killing you...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two angels have flown over and under the direction of Tereders. Na's left and right.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina calmly said: "Terrides, everything I do is to continue the existence of my consciousness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terredes said in a voice without any feelings: "O'Reilly, you have one more sin, greed!" Of course, the new sin will not increase your punishment, and the punishment you will accept is already heavy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is indifferent: "Terrides, although the original God I have is not complete, but you think that you only rely on these two lowest orders." Can an angel take me back to heaven? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terigerus is furious, and the golden flames of the week go straight into the sky of hundreds of meters!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey Rey, do you want to abandon God's radiance and completely fall? ! "The invisible shock wave of the giant roar even destroyed several peaks!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the action of Wella, the door of the heavens has a loud roar, and it has slowly closed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrydes roaring roars still echoing in the air, and Wella’s figure has appeared behind the angel on the left. She grabbed the wings of the angel and tore it off without difficulty! The angel struggled in the air, and the silver flame never came out of his body, eventually bursting into a silver fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another angel raised a burning sword and wanted to rush to save his companion. But at this time, the back of the Weina demon lotus armor is full of wings, and every golden stripe has a dazzling golden light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this golden light, the angel is not only unable to move forward, but is struggling in pain. The golden light, like life, can not lead to the silver flame in its body, and eventually this angel burst into a silver fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teralds stepped up and came to the gates of heaven. But no matter how hard he works, he can't open the door to heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden light radiated by Wella is more and more dazzling, and even has suppressed the light of Teredes! In the light and flame, a huge golden figure that does not lose to Teraddes gradually takes shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge angel with full armor, and the huge light wing that is nearly 100 meters wide is slowly fanning. The prison light rifle in her hand is also up to 100 meters long. The dark space of the hollow part of the gun tip is no longer a void, but it contains a terrible energy storm, which makes people feel fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Terrides, you can't go." Wella was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrides turned and slammed and punched Wei Na! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waina Prison Gun has pierced his chest with a wave of it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrides’s last angry snoring is endless, and I don’t know how many peaks of the world of death have shattered! However, his body gradually shrinks and gradually decomposes, eventually turning into a huge and complex golden symbol of ten meters high, which is slowly swirling in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead cloud of the world of death reconverges, slowly hiding the door of the heavens behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, only the golden symbol of the golden is still spinning. Wella has restored her original form and stood in front of the golden symbol. She reached out her hand several times, but hesitated and took it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy, the bone dragon has recovered a little rationality from the shock. Its attention is immediately drawn to the golden symbols of the air. Gregory gaze at it, and now the golden symbol seems to be made up of countless tiny singular characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the bone dragon wants to look forward to seeing it, but this symbol contains the supreme majesty, it is simply inaccessible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina Master, what have you just done? You killed a god?!" The bone dragon's voice trembled, and his mind was nearing a stop. Not to mention the ability to shoot enough level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed: "Terrides has a godhead and field, but he is only a servant of the god of order, kill him and It is not difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the symbol he left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Teradides's imprint of God, which records his field abilities and insights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon is now for 'field', 'magic' The vocabulary is extraordinarily sensitive. It looks at the golden symbols with awe. He asks: "What kind of domain ability is the master of Wella?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the field's ability has moved, it is aware of all the events and consequences that are generated within the scope of the ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it doesn't sound very useful, but in any case, got this, You also have a godhead? God, are you not a god? And with a god as the master, then I will become a servant of Gregory!"<br /><br /> & Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessively excited bone dragon can no longer control his mouth: "What are you still hesitating? Are you afraid of punishment from heaven? Anyway, your punishment is no longer heavy." One more sin and one sin is not the same..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
