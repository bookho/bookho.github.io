			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;盛世年华章章十下下</br/><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war has passed, and silver has once again become the frozen North The color of dominance. No matter how much seawater is lost, Wanli Bingyang always has enough water to supplement it. It’s just that the whole icy ocean feels a lot quieter at the moment, and all the souls that have been affected in the First World War will not leave even the soul fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean surface has been frozen, and new ice peaks are growing slowly. In a few years, or decades, this vast icy ocean will again Become the same as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery is changing at the extreme heights above the icy ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top here is the darkness of nothingness, the stars are no longer flashing, and the blue moon is clearer. Below, it is the dark gray under the night. At the end of the horizon, there is a bright light, which is a sign that dawn is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stood on the dividing line between the sky and the earth, and looked at the morning light in the distance. Her sculptural face was full of confusion, letting the morning light creep up her hair, and another way down, slowly passing her eyebrows, her nose and her lips, and finally with gold Glorious paving the face of her peerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s blonde hair suddenly flutters, and if it falls like a golden morning glow, the sound is as floating as the sky: 'Fengyue, I think of Many memories lost in the heavens. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon are caged in the chest sleeves, their eyes are drooping, and they are floating far from Weina. She faintly replied: ‘The memory you picked, I will naturally share. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed softly: ‘Achilles, he’s really a stupid guy. I always thought. He was just another tool created by the great Tiratemis, but he did not expect that he was the same as me. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has been silent for a long time, and said: ‘I think that the mistake was made by Tiratemis. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina shook her head and said: ‘The great Tiramis is far away. It is not what you and I can think of at all. What's more, if he didn't make a mistake as you said. How could you possibly appear with me? '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But I still don't quite understand... 'Fengyue frowns: 'The memory you have regained is too little, so I can't take it anymore. Sketch out the outline of a sketch in heaven. It seems... the more we know, the more we find our ignorance. I can't understand why Achilles doesn't bring all your memories. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina sighed faintly and said: ‘Feng Yue, you have not shared my experience in heaven, so you naturally don’t understand. Every angel leaves the heavens. They will leave their memories in the heavens, leaving only the necessary memories and their mission. The power of Achilles' choice is completely different from mine. I am pursuing the perfect balance between various forces, and he chooses to push several forces to the extreme. He thus gained a unique form of existence that can no longer depend on the body of each plane to exist independently. And I still have to come to the ability to stabilize in this plane. But no matter how special the form of Achilles exists, he cannot violate the rules of heaven. So when he left the heavens, he could not bring his memories. All he can do is to awaken my memory of heaven through my own way of existence. So you see the ground. It will be such a messy memory fragment. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Achilles has done a lot for you. ‘Wind Moon Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Yes, he can’t do more. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘However, his choice of power is not wise. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wena seems to be immersed in memories, she smiled slightly and said: ‘From the beginning of creation, there is a difference between me and him. If he also chooses the route of balance of power. That is a little better than my hope. I also understand now why he suddenly changed the way he fought and turned to extreme power. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Wella slightly stretched her body and said: ‘When he changes his strength, he will challenge me every time he comes back. Of course, he never won. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Do not. He chose to annihilate all his consciousness. Reduction becomes the most original form of energy. From then on, in any sense. Achilles no longer exists. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From now on, between the most perfect light angel and the most extreme light angel, all the entanglements are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Wena, how are you going in the future? ‘Wind and ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina greeted the morning sun, and suddenly smiled and said: ‘Everything is gone, no matter how hard we try, we can’t make the river of time flow back. I am prepared to receive all the power of the goddess of nature in this plane, and give myself a look of God. Can't always make you so proud! When I got the goddess of the natural goddess, I see how you will explain to your followers the battle between you and me in the future. Is it a repeated defeat or a repeated defeat? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue also smiled slightly and said: ‘Maybe I should beat you a few more times now. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning light has passed the entire ice ocean. Weina bathed in the morning light and said: ‘Feng Yue, what about you, what are your plans for the future? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I? ‘Wind Moon silver eyes slowly open, said: ‘I saw some very... shocking things from the memory you wake up. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly said: ‘You also saw it? I don't understand their meaning now, but... I am only afraid. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I’m the same. ‘The windy month nods: ‘So I think, maybe it’s time to check out a guy who is very courageous. Waiting for him to have enough courage, I don't know when it is! ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at the wind and the moon, some unexpectedly said: ‘Feng Yue, how do you understand this? I saw more than 2,000 books and I felt that something was clear. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy eyebrows wrinkled slightly and said: ‘I don’t understand anything! I just feel that I should go see him. Although I am able to sense all his activities here, there is no difference between seeing him personally. But I don't know why... I think there seems to be something different in this. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘This is of course different! ‘Weina immediately said. But she thought about it. I can't think of any difference. She felt that the reason could not be imagined, perhaps because the book was too little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning light occupied the earth, the darkness would retire. Wanli Icefield has ushered in a new day, a completely different day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new day, there is no floating city, there are no powerful souls that once existed here. There is no such a red flower that is overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this early morning, when Rogge sneaked back to his home. The middle of the big government is still quiet. The early servants were careful to do their own work, because they knew that the two beautiful and mighty hostesses in the government were the masters of sleepy, and at this time, they always had a strong temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes that have been turned upside down last night are really meaningless for ordinary people who are camping for daily food and clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog is full of heart. Going all the way, I didn’t pay attention to the fact that there was a line of magical energy on the ground, and I stepped straight on it. Although the magical fluctuations were extremely weak, it still caused Rogge's vigilance. He slightly distinguished the magic fluctuations š conduction direction, the heart moved, I wanted to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Dead fat, since you are back, come in! ‘The voice of Froya came from the room. It seems that she also did not sleep for one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man hesitated for a moment, finally pushed her door open and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria has put on a casual dress, leaning against the sofa, and flipping through the "Side Meditation" that can't be finished. . From her calm face, she couldn't see any strangeness. It seems that last night almost killed her. It was just a nightmare of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Floria...” Rogge sat down beside her. I don’t know what to say for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge nodded and said: ‘It’s still easy. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is still reading the meditation of the plane, only licking the fat man under the long eyelashes, said: ‘You are amazing now! Killing a big magister is actually so easy. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man shook his head and said: ‘I’m just a trick. Killing an undefended big magician is no more difficult than killing an unsuspecting magic apprentice. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin does not lift the ground: ‘How is your words exactly the same as the elders of Hughes? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fat man, said: ‘His? What did he say? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘It’s like this. When I came back, I went to ask him if you would deal with the big magician alone, and he would give me such a sentence. And let me feel at ease waiting for you to come back. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s heart moved and stretched out. Gently held the hand of Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblins finally raised their heads. Looking at Rogge: ‘What? Not ready to send me to Miro? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I’m...” Rogge didn’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin suddenly smiled and reached out. Caressing the fat face, said: ‘Do you remember when we were together? At that time, I am afraid that I just want to play with me. Well, I was still able to pass the magic and can help you. This should also be a factor. And now? You will be jealous because you put me in danger, I should be happy. What are you nervous about? '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But Miro...'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He is of course better than me, just He is late. ‘Floria Lee landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled, and his heart was gone. He really likes Fu Luoya, who usually has a variety of styles and changes, and when he is in a big event, he is simply and neat, and he is determined to break his character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he hasn’t finished laughing yet, Froya said again: ‘Dead fat, don’t be too happy too early. There is something you can do for me. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet waiting for Rogge to ask, this little goblin said: ‘I want to see Adrianne, you can find a way. If you are not convenient, then I am going to find Miro myself! ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge went to the room of Hughes again. His mood was stirred up by the ups and downs, and it was slowly calmed down all the way. Every time I saw Fu Luoya, there was always a way for the little goblin to lead him to flirt and anger, and suddenly he was worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, the smile on the face of Froya has dissipated, and a pair of blue eyes looked at the morning light outside the window, and I was very worried. For a long time, she sighed infinitely and infinitely, and said to herself: 'Froya. No matter which of them is in the middle of the two, you... you can't win the land! ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed and began to look at the meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge pushed in, Sius and the Death Class were sitting opposite each other, all of them were heavy. When the fat man glimpsed, he did not know when the death class ran back to Richelieu. The Death Class saw Rogge and just sighed heavily. The trail went out of the house and did not say hello to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the back of the death class somewhat strangely. Xius saw it. Dao: ‘He’s now being rolled in. It’s already awkward. It’s estimated that the plan to retire a quiet day is so ruined, and the mood is naturally not good. Don't care about him, who can't let him even have an artifact! ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Artifact? No wonder. ‘Rog shook his head and sat down. He looked at Hughes. After a long period of indulging, I said: ‘Elder of Hughes, the condition of Master Wenner is very bad. I think he can't support it for a few days. Do you have any way? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed: ‘Roger, you still look at life in the eyes of the standard Necromancer! The soul of Wenner has long been torn apart, and at this time, perhaps only the gods can save his existence. This matter has already exceeded our capabilities. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘All her gods are concentrated on destruction. Rather than saving lives. Moreover, this matter is also beyond the scope of her strength. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded and said: ‘Elders of Shusi, you know that it’s not that much. But I don't want to explore the source of your knowledge. I just want to see what you have been talking about, can you? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes was taken aback. Road: ‘Why do you suddenly want to see the elves? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: ‘I hate the feeling of powerlessness now. I can't always wait for the enemy to come to the door, I must do something. I know that power is not available out of thin air. But wisdom can make up for the lack of power. If properly planned, a low-level swordsman can easily kill an unguarded big magister. I need wisdom, true wisdom. So I want to read your elf story. '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes didn’t say anything, just pulled out a beautifully booked book from the shelf and slowly said: 'Anyone who wants to master the fate, All have to pay a heavy price. With the wisdom to understand everything, the final outcome is eternal pain. Do you have this determination? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has nothing to say: ‘Is the price I paid now less? ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes nodded and gently stroked the thick hand of the hand. For a long time, I said: ‘This is a collection of elves... It’s actually the root of all the tragedies of the elves. Although you have the determination to pay. However, there is no ability to read it. But if you don't let you see it, you must not be willing to give up. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes put the book right in front of Rogge and slowly said: 'When reading it, remember to be humble, when your hand is on the book, what you touch, actually It is the realm of the gods. ‘<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently stroked this thick book by the cover of Mithril. At the touch of his fingertips, his entire soul shook a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that at this moment, the country where the gods are located, and the kingdom of the gods, has pulled a corner of the curtain in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s spirits seem to have seen a world full of prosperity, exquisiteness, complexity and beauty, a variety of floating cities in the sky, in the sky The arrogant floats. And in his ear, there is a burst of elf songs. These beautiful songs, like gravitation, almost dragged his soul out of his body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was shocked, his spirits surged, and all the phantoms were destroyed, which returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he once again sees the real world, the elves can't know when they have opened the first page. On the front page, there is a row of beautiful and gorgeous golden elf text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve Elf Kings Battle"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative magician who has gone deep into the magic world, Rogge already mastered the Elvish language and naturally recognized this line of elf text. But he knows that this book is not read like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and closed his eyes. At this moment, Rodriguez, Pope, Achilles, Goddess of Nature, Goddess of Ice, he saw in his life, those forces have already surpassed the existence of the mundane, one by one in his heart, and at the same time recalled, They have different breaths on them, and these breaths represent their different strengths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his eyes again and his eyes were silver! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the title page of the Elf Code, the words of the Twelve Elf Kings Wars have long been hidden, and another line of Rogge has never appeared before! At this moment, his breathing has stopped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can clearly sense that, in the text, every pattern contains a lot of power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he does not recognize these words at all, he can read them. Rogge finally knew the real name of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
