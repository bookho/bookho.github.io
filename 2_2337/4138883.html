			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crime and Punishment Chapter 13 is not on the way<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat! You dare! ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a scream, Androni suddenly woke up from her dreams. She sat on the bed and breathed in a hurry. For a moment, she could not distinguish between dreams and reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you awake?" Froya walked in with the door open. She had a silver tray in her hand and a few hot wipes on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni felt that the whole body was sore and sore everywhere, and the head was more like a drop of lead, and the bursts of pain could not be sustained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...what's wrong?" Androni put a hot towel on her face and finally felt comfortable, but no matter what. Recall that the experience of last night was a blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sat on the edge of the bed, gently wiping Androni’s face, laughing: "I still say it! You were drunk last night." Personnel, if it’s not the dead fat man who brought you back, I don’t know what will happen! If a new Juggernaut is cheap because of drunkenness, it’s going to laugh out when you say it.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted and said, "I am drunk, and no one can take advantage of me!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya smiled and said: "When you come back, you seem to have a little resistance! I gave you a dress last night, and I didn't see you hang up from start to finish." Brd/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni bowed his head and he had already put on a pajamas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya put the used wet wipes, and Ying Ying stood up and wanted to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly caught Froya’s hand. Froya turned her head and just looked at her quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a green eye that once looked forward to passion. There is no longer a desire to confide in a thousand words of love. Now, the two autumn waters are like the summer afternoon without wind, gentle, but not a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andro, the whole heart is soaked into the ice lake, the chill of the silk from her heart to the fingertips. She suddenly felt that the quiet green eyes were as heavy as a thousand. She couldn’t get a sigh of relief. Androni had the greatest courage in her life, and her hand was shaking. But still holding Fu Luoya's hands, not willing to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twinkling eyes flashed in a burst of gloom, and Froya turned to look at the other place, but her hands slowly and firmly grasped from Androni. Extracted in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anne, let's let it pass in the past. What's more, you chose not to be me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni has his head down. Low and low: "I know that I am sorry for you. But... Do you love him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s voice is very calm: "I don't Know if you love him. But he can give me what I want: a dependence, a hope, and a peaceful life. You see, I don’t really want much, isn’t it?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he loves others in his heart! You don’t know how many women he has, and God knows he can still... how long it will live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andro, who is in a panic, has some choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I certainly know who he really loves. In fact, I don't value keel. For me, life has always been a heavy burden. But He rushed back to the city of the gods, just to look at me, this is enough for me! I don't need him to love me, not long, I only need someone who cares about me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before going out, Fu Luo Ling suddenly turned back. Road: "When it comes to women, Anne, your woman is only a lot more than him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Rogge’s door was opened by Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s room is very large, occupying half of the entire second floor, but the room is empty and empty, except for one table and one chair, there is no other furniture. Rogge sat at the table, in the morning sun, reading a magic book with bronze inlays and yellowed paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This magic book is quite good. There is even a seventh-order magic. I said that I am also a magician, or should learn how to practice as a orthodox magician. It seems that this magician should be good. How did he kill him when he didn't think he was so powerful?" This magic book was derived from the blood-stained road. It was only two nights that Rogge killed too many people. He could not remember who the body was from this book. Searched on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni strode to the front of Rogge and slammed the magic book for him: "Today's weather is good, accompany me out of the city to go Go and see the surrounding scenery!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Rogge looked at Androni with a puzzled look, her beautiful big eyes flashing Perseverance that cannot be opposed. Rogge looked at the window again and smiled. "Okay! But is this a date?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled and said: If you can make me happy, then it is a date!" She is amazingly beautiful, and she is extremely tempted in every move, but this temptation to seduce Rogge's smile is very stubborn. The fat man has a lot of heart, but he doesn't say it, just follow her to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked in a row, and it didn’t take long before they came outside of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this red clay wasteland, there are faulty peaks, steep deep trenches and cracks in the ground. Year after year, the wind blew up the long red soil and rushed to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place, where is the scenery? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sees no one in the wild, suddenly standing, coldly to Rogge: "Rog, do you know why I am looking for you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "Know, because I robbed your woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Androni was shocked and surprised: "Ah... how do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sentence, you told me last night that there was no There are also eighty times in a hundred times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is awkward, she bites her teeth and swears: "Less nonsense! I only ask you a word." Are you willing to give her back to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "I am willing, she will not be willing. Anne, I know You are very painful now. But which one do you value more, is Fuluya still your goddess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s problem is caused in Androni’s heart It's a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She simply put all her concerns aside and took out the stars, cold and cold: "I want both! Rogge, I am not coming to you." Just kidding! Duel, if you lose, then you won't be able to make special contact with Froja!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge began to smile. But seeing Androni's cold eyes, his smile gradually solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie. You have entered the sanctuary, and I have the wrath of the natural goddess. This duel is too unfair, if not changed. I will not promise to fight you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak your condition!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge indulged, said: "First let me cast my own auxiliary magic, and then let me cast an attack magic first. After my attack magic is completed, the duel is officially started. And you are in addition to the blue sky. No. Any other magical equipment can no longer be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted and removed several pieces of magical ornaments from his body and left it aside. She even took off the soft chest armor, and then said to Rogge, and said: "Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a star-studded sword Large swaths of stars swayed around Androni slowly. These brilliant stars that appear in the girl's sweetest dreams can protect her, and can release a lot of starry air to attack the enemy when attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star Guardian is the strongest ability of the artifact to accompany the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is self-sufficient in his own strength, Rogge is an attacking magic. Even the seventh-order is the most serious injury, but her next counterattack is not something Rogge can resist. And she is confident that she can completely control the battle, and she will not kill Rogge by mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the six figures that have already illusioned, Roger is still casting magical armor, blessings and other small magic, and Androni's face is getting more and more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge completed a long process of enhancing self-protection. Especially when the plane passes, this magic is not really able to let him walk between the planes, but only makes his body temporarily change into a state suitable for sliding between the planes. One of the combat effects is to greatly reduce the damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took a deep breath and pressed his anger and uneasiness. She never expected that Rogge was so rogue, and all kinds of auxiliary magic actually put more than ten in succession! However, in this way, the magic of Rogge is almost nothing. After a while, I will release a seventh-order attack magic. Then he will not have much magic left. Although the fat man is endless and agile, his martial arts are bad. It is impossible to be the opponent of Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge had finished the last spell at this time, and his hands were covered with a bright yellow light, and he rushed to Androni! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni doesn’t evade, she quickly recalls all the known seventh-order magic that needs to be touched, and there seems to be nothing to her. Form a deadly threat. And Rogge's hand to touch her body, first of all have to withstand the protection of the stars. Unless... unless Rogge uses her promise that she can't evade, she attacks her sensitive parts in an attempt to get her emotional out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni silver teeth bite, simply do not look at Rogge's hand, just to fully raise the starry spirit. Anyway, how much cheapness has been taken up by him, what is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s hand sneaked into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is like a moth rushing to Rogge. As soon as he touched Rogge's body, he violently exploded, blooming a beautiful blue star flame. The radiant light even gave Rogge's bulky body a dreamy color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Rogge took a lot of shots on Androni's shoulder, which was a heavy force, but she was fully affordable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man retraced and escaped the scope of the Star Guardian. His face was a little pale. In just a short time, the guardian of the stars not only broke the protective magic that he could absorb and resist the damage, but also gave him a lot of damage. Only the protective stardust around Androni has become very sparse, and such a powerful protective enchantment. Even if it is an artifact, it is impossible to launch a second time in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge remembers the magic of the attack, and there is a voice, Androni is so vindictive that he knows that he has not suffered any damage and has no cursing effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sneered a little, and the stars fell slowly. Pointing to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the eye, Androni suddenly found that the clothes on her arm were emitting a weird yellowish glow! A breeze passed. She suddenly felt a cold body. Androni was taken aback and looked down and screamed immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that all her clothes have been turned into a ray of light to dissipate in the air. At this moment, her sword refers to the heavenly posture, and the most proud part of the female body is completely displayed in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge does use the seventh-order attack magic, but he does not use the most commonly used and most horrible seventh-order magic death, but a rare one. See the annihilation. The annihilation is effective in order to contact the attack. The effect is to destroy all inanimate objects within the magic range. Only powerful enough magic items will be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the melee, sudden annihilation can often make a soldier like a steel fortress instantly unprotected. However, the difficulty of seven-level casting and contact attack also turned it into a completely useless magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's subtle magical control is undoubtedly displayed on the annihilation. Under one shot, all the clothes of Androni are turned into nothing, even the shoes and socks are not given. She stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei, looking at the red face and hurriedly covering his body, Rogge smiled, his wrist turned, and he had a little dagger in his hand. , the behead of Cassinaras. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie. How do you play with me like this? Admit defeat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Rogge, a bright blue light band was suddenly lit up, and a perfect arc was drawn in the air. The white ** had already stepped in front of him in a fast and slow pace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni flattened the stars and gently and gently cut Rogge's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light band tangled around Roger's neck. The illusion around him was immediately reduced. Rogge was shocked and hurriedly read a spell, and the hands crossed his chest lit up a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pillar of fire descends from the sky, and then the tens of meters around Rogge are filled with the flames of Taotao! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andronie snorted and the figure flickered in the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like this is a classic showdown between a magician and a swordsman. Rogge can't help Andre with a wide range of damage magic attacks. Nie, and those blue light strips that flicker in the air cut off one of his illusions and make them disappear. The dagger in the hands of Rogge is also a great threat to Androni, and the faint flame ripples of the road can be cut even by the silver dragon. Where does she dare to resist? This earned Roger a lot of extravagant spellcasting time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge is still falling. On the eve of his last phantom, another phantom magic was finally completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of fascinating men on the battlefield that was originally empty! Androni was shocked. Screaming subconsciously! With her cry, the men’s eyes all fell on her, and they swept away with extreme yin. Androni immediately knew that he had done another stupid thing. Real phantoms such illusion magic only need to treat them as real, it is just a phantom. But her name, these phantoms immediately became extremely real, no matter how fast she was, the road was as solid as her eyes fixed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was ashamed and angry, and she bit her lower lip and looked up, only to find that Rogge had disappeared! It seems that the fat man finally used the instant ability to use invisible magic. But how can this kind of magic stealth be the sacred powerhouse of Androni? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has sensed Roger’s position in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni did not cover the body of the red luo, and jumped up, and the stars on the blue sky provoked thousands of stars and stabbed in front of the empty one. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the tip of the sword is actually nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quietly appeared, he opened Androni’s right hand with the left arm that generated a silver light shield, and the little dagger on his right hand immediately She was placed on her white neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lost." Rogge faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s hand is shaking, she can’t accept the fact of defeat, just as she doesn’t understand why Rogge’s position is better than her. One meter before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars fall silently from her hands...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s lips are full No blood, she closed her eyes, and stood up to the white neck, welcoming the sharp edge of the Casinas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogwan didn’t expect Androni to find death, but fortunately he reacted very quickly and quickly received the dagger, but the vomiting flame ripples were still there. She left a bright blood line on her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s heart moved, and the other hand took the waist, and the other hand touched her chest. As for Androni’s little lips, naturally, pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, Roger had a flower in front of him, followed by a crisp and whirlwind. Andersoni's instinct to slap a slap in the face, although not on the power of the Sanctuary, but no matter the timing, speed or angle are impeccable, the fat man did not even see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the shame finally made Androni recover from the moment of despair, and her face began to fly again. Although the phantom around it has long since disappeared, the power of Rogge's eyes has surpassed the sum of all phantoms! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni bit his lower lip and lifted Rogge over it. After three or two times, he took off his robe and wore himself. On the body, cover the body of the red luo. Rogge had wanted to take advantage of it again, but when she saw her hand, she fell back into her hands and immediately dismissed the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
