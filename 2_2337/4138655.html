			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun just leaped from the forest, the fat man had already finished his breakfast, walked into the camp, this is his time in the city of Sellersburg I came to this place for the first time. After receiving the snow fox's territory, the fat man received the coolness of more than 100 snow mines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are slaves in the greater or lesser countries. The supreme slaves include the brilliant elf woman, the outstanding warrior, etc., while the next is a variety of skilled craftsmen. Coolie is the most despicable of all slaves, often without skills, and can only engage in the most dangerous, most tiring, and dirty work. The standard of separation between various slaves is simple and straightforward: the ability to create value for the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the status of the coolies, the camps are usually the dirtiest and tattered areas in the area. Coolie is lifelong, and the face will be branded with the mark of coolies. Escape is not a good way out for the coolies. In the big 6 convention, after the hardships of escape are caught, they belong to the capturer, and the original owner has the right to redeem with reasonable money. In addition to a few, the redeemed coolies are often executed by the original owner in the face of other hardships with extremely cruel means. Even so, the large-scale escape of the hard work is still alive and well, and there are countless escapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred rituals exploded the biggest riot in the history of the Big Six. The number of violent violent forces reached 700,000 and even overthrew the king of a small principality. However, in addition to killing all the nobles, the uncontrollable coolies also killed all the clergy of the Holy Church in that Principality. At that time, Pope Paul VII came forward to convene a total of 100,000 coalitions of the 12 countries, and sent the Templars to be led by the church's youngest patron, Augustus, to suppress the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a sheep encounters a lion armed to the teeth, the quantity and will are meaningless, not to mention a group of lions. In July of the same year, Augustus led the Knights of the Templar to six battles and six squadrons. Every battle did not leave the pawn. At the end of the month, the 700,000 uprisings were killed. The history is called Red July. Since August, Augustus has another nickname "Blood Angel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brain of Rogge, who had just stepped into the camp, he had not finished the information of the coolies from the history of the Big 6, and it was a strange thing. The taste almost rushed him to the ground. The fat man looked around and glared at him. There are low and sloppy shacks everywhere in the camp. Even people suspect that the beasts of the beasts will be more decent than this. The sewage of various colors flows around the camp, and the strange smell is scattered from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the coolies in the camp have all got up and are lining up in a team, waiting for breakfast. In the middle of the camp was a huge iron pot filled with gray-green porridge. A highly skilled and oversized supervisor is giving a spoonful of scoops to the coolies. Rogge frowned and went forward, and once again he was almost overwhelmed by the smell. The fat man resisted walking to the side of the pot, took the spoon from the supervisor, picked up a spoonful and looked carefully. The gray-green soup was filled with unknown leaves, and he couldn’t see it. Sticky, a bubble turned up, ** a meat bug that has already been cooked. The fat breakfast squirmed in the stomach, and quickly took the line of sight away from the spoon of porridge, but saw a group of coolies staring at this point, "荤腥", the throat could not stop rolling up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s face was ugly, and the supervisor who stared at the meal asked: “Who is responsible for preparing these hardies here?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor is not good at the time: "I am responsible for returning to the adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From buying food to cooking Are you all?" "Yes, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom! I spend ten gold coins a month, that is, you are not doing these pigs. What kind of gold coins did I have to eat?" Rogge flew up and kicked the supervisor to the ground. He did not hate it and rushed to continue to kick his body. Several supervisors who were on the side of the scene were busy coming up to open Rogra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervised worker who was beaten climbed up and wiped the blood on his face, revealing a fierce and ruthless look: "Lord Lord, every month Your supervisor, Nila, only gave me four gold coins. You have to find him first. What's more," he looked around in a circle, and the coolies swept by his eyes were all reluctant to retreat." It’s these pigs! I’m already willing to feed them with half a gold coin a month!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogger is only angry, he stares at it. Still two supervisors with his arms, the two were busy opening their hands and standing aside. The fat man fixed his mind: "It seems that you have a good relationship. I am beating on my own site. I still dare to stop, hehe, hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;These supervisors, one by one, are obviously only the horses of Guta. Rogge quietly for a moment, sighed: "That's it. But now the production in the mine is not enough, you give them something to eat, how can you work hard?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gutahaha smiles and gives me this place. I promise that they will work like a boar. When Snow Fox was here, it was all mine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the laughter of Guta is gone, and it is replaced by a sigh, then a square face rises into purple, and the hand is squatting slowly. Falling down. After the huge body fell, there was a sullen Rogge behind him. The fat man was very satisfied with the effect of his cuddly legs, and he was quite content with his body. The life and death war was really good for Rogge. Nowadays, it is not easy to deal with such an ancient martial art that is ignorant of martial arts magic. Is it handy?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other supervisors have a bad idea and have a sense of support. If Rogge screams a few, if he is too long to live, try it. The aristocrats will kill someone on their own territory. If you hit my aristocrat, it is possible for the whole family to exile!" When the words are exported, Rogge screams at himself. What exile is more desolate than here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These supervisors looked at each other and surely surrounded them. The fat man did not move, and stepped on the ankle of the ancient tower, and carried out the darkness. In the sound of "click", the bones were smashed. In the screams of Guta’s pig-like screams, the supervisors were shocked. Rogge picked up the ancient pagoda again and pressed his face on the cauldron still on the raging fire. A light smoke rose, and Guta just stunned after two calls. Rogge threw the ancient tower in front of the supervisors. At this moment, his half of his face was black and bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days ago, the killing of flesh and blood, Rogge has been indifferent to such a scene. The supervisors looked pale and shivered. Rogge pointed to one of the most savvy little men, and then scared him to sit on the ground. Heaven is the head of this, and you will still give you ten gold coins every month. You must feed these hardies to me like a cow! As for this waste," Rogge kicked the ancient tower to the supervisors, and said coldly: "Fuck him, don't you think that the coolies are pigs? You will work with the pigs tomorrow! Put him on me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of a supervisor, cautiously said: "Adult, he is the son of the mayor of Ian. If you do this, the people in the town may be dissatisfied with the adults." what. Rogge smiled and couldn't help staring at him. The supervisor was sweating and he nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do what I said!" If you are not happy, just replace him! You are not colluding, do you want to give me a horse, do you want to start the price of the lion? Damn, I will not be happy with Laozi, and I will go to the camp tomorrow! Rogge threw a sentence and turned to the hard work camp. He hated all the way. "Ian, you old things, the last time you haven't had time to settle accounts, your son actually dared to hinder Laozi from making money, let's walk!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls in the city of Seller, a little bit of starlight flashes in the cold wind, late autumn, the night of the mountain is already very sad. Even one or two unknown autumn The insects screamed, but only brought deeper bleakness to the night scene. The people in the mountains had already crouched in the warm bed, while rolling freely, while imagining the people who were still on the road, they felt the warmth of the nest. The men and women in the mountain village began the original entertainment. The simple and violent action tests the quality of the bed supplement, destroys the comfort zone of countless insects, and makes the rats that are bent out of peace unsafe.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black shadow flashed out of the city of Sellersburg. A cold wind passed, the shadow of the shadows smashed, and the voice cursed, he accidentally became the reference standard, setting off There are countless people who are hiding in the bed. The public morals of the shadows did not bring him any good luck. When he hurried on the road to Le Mans, the three shearing thieves jumped out. The film was shocked and I didn’t expect this poor country. Actually, there are such dedicated thieves. The black shadow looks at an enemy three, the odds are not big, when I am planning to buy a road money, a thief from the back, a sap will stun him. Then three Lisuo stuffed the black shadow into the sack and returned to Salleburg.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow made a strange dream, dreaming of swimming in the cold winter. This dream naturally wakes up quickly and wakes up. He looks down and looks at him, just like he has just fished out of the water. He looks up again, and a sinister skinny man in front of him is still holding a hand. Empty bucket. He suddenly woke up a lot, only to see a few chairs in the room, sitting on the young aristocrats. There are still some mercenaries standing around, light can be seen from the face Very insidious and cruel, at this moment everyone seems to stare at himself with ill will. His cold sweat suddenly flows down, and the back of the head begins to hurt again now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
