			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For decades, there has never been a large-scale civil war between the countries of the Holy Alliance. This is not because the monarchs of all countries hate war and open up the soil. The main reason is that the Asrofic Empire is on the sidelines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, Feuerbach is leading the army to fight the mysterious creatures in the dark forests of the extreme east, and has no time to take care of the small place of the Holy Alliance. But the Duke of Doriak also holds 120,000 troops in his hands, and he can give the Holy Alliance a heavy blow at any time. However, it is too little to rely on these forces to occupy the entire Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although King Romon has been blindfolded by anger, he also accurately grasped the timing of the war. At the moment, the Asrofic Empire can rob the fire at most. If you want to occupy the Holy Alliance, it is a dream. The character of the Duke of Doriak is quite contradictory. Although he is very happy, he is even more afraid that his positional power will be shaken, so he will not easily fight the war, and will not force the Holy Alliance to fight with the Astrophy Empire. To the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the coincidence of all kinds of opportunities and the secrets of the people, the unprecedented civil war of the Holy Alliance finally broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the first four foreign countries to participate in the war, the remaining seven or eight small principalities are faced with the choice of problems. Both sides demand that these countries stand on their own side. These small countries also understand that if they choose the wrong camp, then it is the fate of the country. However, if you do not choose the camp, then after winning the party, you will definitely turn your head to deal with yourself, and that is also the luck of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under repeated trade-offs, there were six small countries and a total of 40,000 troops standing on the Livi and Latvia sides. In addition to the current factors of considerable combat power, these small countries are even more afraid of the tyrannical dominance of the Leiden Kingdom. The Kingdom of Leighton has annexed two principalities. If they defeated Levi and Latvia, then the fate of these small countries is even more self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the war has begun, the terrorist war machine of the Ayre Principality has become more unscrupulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning three days later, Rogge personally sent Charlie’s leading army to Dresden. When he returned to the Grand Duke, the genius was just bright. Rogge suddenly rose up, blessing himself with invisibility and leaping into the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant cook who has prepared breakfast in the Grand Duchy is busy. When the soldiers who were inspected had not yet changed their posts, they had been tired for a night, and now the weather is bright, it is the time when they are least alert. What's more, Rogge, the sacred tiger in the Great Government, is the first in the Holy Alliance to be a good start. These soldiers are also used to slack off. If Rogge, Froja, or Androni can't find someone to commit an incursion, then these soldiers can't be aware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that at this moment, Auntie must have been sitting in the study room to handle the affairs of the Principality, and the two great ladies, Androni and Froya must Still sleeping in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly walked through the room in the Grand Duchy, and suddenly the beautiful figure of a sword under the tree caught his eye. It turned out to be a butterfly. Rogge gave a slight glimpse, and he was too busy these days, almost forgot her. Her body has been restored to get up early to practice the sword? This degree of recovery is amazing! This is not like a delicate elf. If it is a troll that is known for its ability to recover, it is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stayed in the shadow quietly, watching the wind butterfly practicing the sword under the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style between her gestures is still so fascinating, there is no murder in the sword, only the seductive beauty. Rogge, who is accustomed to the fascination, can't help but admire her beauty. If it is tempting, the wind butterfly at this moment can be compared with the Mora that is full of natural charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Rogge faintly felt that the swordsmanship of the wind butterfly had changed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she still swayed the beautiful side of the Elf swordsmanship to the extreme, but somehow, Rogge always felt that her swordsmanship was more majestic and more Shen Condensed, a little more than enough to ignite the vague pressure of the wind and thunder. Although the butterfly's hands and feet are still weak, although her vindictiveness is still weak, but behind her delicate figure, there seems to be a huge figure overlooking Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of strength and beauty, the temptation is more than ever. Rogge suddenly felt that the decision to kill Rumsfeld was really correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge realized that the thoughts of these little people who are not in his eyes on weekdays are complicated and how intense the mood swings. It seems that whether God wants to call someone or the devil wants to seduce a person, it is not an easy errand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slight snoring he had just made was immediately felt by the wind butterfly. She looked at the corner of Rogge’s hiding with a little doubt, but found nothing. The wind butterfly snorted and a bright light in the eyes, has used the invisible instinct of the elf's unique reconnaissance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt that Rogge, relaxed, Ying Ying came to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Rogge, how are you so good today, so early in the house hidden in the shape of walking around?" Wind Butterfly clear eyes staring at Luo grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogello is a bit embarrassed, hehe smiles, and wants to care about it. Can you say that you are not going to be around in the early morning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly’s mouth floated with a fascinating smile, putting a hand on Rogge’s chest and gently said: “Rog, you know The relationship between us. If you want to... want to see... no matter what, I will not refuse." Speaking, a touch of blush sneaked up on her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge set his mind and smiled: "You certainly can't refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly Ning looked at Rogge, faintly said: "It is not impossible to refuse, but will not refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the contractual relationship, the wind butterfly can not refuse. Between this can't and won't be, it's actually a far cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly felt that her clear eyes contained so many things, and suddenly consciously avoided the eyes of the butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, this question...I will talk about it later! I still have something to do, you should practice the sword slowly." I don't know why, Rogge wants to escape. Her thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Rogge did not wait for her to answer, but she lost her body shape and hurriedly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly stood in the same place, thoughtfully, suddenly smiled, at this moment, her bright eyes let the surrounding scenes light up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Open all your defenses and give everything you can give..." A voice echoed in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning is a rare serenity and peace. But somehow, Rogge always felt a little flustered. He subconsciously looked around, and now he did not know when he was standing in the window of Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge wrapped himself up mentally and leaped into Androni’s room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not notice the sneak of Rogge, still sleeping like a baby. Under her loose pajamas, she reveals a large, large piece of white skin. Even in her sleep, her mouth still floated with a smile, and she did not know how to dream about which beautiful girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles, this morning is really rare! After a few days of marching out of the army, such a quiet day is estimated to be gone forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, the relationship with Androni was full of conspiracy and darkness. There is such a situation today, and he himself did not think of it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about it, Rogge couldn’t help but start again, and a hand sneaked into her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s fingertips just touched her soft skin, and there was a whirlwind in front of me, the scenery of the whole room fell over, and then he slammed, he The big head was heavily planted on the floor. Immediately after a strong blow, Rogge flew back to Androni's bed like a cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took Rogge’s collar and brought him to himself. But her beautiful lady is still confused in a beautiful pair of eyes, apparently still not awake. Androni didn't want to think about it. He glared at Rogge's left hand and almost shook his bones, and also disrupted all his intentions of resistance. Followed by the right hand, a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled softly, and took Rogge closer to me. My slap in the face was hidden. You have made a big move! I said how you are so bold, I dare to sneak into my room, not afraid that I will pierce you when I sleep. Are you ready to switch to Magic Wu? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and looked into her neckline. This angle is really good, Androni's pajamas are loose, and the scenery inside is almost Let him give it to him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s face was red, and his hand was a slap in the face of lightning. But Rogge I bowed and hid in the past. This time Androni was really shocked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Missy, change the way, slap in the face is not very good-looking. Rogge laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni once again approached Rogge and looked at him carefully, then she stunned: "Yes, you Permanent curing has been added, scared me, I thought you have grown into it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smiled happily and desperately headed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She snorted Don't say, it's still something that can't be secret. Next time you touch my room, be careful! I will put a sword on the edge of the bed."<br /><br />&nbsp Luo Ge smiled and said: "Miss, you have to work harder! Next time I come again, I am not so polite today. If you are controlled by me, what will happen? It’s hard to say very much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is proud to say: It’s surprising, if it’s been done by you, then I’m too useless. It is. This is absolutely impossible! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In case? Rogge stared at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was so shy and annoyed that there was such a day, I recognized everything! Let me go, let me I have to sleep a little longer!" said, Missy raised her hand and threw Rogge out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha burst into laughter and quarreled the people who were still sleeping in the Grand Duke, and then went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni by the window sighed softly. She still had some wonders why she could throw Rogge into the darkness while she was slumbering, and the two flashing slaps were hidden by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating something, Rogge, who had spent a wonderful morning, walked into the study and began to handle the day's official duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the usual practice, Hilley has already waited there. It’s really hard for this slippery old man to be so old, and to get up every day when he doesn’t shine. When most people in the Principality are still asleep, he has to be in Rogge’s study. I am waiting. It is not an easy task to take power. It is not an easy errand to serve such a wise, savvy and insidious master such as Rogge and Auntie. Hille handled all the things they had dealt with cautiously and asked for everything. The hardships in this are completely different from the ones that served the Tikal in the same year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the reports of Hilley and the ministers, Rogge also ordered some things to be dealt with, and the time was just a half-hour. He has already stipulated that no matter how many things in the morning, he has to report and process it within half an hour. Otherwise, God knows where these ministers will go. The domestic affairs of the Ayre Principality, no matter how big, are not a big deal in the eyes of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His enemy is too tall, if his eyes are short, then this embarrassment, you have lost without playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Shi Lai and others went out, Auntie came in. At this moment, her belly is already high, but she is still beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at her belly and when was it born? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She frowned and forgot. If I missed it, I really want to knock it down. It’s too much trouble to be pregnant at this time!" Rog smiled and said: "In any case, now the public is on the right track. After a few days of leading the way, you will give everything to Shire. Concentrate on rest, let the children get born and talk about it. When you are well raised, there are things that you want to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hastily passed for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army is on the verge of being out, Rogge is busy all day and night, anyway, he is strong and does not need to sleep. In fact, Androni and Froya do not need to sleep so much, but for them, rest and sleep is a kind of enjoyment, which makes Rogge completely speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that there are two more days to go, Rogge spends all night in the study room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge once again considered all the details of marching, reconnaissance, and logistics in front of the huge map, and repeatedly scrutinized until there was no flaw, which was lazy. Waist, stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a chill in the air...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge glimpsed, Northland at the moment The chill is still pressing at night, but I have already closed the window clearly? Is the wind suddenly big, and the window is blown away? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill is suddenly over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s intuition is extremely sensitive, and immediately knows that something is not good. His thoughts moved, and a faint magical absorption shield was immediately guarded. With his strength, he is not very afraid of the assassin who uses poison and daggers, but is afraid of a magician with powerful destructive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of ice cone with a chilly chill has come from behind his back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's magic shield can't withstand such a powerful magical attack, it flashes and disappears. The ice cone, like a blade, took him to fly and slammed into the wall. Even though Rogge's body was tougher, he immediately had more than a dozen wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dark column of inflammation rose from the foot of Rogge, and the high temperature of the devil's black hair melted the ice cone inserted in the body. Rogge jumped from the ice pile, and while still in the air, he used two layers of magical absorption shields with different properties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret killer seems to be familiar with all the habits of Rogge, especially his ability to move low-level magic instantly without a spell. Just at this moment, a faint light ball flew over and hit Rogge in the air. A flash of lightning flashed, and the magical protection that Rog had just added to himself was eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked, and he no longer wanted to hide his strength. He snorted and more than ten magic missiles flashed out in an instant, hitting the light ball. Although these magical missiles have been intensified through the Devil's Flame, he does not expect these magic missiles to hit the sneak attackers. Since the other party is prepared, then naturally, magic protection has been added before the hands-on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, a blue light flashed out of the window, and all the magic missiles disappeared on the sneak attacker's shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge’s magic is just to know the other’s position. In his eyes, the silver light was shining, and a spiritual shock had already rushed to attack the sneak attackers. Rogge tried repeatedly and repeatedly. For the master, although the mental impact is far less than the fatal point, at least the other side has such a slap in the face, he already has room to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sneak attacker is obviously a great magician, squatting on the magical battle strategy, and Rogge can't find a place to fight back. If you can't beat it, then you can escape first. Just call Androni and Froya, and let the other person retreat without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge’s mental impact is like a magical missile, and it’s back in one protection! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge really rushes out of the chill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sneak attacker used a high-level protective magic ‘psychological barrier’, just as knowing that he would use a mental shock. Just to see that he can use this seventh-order magic, Rogge knows that the other side's magic is above himself. At the eyes of Rogge, the silver dragon scales, the dragons and dragons and other treasures are not at hand. Naturally, they must escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as he ate this shock, a big lightning has already smashed him! After the lightning struck Rogge, he also distributed more than ten electric fires, which made the room a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't know well, he endured a lot of pain, just struggling to stand up, and the air was a chilly drift. He had been sealed in a huge forest blue ice! Rogge was shocked. He drove his own magic to break through the ice. After the ice seal, a really deadly blow will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, a khaki light illuminates in the room...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog only I feel that this khaki-colored light is so strong that it is dazzling! He was black in front of him and could not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Rogge’s body was numb, and the skin immediately lost consciousness. The feeling of numbness is still eroding him in an amazing degree! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart suddenly flashed a thought, this is the petrified light of the horrible abyss of Warcraft Medusa! If it is petrified, then even the soul will be imprisoned in the stone statue. As long as the stone statue is broken, he is really dead! Rogge knows that this break will not have the good luck of the last time, the soul can fall to the outside of the ***, the body and Frey to keep it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden rise of two golden lights behind Rogge, just like a huge creature of horror opened his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘭! With a bang, he has been suddenly blown into countless pieces by petrified clothes, and a strange roar is coming out of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s bare skin is squirming, the magic is rising wildly, and it’s breaking through the eleventh level in a blink of an eye! The part of the already petrified part of his body was forced to fade under the turbulent magical force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed and shouted, and the roaring sound behind him, the air was like a gorgeous magical light rain, covering the silence of the entire room. The world has been broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sudden change, and the sneak attacker has been shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger quickly turned around, his back was a dark green, muscles bulging, it seems to grow a huge faucet! The faucet's amber eyes wide open, and the light in the eyes suddenly illuminates. A dragon screams with a stunned Longwei rushing to the sneak attacker! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the previous mental shock and the double blow of this dragon, the soul barrier of the sneak attack was finally broken. The sneak attacker’s mind immediately could not withstand the horrific shock of Longwei and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is incredibly sweet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge has finished the spell quickly, and he has a magical destruction of the ball in his hands, and the sneak attacker has not recovered from Longwei. Come over and throw your backhand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s the turn of the sneak attacker who is full of electric fires. In the twinkling of an eye, the multiple magical protections on her body are destroyed by these two sixth-order magic. The ball was broken and clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smirked and rushed to the sneak attacker. His right-handed five-finger nails stretched and became sharp as a knife, and they passed to the sneak attacker's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other party must have a back, but her magical defense has been broken, if the melee combat, this kind of orthodox magician will be Luo The opponent of the grid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't! I surrendered!" The sneak screamed, his hands drooping, and he gave up all resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's index finger sharp nails can break the skin of her throat. He only felt that the voice of the sneak attacker was familiar, so he opened the horrible helmet on her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating face under the helmet is still as pale as paper, obviously unsettled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough! Your Highness, Flora, how come you suddenly want my life? I have recently offended you." Rogge is cold. His eyes glanced up and down at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria reluctantly laughed at the laughter and pulled out a petrified helmet in Paradise Lost. It should have been left by Teacher Yero. You also know that this kind of baby is rare, so I want to ask you to try it..." The more she said the sound is smaller.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This petrochemical helmet is made with the eyes of Medusa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said coldly: "If I am petrified, would it be really like your heart?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible!" Froya was so anxious that her tears would drip down. "There is no way that people will not remove petrochemical magic. In case, just in case, I have prepared several lifts." Why do you want to kill you in the petrochemical scroll? I want to marry you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are these scrolls?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya just had to reach out and Rogge stopped her: "You still don't want to move, I am looking for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he put his hand into the clothes of Froya, rummaging through it, and smashed everything she had in her collection. When his hand just reached in, he touched three magic scrolls, but Rogge still stopped, searching for almost every corner of Froya, and that was all. During the search, his right-handed sharp nails never leave the soft neck of Froja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya lowered his head, and the tears in his eyes were already stunned. She bit her lip and silently, letting Rogge do whatever he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge searched and searched until he had nothing to gain. He opened three magic scrolls and saw that it was a reel of the petrification, and could not help but glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya finally cried out and sorted out the messy clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge patted her back gently, but her hand was pushed away by Froya. She didn't even want the precious petrochemical helmet. She turned to her room and turned to the corner of the cloister, and she could hear her faint sobbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the direction in which Froja disappeared, the uneasiness and apology on his face had disappeared without a trace, and became as cold as an iceberg. . He licked the petrified helmet in his hand, which was still dotted with the faint aroma of Froya. Rogge smiled coldly. He just turned around. Suddenly, a huge pain came from his body without warning. He immediately snorted and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge pain is like having a life, conflicting in his body, seems to break through his bones and flesh and blood, and take the road. Rogge stretched out his sharp claws and grabbed the mahogany floor deeply, trying to suppress the restless force in the body. The huge faucet behind him was hidden, and the amber eyes showed signs of opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly snorted, spit out a large mouthful of blood, and finally suppressed the restless magic in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The five fingers clasping the sorcerer's sickle quietly relaxed, and she returned to the world of death with Gregorian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, it seems that the owner of the master will not have something for the time being. How can he suddenly increase the magic so much?" It seems that the cost of improving the magic is quite big." Gregory seemed to be talking to himself all the way, but actually said to the ***. It knows that if the owner is willing, he will answer some questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** faintly said: "That is the power that does not belong to him. He uses power in a way that is flawed. It is normal to get hurt." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon immediately seized the opportunity to take a big slap, and then said: "I always feel that the master's owner is familiar with the magic method... If If the memory of my demon dragon is not wrong, this method is similar to the method of cultivation of the most magical talents of the demon emperor. Let me think about it, what is the name, it is the alienation curse and purgatory!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was *** stopped and asked: "The alien bound cursed purgatory? What do you remember, all come and listen." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory didn’t think that what he said casually would make the owner take it seriously, and he replied with guilty conscience: "This, master...there are countless powerful people in the devil world Therefore, it will surrender to the Emperor of the Devil, in addition to the power of the Emperor and the omnipotent power, there is another reason is the strong among the Devils and the Royal Family. The demon kings are actually the most powerful family in the devil world. The alienation curse Purgatory heard that it is a practice method often used by members of the royal family who have mastered magical talents. I heard that they can control powerful forces in a short time. Master, you also know that although I was once a noble demon dragon, we are still too far away from our omnipotent masters. But how can I know the secrets of the devil's cultivation? What? I can actually hear the term, and that’s because I used to be a guard in front of the Emperor’s temple!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
