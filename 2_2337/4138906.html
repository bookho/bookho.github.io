			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small town of Baishi has a small population, but it is still prosperous in the main road connecting the north and the south. Located on the southern border of the Delaware Empire, White Rock City has always been peaceful and peaceful. Baishicheng is very fortunate. At least the war of bloody double flags has not spread here. The Delaware emperor announced his surrender for the sake of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, residents of small towns have become accustomed to the leisurely life of going to bed early. But in this early morning, almost all the residents braved the cold wind and walked out of the warm home to gather in the Central Avenue. Everyone's expression is solemn and sad, and how much is a bit stunned. Last night, the commander of the city ran through the small town and read out the last national book of the Delaware Empire. The city was a night of change, and the citizens who have always lived in ease have not fully understood what it means for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to accept a ruler who holds the bloody double flag, but they can only accept it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun jumps out of the horizon, although the air is not very bright, but it is already beautiful. However, this dazzling moment was very short, and Yun Xun in the distance covered the past and confiscated the overflowing light. The mist formed by the frost evaporation rises from the ground, and the small town is immersed in the orange-gray mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the city hall in the city came seven bells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, White Rock City will officially become the territory of the Asrofic Empire. The Imperial Army will take over the city defense, and the temporarily appointed city owners will also take over as the prestigious old town owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city people just gathered on both sides of the Central Avenue, and they felt the earth tremble slightly. After a while, the vibration of the ground became more and more obvious, and then the gloomy thunder began to come from afar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city people face each other, do not know what happened, the vibration from the soles of the feet to the heart, the face is a bit white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior who looked at the city suddenly exclaimed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far side of the horizon is full of smoke and dust, the flag is flying, countless iron rides are coming! A young soldier on White Rock City had a good eyesight and saw the flying flags on both sides from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle flag is dark red, decorated with a coat of arms like a golden shield, is the bloody double flag that brings the endless nightmare to the Delaware! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the seemingly endless iron rushing into the White Rock City, the citizens of the city could hardly believe their eyes. Baishicheng is just a small town with a population of less than 10,000 people. Why did it send so many iron riders to be taken down? And look at the two flags of the fluttering blood, obviously the Prince of Empires Rogge has also visited Whitestone!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the residents of White Rock finally saw this hand covered with hundreds of The Prince of Wales, the blood of the Delaware. Inconsistent with the previous rumors, it is not a sinister figure in the bloody doubles, but a fat man who looks quite amiable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the tidal iron ride, Rogge slowly entered this bland town. He has a constant smile on his face, looking around the residents of both White Rock and the streets. From the eyes of the city people, Rogge saw confusion, sorrow, loss, and of course fear. These people did not come to welcome him, and no one forced them to stand on both sides of the street. These ordinary civilians came to witness the end of a dynasty and the beginning of a new dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind sent all kinds of sounds into Rogge’s ear, and suddenly there was a vaguely crying baby. Rogge's ear moved slightly, and the corner of his eye had captured the second floor window of a hotel in the distance, standing on a beautiful young woman with a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She covers her right hand and is desperately trying not to let herself make a sound. However, her shoulders could not hold her eyes, and her eyes were already blurred. Although she was so far away, she could not see the five senses of the person in the crowd, but she still tried to open her eyes and did not want to let go of the contours that were drawn in the heart and familiar with the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in the end, that person, the one who made her think about it, the one who has now had the right to be a party, is still blurred in front of her eyes. The color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally couldn’t resist, and there was a dull sob in her finger. Androni quietly appeared behind her, holding on to the crumbling young woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Rogge, you just seem a little uncomfortable?" Rose followed Quig and asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog dropped his eyelids, masked the flash of light, and nodded and wondered what Hailar’s ​​free city-state had to say about it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original adult is bothering about this matter." "Merry has sorted out the information in the brain. The free city-state of Lal controls the six large ports and countless islands on the west coast of the Longines. It is known for its trade prosperity. Hailar's naval fleet and merchant fleet are very large, but their size is limited. Usually, they rely mainly on mercenaries to complete the garrison task. This time their suggestions, including expanding trade, protecting the caravans of both sides, and jointly fighting the thieves on the road, are all beneficial to both of us. Our unilateral reduction of tariffs and recognition of the status of the town of Clayford, which they are building and used for trade transfer, is excessive, but the Hailarians are savvy businessmen, and I think they are the weights used to bargain with us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge faintly said: "It’s not a good thing to be too smart. They expected that I had just captured the Delaware Empire, and the casualties were heavy and the rear was not Steady, I can't fight with them anymore, so I dare to make such a request. The town of Clayford is only one day away from White Rock, as far as I know it. There is no place to belong. From now on, there is the territory of the empire. Today we have a day off here and go to Clayford tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Adult, are you planning to expel the Claragen Hailar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Deportation or demise, I will give them a chance." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this will cause a new war. We have not prepared for another war, Rogge. At least there is a hostile duchy around us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said faintly: "I will tell the Hailar people, if they dare to provoke war, then after I have settled, I will fight them!" The war will continue until my big flag is inserted into the city of Lal, Shanghai. They either accept my conditions or are ready to perish. There is no room for merchants to bargain in front of the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you come? "The beautiful young woman is sitting in the chair, tears like a broken pearl keep falling, and gently soaking one or two sounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni light I don’t know if I sigh. Lilith, he has a lot of enemies now. If you let others know the existence of you and your child, it is definitely not a good thing for you. So he must be cautious."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilys looked at the gloomy sky outside the window and suddenly burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blink of an eye is already at the beginning of the Hua Deng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual night in White Rock City is very quiet, this night is even more dead, even the usual occasional wanderers and drunks are missing, only the city The hooves of the cavalry echoed in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second floor of the hotel, the blazing flame in the fireplace makes the room warm as spring. Androni pointed to Lilys's use of the starry air, and by the way corrected the fallacy in her swordsmanship. But both of them are a little absent-minded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bit more chill in the room. Lilith stayed and turned suddenly, looking incredulously at Rogge who didn't know when he was standing in the room. Her reaction was even faster than Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the child from Lilys, who was standing in the air, and raised it to his eyes, praising: "Look at these eyes! Enough "It’s my son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Lilith again and smiled: "Lilith, you are beautiful too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took a sip and stretched out and walked down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilys’s eyes suddenly burst into tears, and she immediately dried up and barely smiled: “I am getting old!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge carefully put the child back on the small bed and grabbed the white gauze on the top of the bed. Then turned and revealed a smirk, pulling Lilith into her arms, and another restless hand immediately plunged into her clothes from her neckline and took her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liliths flew two red clouds on her face and her body became hot. She pushed Rogge's hand though weak, but she was very determined. "Don't! Kahn is downstairs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... I can't be sorry for him! He has always been very good to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge responded with a deep kiss that completely swallowed Lilith's tongue , sealed all her words back into her mouth. Both hands were not idle, and she ignored her protests and struggles, and skillfully lifted her bondage. The left hand and the five fingers fell into the crispy milk that seemed to be mastered by both hands. The right hand was combed back and forth along her warm back and forth, and then penetrated along the inside of the thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith snorted and was completely overwhelmed by the nascent spring tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden hooves broke the silence of White Rock, and more than a dozen knights rode their mounts under the city. It was quite unexpected for Baishicheng to open the gates around the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knights look different and look like an adventurer team or a small mercenary group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s weird, it’s not so close to the city gate so late. And the city is surprisingly quiet,” said a woman in a wizard’s costume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another petite woman in a thief costume sniffs the smell of killing and bloody, and there is no odor. It seems that White Rock has not experienced war. It is also a good thing to open the gates, saving us from sleeping in the wild. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall warrior sighed with satisfaction and finally could sleep in a warm hotel. The Longines Sea drifted for more than a year, and now it is somewhat unsuitable. 6 places. But if we can get things out this time, we won’t use it for the next ten years!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another middle-aged man who looks quite majestic Sighed: "If all goes well, I think it is time to find a big aristocrat as our boss, and have a good life in a few days. When we went out to sea, we were twenty-one people. Now... only 13 back. I Already old, I don’t want to take any more risks, and I don’t want to watch my friends fall down one by one.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between words, this looks weather-beaten The adventure team has entered White Rock City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They felt it wrong in a blink of an eye, the street was too quiet, and it was a little scary. Although the houses on both sides of the street are still bright, there is no sign of some activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly the hooves of horses rushed straight from them in the front and rear directions. The adventurer knew that the situation was not good, and immediately dismounted, forming a formation of battle. Take the mount as the outermost protection. The mages and the priests began to bless the companions. A tall swordsman in the team took out a pair of swords that sparkled with magical brilliance and blessed himself with several auxiliary spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see the thieves or bandits that you envision in all directions, but the heavily armed, murderous regular cavalry and heavy infantry, the adventurers The faces are all white! Even if they look at themselves again, they will never be able to fight the entire team of heavy fighters and knights. Moreover, judging from the all-encompassing, crisp and neat surrounding, these fighters are obviously elite in the elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Swordsman whispered: "Don't panic! Focus on magical bombardment of the city gate, we have a chance to rush out!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the brisk hooves sounded again, and more than a dozen rides came over and wandered around the encirclement. Immediately, the knights looked light and light. They used not a long shot, but a long magical bow, which was aimed at the adventurers. The long, pointed ears of the knight remind the adventurers of their identity as elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer’s heart sank. How fast they act, they can't get rid of the chasing of the elf archers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a commander-loaded reloading knight raised his hand with a long-handed axe and screamed: "Adventurers! Put down your weapons and accept them all." Check! If you dare to resist, kill on the spot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence of the night was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a glimmer of light outside the window. Although the light is weak, Rogge distinguishes that it is the light of magic. He was shocked, his body fluttered from the bed and reached out, and the black robes flew to him as if he had life. He glanced deeply at Lilith lying on the bed. The flushing of her bare skin has not faded, but her eyes are tight and her face is full of tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liliths still closed her eyes, and the right hand moved, groping in the gradually cooling bed, and finally clasped the edge of the bed, tears from the corner of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One hand gently touched her face and gently wiped away the tears. Liliths was slightly panicked, and at first glance, it turned out that Androni didn't know when she sat at the bedside. Her hand passed over Lilith's cheek, lingering in her long, silky neck, then falling on her beautiful chest and gently drawing the fascinating curve with her fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so beautiful!" Androni admired, then asked, "Don't you want to go with him?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilys’s head sideways, not letting Androni see her tearful face, faintly said: “If he had the heart, he took me away. Since he didn’t say it, then I...just don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni leaned over and printed a kiss on Lilith's face, sighing: "He is an idiot who only knows strength and hegemony. Where do you know how to be good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Long Street has been infected with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger frowns at the four reloaded warriors who have fallen to the ground and a half-faced black face, apparently the elf rider who was directly hit by the flame magic. Then I slowly looked up and looked at the adventurers who were surrounded by a circle and covered in blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer is not good, one of them and one thief have fallen. To make matters worse, the female mage, who should have been strictly protected, has now fallen into the hands of Rose! The deduction of the female wizard’s throat, the jade finger, will always become a deadly weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Rog asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They refused to search, and they resisted, I suspect they have something hidden in their body." Cavaliers said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can put down our weapons and even let these guys check! But you can't insult us!" The female mage who had fallen into the enemy screamed unyieldingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that the Imperial team used the close-up inspection in the extraordinary period, that is the real close-fitting, even inside the underwear. Powerful magic items are not necessarily huge. A dead cloud scroll with a beautifully crafted process is enough to send hundreds of fighters to hell, but it can be hidden in the middle of a woman's fullness. When an empire-like minister such as Rogge is active in the newly occupied area, the emperor will definitely conduct a personal inspection of the suspicious adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looks to the female wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is young, in her early twenties, looks pretty beautiful. However, the beauty of the Allure in the adventurer has always existed only in the exaggerated poetry of the bard. Because of the long-term adventures, even the magicians who have always been protected will inevitably bring the wind and frost on their faces. They may be beautiful, but they are never refined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the current request of the fat man, this female mage is all over the body, only the sharp and full of the chest is worth a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head in disgust, and he was discouraged by his heart, which was equivalent to being pulled from Lilith by these adventurers. bad. The fat man pointed to the female mage and said coldly: "Only leave this one alive." Of course, the ultimate fate of this living is more miserable than the dead companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Rogge turned and wanted to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are... Rogge?" A very familiar voice came from behind him. Rogge turned suddenly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall magic swordsman took off his helmet and cried, "I am Etter! Do you remember me? Et!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s spiritual power swept through the magic swordsman. He stared at the magical swordsman who had eleven levels of vindictiveness, six levels of magic, and several scars on his face. He finally recognized the bad friends who were fooling around at a young age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, all sorts of past events in the Bavarian Principality came to the heart of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge strode to Ette and felt very excited. He didn't even know what to say, but he whispered: "Ete!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Look at each other, each with a bear hug. In the end, Rogge’s brute force was fierce, and the armor of Ed’s was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete laughed and said: "You are really Rogge! Haha has not seen you for so many years, you are much better than me! No, you were stronger than me." How did you get to the Delaware Empire? Now you are an official, these soldiers seem to have to listen to you! Baron, or Viscount? But I heard that Delaware was quickly destroyed by the Asrofic Empire. You have to be careful! Otherwise, you will go with us to Astrophik!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Hehe smiles now The Strofik Empire serves. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Etter cried. "Are you so mixed in the Asrofic Empire?" I heard that they are fighting the Delaware, how come you are here? Are you already a Pioneer officer of the Imperial team? It will not be a general!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, Ett glanced at Mei and said: You actually have such a beautiful man..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose squinted at Ette and immediately took the tall sword that had been weathered and magical The men scared a cold sweat. At the beginning of the scuffle, the adventurers relied on strong personal strength, tacit cooperation and magical superiority of the wizard to knock down several heavy infantry, and even knocked down an elf riding archer. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rose appeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rushed directly into the adventurer with a strange and unpredictable body In the team, the soldiers were killed in an instant, and the female thief was kicked out of the defensive circle. Then she grabbed the mage and retired. When she retreated, she kicked a note to Etter’s throat! The long legs that come and go are really tempting, but when the two sharp sharp edges of her heel are making a spark on the armor, I don’t have the heart to appreciate the beauty in front of me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two young people who fight together and fight evil are being revived, and the middle-aged man among the adventurers has quietly approached Rogge. A little, then he suddenly cried: "Etter! Opportunity! Grab him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not finished yet, and the cry stops! Rogge’s hand has appeared in front of him less than half a meter. There is a small group of dark black fireballs in the palm of your hand! The middle-aged man looks at the fireball that is close at hand, and can feel the turbulent magic contained in it. The moment of heat that has burst out has already made his eyebrows curl!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireball is a very big road magic, but middle-aged men have never seen a magician in a forty years of life can lead a fireball without What kind of magician is this fat man with a cold breath?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he has been sweaty!<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flipped, the dark black fireball flew high. He patted the middle-aged man's shoulder and smiled and said: "There is only one life, don't be so anxious to die." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man turned his head and said: "Aite, you come with me." You companions are a little dangerous and have to grieve them. You don't have to check it out, just hand over the weapon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers look at each other and honestly put down their weapons. It is a bloody conflict with Astrafik, and that is every The nightmare of the adventurer. After the appearance of the rose, they all had a mortal heart. Now, fortunately, Ete is actually old-fashioned with the other side, and of course they refuse to waste a rare chance to live.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Rock City Hall, the wine-stricken Etter is talking about this adventure in the Longines Sea. There are many wonderful battles, and of course there are not so bright parts. For example, robbing a merchant ship and the like. After these years have passed, the strength of Aite has indeed grown a lot, but the arrogant character of the great joy has not changed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, on the table in front of the two, there is a large piece of black and stone-like thing. It looks slightly transparent and faintly reveals a strange smell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the adventurers want to protect from the army. Fragrance. Whale is a very precious spice, which has always been produced only in the deep sea whales. If such a large piece of whales appear in the capital of Richelieu, it can sell at least 10,000 gold coins, which is enough for these adventurers to retire directly. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
