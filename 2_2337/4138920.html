Just put half of the red dragonfly's face on the junction of the ice field and the sky, as if it is a greedy child, trying to see the result of the Jin Ge iron horse on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening glow, the fire clouds, the half of the sky are burning red, like the gods of the chariot is carrying the blazing fire to the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless ice sheet is like a vast golden carpet stretching between the heavens and the earth, and the rolling hills are the gold lines on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heavens and the earth, the half world is the frozen sky, and the half is the boiling red. The more shocking color than the twilight rendered by the setting sun is the dark red flowing on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge two-handed sword slanted down and slashed the body in front of it into two pieces. This hitting technique is brilliant, but it lacks strength. It is more dependent on the weight of the sword itself. However, the quality of the two-handed sword is indeed outstanding. After knowing how many ribs and flesh are kissed, the blade is sharp and new. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fall of the victim, the two giant swords can no longer find new targets. The hand that held it lost the sharpness and became weak and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy two-handed sword fell on the ground that kept flowing with sticky liquid, and easily disappeared, reaching half a meter deep, which was unwilling Stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete was bathed in blood, his hands held the hilt and he couldn’t help but gasp. This tall magic swordsman has exhausted his vindictiveness, magic, and even physical strength. His gorgeous armor was bleeding all the time. Can't tell if you are from an enemy, a comrade, or yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was injured, but it was all minor injuries, and there was no serious problem at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a screaming screaming next to Aite, a boy who seemed to be in the midst of a change of voice, waving a knife that was almost equal in height, and swearingly Rush to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete sighed and pulled out the short sword at the back, the upper side of the upper body. Just let the boy's full strength slash, the short sword in his hand wiped his throat at the same time. In fact, the boy was a soft knife. I can't cut Ette's magic armor at all, but Etter's armor is very expensive and I don't want to be scratched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy fell weakly, and Etter saw that his back was already bloody, and even under the broken clothes, he could see Baisensen. Ribs. Suffering such a heavy injury, he can still charge to Etter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician swordsman has a slight movement. But such a scene he has seen too much today. At most, it is just a heartbeat. Most of the believers in the silver saints are civilians who have not received any military training. They only fight with the regular army of faith, blood and arms to the teeth. Although the number of believers in the church is several times higher than that of the Aray public team, the huge flock of sheep encounters the wolf and only the massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can cause minor troubles for the public team is the Snow Palace Samurai and the Ice and Snow Mage. The Zijing Butterfly has led the elite soldiers to echo the madman on the mountain. , before and after the pinch. The attention of the Snow Palace Samurai and the Ice and Snow Master seems to be concentrated on the attacking Mount Auburn. There are few powerful characters appearing on the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of Etter’s squadron is to face the wave of waves of general communication, he has been slaughtering. From early morning until dusk. It is so easy to take a fragile life. For the magician swordsman, you don't even need any skill, just keep slashing your knife. But the massacre of 100,000 believers turned out to be a long process. He almost exhausted all his strength, but at first glance. The believers of the Faith are still dense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete licked his head and slid into the sweat in his eyes and looked back. On the other side of the battlefield, the slightly weak figure in the British air was stationed immediately, and the command was determined. There are always hundreds of light rides around the Bauhinia butterfly to cope with the sudden situation on the battlefield. These light rides will be attacked to a certain position on the battlefield according to her instructions, and she will gather other cavalry as a reserve team for the whole army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auburn Peak. Mora was at the arrival of the public team. Just walked on the altar and crossed his arms to his chest. Then I kept that position and closed my eyes. The milky white glow that shrouds her body once again radiates a soft, sacred light, supporting the mad believer and the only remaining believers to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last rays of the setting sun fell on Mora’s tight eyes, and her eyelashes jumped and slowly opened her eyes. The already overflowing light shone with her eyes, and it glowed more and more intensely. Later, it seems that there is a new round of sun rising at the top of Auburn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides on the battlefield who were dying to fight each other involuntarily slowed down the rhythm of mutual attacks, and they looked incredibly as strong as the sun in the sky. The light of the light. No one can see the figure in the light, even looking directly at it for a little longer, the eyes will be like a burning pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the people under the Auburn Hills know that they are in the light of the group, and must be the Virgin of the Eye of Wisdom. So there is a difference in the look of the sky, one is fanatic, one is despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goddess said, to forgive our enemies, because they are just a group of lost lambs." Mora's soft voice rang in everyone's heart. Not only the soldiers of the Principality of Aray, but the remaining believers of the Silver Religion can also hear this sweet voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of Mora goes over the top of the mountain, rushing down the mountain like a waterfall, washing the steep and steep Auburn Hills, where the Light passes. The dark red ice has become clear and transparent again. The bodies buried deep under the snow and ice are revealed one by one. The remaining blood is turned into the clear spring to wash away the smoke on the clothes and skin, and then infiltrate into the soil. Those who die are lying. It was as peaceful as it was there. Auburn Hills, which has been piled up with blood and corpses, is like a human hell. It has gradually returned to its true color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this almost miraculous scene, a soldier in the Ale’s Principality suddenly dropped the sword. With tears in his face, his knees and the ground, he was completely out of his enemies, and he had lifted a tomahawk that had already been wounded. Behind them, more Principal soldiers prayed devoutly and kissed the land with their foreheads. This is not the way to express their respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All hatred comes from ignorance. Our enemies are in faith. But what they worship is only the projection of the true distortion of the gods. They hate because of faith. But they don't know. Hatred is not the god's original intention. They waved their swords because of misunderstanding, and chose the wrong goal because of ignorance. They believe and work hard for their faith, but all their efforts hurt only theirs. The true God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of Mora is sweet and soft, and it should be warm and warm, but in fact it is as cold as ice. She is at the moment. Just like those gods who are indifferent to the life of the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has an illusion that it seems that Moura has become the embodiment of the goddess!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The believers of the silver sacred religion were also stunned by the words of Mora, and the weapons in their hands hang down one by one, without taking the opportunity to attack the Alle Principality soldiers who had all fallen to the ground. In fact, they have been only defending themselves, and they have been reluctantly extending their lives that are destined to be destroyed. Their exhausted ** and spirit have reached their limits, since the enemy of the slaughter has temporarily stopped the knife. They also don't have to resist and struggle for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Mora’s words also shocked them, almost subverting all their previous perceptions, such as the lost lambs, turning their attention to the Snow Master and the priest . But those surviving ice and snow mage and priests are as embarrassed as believers, and the theological knowledge of lifelong research cannot tell them why Mora's words will sound directly in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their devout beliefs have even reached the point of blind believers. They know the knowledge of magic and faith, but they cannot explain it. Why is the holy woman of Mora, the goddess of heresy, able to directly sway their souls. There is only one explanation for this phenomenon in the classics of the silver sacred religion. It is also a common sense that almost all believers know. That is, when the believers believe in enough piety, their souls can directly hear the goddess of ice or her god. The voice of the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why can they hear Mora’s voice, is she also related to the goddess of ice and snow? This is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess said that hatred is over and the mistake should be ended. The goddess of ice has awakened from a long sleep, her god will soon come, really The devout will be able to hear the voice of the goddess of ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The war is over, so go back, the blind believers of the goddess of ice and snow! You should bathe, wait for the new god of the goddess of ice and ice, and follow her guidelines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, the indifference of Mora’s voice that belongs only to God has been lost, but the warmth of the country’s winter night, and even a touch of kindness: “The goddess of the goddess of ice will soon come. Believers of the Silver Religion, your faith is as devout as me, and those who sincerely believe in the true God should not kill each other. I will return your companions to you because they are also my companions. Faith has brought us together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy light of Mora fell on the top of Auburn, she step by step underground, all the way to the silver The holy believers involuntarily gave her a way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Moura, the surviving Madman and the Eyes of Wisdom help each other and follow their saints to the Auburn Hills. The dozens of silver saints who were imprisoned on the top of Auburn have been released and will descend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mora Trail travels north through the battlefields that are full of blood, broken limbs, broken meat, and dead bodies. Her face is holy and ethereal, walking like a floating, the place where the flowing holy light shines, all blood is turned into a clear spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the footsteps of the saints, like the center of the battlefield of purgatory, it gradually extended a clean road! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the sorrowful wisdom of the surviving believers and the mad believers also embarked on the path of faith, but firmly followed Mora to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where will she lead us?" This is a problem that arises in the hearts of all, but it is unreservedly true to God. Faith and follow-up are overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally over..." Etter has never paid homage to God. He wiped the tears and blood from his face. Looking to the other end of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the Bauhinia butterfly, and the Bauhinia butterfly looked at the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Bauhinia butterfly is hidden under the helmet and does not see any expression. But her lips are exposed, and the lines are still strong. Her sword was returned to her scabbard, and her right hand was summoned to recruit her own soldiers. Then she led the reorganization and the army marched westward and ran to the Principality of Are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, 100,000 silver believers. There are less than 20,000 survivors. They silently looked at Mora, who was gradually going north, and did not rejoice in the escape of the massacre. In their hearts. At this moment, there are bursts of turbulent waves, only for the words of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do their beliefs really deviate from the track of truth? Are these most devout, ordinary, and unconventional believers able to directly hear the voice of the goddess of ice and snow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of silver saints who survived from Auburn Hills suddenly changed their face, they were trembling, and they were stunned, excited, and ecstatic on their faces. appear. They even suspected that they had an illusion and looked around. See if you can see something from your partner's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this is not their illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priests of the silver sacred sect came out and rushed to Mora’s faith. However, it was only a moment of effort, and Mora was not moving fast. There were still many people who were seriously injured in her followers. But at this moment, the path of pure and clean faith has extended to the far side. At the end of the road, there is only a light like the smog, and there is no more person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest suddenly stopped. Crouching to the ground. Behind him, there are dozens of sensitive and devout ice and snow mage, god officials, and of course there are many ordinary believers. At this moment, these people who originally thought of disparity stood together in no limits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They suddenly squatted in the direction of Mora’s disappearance, praying loudly, praying for her forgiveness. then. Hundreds of believers from the surviving silver sects joined them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A highly respected old believer was amazed. He took a believer and asked him why he went to the heresy of the heresy. The believer looked back at him and his voice was out of tune with excitement: "I just... I heard the voice of the goddess! I can hear the voice of the greatest goddess of ice and snow!... The goddess said that Mora is not only It is the saint of the eye of wisdom, and the servant she walked in this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believers are full of bloodshot bulls, angry, and rushing to grab the hand. Excitedly waving your hands: "Testimony to my soul! My life witnesses! My faith testimony! That is the voice of the goddess! The great goddess of ice and snow! Good. You can not believe me, but you see the great god!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the worshippers around the land also noticed the dispute here. I looked up one by one and showed the vicious snake like the old man, watching the gaze of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the northern ice world, the long coastline is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a high standing ice peak, a figure suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was wrinkles on her face, and her eyes were full of bloodshot eyes. The mouths of the drooping mouth were almost parallel to the eagle-like nose bridge. The nose could not help but bleed through the nose. And stern. Her messy white hair, such as the root wire, swayed with the whistling wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ji Ma Li is at the top of the ice cliff, staring at the vast expanse of ice. The thick ice cover extends from under the ice cliff and extends into the mist of the distance. Ji Maben’s old face suddenly passed a burst of gray, and she coughed fiercely and spit out a few bloody mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cough sounds like endless, and the power of Kima also fails with the cough, even the gale is somewhat unstoppable, crumbling It seems that it is possible to fall off the ice cliff at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She trembled and took out a dagger from her arms, stabbed on her lap and closed her eyes and shivered. After a while, the face of Ji Ma began to appear strange red light, and the old body was quite straight again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the power of Jiema is restored, but the will has collapsed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fell on the ice On the edge of the cliff, one hand trembled in the direction of the depths of the ice, seeming to catch something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The greatest goddess..." The call of Jimmy is like the sound of the nightingale, sharp and sharp, and the heart is sore, but can the existence be heard? Where? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told you long ago that the goddess of ice and ice can not escape the fate of annihilation anyway, you still refuse to believe. Now the goddess of ice goddess begins Declined? How long can you hold on to a dagger?" There was a soft and sweet voice behind Jimma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima slammed from the ice, like a screaming lioness, screaming: "No! The great goddess of ice just sleeps again!" She must have wiped out all the blasphemy, so she will sleep again, it must be like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria wrapped in pure white skin, positive He is standing behind Jima. The little goblin in the cold wind shivered slightly, and the tip of the nose was frozen and somewhat red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Jimmy and smiled coldly: "The reason why a god will fall asleep, presumably you are more clear than me. As for those who are blasphemy Not destroyed by the goddess of ice and snow, can we go back to Richelieu to see if it is not enough? I heard that you have been a magician for decades, how can you learn to deceive yourself now? The goddess of ice has died, which proves your faith. It’s wrong, why don’t you hold it and hold it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Give me a stop!” Jima’s eyes became blood red, and a slap in the face On the face of Froya, knock her down to the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria struggled to climb from the snow and ice, and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with his hands. Her green eyes stared at Jimma, but she sneered with disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimma looked at Fu Luoya, his hand was still shaking. On the clear face of the goblin, it is gradually getting swollen at the moment, with a reddish palm print on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected oracle Ji Ma, what are you in the heart? I am in your hands, want to kill and kill, you kill I can't save the silver sacred religion, and I can't change the fact that the goddess of ice has been destroyed." The little goblin is cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima’s drooping mouth began to spurt blood again, and her red eyes stared at Froja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the glory of the peak of the kilometer, Fu Luoya, graceful and beautiful. The little red blood beads that hang on the lips are not detrimental to her beauty, but more beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
