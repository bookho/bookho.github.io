			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime of sin and punishment is under the circumstance of red tempering<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raging forest fire is hard to extinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the night, Rogge is rushing along the flame promenade left by Donk Bakkara. The wide flame promenade is full of black-black giant woods that are lightly smoked, and many of them are still squirting a weak flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the past few days, the huge footprints left by Donk Bakala still exude amazing heat. At the bottom of some footprints, those melted rocks are still still soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the flame promenade, Rogge has discovered a peculiarity of the dark forest, that is, extremely vigorous vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just between the unburned giant trees, Rogge will see several dark red sprouts growing quietly. They are not afraid of the surrounding flames, high temperatures and blackened solid ground, tenacious, growing at a horrible speed of the naked eye. These newborn plants look different from other plants in the dark forest, they are extremely heat-resistant and can even absorb the energy needed to survive from the scent of the flame tyrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge picked up a new leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dark red leaf writhed and stretched in his palm, even a few pointed nozzles on the edge of the leaf, see Go up and try to insert blood into his skin to replenish the energy necessary for growth. Rogge carefully observed the new leaf for a while, then ignited a small group of extremely light silver flames in the palm of his hand, burning this piece of the leaf that was not afraid of fire to a group of green smoke, and the ash was not Stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground around Rogge has a slight squeaking sound, and the new horror plants seem to have known the tragic fate of their companions. They all went all out to the ground. After a while, Rogge was within a few tens of meters, only a section of coke, and no more live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge knows that not far from the ground, there are countless young but terrifying new plants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the scary part of the dark forest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark forest is like a huge behemoth, for it. Every catastrophe is a chance for a new life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge jumped up and rushed down the flame promenade like a light smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding landscape is swept back quickly. In the background of thick gray color such as dark gray, black, dark green and dark red, a touch of bright red suddenly flashed through Rogge's line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked around and found himself in a very huge ashes field. If the previous flame corridor is a road, then here is a huge square. Within a radius of 10,000 meters, there is no giant tree that can still stand upright. It seems that the tyrant of the tyrant Tang Ke Bakala seems to have been stimulated, so this large forest is destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the same situation along the way, in this ruin. There are also countless new plants growing quietly, and even one is trying to peep out from the foot of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not care about these very dangerous new plants, his eyes only on the edge of the ashes. There, there are low shrubs that are very common in the dark forests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just like those shrubs that are not dark green or dark gray, this bushes are flashing bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not help but walk to the bush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark forest is windy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind here is full of negative energy associated with darkness, and it is incredibly rich. Because of this, even a small breeze. It also contains enormous power. In the dark forest, you can often see a breeze sweeping through, and then the giant trees in the wind sway in the wind. For this reason, even those who are proficient in martial arts, it is very difficult to walk through the dark forest. The dark forest when there is no wind is no different from the world outside, but once it winds. Those who fly in the sky will have a canoe that struggles in the giant *, and every move will feel a little helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whirlwind swept through the entire ash field, huge cokes tumbling, and the giant trees that escaped on the edge of the ash field swayed in the wind. The wind doesn't look too big, but the thick trunks that fly with the wind illustrate the terrorist power of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cluster of bright red shrubs also sway slightly in the wind, but their movements are irrelevant to the movement of the wind, they just can't swing according to their own rules. With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger stops at the edge of the bush. The bushes are all emitting a faint red light. A small piece of bright red is reflected in the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally. He slowly extended his left hand and reached into this mysterious bright red space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That moment. Rogge seems to have an illusion that he feels that his hand has crossed the barriers of space and entered the mysterious space he has visited several times in his soul form. In that space, there is a storm full of energy. Fat people have been very skeptical, whether there is really anything that can be forced to survive in that space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes and looked at it, seeing his hand still attached to his body. Just entering the arm of the brilliant red world, the skin is now emitting a faint red brilliance, just like the bush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger tried to touch the mysterious shrubs, and the feeling of his fingers was told that it was only the most common shrub in the dark forest. But the detection of mental power shows that the bushes are in a very wonderful state, as if they are simultaneously present in two different planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is really just a bush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a bush can exist in two different planes at the same time? Rogge's brow was locked, and he saw the center of the bush, where there was a bright red leaf. So he tried to stretch his body and tried to reach out and touch the red leaf. Intuition tells Rogge that he can't make his entire body enter this brilliant red world. No matter how he stretches his body, one foot stays outside the bright red world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s hand finally reached the red leaf, but the finger passed through the leaf, just as the leaf was just a phantom. He tried again a few times, each time with magical power of different nature, but the results were all passed through the leaves, and the power of any nature could not reach the red leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge returned. Closely thinking, one can not detect this mysterious space with spiritual strength. At last. He finally determined that the red leaf was indeed an entity, but it did not exist in this plane at all. There is a mysterious power that makes its projection appear in this plane. And the whole bushes are being pulled very slowly by this mysterious force to the unknown plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly reached out and grabbed it in the bright red world. When he retracted his hand, there was already a touch of red in his palm. This is not light, nor physical. Just the color, which represents the color of an invisible force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red slowly dimmed, and Rogge knew that this meant that the mysterious power was gradually losing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright red world that shrouds this bush is actually an extremely dangerous trap, a trap that connects the unknown plane and no longer looks back. This trap will disappear when this mysterious red is lost. But the prey that has been trapped in the trap will be completely destroyed by the conversion of different spaces as the red disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this bush is so obvious that it does not seem to be a trap of intentionality, but only the knot that the unconscious red is falling on the ground. boundary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked up to heaven. The sky is still a lifeless dark gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After staying in front of this bush, Rogge finally continued to move along the flame corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon over the Moonlight Dragon City has never had such a dense moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was in the morning, the room in the tall and wide room in the Dragon City was still very dim, and the scenery farther away was blurred. In the past, even the darkest moment before dawn, the walls of the Dragon City will emit a soft glow. Every silver dragon is used to falling asleep under this comfortable light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim environment made the silver dragon in the Dragon City agitated, although the dim has been going on for quite some time. However, the Silver Dragons apparently still do not adapt to the new environment. The restless atmosphere spread day by day in the Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only place in the Dragon City that still shines is Longchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greatly in the dragon pool. The pool of sapphire blue is undulating, with a soft and incomparable comfort. However, the pool water will only cover the bottom of the pool at this moment, which is completely different from the scene in which the entire dragon pool was filled in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio standing on the edge of the dragon pool sighed deeply, she knows, it will not take long, the dragon pool will completely dry up. At that time, all the magic barriers of Moonlight Dragon City will lose energy. The dragon eggs will only rely on the flames of the silver dragons to squirt, and the wounded soldiers will have to rely on their physical strength to recover the injuries, even the lighting inside the Moonlight Dragon City. Either rely on the worldly flame, or rely on the silver dragon to support the magical light with its own magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moonlight Dragon City that lost Longchi is just a body without soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio took a heavy step, picked up the ranks, went to the temple dedicated to the Dragon God, and began daily routine atonement prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the temple, the amber eyes of Cranio are the brightest light source in the hall at the moment. At the altar at the end of the main hall, the giant dragon statue does not feel a little sacred and solemn. It is just a stone sculpture without any specificity, and it is essentially no different from the boulder under the Dragon Peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio prayed silently with the most sincere heart, expecting the Dragon God to forgive her sin and return God's grace to the Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long prayer is over, and this time she is still disappointed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, even if there is no dragon god care, there is no Longchi, and there is no natural danger of Dragon City, the overall strength of the Yinlong family who still has ten adult soldiers is still strong. Any dragon, whether it is a superior or a lower, whether adult or old, can easily eliminate a group of human adventurers. It stands to reason. Cranio has no reason to feel uneasy. There are only a handful of races that can pose a threat to the high-ranking silver dragons. Even if the 12 statues of the Golem army of the Babylonian Empire were all driven to the Dragon City, Cranio would only have to send six soldiers, which would be enough to make the Golem army completely annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she still feels uneasy day after day, just like a pair of invisible eyes are watching her. This unknown enemy must be beyond the power of imagination to kill Nicholas quietly. She had already seen that the Babylonian Empire only abused the body of Nicholas, and the murderer who killed it had another person. of course. It’s just that the abuse of the corpse is enough to make Cranio decide to destroy the Golem. Maybe killing the real murderer of Nicholas. It is those who have seriously injured it, but in the end, Nicholas must have been an unknown enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, when she took the seriously injured Nicholas away from the Moonlight Dragon City, Cranho’s heart was already dead. That was the first time she realized the responsibility of being a king, and she was helpless. This enemy can put the invincible silver dragon into the conspiracy, obviously not the ordinary silver dragon can cope. Perhaps the only way out of Moonlight Dragon City at the moment. It is the assembly of all the power of the Silver Dragon Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Cranio doesn’t even know who this mysterious enemy is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, her heart is hurting all the time, because she never forgets the miserable fate of Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is once again immersed in the boundless pain, not even knowing how she returned to the Yinlongwangdi floor of the Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every day, Kranho’s prayer is the regular time of the Moonlight Dragon City, so several silver dragons have been waiting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio suppressed the grief in his heart and barely played the spirit. From the perspective of Yinlong, she is very, very young. The responsibility of Yinlongwang in this position is too heavy for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Cranio has been established in the position of the Dragon King. A young silver dragon warrior said: "Respected Cranio, I have discovered the ambush location of the human Babylonian empire. They are very cleverly hidden. If you didn't bring back the news of human invasion, we can have Looking for the purpose, it is very likely that they will be able to lurk in the Dragon City. They have brought together six steel statues. If we have one. Even the two soldiers are ambushing, the consequences are unimaginable. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other silver dragon also spoke: "Respectfully, Cranio, following your instructions, we have expanded the search around the Dragon City these days. Forgive me for bringing back a bad news. I don't know why, on the Bluestone Hill. The ground frost giants left the camp under the leadership of their leaders, watching them move in the direction of the Moonlight Dragon City! In terms of quantity, they have come together more than 80 adult warriors, it seems that all the giants in the camp The soldiers are involved in this operation. I can't fly too close. However, I don't think their intentions are friendly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio Point Nodded, adding a layer of worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy voice came from outside the door. Then another silver dragon entered the Chamber of Deputies, and he was very upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Cranio, I brought back a very bad news from the dark forest! The flame tyrant who has been sleeping in the abyss for a long time does not know When I walked out of the abyss, I have already passed through the entire dark forest! The direction of his progress is Moonlight Dragon City! I observed his speed. At the latest three days, he will come to Moonlight Dragon City. It seems that Donk Bakala’s goal is also Dragon City.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio only felt dizzy and couldn’t help but make a low embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all the existences that rival the Silver Dragon around Moonlight Dragon City, and at the same time, they are gathered at the same time! If these three forces are combined into one place, it is easy to destroy all the silver dragons in Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio faintly believes that behind the three obvious enemies, there is still a huge shadow, that is the real terrible enemy of the Silver Dragon. However, she has not considered many, and the immediate priority is to resolve the imminent crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio thought for a moment, on a silver dragon: "Ston, you now lead the three soldiers to the ambush of the Babylonian corps, do The way they searched. Since they only brought six steel golems, they would never dare to be enemies with the four silver dragon warriors. Seeing you searching in the sky, they will definitely avoid them and choose another ambush location. What you have to do is to force them to place the ambush on the path of the Frost Giant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ston swayed the dragon tail, some violent Authentic: "Give me six soldiers! I can guarantee that every steel golem will be broken into steel blocks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio shook his head, Road: "The Iron Golem is a very troublesome and powerful enemy. As far as I know, the human Babylonian Empire has no signs to form an alliance with the Froststone Giants of the Bluestone Mountains. I don't know why the Frost Giants marched into the Moonlight Dragon City, but If they were able to fight with the Iron Golem of the Babylonian Empire, It's not a bad thing, it can at least get us a few days. Ston, even if you can disassemble all the magic figures into steel blocks, there will inevitably be soldiers who will be injured. Longchi is close to dry, and finally The pool water will be left to rescue the wounded soldiers in the battle with the flame tyrant. Ston, our situation is very unfavorable now, we must try to avoid unnecessary fighting before we can determine the meaning of Donk Bakala."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio negotiated with the two old silver dragons for a moment, decided that tomorrow morning, she led several silver dragons to the dark forest, and asked the flame tyrant Tang Ke Baccarat's intentions. If the goal of the flame tyrant is not the silver dragons, then of course thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Donk Bakala is also coming to destroy the Moonlight Dragon City, the fate of the Silver Dragons is really precarious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are two choices in front of Cranio. One is to take advantage of the three-way enemy and still have a certain distance from Moonlight Dragon City to play Yinlong. Their natural superiority in speed, the power of the whole family is broken, and these three enemies are eliminated. Another option is to abandon the Moonlight Dragon City, move the family to migrate, and find another habitat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Silver Dragon is proud, let them give up their dignity, give up the moonlight dragon city that has lived for thousands of years and abandon the city to flee, it is even more sad than killing them. Cranio has no confidence at all that the Silver Dragons will choose the latter road. The previous plan is not a good choice. The horror of Donk Bakkara is famous throughout the North. Cranio only knows that he is very strong, but he does not know how strong he is. Even if the silver dragons came out and destroyed the flame tyrant, she did not know that several soldiers would fall in the flame of Donk Bakala. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the first plan is successful, only a few silver dragons will be able to return to Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
