			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the luxurious living room of the former Fallen City Master and the Night Motors Mercenary Deputy Head, the Orpheus and Marshal Rosio are staring at the center of the living room. A big sandbox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are all faceless and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marshal," Orphee Rock finally spoke up. "Although I won this city of falling, but the grain is not as much as I expected. Ten thousand, but only 50,000 people are transported to support. Now the grain in the army is only enough to support for half a month. His Majesty has not played anything, but the marshal has experienced countless wars in his life, and his record is impressive. There is no reason not to know the supply of war. "Important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Paladin," Rocherio’s low laugh sounded in the hall, "you are the most outstanding of the younger generation. Genius, but the role of experience is sometimes far from genius for politics. Although this war is not brilliant in the military, it is very clever in politics. Unfortunately, you and I are all military, although the situation is now Difficulties, but even for the people of the alliance, we have to win this war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofirok wants to stop, he understands today Politically delicate situation, some things are tacit, and some Title, placed on the table is not appropriate to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and frowned at the sand table. The Lost Basin is shaped like a funnel, and the large end faces the Rhine Union, and then gradually narrows until it reaches a narrow passage that is only three kilometers wide and more than ten kilometers long. In just a few months, there has been a temporary fortress built on the channel. Three-six-meter-long earthen walls were built in accordance with the terrain. The mountains on both sides of the channel are more and more dangerous. The Ron people have built more than ten fortresses on both sides. They are among the few magicians who are placed in these fortresses. They are condescending and can strike the entire front of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Rocherio is tall and tall, with a silver comb that is meticulous, and the clear face is full of years and experience. Orpheco knew that the marshal of youth was a famous beautiful man in the entire league. After living in a high position for a long time, now Orphee has been unable to glimpse a little thing from this face. In fact, Orphee Rock is very keen to know why the two great wizards of the Alliance, Jero and Lhasa, and the close friend of the Marshal, Star Sword Pross, have not gone with the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that the expedition has almost exhausted the Rhein Allied forces. In terms of military power alone, the Rhine League is almost the same as the Principality of Ron, but in the comparison of the strength of the magician and the number of the strong, it is far from the Principality of Ron. The Principality of Ron has neither the Great Magi and the Knights of the Paladin and Juggernaut. The Rhine Union has two great wizards and a sword saint. If you count Elysses and Orphey, you need another paladin and a great wizard. Such strength is also limited by the three empires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Rheinland’s Magisters and Juggernaut have not been released, Orphee is not willing to reveal the strength of his paladin, so this war is very strange. It became a regular war. Of course, the emperor Louis IX also sent his palace magician group out. The religious trials of the church also secretly sent a small unit mixed with the holy knight, the light mage and the templar to assist the Orpheus. Rock. The 12th round table knight of the church is naturally followed by Orphee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious trials have always made Orphey Rooke less comfortable, and this time, because of their existence, he had to leave Elysses in the Grand Duke. The house. The Religious Trial is the most extreme organization of the church: the base camp of the Last Judiciary. For those who are crazy about crazy, Orphee Rooke has always hated it, and he can stay away from far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marshal, if we are aggressively attacking this line of defense, how big is your chance of success?" Orphee asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roserio indulged for a moment, slowly said: "The night motor mercenary of the city of Fallen City was deceived by the city, this time I want Ron The Principality will surely squash behind the line of defense and dare not go out again. After all, the six-thousand-night motor mercenary was completely smashed in half a day. The non-day Knights of the Kapen old things are not stupid and will definitely estimate our strength. If the front is strong, it should be won within half a month, and the other 50,000 people can't run a few. But... our loss may be this number."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc looked at the sandbox silently. He knows that Marshal Rosherio’s reputation is not obvious, and his military genius is hardly inferior to his father. The golden lion is still too young, and this is the first time he has commanded such a large army. On the march of controversy, he knows that he is still inferior to the marshal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a simple little military camp outside the city of Luoshen. This military camp is very strange. The number of guards is far beyond the other military camps, and the target of the alert is actually the soldiers in the camp. There are only more than three hundred knights in the military camp. The military discipline is extremely sloppy. Most people hide in the tabernacle, and a few people are maintaining equipment or scrubbing horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small group of patrol soldiers passed through the military camp, a young and arrogant junior officer looked at the lazy knights in the camp. He was very satisfied with the rank of his major, but now no one here is looking at him, especially a knight sitting on an oak barrel and carefully rubbing the gun. This knight is blocking the road of this team of patrols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer saw the knight without giving way, took a sip and said: "It’s really a bunch of scum! I don’t understand a little etiquette! The attitude towards the horse It’s better to be better than the right person. It’s no wonder to give it to you! If you give Laozi a chance, you must let them know what the real knight is...” If you don’t finish it, a veteran behind him will ignore the status of the veteran. Lived in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer was struggling, and the veteran’s heavy gun, tobacco, and sweat smell almost stunned him. He is the son of the count, and the eight-level knight. How have you smelled this? Just as he was furious, the veteran had to come up again and scared him back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran stepped forward and whispered: "Adults, here are some death row prisoners! You can't provoke people in the Lions Camp!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer is young and vigorous, how can I listen to this? Standing in front of the knight who stopped the road, he said: "Now standing in front of you is the Major Cavaliers captain! Give me the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights Head Don't lift, faintly said: "I have been sitting here since the morning. When adults want to find me trouble, stand up and say goodbye, why should they go around?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The officer was full of anger, and he looked around, and the knights in the lion's camp had put down their work and began to watch the fun. Especially looking at my own eyes, why do you always feel like you are watching a dead person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this made his anger more vigorous. The light officer’s sword was squirted and shouted: “What’s so great about killing people? I have already killed three people! Come here, take this scum to me, just despise the boss, I will draw him thirty lashes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted for a long time, but no one agreed. Looking back, the ten soldiers who had brought in themselves had already been far away, and turned a blind eye to their own orders. At this moment, the veteran who passed his mouth pointed at the foot of the knight, and the young officer looked strangely and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s rifle has a peculiar shape, and the body is purple-black. Only the metal lustre of silver ash is close to the handle. The knight is rubbing the gun with water and rubbing the gun. The purple black gradually faded, revealing the silver gray underneath. It was just the sewage flowing down the gun body, but it was dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out to be blood! How many people's blood on the gun will become such a strong purple black? The young officer suddenly felt a chill in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate ignored the boring boy who was also called and jumping, just wiping his gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the expedition, the War of the Gods reinvented all of the kite equipment for Kate. All armor has undergone several magical blessings and incorporates enough black iron. This gun is even more devoted to Fiss's countless efforts. The three-inch gun head is a bit black, all made of black iron. There are four serrations on the tip of the gun, and a blood trough in the middle. The blue magical light flashed on the sawtooth and was attached with a paralyzed effect. In the blood trough, it is a dark green, obviously a huge poison. In the Lions camp, these equipment will at least give Kate half the chance to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole gun has weighed 120 pounds. If Kate before the War of the Dwarf, can't use this gun. Due to the insufficient quantity of black iron, Rogge resolutely replaced the axe handle of the battle axe with an ordinary steel handle, and dissolved all the black iron to make this gun for Kate. Kate loves this gun very much to kill, just call it a butcher. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate is now calm, or the heart is more gray. He has no interest in the flying fly that flies in front of him. What threat can a fly pose to his life?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it an estimated stupid pig aristocratic son?",<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, look at the timid one to imagine what his temper is!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer’s face is getting redder, and finally the dignity overcomes the fear. He shouted and the sword pointed to Kate’s chest! I challenge you as a knight! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate still rubbed the gun and faintly replied: "Challenging me?" Is the hair under you long? The knights of the Lions Camp laughed aloud.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer finally couldn’t help it, and the sword looked almost at Kate’s neck. He said: "Take the old man *** stand up and talk! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound, his sword flew to the sky somehow, then the gunshot flashed in front of him, and the left-hand shield was slammed five times. The huge impulse made him sit on the ground. The young officer who was sobered up, hurriedly touched the body and saw no bloodstains and wounds, and then he gasped and set his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly saw his soldier staring at his knight shield in a weird look, so he glanced at it and suddenly stopped again.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight Shield cast by the fine iron has five round holes of egg size.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for him to slow down Kate shot a little light on his abdomen, and the vindictive moment violently blew, the young officer fell to the ground, the armor was safe and sound, and the whole body was ruthless. Then Kate’s gun tip swung a few times in his ** lightly. The piece of cloth flew up with the wind. Kate glanced at it and said faintly: "The hairs are all long, and I should understand something later. Don't just provoke us." Some crawl out from the pile of dead people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate took the gun back to the camp and did not care about the flies that suddenly burst into tears. He licked the gun in his hand and said to himself: "Dead fat, you gave me the axe, you don't have to be slaughtered." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, who is having afternoon tea in his own building, sneezed. He licked his nose and shouted: "His grandmother, again Is that the one who doesn't want to live is cursing Laozi? He suddenly woke up and knocked his head heavily, and smiled at the person in the opposite chair: "Look, I accidentally swear." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole man was covered in a large cloak, and he said with a smile: "Did I still hear less?" Ok, let's finish reading the letter that Orphee left for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original mysterious man turned out to be Elysses. When she came, Roger was also shocked. When did he see this witch dressed up? But thinking of the sacred knights in the city and the black flames of Elysses, Rogge has some enlightenment in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is before Orpheq In the letter, he made a detailed analysis of the two small-scale wars before and after Rogge and the snow-white silver fox and the dwarf tribe. Where is the advantage and where the mistakes are made, they are clearly marked. He is even more In particular, the dwarf tribe wrote a tactical analysis of more than a dozen pages.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the Golden Lion, Rogge’s greatest strength lies in his strategy. The mind. The fat man can always mobilize all aspects of resources, forming a situation of more than playing less. Seeing here, Rogge could not help but smirk two times: "I did not expect that the group of Europe can also get a model of the knight spirit: praise of the paladin what! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the time, Rogge’s style is that ten people can play each other and never play eight. If there is a chance to kneel down, he will not be positive. In the battle, Orphee made a correction to these incompetent tactics with orthodox tactics.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Paladin, each on the battlefield The strength is very valuable. Without losing the strength, if you can play eight, you must insist on ten. One is a strategic waste. When the strength of the two sides is similar, the waste of these subtleties will often accumulate. Finally, the whole battlefield is defeated. As for the dark arrows behind the wounds, there are also his limitations. The frontal battle on the battlefield is always the first choice to win. If you can defeat the enemy positively, you must also look for opportunities to be under the knife. It is also a strategic resource. Waste.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock is a familiar reading of wild history books, but I know that there are indeed many people who have the reputation of 'smarts' in history, and they are invincible in their lives, but Is the last battle misuse of the trick, leading to a Tu, Qingyu ruined his life in a battle <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;At the end of the letter, Orphee Rock pointed out the role of Rogge's gambler. Every battle did not leave the reserve team. When the war broke out, it was often in a hurry. Although these two squadrons have the same vision and have won the final victory in the face of strong enemies, they have suffered heavy losses. If there is another war, Rogge will lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is that Orphee has overestimated Rogge. The fat man does not leave the reserve team, but does not know what the reserve team is. At the end of the letter, Orpheek wrote: "Any plan, there is no change, no change. The history of those famous, have The ability to modify the plan at any time according to the battlefield situation. It is important to know that the world's things are ever-changing, and a dead plan cannot count all the changes. The more elaborate the plan, the more places to be modified. The significance of preparing the strategic reserve team is here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned over and over again to read Orphey's letter twice, with admiration. Elysses asked: "Is it all finished? What is the feeling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Paladin's insights really can't compare! The whole letter is actually Unscrupulous, arbitrarily adapting the eight words before the understanding is too shallow, damn, ah sorry! No wonder that Orpheq is so young as a paladin, he is still mixed in the nine magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses grinned, and the sculptural face made Rogge look stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses saw Rogge staring blankly at himself, somehow his face was slightly red. Her fingers flicked, and a small black flame burned a little on Rogge's thigh, which made the fat man return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same beauty is beautiful, and the beauty of Fu Luoya is beautiful, it is the water-like beauty that makes people feel that they can't blow a little. And Elysses has a very classical beauty, such as the statue of a thousand years of cold ice, which is unattainable and can only be perfected and noble. After getting along with these two beautiful people for a long time, the man who is almost the same will be self-defeating. However, Rogge is a bold and daring figure. Although he is respectful on the surface, there are many rumors in his heart that "when Laozi catches you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Elysses does not know these thoughts in Rogge’s belly. If she is told, I am afraid that the fat man will be used to live with a black fire. In this respect, instead, Flora, who spends much less time with Rogge, knows more about his ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses laughter is getting smaller. She looked at the gloom outside the window, and there was a shadow in the eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took up Orphey's letter, lit it on the candle, and watched it burn to ashes. Then he took a step closer to Elysses and screamed: "Miss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses didn't look back, she took it with her voice A trace of melancholy: "Rogge, in your heart, what is your opinion about His Royal Highness, how can you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated He replied: "His Royal Highness is the youngest paladin. People like me have no way of understanding the realm of adults. However, everything I have today can be said to be given by Orpheq, so the villain has always been His Royal Highness is loyal and hard-working. It’s just that the villain’s ability is limited, so this time I’ve done what I’ve done...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses Sighed and interrupted Rogge, "Rogge, don't be so hypocritical at this time? Orphee looks at you because you have the potential that others don't have. Even I didn't see you at first." Potential. Your magic is so ridiculous, of course, compared to other magicians, your progress is very fast. However, your mental strength is huge and scary. Although you have been very careful to cover up, but for those who have reached or passed on me, as long as you have the heart, you will have your special features. So you can Say, actually, we are also using you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart jumped, and he never thought that Elysses would have said so clearly. He rarely put away the attitude of the oily slick, and sighed: "I have no relatives with Orpheq, even if it is used, I am very grateful to the adult's knowledge. If there is no Orpheq. Pointing and taking care, maybe now I am still a normal inferior aristocrat who only knows how to eat, drink, and play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue, for the senior magician, the magic It is very important. However, spiritual strength is the key to becoming a great magician. Spiritual power means not only the ability to control magic, but also a force closer to the source of strength. With your spiritual strength, sooner or later it will become a big one. The magician’s, by that time, I am afraid that all forces will rush to win over you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some relief in the voice of Elysses. She said softly: "Rogge, you know that Orphee is very proud. You know his power, so there is no difficulty so far and it really hard to beat him. This is exactly what I am most worried about. He is a perfect person, there are no real friends and men. Rogge, you know that the strength of a person is always limited, I am afraid that one day he will fall on his own Proud to be above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who was like an iceberg melted and became gentle like water. She turned and turned, gently holding Rogge's hands and promised me, must help Orphee, okay? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenderness in the eyes of Elysian almost overflowed, but Rogge knew that she was not looking at herself. Her gaze passed through her body. Crossing the wall behind him, passing through a thousand miles of time and space, on a dazzling sun-like figure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, all the blood is pouring Rogge’s head. All of a sudden he felt the cold and slippery on his hand. Elysses’ hand did not seem to have a bone, and it almost made him crazy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; However, the tenderness in her eyes is like a pair of ice water, slowly pouring his blood. Rogge only feels that the whole body is getting colder and colder, and the chill has infiltrated his bones.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot of sorrow and grief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently pulled his hand out and bowed his head. Calmly said: "Miss assured, Rogge will try his best to do things for Orpheq. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erics's face is slightly reddish, this smudged and shy color will in the past be the soul of Rogge. Now But he didn't dare or look straight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogeris also had some stuttering, "I was a little out of order..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the figure that Elysses left, Rogge couldn’t help but wonder, what is it that made this witch like the ancient glaciers so bad? Immediately, he remembered the magical power, style, temperament and talent of Orphey Roque, and could not help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of the outer world is always gloomy, but this moment is drawn by a flame. A burning chariot was towed by four unicorns, passing by in the sky, leaving only a burning tail flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick fog, clouds, and dark gray death energy of the outer world are rushing, trying to get close to the chariot, but when they are not yet exposed to the burning bright white flame, It has been steamed clean. In the place where the clouds were burned, a small piece of sky was finally revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is a bottomless black. Instead, the cloud brought a little dim light to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible pressure of the chariot is dissipated. Countless undead creatures fled in Zhang Huang, avoiding the light of the chariot. The undead creatures that can get into the ground are desperately turning over the soil, and even if the soil is covered, they are still desperately drilling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A distant hustle and bustle in the valley, a huge bone dragon fluttering. It spurted a dragon with a pale death flame to the chariot, and the fire of the chariot violently swayed and swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very tall figure on the chariot. His whole body is shrouded in a dazzling flame, and only the outline of the human form can be seen vaguely. He spoke up, and his voice echoed like a thunder in the heavens and the earth: "Abandonment for God! Give up your resistance and purify it in the flames of heaven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon returned with a very strong death flame, and then fluttered to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the inconspicuous little valley above the ground, there are scattered bones and dead wood everywhere. Suddenly, a huge faucet bone buried in the gray soil was slightly lifted up, and the empty eyes were flashed with greed and envious fire, staring at the dragon's breath in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach next to it, which only had half of the body, suddenly moved. A slightly shiny metal hand bone grabbed the neck of the bone dragon. The bones were heavily pressed into the plaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s reluctance. It was so hard to see such a majestic, spectacular and powerful dragon's breath. Before it was enjoyed, the demon master next to it pressed himself back. Yes, it is a clever bone dragon. I know that the people on the chariot in the sky are absolutely untouchable, but the outer world is so big, the bones are all over the place, and where can he be seen? Gregory could not help but feel aggrieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
