Wella quietly appeared, looking at the windy moon that was still in the storm of space, and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headless angel in the eyes of Fengyue has faded. She stares at the vicissitudes of space storms in front of her, letting the soft black hair fly with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just... very intimate!" The wind and the moon are faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina stunned and looked at the wind and smiled: "Fengyue, you never say this before."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to say this before." Although Feng Yue is telling, her tone is like telling something that is completely unrelated to her: "But now I won't say it again, I won't say it again in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina flew to the front of the wind and looked at her pair of mercury, gently Authentic: "Fengyue, don't worry too much. The world of God is not all so cold. You see, the goddess of nature is so powerful, isn't it mad at him? If she really has no feelings, then He will never be influenced by him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has always been a tough person." Fengyue seems to remember the battle that just ended, hanging on the lips A smile, but this smile always feels a little indifferent in the beauty, it seems that she is actually indifferent, but only for some kind of Because, in trying to get myself laugh it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Weina smiled softly and remembered the big battle. "Think about the last sentence he said to the goddess of nature, forever." Endless! This person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Fengyue faded away, she was silent for a while. Cold and cold: "It's time to go back. I still don't know what the ability to take away by the natural goddess, but also need to think about it. How about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I want to go to your territory and see what is good in the deepest part of the ice ocean. If you can meet a big guy with good strength, it is estimated that there will be another three or four, swallowing the power that can bring me. It's over. Next, I will continue to train him. You can rest assured that I will train him well." Wella deliberately lengthened the word 'good'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the way. You will be well kissed." The wind and the moon are faint, and the figure begins to blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina. The eyes flashed in anger, and he replied: "Who was touched at the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is faint: "You are not qualified to say me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is more angry, she missed the fat man more than the wind, but it is the sudden movement of power in space. The result of a strange change is simply the crime of non-war. The light angels were originally known for their fighting art. As the most perfect light angel, Wella used the power running rules to the extreme. This makes her in a similar situation. Can almost defeat any enemy. However, if she squeezes the rules of power, it is not without consequences. The consequence is that if the original rules of power operation change, Wella will often be caught off guard, at least the attack will fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina angered and suddenly laughed again. "It’s no big deal to be kissed by him. It doesn't matter how many more!" Don't think that you have made the goddess of the goddess of ice and snow, you can overtake me from now on. Since we share the origin of God, like that time, I will share all my feelings with you locally. Hey, you have In the case of the matter, let's block the connection between us and try to see if you can do this with your ability of God. Hey! The goddess of ice and snow, even if there is a gods field, how can it be Compared with the gods of the heavens?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind suddenly turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and floated slowly to Weina’s body, gently gripping her hand, and then thanked her, then she wanted to enter the void . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner groaned, she looked at the background of Fengyue and suddenly cried: "Fengyue! You really thought, his sentence, 'Between us, never ending 'Is it to the goddess of nature?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Na only felt unspeakable pleasure in her heart. She smiled arrogantly and entered the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fat man who once squandered the natural goddess was one step ahead. It was already thrown back by Vera to the original plane. The light angel's dictionary never has the word gentle, so the power of Wei Na is full of power, just relying on the hurricane generated between the waves, it is enough to protect the fat man through the space storm, back to the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man rolled over in the air and finally fell heavily on the ground. He wanted to adjust his posture in the air, but Wella seemed to be deliberately embarrassed, and all the resistance forces of Rogge had been sealed between the throws, which made him completely sturdy. Although Rogge also embarked on the road of pursuing combat skills, but after all, the time is still short, want to compete with Wella skills, it is not the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just wants to climb up, he hears a squeaking sound, and more than a dozen knives and guns have been pointed at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't do it! This is Rogge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately heard this It was Straw's voice, but it sounded like his hoarse voice was full of exhaustion and helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man climbed up and looked around and was immediately taken aback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where he landed was the Prime Minister’s Office of Straw. From the position point of view, it was just under the gap of the original abyss, and the remains of his feet. The traces of the magic array also confirmed this. At this moment, the gap in the abyss has disappeared completely. It seems that Straw’s confidant is finally solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It just disappeared along with the abyss gap, and the entire magic hall and most of the prime minister's house. Rogge looked up and saw a fragment of the wall wreckage, all of which were filled with coke wood, and even in the neighborhood adjacent to the Prime Minister's House, there was a thick smoke coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all these horrific stalkers have fallen into the ruins at the moment, turned out to be two huge Barto devils! Rogge couldn't believe his eyes. He looked at it again, yes, the huge corners, the huge horrible body, the deep red skin color, and the rotten flesh behind them confirmed their identity. The body of the two-headed Bata demon is covered with large and small wounds, some of which are up to one meter long. Nearly half a meter, Roger could not help but be surprised. He knows how hard the body of the Bata Devil is, and the one who can leave such a scar on them is not a leisurely generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly moved in his heart, turned his head and saw the other side of the ruins, sitting on a tall man. In front of him was a giant sword with a simple hand. He still couldn't keep blood on his forehead, but at the moment his two left and right doctors couldn't take care of this kind of minor injury. They are busy dealing with wounds on the man's arms and chest, and a therapist is busy with the various demon curses and the erosive magic effects attached to the wounds. The man was very embarrassed, and Rogge immediately recognized that he was one of the three strong men who hosted the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the fat man looking to the side, the man slammed back. Rogge smiled a little and didn't care about his rudeness. But those who are strong in the sanctuary are all unruly people, let alone those who are in high positions, who are the highest in the country. It may not be in their eyes. If it were not for the strength of the Astrafik Empire, it would not be possible to gather as many powerful people. However, Roger is more concerned about the safety of Wenna than the strongman of the Sanctuary, and he looks at the left and right, and does not see where Wenna is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stroud, these two are the Barto devils? How did they appear, Master Wenna?" Rogge said the Barto devil At the time, deliberately lowered the sound. Collusion with the devil has always been a taboo in the Terran nation. At least not a glorious thing. Of course, these two heads of the Barto devil have made such a sound, it is absolutely impossible to hold the news, and it is no wonder that Straw will be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stracha smiled and said: "Master Rogge, I don't know what happened, I only saw an explosion in the hall. I went upstairs. I fell down. Fortunately, Su protects me, so I didn't fall. Next, I don't know how... I have more of these two Bata Devils, but there are Mr. Neri and Master Wenner. Hey! Look! Come to me... life should be like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man immediately comforted Straw. After talking a few words, he knew the two Bartos that suddenly appeared. The devil caused a lot of chaos in the prime minister's house. Then, in the inner court and Wenna, who was in charge of the magical array, they immediately led the warriors and the two demons in the center to fight a battle, and finally succeeded in knocking down the two demons. However, the inside injury is not light, Wenna is directly in the devil's flame spit, and is still in serious stun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at the body of Nabato, who was nearly ten meters long, and his brows were wrinkled. He couldn’t think of any good way to deal with such two huge bodies, but they couldn’t let them stay there. One point, a few more people will see the end of the scene in the government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly whispered a few words to Straw, and Straw suddenly realized that he immediately commanded many soldiers and stopped cleaning up the ruins. Instead, he changed to two Bartos. The wall of the demon's body began to build. In a few moments, a few simple walls were built to block the sight of the civilians of the emperor. These measures have not played much role, but they are always better than none. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a turn in the ruins of Straw’s Xiangfu, Rogge returned to his home with the wounded Wenna. At this moment, the biggest ally in his political arena is destined to be in crisis, and a big magician has been seriously injured. These two bad news have failed to make Rogge feel depressed. On the contrary, the fat man has to laugh a few times. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that the power of Casinaras and the goddess of nature is not at all that the current Rogge can fight, even the fat man has no power to fight back. In this plane, determining the outcome does not necessarily require strength. The power of Fatty, Fengyue and Weina can't even destroy the goddess of nature who has been fighting each other or the Casinalas, but the ending of their exile is even better than the complete destruction in the eyes of the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the natural goddess is unable to return, it will mean that the natural goddess will lose some of its power forever. Even the power of some unique fields may be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of victory can be more thorough than the weakening of the power of the gods behind the enemy? If there is such a victory, then it is only directly blasphemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more importantly, he has always been able to get some knowledge about the gods from collections and legends. Now from this battle, Rogge finally saw and saw the kingdom of God with his own hands! His many conjectures about the gods have also been confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However is the distance between God and man far or near? The fat man is now smeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes. The more you know, the more you will find your ignorance. But anyway. The kingdom of the gods finally set off a corner in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at least for a long time to come, Rogge already knows where he is working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage has not stopped in front of the gate, and the excitement of a child like Rogge jumped off the carriage and took a step to the house. As soon as he entered the house, Robsky, who had a very sensitive sense of smell, rushed out and followed the way behind Rogge. He saw that Rogge was in a good mood today. Therefore, the flattering is not too explicit, not afraid of numbness, how shameless, how shameless, straight to the fat man. Until the entrance to the study, the fat man waved his hand reluctantly, letting this increasingly sensible Robsky retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study, Mei is sitting at the desk. Handling piles of documents. She was expressionless, and only a little black eyes revealed a little bit of her tiredness. Mei is fully absorbed, and the beauty is cold and sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge came to the desk and suddenly leaned over, lifted the chin of the rose, and kissed her on the lips. Rose looked at Rogge. Remove a piece of silk scarf, rub it on your lips, and continue your work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man didn’t take it for granted. He went away and went straight to Furo’s magic lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical laboratory of Leprechaun has changed a bit, and now it has been re-arranged and decorated, which is extravagant and comfortable. At this moment, the little goblin is lazily piled up on a huge and comfortable sofa in the corner of the lab, such as a cat who just woke up, and looked at a magic book in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the door, Fu Luoya did not lift the head: "Dead fat. Something will be said later. Let me read this chapter first." Ah, are you sure you don’t want to study degree meditation?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice has not fallen. Then he screamed and was held up by Rogge. The fat man hugged her in the same place for a few laps, and then laughed and sat on the sofa, the little goblin fell on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
