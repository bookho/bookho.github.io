			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelfth twilight movement chapters under the beam<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic light source passes through the crystal Refraction, turned into a soft and warm yellow radiance, sprinkled in a hall full of quaint and rich atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blushing liquor can't keep spinning in the crystal goblet, only after a few laps, the wine on the wall slowly slides down. Under the light, it is full of fascinating colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MGM is generally not suitable for long-term storage. Red wine that has been stored for a long time will produce odor, but it will destroy its sweetness. But this does not apply to red wine originating in the Schwarzwald region. The longer the wine produced, the more mellow it is. The more you want to try it now is the best remy from the Schwarz region. It has been 150 years. The above history." Catherine's voice is noble and reserved, and unconsciously refuses to be thousands of miles away. Every sway is a model of aristocratic etiquette. But somehow, on this night, her voice is behind the plain and elegant, there seems to be a little undetectable temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, preservation is also a kind of learning, I will introduce you in the future, there is a little funny trick inside!" Catherine is facing MGM The Yang Cup, this time her tail has a little flower cavity, as if the girl is a little lazy, it seems a bit too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM smiled. The theme of these days is wine. Under the guidance of Catherine, he has tried almost all the famous wines on the mainland. In just a few days, his knowledge of wine is enough to be a master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to drink the red wine in the crystal goblet, and Catherine’s hand suddenly fell on his wrist. Stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MGM Grand, the true taste of the wine, you can only get it after you get drunk. No, it’s not the drunkenness you’ve experienced before, then Not really drunk, because your consciousness is still sober. This plane, a great poet once said. Wine is the root of all evil. If you really want to experience the true meaning of the source of sin, the only way is to relax Disappear all the guards, suppress all the power, open the heart defense, and completely relax all control over the **. Only when your consciousness is drunk, the true taste of the wine will appear."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s hand was greasy and cold, but MGM suddenly felt it. The skin that she touched was faintly sensational, and even extended along the wrist to the atrium. His brow was slightly wrinkled, and he felt that something was wrong, but he couldn’t say where it was wrong. In any case, suppressing all the power of the four-winged angel is equivalent to giving his own soul to the fragile body of human beings. This is a very dangerous thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miguel, what are you worried about? Here is the Gong’s Palace. In addition to the cathedral where the Pope lives, this is the safest city in Lille. The place is gone. And I am not vindictive, nor magic. I am a devout believer of the Most High God. What are you worried about? Are you afraid that you will be like the angels at the bottom? Captive?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s eyes are shining like morning stars, and the breath is as fragrant as Lancome, as if blending the most mellow aftertaste of dozens of previous wines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM smiled. Although he still faintly felt that something was wrong, he was a four-winged angel who was accompanying the Lord God. He had known Catherine these days and had tried the human flavor, but he could not shake his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, how could he become the same as those of the next angel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM gently exhaled a breath and drank the wine in the cup. He followed the method introduced by Catherine. From a different perspective, I will relive this precious 150-year-old Remy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of drunk is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially like drunk and not drunk. Everything becomes fragile, and all hidden ** will pop up. All sensory stimuli are magnified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment in the room began to shake in front of MGM, everything was coated with a layer of bloody rouge. Like Macbeth, most of his memories have been left in heaven, but how can tens of thousands of years of time spent with the Lord God be able to forget all of them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MGM’s heart was a little alert. Although he has suppressed all his power, he is an angel with four wings, a famous angel with a curse, and he has been with the Lord God for a long time. The will has become a part of existence, and with a slight shake, the instinct immediately issued a warning. If there are foreign enemies attacking at this moment, he can immediately call back the power and restore the Qingming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, MGM also knows that the last point of wisdom that cannot be completely annihilated is a test of obstacles. At this moment, his emotions are indeed showing signs of faltering. If you don't even dare to face it directly, he can also say that he is defeated and lost in front of his body. Compared with the lowest-level angels who can't resist the temptation of **, this is just the difference between fifty steps and a hundred steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM sighed softly, and a little golden light in the depths of the pupil gradually disappeared, and the clear and elegant face finally began to appear wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rouge red in the world, MGM’s gaze was suddenly attracted by the two shining morning stars. Catherine does not seem too prominent, and even makes people feel that there is no personality, no features. But she is by no means beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine, she is actually perfect, from the tip to the ankle, every detail is impeccable. Even the most discerning person can't pick the shortcomings from her. For this reason, at first glance, I really don't feel what she has, or what is particularly attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human feeling is very wonderful, always attracted by the same prominent things, thus ignoring other deficiencies. And people will subconsciously exaggerate this most prominent point. For this reason, Catherine's name of beauty is not obvious, and at most it is only the first beauty of the Rhine King. And this name is also quite controversial. At least when Froya returned to the kingdom, the fascinating little goblins would immediately rob her of the limelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MGM has no way to understand the weaknesses of human consciousness. At this time, in his eyes, Catherine’s perfection is unobstructed. In this world of drunken fans, she is one by one. The beauty of the drops has not escaped the feeling that MGM has been magnified thousands of times. Ivory skin, thick natural long curly hair, dark blue eyes, soft jade hands, vermilion lips... The impact of each superposition grows with a factorial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine is still rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM quickly discovered that although he has already experienced various human art such as painting, music, sculpture, architecture, literature, and drama. But the true essence of human art has always been with him. He picked up the bottle. I want to pour some wine for myself, but my hands are shaking, and I can’t hold the bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very wonderful feeling. It seems that the endangered travellers in the cold, facing the fire of the dance, knowing that the burning pain can not help but reach out and grab, just to experience the heat of the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine gently grabbed the shaking bottle, and the long fingers ran down the bottle. Touching the trembling fingertips of MGM, the icey touch once again turned into a hot fire, which was poured into the depths of MGM. His soul is crying in the depths, but under the scent of drunkenness, MGM is completely inaudible and does not want to listen to this voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He backhanded and gently held Catherine’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing in the world of gold powder and blush is Catherine’s bright eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most wonderful moment...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is also the most profound experience...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul has been unable to withstand that great pleasure. Screaming hysterically in the shudder!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM suddenly took a seat From the beginning, the face was iron and green, and the wine was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is standing on a scarlet rug, dressing slowly, those styles that are simple in style, with materials and tailoring to show the luxury of the clothes layer by layer, she silky The skin is covered. Every movement of Catherine's dress is so elegant, and her face. Some are noble, elegant but essentially refusing people to smile thousands of miles away, so what she has just done is only the most common leisure things for aristocratic women, such as writing a poem or pruning a bunch of squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MGM is sinking into the water. He has expelled all human feelings and sins from his soul. At this moment, he looks at Catherine with the sorrowful and indifferent look of the world as a gazing lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to kill me?" Catherine was as comfortable as she was. The tone is as relaxed as a lady talking about the weather in a social setting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM is silent for a moment. Just a long sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled and said: "This is right. The church says: When you commit sin, try to compensate. If you want to cover up the crime And committing new crimes will be far from the glory of the Lord God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, what do you want." MGM was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine said: "Dagong has endured the miracle of heaven, and since then he has been fighting for the glory of the high god. Now the Principality is much stronger than us. The Dero empire is in a fierce battle, but the Pope’s attitude is very strange. He is always unwilling to help the Grand Duke of the Lord God. If you are willing to give us generous help, then you not only compensate me, but also spread the Supreme God. Glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM: "Da Gong is indeed the miracle bearer appointed by the Lord God. So if you want me to help you, just tell me directly. I don't necessarily agree, why should I use this way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled, long eyelashes flashed like a fan, meaningful and authentic "Mickey, the greatest source of inspiration for human art, is something called *love. If you can understand what love is one day, then you will understand why I am doing this."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love? MGM fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine left the room, and she knew it was time to let this noble angel come alone. She gently covered the door, walked on the long red carpet and walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure appeared silently in front of Catherine, stopping her way. His long hair and skin have lost the luster of the past, and his eyes are full of blood. The lips are suddenly lost in blood. He was a heroic and talented person, but at the moment he has been tortured and described as awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why! Tell me, why is this!" He stared at Catherine's neck and never let go of the hickey, squatting low. He reached out and hanged in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine frowned and looked at the road that was Fioré, the Church of Light, who had been following her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the focus of Fiore’s eyes. The brow wrinkles more tightly and pulls the shawl up. Blocked the hickey on the neck. Her classically beautiful face is full of inviolable noble expressions, and it is cold: "You? Track me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here to protect you!" Fiore whispered, he forgot to use the honorific words, then he desperately suppressed his voice, and did not want others to hear: so admire you! In my heart, you are even more important than my belief in the supreme god! But this is why. why! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked at him, his expression softened, showing a slight smile, as soft as the first light breeze in spring. She reached out and wiped off Fior. Lei unconsciously rolled down tears, soft but firmly said: "Fiore, I am just an ordinary woman, in this chaotic world. I need help and need protection. But I don't have martial arts, nor magic. Besides my body, what else can I exchange? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I can protect you." Also been helping you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine took back her hand and looked at Fiore for a moment, faintly said: "Are you?" Maybe later, but not now. I used to expect you to do this, but I don't have that long to wait for your growth. Protecting me is not just a matter of determination. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, Fiore's sword has arrived on Catherine's throat. His hand is still steady, but the whole body is shaking: "I Can't stand it, can't stand you in exchange for yourself! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine's bright eyes quietly looked at Fiore. His body trembled more and more, finally. His sword tip was a minute. Sinking underground. Vertically facing the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore was trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If one day, your strength can make me tempted..." Catherine didn't say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiore turned around in a whirlwind, staring at Catherine, and the eyes were all hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you always help me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will, forever." Fiore's eyes looked straight into the beauty of Catherine's deep blue sky, and the answer was not hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a world without a day, no land, four mountains, and no boundaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world has light, soft light, everywhere but no origin and end. There is still a sea in the world, and the ocean is so far that even the perception cannot reach the end. This is a strange world, half is the void and half is the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the waves of the sea, a face suddenly appeared. This is a seductive face, every contour, every curve is created by temptation, enough to make people breathe and stagnate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is swaying, and the giant * is rushing over to this exquisite face, raising it higher. Then in the waves of the road, the endless sea water condenses together, slowly accentuating the slender neck, rounded shoulders, ice-cold skin and slender legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, an unparalleled couple has stood above the sea. He, not her, suddenly opened his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless brilliant red lightnings falling from the sky, plunging into the bottomless sea, and inspiring the giants of high hundred meters*! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four angels emerged from the void, they gathered under him, with the pleasing sound of the holy shrine: "Respected Achilles, great Tiratemis has been waiting for you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles does not know why, it seems to be hesitant. For a moment, he waved a trick, flying a giant horse in the sea, and turned into a robe in the air, covering his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then under the guidance of the four angels, Achilles’ snowy toes illuminate two bright red lights, silently wearing the air . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiratim, one of the heavenly gods, created the great god of the light angel in one hand, and now seems to be immersed in contemplation with his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on a group of pure holy light, surrounded by clouds and steaming. The hymns sung by hundreds of angels linger in the endless space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve angels are arranged in two columns. They gather the golden wings behind them, and bow down their heads with enthusiasm, listed on the sides of the shining Lord God. Compared with the huge body of Tirati Misa exuding the endless majesty, these angels seem to be the little fireflies under the moonlight in the summer night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four lower angels who led Achilles came to a halt and they could not reach the Lord God. For these lower angels, the radiance of Tiratemis is too strong. When they fly forward, they will be burned out by the light of the Lord God. Become an unconsciously primitive form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles sees the twelve angels in front of Tilatemis, and the bright red eyes have a slight fluctuation. He flew to the Lord God who created himself, and bowed to the void with ease, waiting for instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiratemis slowly opened his eyes and looked at Achilles, who was not even as tall as his finger, slowly said: This time, your mission is not going well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord God has spoken as gently as possible. However, some of the microwave movements of his power have caused a lot of space in the space for those of the next angels. The hymns they sang are almost interrupted. Hundreds of angels immediately retired, until they were far away from the divine power of the Lord God, and the hymns became bright again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "O'Reilly is the perfect light angel you have created. My mission this time is not going to be smooth." Achilles first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also..." Tilatemis sinked and said: "But O'Reilly has just stolen the power of faith, but just awakened. She. Power should not be strong. This time, your body is even broken down and has to return to heaven, why is she not destroyed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Tilatemis indulged for a moment and reached out, and the four angels of the twelve angels immediately went out. Tiratemis said: "Let them help you, bring O'Reilly to see me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles slightly raised, bright red The eyes of the pair flashed a little light, saying: "The great Tiratemis, bringing Otto Reich back to heaven without the need for five light angels, will affect the speed at which you extend to other gods in other planes. And if the five angels of light come down at the same time, they will also exhaust the savings of the bright church. You know, the plane where O'Reilly is located is very troublesome. Otherwise, she... she won't..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles did not say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiratemis slowly said: "Achilles, your eyes are not high enough. I want to bring O'Reilly back to heaven. It is not enough to rely solely on your strength. As for the accumulation of the Church of Light, this does not require you to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the endless void suddenly emerges A strong ray of light, hundreds of angels flew out, they were arranged in a neat row behind Achilles, kneeling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel headed by respectfully said: "The great Tiratemis, the great Setanistria heard that you met some in the plane. Insignificant trouble, he knows that you are already tired when you create a light angel, so let us come over and hope that we can annihilate all the troubles at the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirat Slightly said: "I am grateful to the greatness of the great Setanistoria, but his mission is far more important than me. It should not distract even tiny forces. Go back, this time, the affairs are actually insignificant. It’s not even troublesome.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel respectfully said: “Of course, the great Tiratemis, I believe this time will be resolved soon. But the world of ectopic faces is complex and dangerous, and we have some humble experience. The great Setanistoria hopes that this matter will not be delayed until the moment when the eyes of the order god Frian Mill revisit it. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilat Si Dao: "The great Setanistoria is the main god of the battle. I can see your power very clearly. Go back and ask him not to worry, this time the matter will be solved soon."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel no longer insists, leading a hundred angels behind him to maintain a crouching posture, unable to slip back, hidden in the turbulent clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the battle angels retreat, the temple of Tiratemis is dignified, and even the hymns are particularly dry and tasteless. The divine power of the Lord God, which is unpredictable, has not seen any fluctuations. In the sphere of divine power, almost no light or time flows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Tiratemis raised his right hand and the four light angels stood up quietly and returned to their original ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of the Lord God is pointing to Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles crouched, waiting for the metaphor of the Lord God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little morning star flew out from the tip of Tiramis, and fell into the beautiful forehead of Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Achilles, I give you the freedom to shuttle the space and continue your mission." The words of the Lord God have a majesty that cannot be disobeyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Achilles replied, and then slowly retreated in a crouching position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time... you don't have to bring O'Brien back." Tiratemis slowly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angels of Light can't tell if Tiramis is cold and cold, if there is anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles finally left the vast and infinite hall of the Lord God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unreal space, vague hymns, tall and incredible majestic figure, alternately emerge, like a chaotic picture, then a familiar death The sickle passed through the center of the scroll and turned all the light into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the death slasher went to the situation, after a roundabout, he even came to him! The huge, cold blade fell into the chest little by little, and the unprecedented pain immediately burned his consciousness and his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
