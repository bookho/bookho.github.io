			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already autumn. In the autumn mountains, sometimes it will be hotter than summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after a rain, and then the sun is burning, the whole forest is so hot and humid that it can’t be said, it’s almost breathless. . The poisonous snake venoms are hiding in the cool and humid places, and the beasts and birds are also in the nest, and they are not willing to be poisoned by this sunlight. Only some powerful World of Warcraft walked leisurely in the forest, looking for food, patrolling the site, and playing a long and boring afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week ago, Kara Yang met with Chrisma’s brigade. Rogge peeped around them for a few days. It was really a good opportunity to find a hand. He had to sneak away and take them to the mountains with them. In the depths of the jungle and the mountains, there are many powerful unknowns. If used well, it should be a fatal blow to the pursuers behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a clear waterhole in the forest, Rogge is soaking in the pool water, and squinting his eyes. Occasionally he puts a small cone of ice on the pool water, and a piece of ice cubes into the water will cool the already warm pool water. Although Rogge was soaked in the water, his spirit was constantly scanning around. Any powerful creature, no matter how much it hides its own atmosphere, can hardly conceal powerful spiritual energy and soul power. Among the people Rogge had seen, only the pope completely concealed his existence. And Orpheus and Elysses distorted their strength and made him misjudged. As for the others who waited, it seems that they only know how to conceal the magic of fighting, but do not know how to conceal the spiritual power and the power of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sprinkle of water, Rogge jumped out of the pool. He picked up his ragged clothes and shook, and a little jade suddenly fell. In his heart, he gently picked up the jade of this size. He gently opened the lid and a soft glow overflowed from the sputum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of round, transparent drops of water lay quietly in the shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tears of Angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart burst into pain and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, Elysses lay in front of him like a sleeping baby. Now, every flawless skin of the body is clearly printed in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A memory like a crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, tears of angels. It brought her to his side and it took her forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that body, Rogge had a desperate struggle in every corner with the power of all souls and the tears of angels. From small to large, he still did not remember how he had spent so much at no cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also thought that there would be no people in this life who could make him lose both at all. However, the moment when the burning Elysses fell in front of him, he finally knew that this person had already appeared. He thought that all the admiration for Elysses was just a dream of nothingness; he thought that the weight of this relationship was far from the point where he deserved everything; he thought he could hold back the pain in his heart. The person sitting on the church took her away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he was wrong and he was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is used to calculations, getting used to everything can be calculated and lost, only the interests are supreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is like a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the tide came, he couldn’t understand it and he was taken away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently closed the jade, concealed the soft light, and also covered the pain in his heart forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hardships, this little jade is still on his body, it is a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge lifted the jade, gently kissed his lips, swallowed a mouthful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a chain of magical intensifiers from the law enforcement, jumped onto the treetops, and recognized the direction. I jumped again and drew a small magical array on the ground. Two piles of fine sand in the magic array were constantly moving. Rogge calculated it a bit, messing up the magic array and rushing into the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the flight, he inadvertently showed a brown bear in the forest and a giant wolf running together. Rogge sneered, this giant wolf and brown bear with scales on their backs can actually hurry together? It seems that these two Druids are still very tender! Just in case, Rogge quietly explored the wolf-bear with his mental power, and now they are the most famous magic of Druid: deformation. Rogge quietly put a spiritual mark on them, not disturbing the two Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining the balance of nature is the creed of Druid, and most Druids are pacifists. However, this deep forest is the best place to fight Druid's strength. "They should accept people like me who are upright and kind, cherish animals, and persecuted? Druids don't seem to be easy to lie, but they can't be taken lightly." Rogge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s magic advocates the use of natural forces, the middle and lower level of Druid is not powerful, and the advanced Druid is completely synonymous with horror. . According to historical records, the four Druids who ruled the entire Druid world were not under the top ten mages. Although the credibility and rumors recorded in this history book are not much different, they can write this way, and no big magician has come out to oppose it, indicating that the strength of the Grand Druid must be amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you let these Druids and Chrisma fight them once? Even the 16th-level adventurous angels fight Druid in the forest. Will it be a headache? I don’t know where the Elf is hiding in the forest? *** This mountain is too big for him.” Rogge thought bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the whereabouts of Druid, Rogge decided to follow them secretly, first carefully observe the strength and living habits of these Druids, and then make a plan How can they let them teach the church's pursuers awkwardly. These two Drews can only become brown bears and giant wolves, indicating that the heat of deformation is far from home, just two subordinate Druids. The lower level Druids are sent out to perform the task, it seems that the strength of this Druid tribe is not worth looking forward to. However, even if they have limited strength, if they have their own central planning, they must be able to pack up the chasers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ran for a few tens of miles west, which removed the mental power of the whole body. As he expected, the magic mark in the body was gently Concussed, and if there is no magic fluctuations. He rested for two hours, and it was estimated that the pursuers had already determined their position, and they sealed the magic mark with mental strength. To his surprise, another magical marker that had never had a movement suddenly jumped abruptly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s heart sinks. The pursuer has been forbearing, and he almost thinks that only Chrisma is a chaser. It seems that this person is a master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge set his mind and went to the northeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, ancient tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dark hall, *** is standing in the middle of a group of blue fires, and there are painful faces in the flames. The black warrior walked up and carefully held a misty pale green light group and put it into the fire. Under the burning of the fire, the cries of the calendar continually sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost of the hall and other low-level undead creatures listened and were excited. Some can't restrain the impulse, and the screams of pleasure and greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is getting more and more prosperous, and the painful face in the fire is more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Turned around, the armor on her back cracked slowly, a harsh rubbing sound, a huge bone spur slowly The crack has grown. *** ignoring the unknown spell, reaching for a finger, the group of fire suddenly flew up from the ground, stuck to the newly formed spur on her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire blazed the spurs fiercely, and the sound of the flames continued to grow. The grievances in the flames have a place to vent, and one side is crying, and one side is desperately trying to strengthen the heat of the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still have some memories of their lives. After the death of the war, their souls can return to the heavens, or re-enter the reincarnation, or naturally dissipate, but they have been killed by the devil halfway, and they have all robbed the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***It looks very painful, trembling slightly, and the huge bone spurs slowly soften in the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory lie on one side, boringly watching the flames beating in front of him. This burning flame forms a flame that burns directly to the energy core of the undead. It is also the feeling of the dragon, it is pain, very painful, and unparalleled pain. It had asked the owner to try this kind of fire, and the result of trying it once was almost so painful that it had to dissipate itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** unexpectedly could not support, fell down. The fire is still burning unrelentingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was shocked and stood up, but did not dare to approach the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! Dangdang! The heavy footsteps sounded in the hall, and Gregory recognized the flame bones from the huge body shape. He immediately became alert. Now is the weak period that the master has never had before. What kind of flame bones that have had two hearts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory leaps horizontally, blocking the path of the flame bones. It squats down, showing his huge fangs, threatening the flames of the bones, and not allowing him to get closer again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's make way!" A message came from the Flame Bone. This information is full of temper, anxious, fury, so that Gregory could not help but cringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a dragon, breath and magic should have been its most powerful weapon. Unfortunately, its power is too weak now, and no magic can be displayed. And what about breath? Wind poisoning? Let the flame bones cool down at most. Although it is not afraid of the flame attribute of the flame bone demon, but the two meet, and in the end will inevitably evolve into a melee combat. At that time, the power of the flames of the bones and bones was much greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's get out!" The violent flames of the bones are not reborn for a long time, and they can't think and convey information very clearly. Most of the time, they rely on instinct to carry out activities. It only knows that this information is transmitted stubbornly, but Gregory has no intention of letting go. It was anxious, the giant hammer was high and the hammer slammed into Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has a soft flash, the giant hammer falls on its side, leaving a one-meter circle on the ground bluestone, half a foot deep Big pit. Gregory was shocked. If the hammer fell directly on it, it would be enough to break its strongest spine! Gregory’s fear in his heart, he looked back at the sorrow that still couldn’t stand. He bit his teeth and turned to flutter to the flame bones, and tumbling with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Gregory is no longer supported. Half of its wings have been torn off by the flame bones, and the ribs have been broken a little. The flame bones are also not good, and many bone spurs on the body are bitten by Gregory. The left leg has a heavy tail, and the three bones are interrupted, and the other is covered with cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two undead creatures in the hall frightened other low-level undead creatures to hide in the darkest corners. Their pitiful intelligence is not enough to judge what happened, and they have not received any orders from the ***, so the instinct and fear of the high-level undead make them as far away as possible from the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Flame Bone Giant Hammer fell and smashed a small tail of Gregory. Gregory screamed, and the arrogance and bravery of the former birth of the dragon seemed to suddenly return to its soul. The raging anger suddenly made it forget everything. It was forgotten to fit on the body, throwing the flame bones to the ground, and biting off a spur on its shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two undead creatures are in a stalemate, a tall black shadow emerges from the darkness, it is the black warrior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You help me protect the owner, or help him betray the master!" Gregory asked the black warrior in his busy schedule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will always guard the master!" The black warrior's answer made Gregory happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Warrior... The Flame Bone suddenly violently screamed, and it strove to push the Bone Dragon and rush to the Black Warrior. Gregory rushed from behind. One bite his lumbar spine and throw it to the ground again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior’s two-handed sword fell high, and the two swords broke the flames and bones. Arm, another sword broke one of its legs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, see how you betray now! I will wait for the owner to recover and then pack you up! Gregory Lisong spoke up, stood up, and looked at the ruthless, violent flames of the bones and bones. He took a sip.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Jianguang It was a flash!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory suddenly felt that his body was light, and then it was a whirlwind. Waiting for it to stand up with his front paws, but now his own The lower body was scattered a few meters away. It was actually split into two paragraphs!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory suddenly understood, "It was you who betrayed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is me! Why is such a rare opportunity not to use it! Flame that idiot and I am born again, how many can feel the thoughts in my heart. Unfortunately, he pays too much attention to strength. As a result, the intellectual exhibition is too slow, and he can't even say a few words! Hahaha, I am interested in making him feel my rebellion, he I rushed to the scene, and I really got up with you! Haha! If not, how can I clean up both of you in one fell swoop? I will cut the light, know the appearance, and don’t know the power to pursue it. It is the owner of this valley!" The black warrior was so proud that he couldn’t help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Warrior!" Gregory couldn’t help but ironically: "Even if you succeed this time, rely on your strength and want to be in the opposite world." Is it because of the owner sitting here, the greedy dead ghosts around you dare not to rob this tomb! If the owner is you, I am afraid that I will be beaten out in a day! You are the ghost knights in the east. Opponent? In the Western Dragon Dragon tribe, which adult dragon can you fight? Can you get the mummy community in the south? Even if you seized the tomb by conspiracy, can you hold it by conspiracy? You think you are Master? The owner's engulfing is only the possession of only a few of the most powerful demons! With your slow absorption of energy, even with the help of ancient tombs, give you five hundred years, but no more than the owner. The power of the present!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black warrior was obviously angry. It slammed on Gregory and cut off its two front paws. "What is the use of *** strong? Is it not killing me now? I Let me see, how can I dismember your master for a while! ***A disintegration, will you follow the finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cold The spirit wave echoed in the hall. "Poor bone dragon! Are you Gregory? Our noble black warriors are fully capable of holding this tomb. Speaking, I should thank you for destroying the awkward big Mummy, our black warrior can't hurt it. Now, the collar of this black warrior community can stand in this ancient tomb, or because of your merits. As a reward, I will personally disintegrate you for a while. This is the honor you deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall black warrior nearly four meters high entered the hall, an unimaginable black giant sword dragged on it Behind him, all the way to the ground sparks. The black warrior collar followed behind ten black warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory looked angry at the black warrior entering the hall and said: "You have colluded with the black warrior outside! What is wrong with the owner?" , changed a master, you are not the same? Is the status still improved!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the same!" Paulus soul transformed into a black warrior A Tao: "Our black warriors are glorious in the past, and are willing to give everything to the knight! But I don't know why, the Lord abandoned us, we have not been able to return the soul to the Lord's arms, but in this fallen, sin, The dirty world has become the most wicked being: undead! We have more or less preserved some of the knowledge of life, so the Black Warrior is the most intelligent family in the world. However, the limitations of natural power, but Let us have to live with the zombies and the shackles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gradually became excited: "Black Warriors are the most honorable family in the world! We How can I endure this state of existence? How can we tolerate a dirty undead to act as my master? Those damn gods have abandoned us, we are going to kill the heavens, to kneel down the heads of those gods! Let them tear off their wings! Blood is turned into our strength! The Black Warrior is supposed to be the king of this world, and only to become the king of this world, we can challenge those who abandoned us! Today, we have produced a great king in the black warrior, he will lead us To tear those gods that are hypocritical, have no sense of honor, and deceive all our faith and life into pieces!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few sentences, it is waving The long sword is almost hysterically shouted out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a black rope that is soft, black, and very radiant is wrapped around its neck. This slender, black-skinned finger-like weight has an amazing power. The black rope was tight, and the three-meter-high black warrior was lifted off the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental fluctuations of a cold bone marrow sway in the hall. "There is nothing to do with God!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other black ropes are entangled in the black warrior of Paulus's soul. The black rope suddenly tightens, the black warrior screams, the body continually blasts, and finally bursts into a mass of powder, even the armor has no The rest is coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The body is burning with an invisible flame, standing in the air, more than ten black tentacles stretched out from behind her wings, dancing in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly opened her eyes, and her eyes turned out to be silver! The silver light in her eyes is not strong, and the black warrior who is occasionally illuminated by the light is suffering, and there is a light smoke on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The black warriors who are as cold as the ice, do you choose to be absorbed by me, or give up the brand of your soul? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul branding? "The black warrior collar is panicked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never! Honor and wisdom are our lives! "A black warrior rushed up, a squat into the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Stupid! *** Stretched out and grabbed its sword, so the huge two-handed sword was so stiff in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black tentacle flew out of her back The black warrior's helmet was pierced and worn. When the tentacle was withdrawn, the tip was glued with a faint glow, and it was absorbed by the eyes in a blink of an eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *** A whistling whistle, endless pressure from her body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Gregory with a soul contract with ***, Fang Yuan The undead creatures in more than ten miles fell to the ground, and they did not dare to move a little!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Warrior’s leader fell to the ground and you are in the dark The true king, please accept the loyalty of your servant. I will give my soul mark, from then on, and my thoughts and wisdom will be known to my master."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will give my soul mark, from then on, and my thoughts and wisdom will be known to my master." The rest of the black warriors fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A faint ray of light from the black warriors, into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the most intelligent family! Still not something that is bullying and hard! Gregory thought disdainfully. Although it was almost demolished, it is natural to give yourself a new and better body with the power of the owner. I am really a lucky dragon! Keep up with this one. Wonderful masters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul brand is far more unequal than the soul contract signed by Gregory. The undead to sacrifice the soul will be completely I can't afford any rebellious thoughts, and even if they want to treat them as food, they will be happy to receive them. If they are willing, they can even directly absorb the power of their souls. In battle, they will give their souls a mark. Undead creatures tend to be temporary tonics for the master.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory does not only have his own independent thoughts, but of course the idea of ​​rebelling against *** needs to be carefully hidden It can also learn from the *** to use the power method, and even get some extra energy boost, Gregory will also get a lot of benefits. This contract is very expensive for the owner Power is a particularly powerful demon . Several such servants can not <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "the owner is still very value their own ah! "Bone dragon can't help but vanity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how can the owner not withstand the burning of ordinary soul flames? Although they can't stand it, but the master is absolutely No reason can't stand it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does...the master is calculating this black warrior community?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This black warrior community is usually entrenched in a small stone fort a hundred kilometers away. The side of the stone fort is on the side of the mountain, and the side is on the cliff. It is located on the road leading to the peak. According to some ghosts, There is an ancient keel altar on the top of the mountain, and the undead can gain tremendous power from the altar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least twenty black warriors in the stone fort. When the *** took Gregory to see the stone fort, he gave up and chose the big mummies that attacked the individual strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now stone There should be no less than ten black warriors in the fort. With the new men of the black warriors, the stone fort is already equal to the ***.<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
