			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for Rogge to answer, the silver dragon horn in his hand, along with the silver dragon horn inserted in the roast goose, automatically flew to Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas's fingers gently stroked on the two silver dragon horns, after the silver flame flashed, the silver dragon's mouth was stained with saliva, greasy and meaty. When the dirt disappeared, the soft and beautiful silver light danced again in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas looked at the two silver dragon horns with deep affection and sighed and put them in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog didn’t think that Nicholas was so terrible after being irritated!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to take These guests made the first wave of shields, but Nicholas had no scruples, and they killed these people in a foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, in addition to the Xiusi and the Death Class, only Andre, Rogge and the Wind Butterfly are still alive. Because of the reason of the blood dragon's blood, the wind butterfly is completely unaffected by the Dragon Power attached to Nicholas's blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to irritate me, then as you wish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas icy The voice is still echoing in the air, and the man is already in front of Rogge, and his left hand can catch the throat of Rogge!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s body suddenly backwards Retired, even escaped Nicholas's blow!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shining dragon's blade is like a flying sky, pointing to the throat of Nicholas. The great power of the dragon blade, even Nicholas did not dare to look down, his body suddenly stopped in the air, lightly and skillfully let the hammer of the dragon blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dignified death class stood out from behind Rogge, just now he broke Rogge from Nicholas's claws. At this moment, the temper has already condensed into a dark gray armor on him, and apparently he has done his best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a terrible opponent as Nicholas, the Death Class had to use Sanctuary forces directly from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out another dragon blade and joined the two dragon blades together and turned into a long gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas is proud of himself, even though he has a dragon gun in his hands, he has no fear. What he wants to watch out for is not a death class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green light flashed, and the Dragon Slayer shot to Nicholas with a strange whistling!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nicholas's face was dignified, and the back was slightly retreated, and the dragon-gun that flew in the air was passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon-throwing gun is a big throw, but its power is not very good. After being overtaken by Nicholas, the rest of the situation was not exhausted. Only one of the stone walls revealed a gun handle. However, with the true power of the Dragon Slayer, if it is driven by spiritual power, it is Rogge’s full throw, which is enough to penetrate the stone wall of the 3rd and 4th. This thunder is loud and the rain is small, which fully explains what is called bluff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes stepped out slowly from the darkness, and the dragon-gun that he had just thrown was thrown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of doubts, Nicholas is still alert. The power of every god is unpredictable and cannot be measured at all on a normal scale. The sound of the Dragon Slayer’s gun was so fierce that he had to take a step back. Who knows that the power contained here is so weak? This is a sinister blow, and Nicholas had to be fully guarded against Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a solemn face at this moment, and the dark green temper is also condensed into a few green and strange leaves, flying slowly around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed a long sigh of Gulas, you killed so many people, isn’t you afraid of being chased by all the strong people of the Terran? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas sneered a thousand years ago, and you want to lie to me? With the selfishness and suspicious nature of the Terran, they are numerous But when it comes to uniting, it is a dream! Since you know everything that happened to me, do you want to stop me from revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand! Let me try your field tonight!" Nicholas screamed in the sky, a long, clear dragon swayed over the entire city of Bora!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bright night, but at the moment I don’t know where the clouds come from mysteriously attracted and are madly coming to the sky above Bora.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tornado is generated from nothing, from the city's main government to the sky!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gale, the size of the city's main building Collapsed, turned into a rubble field in a twinkling of an eye!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hurricane of the sky, Androni kneeled on one knee, and the blue sky tree In front, the artifacts radiate bright blue light, forming a shield that protects Androni's whole body. The wind butterfly is tired and sticks tightly behind Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this extremely fierce storm, the wind butterfly is like a fine porcelain, it seems to be broken at any time.<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm finally stopped.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas condensed in the air, long winds, the magic of the whole body As soon as it floats, it turns into hundreds of magical markers that shine with various colors, and flies around. Nicholas still maintains the transformation of the elves, but the breath of the dragon has begun to flow continuously. Although there will be some loss in strength, the flexibility and degree will be far from the huge silver dragon form. In order to avoid the field of Xiusi, Nicholas decided to remain in the form of the elves. Even if the power is weakened, he is sure to defeat the *** And the class of death. Moreover, if you want to kill Rogge and escape successfully under the heavy encirclement, flexibility and degree are much more important than pure power.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge struggled out of the rubble and looked up at Nicholas. In a moment, Rogge thought that Nicholas suddenly became so tall, it seems that everything in the world is insignificant in front of Nicholas. Rogge knows that this Because of Nicholas The power is too strong, it will make him such an illusion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes is full of mercy and looks at Nicholas in the air, sighs: You Don't blame me. You don't want to see, what did I just throw you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas saw with the eyes of Hughes The dragon gun in the gravel. Looking at it, his face gradually changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas screamed and pulled up the dragon-gun and carefully looked at it. His hands trembled, and then the whole body trembled uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...Crisis...Ferrena..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although The shape has changed dramatically, and although the breath of Kris Felena has been completely erased, Nicholas recognizes what the dragon-shooting gun was made of!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The sorrowful, desolate dragonfly once again resounded over the city of Bora. The porcelain and glass in the whole city of Bora were broken at that moment!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the furious Nicholas are almost as spurting as the real golden flame! His gaze is slow Slowly swept through Rogge, Death Class and Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class actually took a step back, but Xiusi still stood still, and even the clothes did not float a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nicholas, before the final battle, I will give you the last advice." The voice of Hughes seems to have endless regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, Silver Dragon is not completely immune to poison... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a sense of paralysis was uploaded from Nicholas Come, paralysis turned into a huge pain in the blink of an eye. At this moment, the dragon gun in the hands of Nicholas was like a piece of red iron!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas was shocked. But in any case, he was not willing to put down the dragon-gun gun made by Chris Ferrena’s dragon horn. The pain of this hesitation, the pain has spread throughout his body, and his dragon power immediately weakened. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this throw was so fierce that the dragon-shooting gun flashed in the sky and disappeared. In any case, Nicholas is not willing to drop the dragon gun into Rogge's hand, so this throw, he is thrown at the Central Mountain Range thousands of miles away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Cris Ferrena stay there forever...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas is improving Power, barely forced the body's dragon poison, but Longli has been greatly weakened. He stared at Hughes and yelled: "It will be poisoned!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes is holding hands, just slamming the morality of the world can also restrain me? Since you are not convinced, then my old man will not do it. I will see if you can escape tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fury Nicholas screamed and suddenly rushed over to Xiusi! At the same time, the death class also moved. He followed Nicholas in a lightning bolt, and the dragon's gun stabbed Nicholas's ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Nicholas suddenly disappeared, and in the twinkling of an eye he appeared in front of Rogge, punching a punch to the unresponsive Rogge!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** wearing the dark black demon suddenly appeared in front of Nicholas, her left hand opened Rogge, the undefeated right hand also made a fist, a fist to meet Nicholas's fist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small flame between the two gradually approaching fists! In the blink of an eye, the flame continued to shrink and shrink into a group of absolute Dark!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in the space suddenly lost gravity completely, and the bricks and gravel are floating in the air...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to be still...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, filled with the world, is absolute emptiness, absolute silence, absolute darkness... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of dazzling glare suddenly broke this absolute stillness, and the storm that appeared out of thin air immediately swept a radius of 100 meters. Cut!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni couldn’t support it anymore and was boasted dozens of meters away. She clasped the wind butterfly tightly, relying on the power of the stars to barely resist the storm that eroded everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class sighed low, and the whole man plunged into the storm, and the dragon gun stabbed in the empty space that seemed to be empty. The space in front of the gun fluctuated, and the figure of Nicholas emerged. He blocked the dragon gun in his left hand and turned to the death class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tornado immediately rises to the sky, wrapping Nicholas and the Death Class in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge climbed out of the rubble again, and there was no harm. The power of the storm was blocked by ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pile of rubble next to Rogge suddenly exploded, and the wings were fully unfolded, rising from the gravel! But at that moment, Luo I have already seen that the right-handed demon lotus armor has been broken, revealing a small white hand and a half-clawed arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The right hand is still clenching, but a few golden blood can't help but splatter between the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, Rogge’s heart hurts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air of the *** wings spread, a clear whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas, who was fighting with the Death Class, suddenly felt that his body was heavier than a dozen times, and his movements slowed down immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gravity control?" He was shocked, but he couldn't help him think more, *** already appeared behind him, still bleeding his right fist to him Back-to-back!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas turned back to be a boxing, his right fist has been deformed, and blood flow is not limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle has finally begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** completely abandoned the Death Scythe, relying on an invincible right hand and Nicholas hard fight. The Death Class keeps moving, and the Dragon Gun attack is full of elbows, knees, ankles and other bad defenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air was hot and cold, and the electric light was smashing. It was a flame in the sky. At the last moment, the dragon roll suddenly appeared, and the next moment became absolute darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a soft bang, a piece of black metal fell to the feet of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s heart trembles, this is a half-breaking demon lotus leaf!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Forced to reconcile the spirit, and moved the magic scroll in his hand. The small scroll is like a bottomless vortex, and the magic of all of Rogge is sucked in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this magic scroll finally moved. Rogge covered a faint white light. No matter how the surrounding environment changes, white light is always so stable and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is extremely tired and just wants to sleep. He screamed and screamed, and the dark flames couldn’t help but rush out of it. The clothes of the whole body were turned into ash in the fire, and the faint faucet emerged behind it. Relying on the magic of the purgatory provided by the aliens, Rogge sang the most crucial magic spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Rogge is now tightly linked to the ***, firmly locked in the position of Nicholas, he must seize this short Invaluable time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***There are many cracks on the demon lotus, her right hand is full of golden blood, and dozens of white feathers are flying in the air. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death squad has only one gun left in the dragon gun, and the other gun does not know where to fly. Although he has never seen blood on his body, his body movement has been slowed down a lot. In fact, his injuries are not much lighter than ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the Sanctuary, the real damage is not necessarily what the eye can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class has to carefully avoid the gravity range of the ***, otherwise, his movement will be slower than Nicholas, and more disadvantaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas has had multiple wounds. The wounds caused by these dragon guns will not heal at all and will slowly expand over time. If Nicholas does not concentrate on suppressing the magical power of the dragon gun with the dragon force, these wounds are not good. But where is he coming from here? The degree of *** is faster than him, and he always finds a chance to fight with him. The very annoying gravity field has always covered Nicholas. Now, under the influence of gravity, the gap between Nicholas and *** is even more obvious. Every time he fights with the ***, the Death Class will seize the opportunity of the moment to attack. Even if Nicholas was scratched by a dragon gun, it would not be too long to become a wound that could not be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war has become a war of attrition, and it depends on which side can't support it first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas was furious and the old wound was also cited. Originally, he did not fear the combination of the *** and the death class. Even if he had the dragon poison, he had absolute certainty to take advantage of the death of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now there is a Hughes standing in the field!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how bad the surrounding environment, Hughes can always bring the elf's grace to the extreme. He stood up with his hands and looked at the death of the three people in the Sanctuary by looking down at the leisure and arrogance of all beings. Whether it is a variety of lightning, or an invisible flame, when he is on his body, he will be cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of Xiusi said that he would do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his eyes are as real as he is, followed by Nicholas. For Yinlong, this nasty look is like a thorn in the back, always making him uneasy. Since Xiusi has even gotten the poison of the Dragon Slayer, it’s not a trivial matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible, the distraction of Nicholas's fighting power, such as the two-pointed death class under the siege of the death class has gradually fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to regret not recovering the silver dragon form at the beginning of the battle, when he still had the idea of ​​killing Rogge. But now he has to fight in the form of elves, and the deformation in the fighting is undoubtedly a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint, almost invisible mask quietly enveloped Nicholas, no matter how he evaded, the mask always covered him, but Nicholas's offensive and defensive movements in the mask were completely unaffected. He did not put this innocuous magic on his heart. Just because of the poor magic of Rogge, where could the magic that was released might hurt him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a half-meter-sized ball of light in front of Rogge, in which a narrowed Nicholas was kicking his fists and fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of the blue ribs on the head of Rogge floated, and the silver light in the eyes was also bright and dark. He was sweating and barely raised his right hand and went to Nicholas in the ball of light. Just as his fingers touched Nicholas in the ball of light, a dazzling light slammed, and the magic and spiritual power of Rogge's overdraft finally could not support the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge has hit Nicholas!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this blow is so weak It’s not even possible to kill a frog, but still hit Nicholas!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s pale white magic light suddenly disappeared. This magical light is now on Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical light of white turns into a chain of chains in a blink of an eye, criss-crossing to Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas roared in pain, this magical chain was burning his soul, still eroding his soul! Soon, more horrible It happened. Nicholas suddenly appeared, his dragon power has disappeared cleanly! From this moment, he has completely turned into an elf!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he The power is still very powerful, even far beyond the strongest who entered the sanctuary, but he is already an elf, not a silver dragon that is almost invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal of the finger, a high-order, powerful but almost useless magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal finger will only work if the caster hits the opponent by hand. This magic will keep the hitter in the current state forever until it is cracked by a caster with more powerful magic. The most suitable object for this magic is the powerful existence that cannot be completely destroyed, although it is knocked down. For example, the abyss demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrified Nicholas finally understood what was born. At the moment when the power fell, he took another shot of the punch and the two shots of the death class, and a blood spurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas searches for memory. What kind of magic can make Rogge hit himself in this unstoppable way? Between the lights and the fire, a thought passed by his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the top dark magic: curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong suddenly snarled, his voice echoed again over the entire city of Bora: "Damn Devil! Where are you hiding! Give I rolled out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the mad attack of Nicholas, both the *** and the Death Class were forced to take a step back. When Yinlong was preparing to desperately kill Rogge, who was already sitting on the ground, the lingering glimpses of the corner of the eye suddenly stunned the corner of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the quietness of Xiusi seems so strange, just as he does not belong to the world at all. And the eyes of Hughes are falling on Nicholas's body. At the moment when the two sides met, a sneer that was not easy to detect appeared in the corner of Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops! He wants to do it!" Nicholas was shocked and immediately woke up from fury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was known to be in vain, Nicholas still slammed into a bullet, and a bright silver smudged projectile hit the rogue's forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whistling sound, a piece of demon lotus leaves first and then, with Rogge's scalp intercepting the vindictive projectile. The Death Class seized the opportunity, and a very indecent shot was directed at Nicholas. The tactics of the class are extremely vicious. His goal is to form a tiny wound on the powerful Nicholas. In the face of such a weak attack, Nicholas took it for granted, but instead slammed the death class. But as the fighting time went on, these small, insignificant small wounds had turned into big wounds, and the first wound had spread to half a foot and one inch deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas has escaped!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a deadly battle ended like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The wings vibrated a few times, and could no longer maintain gravity control, slowly falling from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory jumped out of the void and let the powerless *** fall on its back. *** Grab a dragon's horn with the left hand, which stabilizes the body. Her right hand was weak and weak on her side, and the white hand was completely deformed and stained with golden blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory did not stay too much for a moment and jumped back to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class also fell to the ground, and he finally couldn’t hold his hand and a blood spurted out. Although he had the support of the dragon gun, he could not stand, snorted and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but scream: "Let it run away again! This year, this mission is a head, Ahsius, your dragon gun It’s really bad to take the 斩 dragon gun!!” The death class suddenly mourned!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the gun at one end of the dragon has disappeared. The gun is also curved, how ugly it is. Most importantly, the faint glow that has always shrouded in the gun has disappeared!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artifact dragon gun has been ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the death class is extremely depressed, almost crying out. He opened his mouth and looked at the dragon gun that had completely lost his edge. He couldn't say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a rumor passed, Rogge also climbed out of the masonry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the seriously injured Death Class and ***, Rogge is extremely lucky. In addition to the extreme weakness and fatigue caused by the magical overdraft, he can almost be said to be harmless. Rogge was just dizzy, and when he moved a little, it was like sweat and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another person in the field who is more fortunate than Rogge. Hughes was not injured, and he did not even get a little dust. He stood up with his hands and smiled at Rogge. There is a touch of green brilliance on the body of Xius, and a few pieces of green leaves slowly swaying, which is simply the best portrayal of the elegant word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the Hughes at the moment is too out of place with the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge feels that his smile is exceptionally abhorrent, and angered: "Old things! You didn't start from start to finish, why did you let Nicholas run?" He has already hurt like that, why don't you chase?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults," Hughes smiled. "Not my old man doesn't want to chase, but fundamentally I can't chase. In fact, before this magic effect is lifted, I can't figure out the scope of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge carefully observes Hughes, realizing The magic waved and the face suddenly changed. I couldn’t help but scream: "***, it was a sacred refuge... No wonder! Old things, you really act..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Refuge is also a little used magic, which can form an absolute space for a certain period of time. During this time, any attack on a person hiding in the sacred refuge is ineffective. But in the same way, people who have taken refuge can't make any attack, and they can't leave the scope of the refuge before the magic expires. Originally, the most common use of this magic was to rescue the warrior who died in the battlefield center, but Hughes used it on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder, so close to the battle center, there is not even dust on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge’s gradually distorted face, Hughes was busy: “God made the adults, I was restrained, and Nicholas could not fight at all! Otherwise, where do you have so much time to prepare for magic? Of course, God has enabled the adults to successfully display the curse of one of the top magic of the Mozu with the thirteenth level of magic. The subtlety of magic control is simply chasing the big magician!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hughes said yes." Although talking to Rogge, the eyes of the class are always inseparable from the dragon gun that has become scrap iron. "If Nicholas is not divided, the two of us can't support it for so long. The dragon is also very perverted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to testify to Hughes, a pile of rubble not far from the room suddenly burst into a layer of blue light, turned into a crystal in the blink of an eye, and finally burst into a little bit of stardust. Androni took the blue sky and held the wind butterfly in one hand and walked out of the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes said again: "If it wasn’t for God that made your plan sinister and sinister, how can we win so easily? Apply dragon to the dragon The poison is handed over to Nicholas, and this shameless drug can only be imagined!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ignores the ass of the Shus, weak and weak Falling to the ground, almost screaming: "Old things, you see clearly, have we succeeded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults, you only Rest assured, Silver Dragon Nicholas has disappeared. From then on, there is only the Elf Nicholas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s spirit is raging, and he laughs for a while: "* **! Silver Dragon becomes an elf, and he is a few levels of metamorphosis. If you have less strength, you have to make a 20% discount! Hey, choose what is not good, you have to choose the final metamorphosis! Right, then he is now Will the state of serious injury be maintained?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the strength of Nicholas, it is inevitable to resist the seal Part of the effect, so the next time we see it, it will be a sinister Nicholas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed, unable to say: It’s better to face the silver dragon in the face of the elves. Then, how many people do you need to deal with the elf Nicholas?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sank: "As long as there are adults and death classes, the elf Nicholas who can no longer transport Longli will have no return. If only one of them is there, then my old man and Miss Androni, It’s enough to protect yourself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes looked at the Death Class. He knew that letting the Death Class protect himself was almost a luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class snorted and stood up and wanted to leave. The hand was still reluctant to drop the dragon gun that turned into scrap iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death of the Dead" Xiu Si smiled and asked: "Where are you going to go? Our agreement can be finished!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class is a little embarrassed and annoyed: "If Nicholas does not come for a lifetime, I will have to protect this little fat for a lifetime?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: "It seems to be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Death Class is swelled and can't speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class has a red face, but finally it still hasn't nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is right!" Hughes smiled happily. "You have already received my dragon gun. The name of the death class resounds through the dark world. This is handed down." Fame is hard to come by. How can the stigma of the defamation be tarnished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How good is Rogge, though I don’t know what it is, But still said on the side: "As a strong person in the world, you have to pay for it but you don't have to do anything. If it is passed out, it is afraid that it will be sung by the bard for centuries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the death class changed, and it was too crowded to speak. He looked at the dragon gun in his hand and finally sighed with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked at the fierce light, staring at Rogge: "Little fat man! You don't even get too early! I am paid for it." There is still a part that is not taken, maybe it will be the last, the breach of the contract is that you are not me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "I will worry about this later." "No matter what the rewards that Xiusi gave to the death class, Rogge was ready to push the old fox to deal with it." Apparently, Xius used the death class to give him a set of love for the dragon gun. Now that you have already set it up, then you will not have to wait for the second set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A powerful artifact like the Dragon Gun, even if it is difficult to get one in the Sanctuary, so the Death Class will promise to take this difficult task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
