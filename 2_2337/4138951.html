He really hopes that it is just a dream, an illusory, unreal, nightmare that does not need to be thought and responsible. No matter how much frightened in the dream, after waking up, the feeling of trepidation will only become a memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but is that really just a dream? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly found that he could not find the answer to this question. His instinctive reluctance to recall the content of this dream, the huge existence he saw is slowly faded from his mind. As soon as he described his description from memory, Rogge immediately resembled the moment of dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of faces are resurrected, and the number of light converges on him, the moment of the huge sounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even even such a moment is fading out of his memory. This may be a kind of self-protection, because whenever this scene uncontrollably rises from memory, Rogge will relive the unspeakable pain from the soul to the **! This kind of pain associated with fear does not know how many times the pain of the day when Rogge was hurt by the wind and had to be treated with divine power! Until this time, the fat man realized that he was really a very persevering person. This degree of pain and fear did not make him crazy. But his will may be supportive, but his ** has been unable to support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever revisiting dreams, fat people will immediately faint, not only because of pain, but also because of fear and despair. He will wake up again. However, this short vertigo moment, in his feelings, is also like a world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more than just a dream. I don't know when I woke up a few times, Rogge finally came to this conclusion. In fact, this conclusion is very easy, because no nightmare will have such a terrible power, just memories are enough to make the fat man who is hard like blue steel can not support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it does not involve such a huge existence, the memories of some details of this dream will not cause much problems. But everything in this dream. The thick clouds, the unknown metal that makes up the armor, and the light smoke in the metal are far beyond Rogge's perception. Fat people know that these are amazing, but he doesn't know where they are magical. Who is creating this? That created the existence of all these miracles. With such merciful eyes, look down on the lives of countless planes!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog stood up and came to the window. It was already quiet at night, and the whole of Richelieu sank into the deepest dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is still cold, the days are sparsely hung with some cold stars, the blue moon has become a new sprout, sloppily radiating dim blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge came out of his nightmare for the time being. He has been in the past, and he has flowed through his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who opened the domain of the gods alone. That pair of peerless couples who have embraced each other in the flaming flames, the elf girl who was in the last moments of life, who was screaming at the city of the gods, shouting at him and making him hurt and hate. And so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his footprints have already traveled thousands of miles away? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first he climbed up the ladder of power from a degraded aristocratic step by step, from knowing that he was collecting money for himself, and now he has to open up a future for many allies and men. The gap between the two, is it different from the difference? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is lucky. From the moment Rodriguez entered his body, the fate of the fat man was destined to be different. He is also unfortunate, and it is from that moment that he began to grow up and become more and more deeply involved in all kinds of infighting in the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few ideals for those who have a lot of money and a beautiful woman. It seems very ridiculous in today’s Rogge. He is now sitting in a country. The woman of her life, whether it is Androni, Fu Luoya, or Fengdie, Ajiani, Effie, such a unique elf, is a woman who has exhausted her life and is difficult to kiss her. And the target he is now eyeing, but Fengyue, Wella is completely synonymous with terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the fat man is responsible. Around him, there are Pompey, Alexander, political powers who do not know how many strengths are hidden, such as the inscrutable bystanders such as the Great Emperor and the boss. In the Central Mountain Range, there are also unidentified orc empire. Other than that. In the far south. The old body of the pope is like a huge mountain in the memory of Rogge. There is also someone who knows his whereabouts and who has stolen the goddess of nature without knowing it. Think of the power of the goddess of nature. He naturally thought of the goddess of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly remembered the dream, only a heart slowly sinking. The joy brought by the victory of the orcs and the gathering of tens of thousands of elves has long since disappeared. A powerless attack hit my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, I don’t know when it’s overcast. The layers of black clouds that rolled up, surging, like a bottomless mouth, swallowing endless darkness, seemingly to destroy even the light of this human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, the dark clouds dissipated, and the soft and weak sun rose to the sky. When the dim light fell through the thin clouds, there was no warmth, and everything that was sprinkled in Zhaohui seemed to be depressed, and there was no business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sparse forest on the outskirts of the Imperial City, Androni is squatting with Rogge. The anger is blazing. She stares at the fat man with a sullen look. The star shining with anger is like a soul that pierces the fat man. A skirt is also dancing and screaming and flying. But this raging anger has not been able to hide her exhaustion caused by the rushing and wars of the past few days. This tiredness made her go to the British spirit, more feminine, so that Rogge looked at both eyes and heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the sky, the black night had already put away its big wings, and the sun that was not warm was slanting and swaying, driving away the sparse forest Every shade of every silk is dark. The entire sparse forest gradually became brighter. Although the weather is not early, she still gnash her teeth: "Dead fat man. I dare to disturb my dreams! Call me here so early, don't expect me to be merciful! This time I won't be in bed." I can't afford to give up Rosherio's last name!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Rocherio's surname is not important to you, don't say so It’s a grandiose one.” Rogge grinned, unceremoniously piercing her little tricks, and confidently: “According to the agreement. I have the right to choose the venue and attack first. If you lose, then listen to me. Let me dispose of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni's heartbeat is faster. Her face was red first, then she gradually became pale, and her hand holding the starry sky was a little trembling. She really didn't understand why, why didn't she start playing, and she already thought about the consequences of losing the land? How can she not be bad, and shouldn't she lose to a wizard with only 12 levels of magic? Although Rogge’s power is obviously not limited to these magical powers, he has shown his skills in the past. I am fully able to cope with it, as long as it is not as good as the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, she made up her mind that once she started the war, she would go all out to attack and never give the fat man any chance to use intrigue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t think that I will lose, but she has always been arrogant, she decided to bargain again on the conditions of defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I lose, I will dispose of you at most... one day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the gaze of the glance, Androni's face paled and pale, and finally became more and more red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also. If I lose, I will only give you Froya for a day." Rogge does not matter as authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That won't work! I am too bad!" Androni cried, and the anger was a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why not? This is fair!" The fat man smiled badly, staring at Androni's eyes more blazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni gnashed his teeth and said: "Fair ghost! I said but you, but all in all, this is no good! I will not fight with you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you afraid of?" The smile on the fat face is getting worse. Seeing that Androni is about to break out, he just laughed: "So, if I lose, I will give you Fulua for a month, but you can't force her. How do you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is almost the same!" Androni's pretty face was slightly flat and agreed with the fat man's proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled. Ignore her provocation, just concentrate on chanting spells. Not long after, a huge red magic symbol appeared between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimson mark. As long as the creature sees this mark within a certain distance, it may be cursed by pain and lose life. This is not a magic that is so powerful. So when Androni saw Roger cast the magic, he immediately snorted, and the temper was lifted to the highest peak. The whole person instantly turned into a blue meteor, and quickly rushed to Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of meters of the deep red mark can be used by her in the blink of an eye. In such a short time, the magic mark only has time to flash. Once, I sent a painful curse to Androni. Just using this level of magic to attack the martial arts in the Sanctuary, the chance of success is too low. The god of luck does not always stand on the side of the fat, so this painful curse has not been successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the curse is successful, Andreoni’s all-out momentum is enough to knock Rogge within three strokes. The loss of life brought to her by the curse of pain at that time was completely negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni has a long-lasting chestnut-colored hair, and her eyes are as bright as the morning star, locking Rogge's every move. On the tip of the sword on the blue sky, I began to shoot out dazzling stars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog has only two choices, dodge or hard top. Even if he has the ability to instantly send magic, with Andreoni at the speed of the wind, the fat man can have a protective magic at most. No matter how strong he is, no one can defend against the blue sky. Therefore, the only way out for the fat man is to dodge, in order to gain time to make the deep red mark work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man really moved, his body side, the speed rose sharply, and fled to the side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled coldly, and the fat eye was brighter than before, knowing that he could not block his own blow. However, she had already expected the fat man to hide. Therefore, the one-on-one blow is actually an imposing manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sky and the sky made a slamming sound, drawing a beautiful trajectory and stabbing the front of the fat man. With the resilience of the fat man, when it is found that it is wrong, after the emergency stop, the blue sky will be just before his throat. This incredible skill is in line with her identity. She is aesthetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in the moment when the blue sky changed the trajectory, Rogge suddenly turned his head without warning. I rushed straight to Androni! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this change is so sudden, so weird, so incredible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s eyes widened with horror, her lips were slightly open, but she was too late to exclaim, and Rogge had slammed her Hit it together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars fall out of the sky and draw a blue trail in the air. Finally, helplessly inserted on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni groaned, and finally recovered from the dizziness, but still Venus is in front of him. She was a little scared and hurriedly reached out to touch her face. She wanted to see if she was hurt by her face. However, she tried to lift her arm a few times, but it was not moving. She thought of getting up again, but her body was like a huge stone. Where can I stand up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calmed down, and the fighting force forced the discomfort of the body and slowly opened her eyes. Sure enough, the fat man’s face that is so ridiculous is close at hand. Rogge's face was also a bit pale, and it was obvious that he hadn't been so good when he hit it, but it was much lighter than that of Andrew. More terrible is. The dead fat man was lying on her, and she could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very moment, when the rush to Androni turned too fast, Rogge did not add any protection on his body, nor did he attack or Defensive posture. All his strength is used to increase speed. At the time, Androni had just changed his direction and his self-defense strength was very weak. This moment of collision, the two almost equal to no protection to hit together at a very high speed, naturally Roger is physically strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man laughed, even though his smile was a bit reluctant because of the pain: "You still don't admit defeat? Just that time. It is enough for me to kill you three." Five times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted. This is a little bit of strength, anger and sorrow: "Dead fat! What is your play! It is a rogue! This time just your luck. I have not had enough luck to defend myself. Otherwise, you will try this way?" What are you doing! Roll me down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the two had had close contact, even if Androni had been psychologically prepared to accept everything, she still couldn't stand the humiliation of Rogge's unbridled, red luo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put on the cold and cold ground, said: "I certainly remember. You can rest assured, I am not a loser. No matter what you want to do, Give me a hurry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding the Iraqi's face, the fat man is still a rogue face, laughing: "Hurry up, it's all day. Anyway." It can be more than a few times!" While speaking, one of his hands was lightly placed on Androni's chest, staring at her eyes and slowly pressing down. And his other hand slowly sneaked into her clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni closed his eyes in shame and turned his face to the side, his face gradually turned pale. She bit her lip, and the long fingers were deeply inserted into the frozen soil beneath her body. But that's it, she can't control the trembling of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still have this body!" The fat man smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni opened his eyes slightly and looked at Rogge coldly. He said nothing and closed. Only her breathing is getting more and more urgent, her body's trembling is getting more and more intense, and it seems that she will soon reach the limit of patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly stood up and raised Androni again, smiling: "Hey, look at how hard you endure, I am so heartfelt Kindness, I really can't bear it, just spare you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sneaked, then shouted: "You are kindhearted? Really damn If you are not using this shameless style of play, is it possible to win me? The last time is the same! In short, with your strength, it is impossible to win me in real battle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled, his eyes could not walk in her body, and finally fell on her long legs, saying: "I am so kind, I don't appreciate it! Well, I haven't seen you how long these long legs look like for a long time. Anyway, the time of day is very long, I can appreciate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See The fat man forced himself up, and Androni’s face was white again. He had to say: “Leave me away! Good... I admit that you are a good person. ? This is it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; This time Roger would be delighted to cooperate, really stopped. He looked at Androni and said: "I know that you are not convinced, but you don't care what kind of means I used. It is true that you won. I can let you go this time, but it can't be so cheap. You, from today, you have to protect Froya for a month. If you are not satisfied, you can come and challenge me at any time. We are still gambling, you lose, or accompany me for one day, or protect Froya for one month. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni stared at the fat man and said slowly: "In fact, from the beginning, you just wanted me to protect Froya, right?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said, "Even if it is." After that, he cast himself a flying technique, rising to Lissey. Leave to fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni quietly stood still, looking coldly at Rogge’s figure, and suddenly shouted: “Dead fat man You are such a jerk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flies in the air. The flamboyant battle just diluted his depression, but it was nothing more than that. Once you got up and flew, the endless shadows spread quietly from the bottom of your heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the angry cry of Androni, Rogge thought with some self-deprecating thought: "Bastard? Maybe I am really a real person." Bastard! After so long, I haven’t figured out my own things...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also doesn’t understand, how can he be cheap this time? How can she be smashed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the magical energy of the Toto help him slowly weakened, and the fat man knew that it was time to add another flight to himself. This level of magic in flight is said to be high and low. To be instant is very mental, it is a good choice to read a very short spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge spit out a few simple syllables, the magic is arranged in a row, and a new flying eye is put on him. It is a pity that the change will always appear before the moment of success. I don't know why, a small piece of magic in the flying magic suddenly became turbulent and out of his control. Control is a very subtle thing, and a slight dissonance can lead to a magical failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
