			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north of the Holy Alliance, the Azrosk Empire is already a bleak world of whiteness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a vast and uninhabited wasteland. In the snow-covered land season, even a bird in the sky can't see it. The strong gale did not live in the wilderness, screaming with tiny sandstone, ruthlessly scouring the rocks and dead woods in the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, there is a small black spot in the sky that flies across the sky in an unimaginable height and disappears into the clouds in the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dark brown scorpion with three eyes on the forehead, and the middle eye is light blue, which is constantly shining with magic. It flapped its wings with a high flap that the average bird couldn't match. Then it tightened the wings tightly, and the arrow smashed the faint clouds in the sky and went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, a very steep snow peak appears at the end of the wilderness. It is like a huge stalagmite, piercing the clouds in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud around the snow peak is like a big whirlpool, which rotates very gently around the snow peak, and the square is even more than a hundred miles away! The center of the cloud vortex slowly hangs down, and finally half of the snow peaks are covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this heaven and earth vision, anyone who fears will be fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac lightly penetrated into the clouds until it hit the snowy peak like a knife-cut stone wall and turned upwards, flying up against the rock wall . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, at the top of the snow peak, a magnificent castle with a singularity and a strange appearance appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The konjac penetrated the window of a tall tower and landed on a long-lasting magic altar, spitting out a khaki-colored bead. In a smog, the konjac slowly turned into a middle-aged man with a cyan face. He bowed with great respect and slowly pulled out of the room from a small door and carefully closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen or so old people stood around the altar and were reading the information recorded in the magic beads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, a burly old man in the middle finally opened his mouth, his voice is far and pleasant, as if it came from the far-reaching sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smart elders, what do you think of this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a danger The person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His path has nothing in common with Druid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He is very young, but the strength is not low..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will continue to grow...".<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behind his power, there seems to be a shadow, it is even more terrible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a conspiracy and The avatar of the trick..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man in the middle nodded, his white robes decorated with snowfields, mountains and thick clouds seemed to follow his movements. Lived up, the snow began to snow, and the thick clouds rolled between the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cold wind blowing in the window, and his white feet were a few feet long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders, this is already a conclusion. For us, he is a very dangerous person. Is it possible for him to join us? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders were silent for a while, only after a while, only four elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have occupied the entire forest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is still growing up The little tree..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature is balanced, trees that a forest can grow are limited..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man in the middle concludes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The conclusion is that this small tree can no longer grow in this forest."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders looked at each other, and an old man replied with a voice full of wisdom: "This is the way, the wrath of the sky is angry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raging voice of the sky is more chilling and the smell of chilling<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This decision, immediately executed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders all quit the room, leaving only the wrath of the sky. He stood in front of the altar and pondered for a long time, until the sky outside the window had dimmed, and then he clap his hands gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was opened, and a young girl in a white robe walked in. Her eyes were deep blue, and there was no warmth inside. The voice is also cold like ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wisdom of the sky, anger, what do you have to order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freund Is it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Frey has taken his immediate troops to the Principality of Aray. It is expected to arrive five days later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky nodded silently, and he slowly walked over to the window, looking out at the window, the horrible, endless cloud vortex. This tall tower is the tallest building in the whole castle. From here, the clouds are at the foot, like a dark gray sea. From time to time, huge faces of tens of meters are emerged from the clouds, and the spins dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl stood quietly, like a statue. When she is standing still, if she does not pay attention, she may actually regard her as a white jade statue. Because she has no emotional fluctuations at all, there is no temperature on her body. The beauty of the face flashes the luster of the jade, slippery and cold, and the two shallow scars on the left cheek are also like chiseling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can't see any feelings in her eyes, if she looks at it carefully, there will be a lot of clouds in her eyes, lightning and thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it takes for the old man and the girl to become two stone statues...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The wrath of the sky finally spoke up. "You can get out of the ice wind so soon, it's amazing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls still like a The stone statue without life does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the sky seems to have known this for a long time, and did not wait for the girl’s answer, just a long sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as if there are countless hurries in the sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know your wish...you go too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl finally got A trace of anger, she gave a deep ritual to the old man, and then slowly quit the room as if she was sliding on the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon tea meeting prepared by Grand Duke Creek for Rogge encountered a rare sunny weather. The three sons and six daughters of Dagong attended the tea party, and the most powerful aristocrats and husbands of the Principality were also present. Of course, the palace magician Gnawala is indispensable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the impression of all the great nobility, the old court magician has never been dressed like a regular magician in recent years. Instead of wearing his favorite black embroidered cloak, he replaced a cloak decorated with a magical symbol, holding a beautifully crafted magic wand. Some of the aristocrats who have practiced magic a little can sense the faint magical fluctuations on his magical cloak and luxurious cane. This shows that this is a genuine magical equipment, not just a decorative accessory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is still a dark green cloak. After handing the cloak to the waiter, he reveals a breastplate that shows the craftsmanship and artistic beauty of the elf. The decorative branches on the breastplate are like life. This breastplate is a masterpiece of the Sala artists. It is tailor-made for Rogge with incomparable beauty and handcraft. It fully considers Rogge's looks and body shape, and skillfully deceives it with a combination of lines, colors and patterns. The eyes of everyone. Now, with the fat body shape of the fat man, after wearing this breastplate, they all look smart and savvy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats who know how to do it all show their horrifying and awkward eyes. It is only the artistic value of this breastplate that is enough to buy a territory of a small aristocrat. The ladies' eyes were extremely enthusiastic. Even the daughters of Grand Duke of Crick, whether married or unmarried, looked openly at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one now doubts how rich a great magician will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Rogge wore an all-steel breastplate, Gennawala was surprised first, followed by ecstasy. The obstacle to the magic effect of metal is the common sense that every magic apprentice will know. Rogge wears an all-steel breastplate in order to show off his wealth! Although Gennawala had to admit that he could not afford such an expensive magic breastplate, in the magical battle, the armor of tens of thousands of gold coins is not as good as the magic scroll of a few hundred gold coins. If it wasn’t for magical crystals that Rogge was indeed the magic of the eleventh level, Gennawala would not believe that he was a magician anyway, he had never heard of a magician who would wear a piece on his body. All-steel breastplate. Although the breastplate seems to have strengthened the protection against magic, but this protection can not make up for the loss of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, it seems that my luck is still so good!" Gennawala smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he saw that Roger had no elf guards, he laughed even more happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a wonderful afternoon tea party. All the people, Grand Duke, Danro and Carlos, and two magicians are so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnawala can’t wait. He is like returning to the time when he and the adventurer challenged Warcraft in his youth. At that time, the battle was thrilling but there was a certain victory, just now. However, he is a court magician with status. Unlike Roger, a magician who is unclear and obviously half a bucket of water, he is not good at challenging Rogge. He needs an excuse and reason. However, Gennawala is not worried, he knows that Danro will arrange all of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, just as he was losing patience, finally a Miss Earl began to ask about the glorious deeds of Rogge’s seal. Rogge responded politely to her question, but her eyes could not help but swear to the aunt, the most beautiful daughter of Grand Duke. If Auntie intentionally sneaked at Rogge unconsciously, her mouth floated with a proud and reserved smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After knowing the first few brief narratives of the seal demon, Rogge finally satisfied the curiosity of the countess. However, the trouble immediately came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Rogge, who is your magical ability and master Guernwara? It must be you, you sealed the ancient demon! A mature and gorgeous lady asked me eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very obvious provocation, but Gennawala is hard to wait until this opportunity, where will he let it go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Rogge, I am also a magician. I would like to take the liberty to ask, is your seal really ancient demons?" Gennawara Asking about geology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a calming down in the tea room, and Gennawala’s words were tantamount to swearing that Rogge was a liar! In the upper class, this is the invitation to duel. Except for Tikrick, all the people are now eagerly looking forward to a grand magic showdown. It’s just that Dagong has a good chance of having two magicians. He doesn’t want to hurt any of them. It’s too much loss for the Ayre Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for him to stand up and stop, Rogge replied coldly: "Master Gennawala, are you accusing me of being a liar? Deceived all the noble gentlemen and ladies here? I deceived the beautiful Miss Auntie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie screamed, covering his mouth with a fan. In her eyes, there is a light of excitement and pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnawara said arrogantly: "I only know that the inability to wear metal armor is a fact that every magic apprentice knows. I only know that ancient devils The power of the world is not something that ordinary people can imagine! Although I am the eleventh-level magician like you, I have to say that the ancient devil's close-knit servant can easily beat me! I don't know what method you used to seal. What about the ancient demons? It seems that no one has seen you how to seal the devil except for you and your elves. Maybe your performance can deceive many people. After all, there are not many people who know the mystery of magic, but unfortunately Forty years of magical career gave me some wisdom and vision that enabled me to see the truth behind these gorgeous appearances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world of magic is deep and vast. Although you have already been a court mages, you obviously have not yet grasped this. The prosperity of Ronghua not only weakens your magic, but also damages your wisdom. Since you proposed I doubt, then I am happy to let you know what the magic of the 11th level can do. Can I understand your doubts as a challenge?" Rogge replied coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's my pleasure!" Gennawala replied coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a group of nobles came to the military field on the edge of Miyagi, and all the nobles were hiding from the high platform to watch the battle. A wide range of magical shields is a very extravagant thing. To protect such a large group of nobles, I am afraid that Fuluya may not be able to do it, let alone the two second-rate magicians of Gennawala and Rogge. It is. So although everyone wants to watch the magic showdown that they only see in their lives, it is not a joke to be involved in magic, so they stay on a relatively safe high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Gnawala are 50 meters apart, waiting quietly for the ceremony official to announce the beginning of the duel. Rogge's sharp eyes have already been secretly holding two magic scrolls in his hands, and the magic wand also stores ready-made magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge did not use the magic wand and did not take off his breastplate. Gennawala is overjoyed, and only wants to say: "This is your own death, but you can't blame me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I announced, duel...begin!" etiquette The official voice of the official voice echoed in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremonial official voice just fell, Gennawala put a magic wand, the magic stored in it instantly, a faint magic mask caught him The whole body. This is a low-level spell ‘magic absorption’ that can cope with most of the fast-moving small attacking spells, which is the most orthodox tactic of the magician. Subsequently, Gennawala, who added the protective magic, once again launched two magic scrolls, and each of them added a mask to defend against evil and ghosts. He was able to sing a spell with confidence and began to prepare for a large attack magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost Mask can enhance the magician's dodge of magical damage and physical damage, which is one of the absolute orthodox magical tactics. But why do you still have to defend against evil? Rogge knew what it was, and it was originally Gennawala who wanted to summon powerful evil creatures. Powerful summoning creatures are unwilling to be controlled, and some creatures that directly attack the range of sight. There is no doubt that the summoning magician himself is the one closest to these evil creatures. This magic can make the summoned evil creature completely ignore the existence of the summoning mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiles evilly. Since he summoned the evil creatures, it is logical to put Gregory or the Flame Bones out one by one. What can the four levels of the Master summoned, how can they be stronger than the two wicked men? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited patiently, but he was surprised to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the Gnawala spell, a purple-black pillar of fire rose up at the foot of Rogge and wrapped him all in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos exclaimed in the stands, nervously stood up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark Magic?" The fat man is not too surprised. The effect of practicing dark magic on the magician's reputation is not small! When he thought about it, he realized that Gennawala must be a bully. There is no magic culture in the Principality of Aray. No one can see the difference between the magic. This is the unscrupulous practice and the use of powerful dark magic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this dark column is powerful, but it is useless for Rogge. The powerful mental power of the fat man has given him a high level of magic resistance, and the magic resistance has been enhanced after swallowing the green dragon blood. The fat man sighs, what magic does he make, is it necessary to make dark magic? How can Gennawala compare to Rogge who studied the magic of the Princess Elise in the Devil? In addition to the lack of magic, Rogge is already familiar with the manipulation of the black flame. Only he and Gnavara can control the first level of dark fire, compared with Elysses's sinus rhythm, although the shape is the same, but the power is far worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Rogge stood there motionless. He had a faint black flame across his body, separating Grenawa's dark column. However, no one can tell that there is actually another layer of magical protection in the dark column of the flaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha!" Gennawala smirked triumphantly. Rogge was useless, but he didn't think of it. He was burned directly by the dark column. It was the strongest knight in the Principality. It was not a few seconds. Rogge stayed in it for so long, and it must have been grayed out. He now has some heartache Rogge's breastplate, hoping it will withstand the burning of the dark flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gennawala saw his eyes fall out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mystery of magic, is this shallow person you can understand?" Rogge smiled, waving between five purple-black magic missiles Fly to Gonawara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Magic absorption has been dealt with!" Seeing Rogge waved his hand and released the magic, Gennawala was scared of a cold sweat. To be seen as a magic missile, he just let go of his heart and began to prepare a second powerful magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic absorption has dealt with ordinary magic missiles, but it is just too good to deal with Roger's magical missiles that mix the magical blacks. The fat man has already calculated the limits of the magic absorption that Gnawala has released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After blocking the four magic missiles, in the horror of Grenawa, the magic shield flashed a few times and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth magic missile hits the face of Gonawara right after it. After a small explosion, a scorching smell spreads. Gennawala screamed and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He twitched for a long time before he struggled to get up, and now Danro, the turn of the stands, exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnawala has a black face and a thin blood line in his left eye, which is obviously awkward. He endured severe pain, stood up trembling, and his right eye was blood red, staring at Rogge. The anger of losing the left eye almost completely lost his reason! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to admit that your despicableness has come to my imagination! But... everything is not over!" he screamed. Yes, everything is not over yet, he has the last move! Now, as long as he kills Rogge, which one will be defeated in the future? The same level 11 magician, Rogge can not deal with his last move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnawala smirked and crushed the crystal skull on the wand in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exclamation of countless aristocrats, a door of the alien bone formed by a bone and flame appeared in the square, up to four meters, the flames burning around the body The lord, the strongman in the undead, stepped out from the door of the alien. It has a huge Warcraft skull, with four huge corners curled up. The two-inch-thick iron armor is sturdy and full of rust and scratches. A three-meter-long giant sword slanted on its shoulder, and the blade was covered with gaps and rust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s heart jumped, and he never thought that Gnawala actually possessed magical props that might summon the lords. He wanted to defeat Ghana Walla's summoning creatures magnificently, but he would deal with the lord who is not weaker than the flame bones. He must make a full copy to win. The lord of the lord is different from the ordinary creature that the magician can summon with his own magic. This is the evil existence that can only be summoned by special powerful props! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were flames flashing on the four huge corners of the main head, and the formidable two-handed sword was removed from the shoulder and pointed to Luo. grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger had no choice, the silvery light began to flash in his eyes. He gave himself a boost, a strong and a stone skin, and prepared to fight a long battle with the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill him! Kill him! Kill all the people here! Ah hahaha!" Gennawala screamed and laughed wildly. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord’s fear field spread to the stands. The nobles of the Principality are in chaos, and you push me to squash and flee from the stands! There were a few ladies and ladies who were scared to kneel on the ground, and then they were trampled by the aristocrats who had no choice but to make a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a faint wave of ripples filled the entire square. ***The clear, majestic, only the sound that Rogge can hear suddenly echoed on the square! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my name, the contract is lifted! In my name, I am obeying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The air seems to have solidified in the square, and the fear of the raging waves has nailed everyone firmly to the ground. This is the pressure of the ***, this pressure has completely dispelled the fear of the lord, and replaced it with a deeper fear of deeper soul! All the nobles had solidified at this moment, and they had completely lost control of the body and could not do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord trembled, the huge skeleton and the extremely heavy armor could not collide, and there was a deafening noise. The blood-red flame in his eyelids flickered and flickered. After jumping a few times, he finally turned completely pale, and the flame that burned around him changed color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremor of the lord stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned around and a sword cut the horrified Gonawara into two paragraphs! Later, it did not return to the door of the outer world, but entered the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the outside world disappeared, and the square re-emerged brightly, just as if the storm of fear that wanted to destroy everything suddenly disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked up at the sky and his face was very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility of the fart is still not recovering from fear, they still maintain a crowded escape posture. Many of the lady's long skirts that fell to the ground had already revealed a water stain, and some of the original gentlemen were equally embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s already clear, time still seems to be fixed in the previous moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly took a deep breath and turned to the nobles. His deep, magnetic voice has strong self-confidence and calmness, swaying all the fears and panic in the hearts of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil has been taken over by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles burst into a burst of cheers, and the joy of escape in the dead made many people cry and cry. More nobles rushed to Rogge and wanted to hug the people who saved them from the flames of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and generously stretched out and embraced the grateful people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the fat man is as holy as an angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was so familiar that only the praise that Rogge heard was ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too mean! Too shameless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosie's bone dragon this time The praise was surprisingly simple, and it hurried away after two roars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon is worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it wants to stay and continue to watch the movie, it is more anxious to return to the owner’s side to shoot the horse. The newcomer is very strong. To ensure that you are in the right position, you must be more diligent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late at night. The night winds of the deep winter roared and drove all the pedestrians back into the warm bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tricky's luxurious harem is warm and radiant, and the dark red magical light makes everything shine. More than ten glamorous dancers who are almost naked are self-expanding arms, stretching their legs, swinging their hips, twisting their waists, and dancing enthusiastically and indulgently. Their upper body is completely, with colorful oil paintings depicting various beasts, and several tassels barely block the secret. At the time of the pulsation, the golden tassels are scattered, and the mysterious scenery will flash in front of more than a dozen pairs of fascinating eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, sitting around Tikick is a very close confidant of Dagong. After the death of Gennawala, Rogge took over the position of the court magician, and he was sitting next to Tikick. This dinner gave Rogge a new understanding of the winds of the Principality of Aray. On this occasion, several daughters of the Grand Duke of Tikke and the two marquis were actually present, and they laughed and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos is full of red light and spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gannavala’s call to the lord even threatened the life of Tikick, so Danro was also pleaded with sin, and was slain by the squad Stay in the government, do not get a step. Although the Grand Duke has not officially announced the deprivation of Danro's heir qualification, the aristocrats with a keen sense of smell know that Carlos, who is supported by the great magician Rogge, became the heir to the throne, just one day later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From afternoon to evening, Carlos feels like a hell of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of atmosphere is the best time to do political transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Trick has never been so comfortable in the past decade or so. Rogge very much agreed to the request of taking over the court of the Principality. With the great magician of Rogge, he is no longer a small character in the Holy Alliance. The glorious era of the Tickrick family will soon appear in his hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, Rogge’s interest in the Luck Territory is simply too small. Carlos had just proposed for Rogge, and Tikick did not want to accept it, and told him to handle it. The size of the territory is one of the symbols of aristocratic identity, and Rogge’s territory is full of thousands of square kilometers! But this land is worthless in the eyes of Tikrick, except for the original small territory of Earl Luck, which is a large number of mountains in the Central Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos did not understand this. The mountain was never explored because of its steep terrain and numerous Warcraft. There was no map. Why is Rogge so interested in this barren land? But in any case, this reward sounds quite big, in fact, did not spend a penny of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of the seal is to have an identity, and Hilley has done a good job and has already considered this. He has chosen a family name that has a long history, noble bloodlines, and cut off the descendants. At that time, as long as the Grand Duke signed the warrant, Rogge could inherit the surname, and it would be a good thing to receive the title and receive the seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the banquet is getting more and more enthusiastic, the dancers have already made a thin sweat, and the movement has completely become the most primitive teasing. Carlos raised the glass and sang: "Let's get rid of the great magic of the great magician Rogge to remove the demon summoner Gennawala!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A piece of screaming sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood up with a glass of wine and smiled and said: "Please allow me to dedicate this little glory to the most beautiful and noble Miss Auntie! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie exclaimed, covering his mouth and shyly bowing his head, his eyes were watery, but he couldn’t help but scream at Rogge...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day was bright, the party was finally scattered. Rogge now lives in the Carlos House, so he is in the same car as the second drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards are exhausted and sleepy. A dozen guards rode on the horse, and they all swayed east and west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is also a little tired, the dancers in the Grand Palace are still very tasteful. Of course, when the men began to revel, Auntie and a few ladies quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly felt a bit murderous in the air. These days, the special training for him immediately had an effect. He immediately fell asleep, and his mental power spread to a few tens of meters, searching for the source of murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s not an undead, but a dozen assassins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assassins used to be powerful military hards! Under such a close distance, the guards could not dodge. In the blink of an eye, nearly half of the guards screamed and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A robe masked assassin climbed onto the roof, he sang a spell, and a large bowl of fireball flew to the carriage.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Xun searched around with his mental power, and determined that except for this low-level magician, the rest of the assassins were very ordinary warriors. This level of sneak attack is not in the eyes of the fat man. Watching the fireball fly, he arbitrarily propped up a magic shield to protect the entire carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wave of fire, the magician on the roof was surprised to see that the carriage was still intact! He just wanted to cast another spell, but now all his muscles have not listened to the command, and even the tongue can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ‘powerful paralysis’ magic is not something that his low-level magician can resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge later released more than a dozen intensive magic missiles, each of which was spread by one. The screams of the moment were one after another. The horrible guards screamed at the moment when the assassins were hit by the magical missiles, and they fought back. In the blink of an eye, more than half of the assassins fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
