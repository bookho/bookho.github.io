			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This winter, Dresden is an eventful autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the night of the death of the old man, the new Dagong Carlos was on the throne. This time, the officials of the big and small aristocracy were busy, and no one could tell whether the funeral or celebration should be performed at this time. In the end, it was decided to hold a three-day celebration to show the fact that the new Dagong of the Holy Alliance had already taken the throne, and then held a month of funeral to remember for the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the great things of these nobles are not important to the ordinary people of Dresden, and even more impact on their hearts is the great cleansing of the death of the Grand Duke. The city has never had a massacre of this size for decades. Although the army and the security police began cleaning the entire city the next day, the faint bloody suffocation could not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cold, sad season for the citizens of Dresden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the aristocracy officials were busy, Rogge sent a quick horse back to the news, he was ready to return to Dresden, just in Married to Auntie in a week. The officials of the next aristocracy collapsed completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court magician and the sister of Carlos Dagong, the wedding of Princess Auntie is definitely not a trivial matter. However, time was so rushed, many cumbersome etiquette had to be cancelled, and the envoys of national gifts were too late to be invited. But Carlos still did everything possible to make this wedding a grand occasion. He understood that his power was all supported by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small, single-family home in the southeast corner of Dresden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no eye on the surface of this house, and no one is in or out. When the night was low, a carriage without any mark quietly stopped at the door. A maid knocked the door very rhythmically, and the door opened silently, letting the chariot enter the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very handsome middle-aged man in the house, and the shorts on his lips were neatly trimmed, and the taste of the playboy was revealed. He rushed to the front of the carriage, holding a lady who was coming down from the car in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My angel! You finally came, why is it so late today? Don't you know, how is the wait? I wait a little longer. Minutes, I will have a white one for you on my head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady smirked and said gently: "Dear Clark Count There is never a white on your head. The wedding time is too short. I tried a day of clothes and jewelry today, and I am very tired. But am I still rushing to see you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark’s face passed over a cloud and angered: “You refused my proposal for more than a dozen times, but agreed to marry the magician like the pig. Are you really sincere? Do you like him? Or is it just because he is a magician? Are you marrying a magician? You say, if this is the case, I am willing to learn magic and come back to challenge him! Auntie! You It’s my angel, how can I tolerate giving you to someone else?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie is in the lips Tree up the index finger and gently said: "Dear Clark, don't be so loud! There are a lot of people around him, we can't be too arrogant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark blushes and cries out, "Don't I be afraid of him? Although he is a magician, although he has hundreds of Elf Guards, our Clark family is one of the three major families of the Layton Kingdom. My uncle is One of the three marshals of the Kingdom of Leighton, the army that has the right to mobilize is 15,000! Can he dare to move me, he dares to be an enemy of the Kingdom of Leighton... Hey!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie saw him screaming louder and louder, and hurriedly kissed his mouth. They kissed and kissed, and the breath was heavy. Clark picked up the aunt and hurried into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything that happens in the night, like a small spray, quickly disappears into the raging sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after Rogge returned to Dresden, his wedding with Auntie was held as scheduled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aristocracy of the Ayre Principality is present, but compared to the importance of the wedding itself, this wedding can be said to be too rudimentary. Due to the short time for the preparation of the wedding, there was no country in the Holy Alliance to send a congratulatory message. Only a few of the envoys who participated in the Carlos Ascension Ceremony and the Tikke Grand Duke's funeral ceremony and had not had time to return to the country attended the wedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, another wedding was held, but it was almost the attention of the whole big 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first rays of the sun shone on the splendid golden dome of St. Peter's Cathedral, a shrine was sung in the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand ceremonial knights gathered from all directions and arranged neatly in the square in front of the church. The bright red carpet was directly attached to the church gate from the center of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony of more than ten countries reached the square under the guidance of the ceremonial officials. They all wore their own dresses and gathered together to form a bright color. The river has added a lot of warm colors to this chilling winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10 o'clock in the morning, a white carriage was escorted by ninety-nine knights to the front of St. Peter's Cathedral. The Bavarian Grand Duke in a gold armor walked down the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage extended a hand with white gloves, and Dagong gently held the jade hand, and Catherine in the snowy white dress also walked down from the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hymn of the air entered, and the St. Peter's Basilica has a faint light. The church's heavy oak door opened, and the ten red archbishops came out to meet the unusual newcomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A golden armor of the Bavarian Grand Duke, carrying Catherine’s hand, slowly entered the church under the guidance of ten archbishops of red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope put on the robe, holding the holy book in front of the icon, welcoming the newcomer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is very noble today, she is like an ivory statue, the whole person seems to be soft light. The light gait that her eyes flow like a stepping wave is like an angel coming to earth. Even the eyes of the pope's dim flowers opened slightly, and the nod was nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Pope, stood with Augustus wearing a ceremonial armor. The blood angel completely converges on the murderous and bloody taste of the body today, and the whole person stands quietly as if it is integrated with the entire church. If you don't look closely, you won't notice that the Megatron 6 character is standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong and Catherine came to the Pope to stand and wait for the blessing of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s trembling hands opened the Holy Scriptures, and the old voice finally sounded: “Rheinhardt William, even in the name of God, you are willing to marry you. A woman, and give her happiness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandfather and smile: "I am willing! I am willing to use the Millennium Dynasty, Wanli Jiangshan as the most beautiful Catherine. Miss Cleopatra's dowry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus, who is hidden in the dark, has a slight jump in his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So" the Pope has turned over a page of the Holy Scriptures, "Catherine Rosello, you are willing to marry the man around you, and promise a lifetime "Is it not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to be Catherine Rossorio, not only his best wife, but also the Millennium Lionheart Dynasty A strong pillar! When my husband is out, I will not only prepare a warm home for him, but will also take care of the conquered territory for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This time, even the Pope has some movements. The old pope looked carefully at Catherine from behind the thick crystal flower mirror. She stood there in peace, calmly watching with the pope, and the arrogance and holiness of the arrogance made the pope feel bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope looked at Augustus and caught a smile on the corner of the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulge in, the pope stretched out a dry hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong and Catherine's hands are held together and stretched forward. The Pope's dry hand gently tapped the hand they held together, and the entire St. Peter's Basilica suddenly seemed to have life. Every heartbeat of the Pope would bring a heavy response from the church. Slowly, even the entire square, even the city of Lille, began to tremble with the pope's heartbeat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the knights on the square are exposed in awe, and the citizens of Lille City, regardless of what they are doing, put down their work. Standing respectfully, facing the direction of St. Peter's Cathedral, praying devoutly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pope's vigorous voice sounded: "In the name of the Lord, the grace of the Lord! The Lord said that the name of the Lionheart will be passed down for thousands of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge holy The light column rises in the St. Peter's Cathedral, and there are countless shining angels flying around the pillars of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who saw this scene, whether he was a knight, an envoy, an ordinary citizen, a humble servant, collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the Most High God, all life is the same humble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ceremony of the blessing, the pope’s face seemed to be a bit old. He closed the holy scripture and restored the old-fashioned look, slowly saying: My child, bless you! May you spread the gospel of the Lord to every corner of the Great 6."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step in the sacred cathedral Bavarian Grand Duke and Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are 3,000 ceremonial knights on one side of the square, and the envoys of the national ceremonies on the other side. There are between one hundred and five hundred national knights behind each country’s envoy. This time, the national envoys brought the most elite knights in the country. The number of knights represents the military strength of each country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One team of the Grand Duke team looked over the past, although the countries that came, how many knights he came to have been familiar with the chest. But at this moment, he still can't help but boil the blood in his heart! In front of him, there seemed to be a fierce battlefield composed of fire and blood. It won't take long for these knights to smash all the obstacles on the way forward in the direction of his sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wedding is also a congratulation to the military and political alliance declarations. Today, six countries formed a Lionheart alliance in the city of Lille in the Principality of Bavaria, forming a war machine with a population of 20 million and an army of 120,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the number of light on the square, Old Rhinehart slammed out the long sword and pointed his sword at the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is waiting for the breath, waiting for his long sword to fall, waiting for Rheinhardt’s sword to point out the league’s first goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinhardt’s long sword slowly descends, pointing southeast. In that direction, it is located in the kingdom of the Rhine Union. Over the Rhine City, there are more than ten countries of different sizes. Further southeast, it is the great empires of the Flemish Empire. The southern part of the Flemish Empire is the ocean of endless storms. On the other side of the storm ocean, there is an unknown big 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred years ago, the largest jihadist corps in the Guangming Church was from the Flemish Empire, expedition to the mysterious aliens, trying to spread the gospel of the Most High God to the world. the edge of. But after going out to sea, there is no news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bang of the loud noise, thousands of knights in the square all pulled out the sword, thousands of knights with the sword, pointing to the southeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the newcomer is in the mood, it is always the time when the old people are frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a courtyard in the Grand Duchy. Because Rheinhardt was married today, all the maids and servants were preparing for the wedding, and the courtyard seemed very deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an elegant two-story building in the courtyard. The lawn in front of the building and the garden behind the building are all written by masters. The pools, rocks and trees are scattered. Ingenious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in harmony with the festive atmosphere of the city of Lille, a room on the second floor is crying low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged lady is crying in front of the dressing table. Although the years have already carved marks on her face, she still can't hide her noble temperament. Her charm is still very moving, and she must be a beautiful and beautiful woman when she is young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman holds a picture in her arms and strokes the face on the portrait while sobbing. The person in the painting is amazed by the already-dead Orphey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a maid in the house who also accompanied her in tears. She occasionally persuaded the lady to say a few words, only to make her cry more sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Madam, don't be sad... Dagong is the head of a country, maybe he is not worth it..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid knew her duty very much, and she didn't dare to talk about this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady calmed down some of the first beauty of the kingdom, and I heard that she is not only beautiful, but also very scheming. Have you heard her rumors in the next person? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress hesitated for a moment, and whispered: "Everyone is secretly rumoring that the new king has never been emotionally affectionate to anyone since childhood. There is no feeling like anything. Being a person is like a machine. It is fair, rigorous, and has no human feelings. Madam, these words are from the people of Marshal Rosio, how I heard it, how to tell you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady nodded and said coldly: "She is not without feelings, but too rational and too arrogant." In addition to Rheinhardt in the Rhine League, no one can make her see it, it is worth her emotions. Even if it is Rheinhardt, if it is not because of miracles, it will not be put in her eyes. After Fei Li and Catherine came, there would be no more place in the Grand Duchy. Although I lost Orpheus, I lost the meaning of life and nothing to do with anything. But after all, I am the Austrian-Hungarian imperial family, to maintain the dignity of the Austro-Hungarian emperor, so I can never be tempted by these second-rate aristocratic women. Would you like to go back to the Austro-Hungarian Empire with me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid said: "Mrs, where are you, where will Philly follow?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady nodded and wiped away the tears. You are looking for someone to inform the Austro-Hungarian Empire to pay tribute to the Earl of Burhan, let him arrange it. I am going back to the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the evening! I don’t want to stay in this place for a day! Go and do it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferry quit the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady meditated for a while, started a few pages of letterheads, and raised the quill, and the smooth and beautiful swashes flowed out at the nib:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Rheinhardt:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please forgive me for leaving you at this time and leaving the Bavarian Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you can understand me and understand me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our dearest After the Philippines left me, my whole world has collapsed. He is so important to me, he used to be all our meaning and pride! Now, when I see everything in the Grand Palace, I will remember him, as if he was yesterday. Just left. My broken heart is hard to bear this pain, so I have to choose to leave, choose to end our 20 years of meeting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please forgive me, Abandoning our vows that we will never leave......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of tears fell and wet the letter paper. The lady hurriedly folded the letterhead and placed it in the corner of the dressing table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the portrait of Orfey Roque, staring, and said lowly: "My child, my mother could not protect you, but my mother won't let you It’s so unclear to die. What does the mother say is also the royal family of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the child, the mother will find out the person who killed you...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When the war in the south became more and more dense, Rogge of the Northland began to feel the severity of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more adventurers in Dresden, almost all of them are full. Every night, all the pubs are full of noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Dresden was a curfew system, but after the influx of adventurers, Rogge canceled the system. He wants the adventurer's energy to be somewhat consuming from all-night drinking and fighting. However, he soon underestimated the temptation of the elves. The adventurers who flocked in groups had already lost control. The number reported by the Legal Affairs Department alone has reached nearly a thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge believes that in the next half month, the number of adventurers who flock to the Ayre Principality will pass the number of Snow Bear Knights. At that time, perhaps with a small fuse, these lawless adventurers would turn over Dresden as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legal Affairs Department counts only open-minded adventurers. Large slave hunters and thieves usually choose to sneak into or sneak into the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the fat man secretly monitors the movements of all the large caravans, and on the one hand, he has seized all the time to arm his ‘the dark side of the moon’. The newly arrived 40,000 poison arrows made him feel a lot of peace of mind, but the fat man still felt inadequate, and specially adjusted the dark side of a batch of poisons. All the swords of the elves were also coated with poison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in adventurers, the staff of the Legal Affairs Department will soon be insufficient. Finally, the adventurer couldn’t help but started to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger frowned and looked at a report in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the two elves disappeared in Dresden, and Rogge immediately set up a manpower to trace. As a result, the Snow Bear Knights intercepted a dozen at the border. The large adventure group of people found two elves that were disguised. Then a fierce battle broke out between the snow bear knight and the adventurer. After paying more than a dozen knights, the Snow Bear Knights also killed nine adventurers and captured four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now what Rogge is facing is how to deal with the four adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the decree issued by the Grand Duke of Trick, the people who captured the elves without authorization were all sold according to the masses, and should be sent to the gallows. But how these people die, is still very learned. The adventurers who came to Dresden are far from being strong, and the strongest is just the 9th and 10th. The real powerhouse is not going to seek this advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge dare not take it lightly, and when the city of the gods is exposed, high-level adventurers and hunters will appear. The attraction of a large number of elves is fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man repeatedly paced in the room and finally made up his mind. He clap his hands and a guard came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To post the notice, three days later in the East Square of Dresden, the four adventurers were fired!" He decided to give these adventurers a little Look at the colors, it is best to let them know and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the guards took the lead, Rogge thought for a moment, this time he played a magical golden bell, and Ajani came in like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ajia Ni, inform the butterfly that they are ready, three days later we will execute the adventurers who dare to catch me! We need to sit on the spot, These adventurers are not honest guys, they must guard against them. Remember to bring masks and poison on the swords, and the magic arrows are also brought. Also, the wizards who informed the gallery all lived with me, the gallery. Let’s turn off for a while.” Ajani responded. Even if she accepts the order, she is just as gentle and pleasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge originally brought more than a dozen Sarah Elf artists and opened a gallery in Dresden for paintings, statues and other crafts. The art from the hands of the elves immediately became the new fashion of the upper class of the Principality. The two elves who were hijacked this time were two painters, a man and a woman. What makes Rogge and the elves extremely angry is that both of them have been brutally violated! Two of the four adventurers caught were women, and Rogge stared at the jailer, giving them a little more pain before they died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger stood in front of the large window, looked at the hustle and bustle of the city, sneered, and thought: "The elf is the private property of Laozi! You dare to stretch your claws." In the pocket of Laozi, Laozi will let you down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm Dresden is now chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers are a lawless group, they travel through the mountains and rivers, eager to take advantage of the opportunity to get rich overnight. There are also many adventurers who want to hone martial arts or seek fame. No matter what kind of adventurer, no law will be put in the eye. Their personal combat power will be better than the average regular knight, so the adventurers full of heroic romanticism will not put the regular army in their eyes, unless the world famous Knights of the Golden Lion Knight will get their respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thousands of adventurers flocked to Dresden, local law and order immediately deteriorated, because thieves are almost a must-have for every adventure group. At the same time, without the presence of a magician, an adventurous group can not be called powerful. There are now more than a dozen magicians in the city of Dresden. In terms of quantity, it has almost passed the sum of the past 100 years. It's just that these magicians are mostly rookies, basically not going to five levels, not to mention that compared with Fu Luoya, even one or two can match Guernwala. Fortunately, the fat man still managed to cope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the execution day, four fire columns were erected on the square, and large bundles of firewood were piled under the stake. On the side of the square, a stand was temporarily set up. Now Rogge and the elves guardian warriors are sitting on the stands. The fat man also specially invited the powers of more than a dozen principalities to join the nobles of other countries in the Holy Alliance to watch the fire. This is a popular traditional entertainment program among the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For safety, Rogge guarded the 100 archers of the 'Dark Side of the Moon' and the 100 swordsmen around the high platform. The adventurer will start with the elf who placed the order, but for the time being, he will not deal with the elves' army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation is somewhat unexpected. Early in the morning, the adventurers began to flock to the square from all corners of Dresden. When four bruised and bloody adventurers were tied to the stake, the adventurers gathered in the square had already passed thousands. In contrast, the high platform guarded by two hundred elves is like an island in the sea. The aristocrats on the stage saw this type of frame, most of them are earthy, especially for a few nobles from other countries. Because they are concerned about the dignity of their respective countries, they are embarrassed to retreat, so they let the followers mobilize all the people who can be mobilized to defend their own safety. Some people have begun to ask Rogge to take measures to protect their safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fate of the middle, he is ready. After a short time, the hoof of the hoof sounded, and five hundred snow bear knights rushed into the square and confronted the heavily armed adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat power of a large number of regular knights is not comparable to a group of adventurers. The square is also good for the knights to attack, so the adventurers who are eager to move are somewhat quieter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge knows that things are not going to be that simple. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, just as the executioners of the four hand-held torches walked to the front of the stake, the bow of the crowd rang and more than ten arrows suddenly shot. The executioners shot on the spot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square was immediately like a pot, the adventurers were in a rush, and the swords were squirted. The snow bear knights took out the sabers, and the guards of the nobles also squirted all the weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the situation hits the scene, a six-person adventure team is coming out. For a tall swordsman, it seems to be prestigious among adventurers. He shouted: "You damn aristocrats! For the alien elves, you want to slaughter your own kind! I don't want to accept it! You guys will only be lazy pigs, dare to send six people out and us. Put on a game? Just dare to hide behind the army, what a hero!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a closer look at this adventure team. This is a standard adventure combination consisting of three warriors, a thief, a magician and a monk. They are well equipped and the grades are not low. For Feige, he already has some vindictive light, and it seems that there are already about ten levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that the most needed in front of him is Liwei, otherwise the adventurers will riot, but it is not easy. Although all the troops of the 'Dark Side of the Moon' have been secretly transferred to Dresden, he is confident that the thousands of adventurers will be slaughtered, but their damage will not be small. When the next adventurers come, they are not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly stood up and walked to the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fage stared at Rogge, somehow, he felt very nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You call Feige?" Rogge’s voice was cold, just like talking to a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Your grandfather, I am called Feige!" Feige has some guilty conscience. It seems that he is not simple, but in front of nearly a thousand adventurers. He has to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! You insulted me, I will wash my honor with your blood!" Rogge coldly, he applied another The sound of magic, the loud voice resounded throughout the square. Give you a chance! My two men will accept the challenge of the Feige team! Only two! If you can win this test, these four criminals will be released! If you lose, you must respect the laws of the Principality of Aray! Dresden welcomes all adventurers, but everyone must obey the laws of the Principality! If you break the law, you must be punished! Now, do you think the Feige team is qualified to represent you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers are in a mess, and there is a lot of discussion. The Feiger team seems to have a reputation among the adventurers. After a while, the adventurers have expressed Willing to accept the conditions of Rogge. The fat man sneered and laid down his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter! Actually send two girls to deal with us!" Feige screamed scornfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly took off the huge wheel saw behind it, and such a fierce weapon immediately calmed the adventurers on the square. Ajani also took out a long sword. Her sword was originally a fine weapon in the magic weapon, but it is dwarfed by the wind saw's wheel saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani turned her back and waited for Rogge’s instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sneered, his thumb down, from left to right, slowly passing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fage is not the first to face the death threat, but I don’t know why, this time he really felt the fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon he knew the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers in the square were exclaimed, and Ajani’s body rose green, compared to Feige’s vindictive light. , almost negligible. But what surprised them even more is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green vindictive radiance rises in the wind butterfly body, and the huge wheel saw also begins to flash magical light. In the twinkling of an eye, the vindictiveness of the wind butterfly is as strong as it is, and she is like a burning green fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God! This is a fourteenth level of vindictiveness!" A middle-aged adventurer screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferg’s heart immediately sinks into the icy lake, and any of the 14th-level fighters may be able to clean up their combination, not to mention the other Aga Ni, who is not weak? However, why is there such a 14th-level Elf Swordsman in such a small and remote country? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no hesitation, the green light flashed in front of him, and the wind butterfly had passed the Feige lightly and rushed to the magician behind him. Her movements are like electricity, and Feige is too late to stop. Even if he wants to stop, he can't stop it, because Ajani's long sword is like a flying sky, and suddenly appears in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is a unilateral massacre. The magician and the monk did not release a magic, and they were cut by the wind saw's wheel saw. The three warriors were all entangled by Ajani. When the wind butterfly easily solved the thief and killed it, it was the scorpion who could see the end of the Figer combination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three adventurers who have come out. They are all friends of Feige. When they see Feige, they are in danger and can’t help but reach out. Save. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange scream in the air, and Rogge jumped down from the high platform and stopped in front of the three! He held a huge, imaginative battle axe and smashed the waist to the two soldiers in front! The soldiers erected a long sword, but they were easily cut off by Rogge's giant axe! The giant axe did not have any stops, and the two men cut their waists into two sections! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third soldier is a little behind, seeing the horrible flesh and blood in front of him, can’t help but stay! Then he sighed with a sigh, his eyes were red, and he took the sword and rushed to Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and reached out and pointed at him! The four little magical arrays lit up almost at the same time in Rogge. Twenty purple-black magic missiles, such as the fierce bees, came out to the warriors and flew them into a sieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massacre ended in the light stone fire. Rogge turned his head and smiled at the adventurers, and the blood on the axe dropped dripping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dead in the square, and everyone, including the elves, was stunned. Feige also picked up a life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger's finger force, the huge battle axe easily danced for two weeks. He snorted and finally pressed down the inexplicable bloodthirsty killings in his heart. While turning to the high platform, he chilled and ordered: "Ignition!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The original noisy square is now quiet. Under the blazing flame, four adventurers who have been tortured and dying have ended their journey of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes are on Rogge. His eyes were red, his tongue couldn't help but lick his lips, and he couldn't help but sneer, his eyes sweeping through the adventurers. The adventurer who was swept by his eyes involuntarily gave birth to a chill from the bottom of his heart and subconsciously avoided it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
