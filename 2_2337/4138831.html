			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Heavenly Chapter Seven Holy Baby in Hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter Seven Holy Baby<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s mentality has dried up, the whole person is in a groggy, everything in front of him is blurring and shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, he seems to see the mysterious black hair O'Reilly again in front of him. It’s still the gray robes, it’s still the silver plaque. The barefoot that once caused the deepest part of his heart is also in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just somehow, this time O'Brien did not exude the pressure that had made Rogge shudder, but it seemed a little weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge pain in Rogge’s head, his eyebrows were wrinkled, and everything in front of him began to shake again. Suddenly, a long-repressed flame rose from the depths of his soul, and he turned out to be the unspeakable, only God's body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly felt that the whole world has become very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His slow thinking can’t understand why he dared to make such a move to the goddess, knowing that his fear of O'Reilly could not be used as a fear To describe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even more strange is that O'Reilly is not only angered by his imagination, but is somewhat flustered. And the movement she evades is not so difficult to capture, it is not like a reaction that God should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it the true strength of God behind the endless pressure? Rogge thought involuntarily. But he has a terrible headache now, and he can't even think about how the end of the goddess O'Reilly will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cases in the history of the blasphemy, and the end is strange. Someone was nailed to the mountain and allowed the raptor to suck on the internal organs but it was not dead for thousands of years. There is always mourning in the flame of lava, and more blood is cursed by God. The descendants of the generations have suffered for many generations, and they have never stopped to redeem the sins of their ancestors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Rogge? How should he deal with it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not only distracted by the goddess, but also acts disrespectful to the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, he turned out to be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; caught a barefoot of the goddess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this true? Rogge does not believe it! He shook his head hard, only to get rid of the state of dizziness. Gazing at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is empty and there is no trace of O'Reilly's arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it just an illusion?" Rogge couldn't help thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment he has recovered to be awake. Looking around, there was no one in the room except the sleeping butterfly. Obviously there will be no one to answer the doubts in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the feeling of cold and frosty, still lingering in his palm, seems to remind him that everything just, maybe not a dream. Think of the glittering feet under the gray robe. The fat man who was already near collapsed, the bones are even more crisp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the only way to check out the matter is to go to the eye of wisdom and use Mora to check with O'Reilly. But the fat man is a guilty conscience, his color is big, and he dare not ask Otto Reich about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, the weakest, began to meditate. Losing the support of huge spiritual strength, he can now say that it is extremely fragile. Meditation does not improve the speed of his mental strength, but with the addition of magic, Rogge will restore a lot of combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly wakes up. Rogge has already meditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf leaps lightly from the white jade platform. When she landed, her delicate and feminine body brought the whole room to a slight vibration. . Both Wind Butterfly and Rogge stunned. Rogge reached for the waist of the butterfly and hugged her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, how do you feel now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is like a smoke and double eyebrows. Road: "I don't know. But my current consciousness is very clear, it seems that I have not forgotten anything." Here, her face suddenly passed a trace of blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "That's good! In a few days, we will go back to the city of the gods. During this time, you will adapt to the new body and strength." When we come out of the city of the gods, we should go to the emperor to compete with the Druids."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A miniature storm suddenly winds The butterfly broke out from the center, and her beautiful face began to faintly reveal the outline of the dark coat of arms, revealing a faint dark red in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quickly said: "Wind butterfly! You must learn to control your emotions from now on, especially hatred, hate! You are lucky to keep your mind Clear, don't let the cursed power once again dominate your soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly faces the struggling color. After several iterations. She finally suppressed the hate of the body, and the dark coat of arms gradually disappeared. She breathed a sigh of relief. It was trembling and sweating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and put a robes on the wind butterfly, and walked out of the magic lab that had been there for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of Wisdom is magnificent in the Dresden Landlord Hall. Every night, the brightly lit halls are magnificent and solemn, and have become the most famous in Dresden. a scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the high-ranking clerics in groups are coming out of the main hall in groups of three, ready to go back to rest. The grand ceremony of the evening prayer that just ended ended up being very exhausting for everyone. It is not only physically tired, but more spiritually extremely weak. These clergy do not know the reason why the Virgin Mora suddenly summoned them to hold such a ceremony, but the signs that Mora is a theologian have become more and more obvious, and even believers have thought that she is close to the goddess in the mortal world. The spokesperson, so no one will now question any decision of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prayer room of the Eye of Wisdom, there is only one Mora. She quietly squatted in front of the raging flame, not knowing what to talk to the goddess. Mora's hair was raised high, revealing a slender and beautiful neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is like a swan in front of God, elegant and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames on the altar danced, and the majestic voices were directly imprinted in the heart of Mora. She carefully wrote down the goddess of the goddess and hurried out of the prayer room. Bring a few servants to the Grand Court of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the wind and the moon are looking at the priests who have been scattered in twos and threes and the departing Virgin. In the silver eyes, these weak and uneasy mental states are clearly reflected. Obviously, they can no longer support another prayer ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind sighed and looked around, and the silvery light in his eyes began to fluctuate very regularly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a few hundred kilometers of Dresden, a slightly stronger creature feels a deep chill in the soul. They immediately followed the instinctive guidelines. They climbed out of hiding places and fled away from the wind and the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow is flying over Dresden. He seems to have suddenly discovered something. Hard to live in the shape, and then rushed to the densely populated houses below. However, the windy moon has already appeared in front of him, and the pair of silver eyes with no expression are watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow is not a small shock, he immediately changed direction, just want to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the black shadow is extraordinary, and the transition between the advance and the retreat is unpredictable and speedy. However, in this world, it is not without speed. It’s just that there isn’t one in Dresden right now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy month will appear in front of the shadows and intercept him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow finally stood in the air, and the sword was pulled out silently. The sword was like a living snake, and it could not be twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue stares at the death class. The silver awns in the eyes flashed, seemingly hesitating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of hops in the heart of the death class is still calm on the surface, saying: "Feng Yue adults, although we have hatred in the past, we have not yet revenge. Timing. At least we have to solve the common enemy? However, if you must insist on solving it now, then I will not object."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment, I finally turned and sneaked into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Shusi slammed the book in their hands and poured a glass of wine for the Death Class who just entered the window. The Death Class did not politely with him. He directly grabbed a drink and then took a sigh of relief. He said: "This windy month is really a madman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Xius smiled and said: "Did you have just played one with Fengyue adults?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class snorted, and the atmosphere was obviously lacking in authenticity: "This ......Now is not the time of infighting. Isn't that cheaper silver dragon? But let's talk about it. Although she is not a person in our world, she comes here. When she walks away, there is no sign at all. It’s really elusive. Her speed doesn’t need to be said. She used to be worse than me. I still have to fight at that time. But when I saw it tonight, her strength was no worse than me... um......... ......It’s not good! Besides, I always feel that something is wrong with her tonight, or don’t conflict with her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes laughed: "The most important thing for a killer is a keen instinct. The intuition of the class is so accurate. It is no wonder that the dark world is strong. Haha! Haha! In fact, the style of the wind and the moon is the way to go, but it is suitable for sneak attack, that is the defense is impossible! So, it is not a good thing to attract the upper hand of the moon. Right, you must know that someone has to challenge recently. The news of the Silver Dragon King? I just knew that the challenger is probably the Fengyue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Death Class is getting more and more ugly, muttering: "Insane, crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes and mysteriously lowered the voice: "Especially during this time, I can’t even provoke the wind and the moon... I heard her. I am hungry now, so I am in a very bad mood..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! This..." The death class was stunned and could not speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This noisy night is that the city of the gods is not peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imprisonment of Amaro’s hall is constantly shaking, and from afar he can hear the roar and roar of Amorro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, several elf mages stared nervously at the madness of the Amorro. Numerous thorns have collapsed, and in the roar of Amorro, hundreds of thorns have been broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What to do, do you want to increase the extent of the power?" The elf mage, who is headed, is extremely nervous in seeking the opinions of his colleagues. After all, the strongmen followed Rogge to Dresden. Once the Amorro really broke free, it would be a catastrophe for the entire city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bob! What do you do?" Amorro suddenly roared: "Initiate invisible magic, cover the entire city! Wake up all the soldiers Guarding this temple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard wizard was shocked, and these suggestions should not be said from the mouth of Amorro anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden feeling of strangeness in the hall. Several elf wizards were on the spot and they were not awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray robe of the black wind is coming from the entrance of the hall, and the cockroach rises, and finally stands in front of the Amorro. This time, her mouth finally showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge Amorro has been utterly suffocating at the moment, it whispers in a low voice: "The powerful world exists, your strength is enough to convince me of such a high Mozu. I am willing to set a soul contract with you from now on. According to the tradition of the devil world, it is also a kind of glory to be able to serve the strong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue ignores it . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the magical glory of the entire city of the gods is extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
