But this does not prevent the orcs from producing some highly intelligent figures. The simple eyes of these orc leaders can penetrate most of the hypocrisy in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, most orcs maintain the nature of many beasts. They are keen, powerful, energetic, and fertile. The orcs demand simplicity, hard work, and instinctive obedience to the strong. A large piece of casual beast and the icy water that can be seen everywhere in the Central Mountains support the support of a strong orc warrior. Of course, the sacrifices, shamans, physicians, and those with strong military power at the top of the orc society are much better. But this is only relative to other orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have historically formed their own great empire, but they were not lucky at the time, just hit the elf empire in the most powerful period. At that time, the Elf Empire also had four of the twelve Great Elf kings who had existed in history. Because of the great deities of the four great elves, Wang Tuyu, many dragons and an ancient dragon, this section continues the glory of the dragon in the history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion of the elf empire, the orc empire was expelled all the way westward, and along the way it was constantly attacked by dwarves and strange races, eventually disappearing into the boundless In the west of the plateau, there has been no news since then. In the rich central areas of the mainland, the remaining beasts rely on their adaptability to the environment and their fertility. Survive in the form of a tribe in the mountains or on the wasteland. They are outstanding fighters, but the shortcomings are equally prominent, the equipment is rough, the strategy is not understood, there is no discipline, and more importantly, the orc's magic level is still in the primitive era. The great magician of any human race. All can bear the great sacrifice of an orc country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty has always been familiar with history books, and he is very clear about this history. But let him worry about it. This time, the sudden appearance of the orcs in the Central Mountain Range has been compensated for in equipment, military discipline and strategy. The only thing that is unclear is their level of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several orcs climbed to the top of the mountain, overlooking the quiet and beautiful valley. In the center of the valley, there is a city that is already withered. Because of the loss of the energy support of the ancient trees of the elves, the small lake on the edge of the city of the gods was also covered with a thick layer of ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs are also aesthetic, and their beauty, to some extent, has something in common with the elves. They immediately took a fancy to the valley. Be prepared to take a day off here and chase the elves again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the City of God has already crossed the race. Although it has lost its luster, the city of the gods lying quietly in the middle of the valley is like a sleeping girl, and it is so sweet and delicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of orc warriors, if dark green steel torrents, rolled into the city of the gods. The officers have already divided the city of the gods into more than a dozen areas for different orc troops to rest. It’s just that there are too many orcs, just four or five thousand have already crowded the entire city of the gods, and more orcs have to rest in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the orc regular troops. It is a variety of quirky war behemoths, their eyes are red, staring at the orc warriors around, from time to time spouting steaming white air from the nostrils. Occasionally, a giant beast roars to the surrounding orc warriors, which will lead to the roar of other behemoths. If it is not the shaman who controls these behemoths, they may pounce on the orcs around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the intimidation of the war behemoth. There was also a small commotion in the disciplined orc warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant beasts lined up in a long queue, came to the small lake one by one, smashed the frozen ice cover on the lake and began to drink. However, a huge roar suddenly rang in the valley!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge, unparalleled, dragon-like behemoth walked into the valley at the roaring pace !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a circle of invisible majesty around the body, and all the behemoths flinch in front of it and give it to the whole small lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs looked at the incomparably majestic behemoth and drank water at the small lake. Instead of the color of excitement, it seems to be a little pity and sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the bloody adult has been completely lost in the body of the beast, hehe!" The tall orc sacrifices are heavy and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central black robes said in a strange and sharp voice: "This kind of thing will always happen! I know that the blood is very high in the tribe." But for the glory of the beast, there must always be someone to take the risk. The blood is the greatest and brave warrior of the werewolf, carrying the great mission of the servant's will, of course, to fall on him. You should not be as useless. The elf is so disease-free! The bloody teeth have the opportunity to wake up their will, until then the power of the beastly servant can be fully realized. But now, we can swipe the entire central mountain."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you directly enter the Terran country! After catching all the elves, we should sweep the entire northern prairie! We brought 200,000 warriors, any A human race country can't stop the orc's battle axe!" a troll cried fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central black robe turned around and stared at the troll, silently. In the shadow of the robes, his pair of yellow and green eyes reveals the murder of Sen Han. The troll, who was still roaring, immediately narrowed his head and fled, staring at the mysterious figure who could not reach his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked around for another week, and the chilly and coldly said: "Augland Heller’s sacrifice before we went out, have you forgotten it? That is The god of the beast god! In the country of humanity, there is a very powerful patron saint. The beast god is not ready for perfection. Therefore, we have not yet reached a full-scale war with the Terran. The elf does not protect the gods. It means that there will be no strong sacrifices, wizards and magicians among them! Of course, I and your simple-minded guys don’t understand the problem. In short, this time our goal is to divide the entire central mountain into the orcs. In addition to this, you must not act rashly! If anyone can't control his impulse, then he will wait to go back and accept the Ogan Heller Grand Sacrifice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Hear his last sentence. All the orcs trembled involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the surrounding orcs all expressed Chen Fu, the talent snorted. Then I recited the spell, and a moment later, a huge crystal plate appeared in his hand. Such a spell does not surprise the orcs who are not worthy of magic, but if the fat is here, it will certainly be a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantaneous summoning, you can store items prepared in advance in parallel space and take them out when needed. This magic has a seven-step casting difficulty. The question is, how many wizards are willing to use the magic of preciousness in such a magic? I can tell. This piece of crystal is inevitably a very expensive magic item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal plate is one meter square, nearly half a meter thick, engraved with the image of countless devils, and the two sides are full of magic symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious man caressed the crystal plate with his hands, and kept chanting the spell. Slowly, the crystal plate began to float in the air, and the blurred scenery gradually emerged. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his magic constantly injecting. The scene in the crystal plate gradually became clear. Centering on the current valley, the terrain of the mountains within a hundred kilometers of the inland area is revealed one by one in the crystal plate, and the range that is accommodated is getting larger and larger, and finally reaches about 300 kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious man stretched out a pale finger, biting hard and applying dark green blood to the crystal plate. So at a position near the edge of the crystal plate. Gradually lit up the dense light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc leaders at the venue all looked around and watched the crystal plate. They all know that a light spot represents the position of a life. After using the blood sacrifices of more than five hundred elves, the sensitivity of this crystal plate to the life of the elf is already extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, you see, these elves are all together, only one day away from us, we only need to..." The mysterious man started Tao The waves are constantly arranging tactics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the orc warriors of the City of God have sent the big pieces of meat to the stomach with ice water like a wind and cloud, and they are looking comfortable. The position, lying down. With the orc officer's voice screaming. They soon went to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
