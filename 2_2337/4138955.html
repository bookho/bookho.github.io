Feuerbach finally asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sea?" Rogge, he thought for a moment, then replied: "The ocean means quick traffic, meaning inexhaustible food. In a sense, the ocean that is bottomless and hides countless monsters belongs to the realm of the gods, because in the face of natural tsunami and hurricanes, our power seems so small."<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey smiled and said: "The sea is a dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! The sea is a dream." Passionately and profoundly: "The sea is the dream that every generation of Asofik people have. At the beginning of the founding of the country, the outsiders could not understand the hardships of the wasteland. At that time, how much killing and hatred came from a source of water, a little Food competition! Since then, the sea with inexhaustible food has become the dream of every generation of emperors, and every North Warrior Dreams! Whether it is a tsunami, a hurricane or a monster, it is just some small obstacles in our dreams. You see, this endless sea, just like the hearts of our North Warriors! The sea and the wilderness are just Belongs to the field of brave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger quickly said: "Congratulations to you! You have finally realized the dream of the brave who did not complete the imperial dynasty!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Emperor, Pompeii, Alexander, Rogge and the boss are standing on the lighthouse of Ludan Port, the largest port on the west coast of the Longines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day. Longines did not fog at sea, so I looked at it at a glance, but I saw the sea and sky, and I was connected in the far distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea breeze is blowing in the face, its fierce and sturdy strength, no less than the hurricane on the land of the Northland. In the distant sky, there are a few huge lead clouds hanging down. They are so low that they seem to be caught in the bottom of the sea by the giants of the sky below. In such a weather. A fishing boat in the sea is also invisible, and the fishermen with the highest skill do not dare to go fishing. In fact, even huge warships can hardly survive in such weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Longines Sea is just an inland sea, but in such a far worse weather, the sea is already a huge storm, dark tides, and if it is What kind of scene is it to the unknown outside the world? The power of those who are strong. In the face of the tremendous power between the heavens and the earth, it seems so insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of Feuerbach’s Emperor, this vast, violent, majestic sea roll is completely beautiful. His eyes are blazing and wild, and now in his heart, there must be countless huge imperial battleships full of warriors, breaking the storm and exploring the endless unknown. At this moment. Pompey, Rogge, etc. all remain silent and do not bother the Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the Emperor Feuerbach spit out a sigh of relief, looking around and slowly said: "The dream of the empire for hundreds of years has not been realized. It’s just starting in my hands.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, this grand dream is just the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people at the moment beside the Feuerbach are the core of the Astrophy Empire. As the first pope of the Holy Church, Rogge’s strength is no worse than Pompeii and Alexander. He understands the national power of the empire and knows that building a fleet that can traverse the sea from nothing is not an overnight success. In the past three months, although the empire has swept the entire West Bank of the Longines, it has wiped out nearly 300,000 troops in more than ten countries, but only captured more than a dozen small warships. Most of these warships were parked in the port because of damage or repairs, etc., and they fell into the hands of the emperor. Hundreds of warships in the West Bank, thousands of merchant ships have already entered the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empire has captured thousands of craftsmen associated with shipbuilding, but there are only a dozen masters who can command the construction of large warships. Rogge learned from their mouths. It takes three years to build a giant warship. Even longer. It depends on what kind of performance the warship is going to achieve and what equipment it is equipped with. This is only the time of construction, and it does not include the time it takes to collect the huge amount of materials needed to build a warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor was able to stand on the west bank of the Longines, and there was no price at all. He levied the elite army, so now the hinterland of the Empire is very weak. Although the Western dwarf empire is nearing extinction, World of Warcraft in the dark forests of the East never left the forest, and the icy ocean in the north is the country of the wind and moon. But the orc empire in the central mountains of the empire is a real threat. As Rogge saw, the army of the orc empire is likely to rush to the empire's defense line in the south. Moreover, although the plague seeds under the orcs are powerful, it is still unclear at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach, looking at the sea, suddenly turned his head and said to Rogge: "I know that you also have dreams, although I don't know what it is. Now The dream of the empire has begun, and you are no longer far from your own dreams. But any dream has a price, you have to know what to expect, don’t pay too much for a dream of emptiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge should be right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his heart is not as calm as it seems. He is not far from the dream. If you must say a distance, it is a few hundred kilometers of virgin forest. This distance is for the strong, but it takes half a day or even less, but for the hundreds of thousands of empire, it is a completely different matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes at least a few months to develop a boulevard in the forest that is large enough for the army to pass. But the empire has time. Before the fleet was built, hundreds of thousands of troops could not be idle in the past few years. What's more, Feuerbach had long been interested in comparing with the great empire of the South. Crossing this forest now is the territory of the Dro Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South used to be Rogge’s dream. But at this moment his mood has changed, and it is not so eager to kill the South. Only the development of the situation did not move with his mind. The two major forces in the north and the south are now only one forest in the district. Between these two forces, this spatial impediment is simply untested as a piece of paper. Since the conflict is coming sooner or later, and the imperial momentum is flourishing at this moment, it is better for the fat man to come late than to come early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach waved his hand and returned to the palace. Rogge and others also returned to the temporary residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep. When Rogge was studying the various religious scriptures, the followers suddenly reported. Called the emperor to call. Although Rogge was a bit strange to the Emperor to summon himself at this moment, he still sorted out the appearance and went to see the emperor's residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge stepped into the Emperor’s study, Feuerbach was concentrating on the huge magic map that was spread out in front of him. Seeing that Rogge came in, he just looked up and went down to watch the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gave a bow to the boss of the corner of the study and patiently waited aside. Rogge always felt that there was a darkness behind Felbach. The darkness of the group slowly flowed. It is powerful but subtle. Although it has the power to destroy everything, the edge is not revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s heart moved slightly. He has never felt such a strong darkness in the Great, until not long ago, he thought that the Emperor was just an old man with little power. But at the moment Felbah, the darkness of the sea, like the darkness of the night, has clearly told Rogge that the place he saw in the past is completely illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the Emperor clearly reveals his darkness in front of him, is it a curse or a blessing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But somehow, this darkness does not seem to belong to Feuerbach. In Rogge's induction. There is still not much power in the Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s surface is quiet, but in the dark it is very slow and very slow to extend the spiritual tentacles, to explore the darkness of the surging, trying to sense Look at the secrets contained in the dark atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be aware of Rogge’s movements. The Emperor suddenly raised his head and said faintly: “It is not my strength. It is the breath of the dark Lord God. Although the Great Dark Lord does not care about our beliefs, it is still possible to provoke a fine punishment for improper actions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was shocked, and the cold sweat was soaked and heavy. He immediately recovered his mental strength and threw himself to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up!" The Emperor repeated it, and Rogge dared to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach measured the distance on the map with his hand and said: "The chaotic colors of this world are all appearances. You are just beginning to see through. The truth behind these colors, and occasionally being deceived by the external appearance is normal. Just as you are desperately pushing the imperial south, it is not the revenge or power that others think. And I lead the army to the south. I want to open up the territory for the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is more shocking, but he can do it. It’s just that we’re constantly blaming it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great finally raised his head and looked at Rogge: "I heard that you have tens of thousands of elves in your hands. Is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog immediately said: "There are a total of 55,000 elves, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great nodded, said : "Very good. The elf is a rare warrior. What is even more rare is that you can actually accept the elves with stubbornness, arrogance and stupidity. It's good! I don't know how long you can see this. So, you will reorganize these elves. Become an army and go to your church. I will order all the elves following you to be an empire national, so that you will not have any worries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Such a result, Rogge does not know whether it is happiness or worry. He didn't know how to answer for a moment, but he had to thank the great emperor for his reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach looked down again and seemed to be absent-minded: "A church that wants to develop must have a sufficient number of devout believers and well-defined teachings. The two are indispensable. Your sacred church believers have been quite a lot, but the teachings are far from perfect. You have to do a lot of things, you don't have to delay me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss always sent Rogge out of the palace. When he arrived at the palace gate, he coughed a few times and slowly said: "Master Rogge, your prince's position must be planned early, and now the time is running out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge agreed, and then piped to the boss. Go away from the palace. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the gates of the Emperor’s camp, a night wind struck, and Rogge felt the chill of his body. He sighed and stood alone, and walked quickly to his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is very upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selecting the sacred right to teach, you must abandon the secular military and political power. Feuerbach gave the Rogge a year and a half, and the time came. Rogge must hand over the title of the prince and the territory of the Alle Principality. Rogge has handed over the military power of the Chaoshan Legion. These knights and territories have more interests related to the prosperity of future generations. Although the Emperor did not say anything. But at Sarah Wenger's suggestion, Rogge knew that he could pass these benefits to future generations so that the children and grandchildren could enjoy their own shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the problem is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many women who have been with Rogge over the years, but no one except Lilith has given him a son and a half. Female. The fat man is cautious, giving himself one more way. He would never push the son of Lilith to his son from behind the scenes to the stage. But until now, Froya, Effie and others have no signs of getting bigger, which makes Rogge anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the fat man has a prominent title and a vast territory, and he could not find a son to inherit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is proficient in magic, but he does not know why he has no new children in such a long time. Even those nobles who are powerless, weak, and yin should have three or five children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled bitterly, he had no other way. Only a lot of hard work in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, but in the seat of the Holy Church, many people still have not fallen asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being able to foresee fate is far from the final level of prophetic surgery, and changing the direction of fate is the purpose of prophecy." Constantine looked solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie is sitting casually across from his face, his eyes are full of tiredness, and he is absent-minded about Constantine’s teachings. And he yawned unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
