			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sudden hoof sounded outside the pub, an eager, loud voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry! Where is the magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several knights walked in Pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub was quiet all at once, and everyone who was flushed and red-faced almost completely forgot about Ketu. Now that I have come to so many knights, this very popular magician will have a hard time dealing with it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few temperamental drunken scented Hans who have seen Rogge as a life and death brother. Although they knew that these knights under the count of Luck were very harmful, but these men were eager to seduce, and still stared at the knights with gaze, and stopped Rogge behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just like the Ketu behind these knights, the expression is indignant and somewhat helpless. This is a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a knight to step forward, Lang said: "I am the Knight of the Earl of Luck, the Knight of the Krone, which is the honorable magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very respectful to hear the Kroner’s tone, and everyone’s nervous mood is moderate. Rogge tried to squeeze out from the tall North Koreans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kroon suddenly pulled out the sword and pointed to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is like not seeing his long sword at all, he has taken care of his clothes and wiped the sweat from his head. The Cavaliers smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not like someone who is looking for me. If you want to try my skills, then please avoid it, my temper is not very good. It’s not good to accidentally hurt you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s face suddenly turned red, and he took a lot of effort to suppress his anger. It is most likely to say in a steady tone: "Mr. Lord Lucer, Mr. Luck wants to invite you to see one side. Please be assured that we are not malicious. Ketu has offended you, I will call him to sin. Ketu! I don't want to apologize to the magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still a black-eyed Ketu who walked forward and reluctantly said: "Adults, just...all The villain's mistake, please be sure to understand me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and snarled, what do you say directly! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights said: "The Earl of the Lord has something to do, please be sure to come with me to see the Earl." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded, calling the still-defunct wind butterfly and the elf guarding the warriors, followed the knight to the castle outside the town.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha! Dear Mr. Magician, welcome to my simple castle. Is there no rudeness for Kron? With a burst of old and heroic laughter, Count Luck, who was in the spirits and dressed in gorgeous home armor, greeted the castle hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greg quickly stepped forward and embraced with the old Luck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my son, Paul! He is an unfortunate child whose mother died of illness three years ago. My family's history is very long and can be traced back to more than four hundred years ago. But as you can see, I am only a small aristocrat who guards the border of the Ayre Principality. My richest wealth is this son. Paul, come and say hello to the magician! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luck is a 16-year-old boy, handsome, pale, delicate, with a pair of melancholy blue eyes. He looks ashamed. The voice of greeting is very small, but very curious to stop talking to Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luck apologetically smiles at the Master, my son is very courageous It's really rude, it's rude! He doesn't want to be a knight, but he is very obsessed with magic. He only knows what kind of magic array he is hiding in the room every day, and he is arguing to go out and learn magic! Magician, if you Don't mind, can you point him to see if he really has a magical talent? If he can't be a magician, let him die soon."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luck looked at the time of the lunch, I have told the chef to prepare some food. Mr. Rogge came from afar, first try the craft of my chef! The ham he made, it tastes so good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the furnishings in the castle are heavy, simple and strong. There is a large dining table with red pine in the dining room, no painting on the walls, huge bluestone exposed, simple Decorated with a few tapestries, swords and a huge bear's head. Several rosin torches provide dim lighting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looks at the hall quietly Everything. The count is not rich, he came to a conclusion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern winter dishes are very monotonous, mainly based on various meats, light dishes Rarely. The wine is a spirit, and the milk is also a thick green cheese.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge can’t help but think of the elves who ate with the knights. Sin, the more their will is hit, the sooner they will succumb to their own hands. Rogge thinks with some viciousness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very enthusiastic manner After the meal, Count Luck finally opened his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Rogge, why are you? Then I came to this remote territory it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince, I was living in the mountains, and I was studying magic with a few friends." But in a study of ancient collections, we have no intention of presenting, this land is buried with a horrible demon! According to the age, the devil's seal should be very dangerous. So this time I came to find out the demon's seal, to prevent someone from unintentionally releasing this horrible demon, and to reinforce this seal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Luck has a hint of sorrow on his face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Rogge, Since you have also found a demon hidden in this land, I will not be holding you anymore. There have been many strange things in the castle in recent days, and many people have seen huge monsters in the haunt. I will take you to see the traces of these monsters in a moment, that is not what humans can do. Later, the count’s voice began to tremble.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still calm, in the eyes of the count, but hope is a bit bigger "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Rogge, you know, although the knights under my command are brave, but dealing with the magic is not their specialty. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not worry too much. Rogge comforted. "These monsters should be just the devil's men." If the ancient demon is really resurrected, I will not be its opponent. But it is still under the seal, and it is not enough for these people to worry about it. The few people who followed me this time are all good devils. Their skills are very strong and trustworthy. Ok, the rice is almost eaten, so please take me to see the traces left by the monster. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl screamed and led Rogge to the basement of the castle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything It would be so perfect, he actually has a son who is addicted to magic. Is it true that there is a god or a devil who cares about me? Rog thought.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian slowly entered the basement of the gloomy, cold and humid castle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This has obviously suffered a lot of damage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables and chairs scattered in a scattered place, the decoration on the wall was sprinkled down, several The armor was heavily pressed into a pile of scrap iron, and the hard bluestone on the wall left countless huge claw marks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at these long feet, With deep claw marks, the old count's face was paler. But he did not stop, but led Rogge to continue to go deep into the underground castle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In the deepest storage room, there is a whole body armor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an ancestor left in my family. armor. He is a very powerful knight who has won honors for his family among countless warriors. But then he committed an unclean crime and was expelled from the family. So the armor was placed here, not in the castle's weapons showroom. In fact, in terms of quality alone, this armor is the top collection of my family's centuries-old collection. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count sighed and patted the armor gently. With a bang, the upper half of the armor suddenly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire armor has been slanted and cut into two halves, and the fracture is extremely smooth and tidy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luck trembled and said: "You saw that this armor has been cut in half by the monster! All my knights add up, absolutely not It will be the opponent of this monster! This is not an ordinary devil, is the ancient demon in your mouth already resurrected? If this is the case, perhaps giving up the territory to escape is my only choice. However, I really can’t leave this More than a million people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not the trace of the ancient demon Amaro." Rogge said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K saw hope again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should only be the masterpiece of the devil's number one, the fierce bloodthirsty white bones!" Rogge also turned the old count into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is not finished yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since he has been active, it means that the resurrection of the ancient demon is not far away. You better take me to take a look at your entire castle. I need to find out where the seal is. It seems that the seal should be in the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Luck has completely lost his claim. He walked out of the underground castle with Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Earl, we are better to bring a few more people, my men are best to be present. Now the devil is likely to attack us at any time. I am a magic Teacher, you need the protection of the soldiers in the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count has been completely fearless, and he summoned all the knights, which makes him feel safe. Only then, dare to lead Rogge to see the whole castle. The dozens of knights under the counts seem to have a lot of things about the monsters. I heard that I have to inspect the whole fort and look for the seal of the devil. Many people are white. But the knight’s sense of honor does not allow them to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way to the bottom of the castle to see the highest third floor. Rogge did not let go of any corner, and even the kitchen was turned over. The third floor of the castle is the bedroom of the Earl's father and son and the office of the Earl. Rogge stepped on the stairs without hesitation. The old count hesitated and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the old count's office and bedroom, Rogge pushed the door of the count's son again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Paul didn’t know when he had ran back to the room. He is sitting inside, sorting out a high magic book. It can be seen that he has a heartfelt love for magic and he is not willing to leave his bedroom and magic laboratory. It was a very messy room filled with all kinds of beakers and utensils, and the ground was covered with a lot of messy symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found the devil and its seal!" Rogge said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Earl’s collapsed nerve suddenly exploded. He grabbed Paul. "You are a jerk! I have already told you not to do something unexplained! Who do you think you are, no one teaches you that you can learn magic?! Let Mr. Rogge see which thing is Devil's Seal? Which thing is it? Paul! You won't be exposed to anything about magic in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning I haven't noticed yet, but now I I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s voice is heard in the ear of the count, just like a death knell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The seal is Paul itself, the ancient demon is in Paul's body. Soon, maybe tomorrow, the ancient demon will rely on Paul's body to rise in this world. Everyone here will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Earl and Little Paul are stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible! Not true!" Luck suddenly cried hysterically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, this is really detecting evil magic." Rogge sang a spell, raised his hand, and a white light illuminate the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the white light, the old count and the knights did not respond, and the elves reflected a soft, warm, green glow. As for Rogge, nature is a holy light. Under the shield of his mental power, the magic of detecting evil could not reach his dark constitution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count caught Rogge’s arm, fear and despair have made his voice hoarse: “Mr. Rogge! Is there a way to save Paul? Save my son! He is only seventeen, seventeen years old! Still a child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's soft and pleasant voice is extremely cold: "This seal is shaking. You have already seen it, the door to hell is about to open, and the flames in the abyss have begun to emerge from the cracks. The ancient demon Amorro is likely to be resurrected at any time! Once the Amorro is resurrected, first The thing is to destroy Paul's soul and occupy his body! Then, the magical ancient demon will turn the city's people into Warcraft, and then transform this land into the best lava hell for its survival." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do! You are not saying that you can enhance the seal?" Luck clutched Rogge's arm, now Rogge is his only Hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ancient demon has hid in Paul's soul, and the only way to enhance the seal is to use the Holy Fire to vanish his body!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" Earl Luck suddenly angered. "You want to burn my son? You want to burn my only son! You evil wizard! I will never let you succeed." Come on, take him to me, and go to the dungeon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf warriors have pulled out the sword, the wind butterfly also A huge wheel saw with a shining green light was removed from the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince, I am sorry, you have not arrested my strength. Since you are risking the destruction of the entire town for this son, then I have not The way. I will wait in the town these days, waiting for you to change your mind. Remember, the ancient demons will be resurrected at any time, maybe tomorrow, or maybe tonight. Once the demon is resurrected, I will leave immediately, I am not Its opponent. Earl, I will say it again, no matter how you choose, Paul’s fate is already doomed, and he can’t change it anyway.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned and left with the help of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul suddenly fell to the ground, and he was already fainted by this sudden change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Earl angered: "Do you want to go! Knights! Take him to me! Are you all stunned? Didn't hear my order?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen of knights under the count, look at me, I look at you, haven’t moved, just look at Rogge’s presence in the elves. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You dare to disobey my orders! Want to rebel? Your knighthood? Where have you been?" Earl Old Luck was so angry shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight hesitated and finally said: "The Earl, our knighthood has not changed. However, in order to protect the son who is occupied by the devil, it would rather The whole city of Sayi is pushed into hell. We can no longer be loyal to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a wizard! He is a liar!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince, I am sorry, we have seen the result of detecting evil magic. You have been very good to us over the years, you are a very kind lord. So we can't wave to Paul. Sword, although he will soon become a demon. But we can still do something for the city now, at least we have to leave this with more than 10,000 people temporarily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count sat on the ground, and he held his son in his arms, tears and tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go! Let's go! Everything in this castle, take it away. Even if Paul is really a demon, he It is also my only son. If the fate is destined to perish, then I am willing to break into hell with him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold wind, the old count is in a coma Paul boarded the tallest tower in the castle. His figure seems so lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count hangs all his armor, holding a shiny sword. Although he is too old to bear the heavy body armor, the hand holding the sword is also shaking, but his figure is extremely firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desolation shouted and echoed on the earth for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen knights slowly came out of the castle. They squatted one by one and paid tribute to the old count on the tower. Then they left and went to contact the townspeople to arrange the escape route. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, there was also a commotion in the castle’s outer barracks. Many infantrymen ran out and pointed to the count of the Earl of the tower, and there was a lot of discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky thick clouds quickly gathered to block the sun that was not warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind suddenly grows up and the leaves are flying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also felt a chill, he tightened his cloak and looked at the lonely figure of the old count on the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly is also looking at the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See the old count on the castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind nodded, She felt incomparably sad. "Can Rogge can't help him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood of their father and son, the blood of many people in this town, will be the cornerstone of the rebirth of the Red Elf, and Make it harder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand. "The wind butterfly is very confused.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves want to have a foothold here, the lives of their fathers and sons, countless blood, is the price. In fact, bloodshed is not the first time. For the survival of the elves, how many orcs of blood have been dyed on the north's cloak? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...that's all Rogge... your order! "There is also a trembling in the sound of the wind butterfly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, the world has already delineated the sphere of influence. Everything we can see and want to have has a master. If the elves want to exhibit, they can only grab things from other people's bowls. Only in the ladder of blood-stained, the future of the elves will be guaranteed. "Rog's voice is as cold as the smoldering wind in hell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly still can't believe, peace-loving elves, why must they step on others? Blood can thrive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighs in the woods, if the lion does not eat deer, he will starve to death. The elf wants to expand the living space, only from Others will grab space. No one will be willing to be robbed. This is the struggle between you and me. If the elves don't want to be strong, there will be countless hungry wolves coming to the door. At that time, the elves will cast others with their own blood. Stepping stone. Now, do you understand that I am forcing the elves to kill the village? For the exhibition of the elves, there are always some elves to abandon the faith. The elf warrior's belief is the most determined, for the whole The future of the elves, they should also be the first to break into the dark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the butterfly seem to understand, only feel very confused and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly remembered the mysterious woman she met at the pub that day, and the cold sweat involuntarily flowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is the most elite sacred guardian of the elves, but for some reason, she will be as beautiful as a dream, as delicate as ever. It will break the fear of the average woman. If the woman slowly cuts her throat with a cockroach, Wind Butterfly knows that she will not resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear has become more and more, it is already desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count on the tower, is it all desperate at the moment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter, the wind is cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly only feels that the whole world has suddenly changed. She used to live in a world of fairy tales. All of a sudden, everything changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm spring turned into a harsh winter, her hands have been stained with a lot of blood, and she will also get more blood. In the past, the handsome and cheerful Rumsfeld has become silent, often not saying a word for a few days, only sitting in the treetop when nothing happens. The elves also left the habitual forest and began to walk out of the mountains and compete with the Terran for survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is because of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up at Rogge, wondering why, she suddenly felt safe at the side of Rogge. This is the intuition that comes from the deepest part of her consciousness. She does not understand why this is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge Mingming is only an 11th-level magician, and his strength should be far worse than his 14th-level guardian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She subconsciously leaned over to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this cold winter, only Rogge is the only safe and warm place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge had some surprises, but he would never let go of these opportunities and take advantage of the situation. The wind butterfly was shocked and struggled for a few times, but lost to the brute force of Rogge, and was extremely afraid of the cold outside, and did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was really frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows that these seemingly strong and proud elves are actually very fragile. They have been hitting their spiritual defenses bit by bit, and now they have finally achieved results. But the decisive blow did not come from his series of bloody commands, but from the murder of the mysterious woman in the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She murdered these elves, it was this murder that completely defeated the will of these elves. I don't know why, Rogge knows that if the woman is interested, the elves will only have the outcome of being slaughtered, and they will be the massacre that will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge couldn’t see through her strength, and he knew that she was already in the sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreamy and beautiful woman, the woman with the legendary power, where are you from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge doesn't know the answer. He has the feeling that he will uncover this mystery in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf guardian warrior also clung tightly to Rogge without knowing it. They always feel that there is an invisible danger around them. Only the place around Rogge is the place where true warmth and security are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep, the Earl's Castle is dark, and there is no warmth and warmth of the past. Under the cold moonlight, the figure on the tower is still motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and the elf warriors are still standing and looking at the castle. I don't know, he has already embraced the butterfly for an entire afternoon. This elf woman, who is so disgusted with her own, is crouching at her feet like a cat. It is conceivable that she is so scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when the moon has become blood red, and an electric light suddenly bursts, and then the castle is full of devil’s laughter and call sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is skyrocketing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall figure rushes up the tower, two figures Handing over, only one trick, Earl Luck slowly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very tall devil with a black body armor and a huge sword in both hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle suddenly opened its doors, and a few small black warriors rushed out of the castle. They broke into the town, and when they saw people, they killed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The townspeople did not expect the devil to come so fast, the vast majority are still packing things, for a time, a dozen people have fallen to the black warriors Under the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face was dignified. He gently pushed the wind butterfly and sang a long spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black flame did not live out of Rogge, gathered in his hands, forming a black giant shield and a long handle. After a while, the blazing black flame emerged from the axe shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s body began to glow with a faint light, but it was very noticeable at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory's huge body also appeared, and Rogge jumped up and stood on the top of Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
