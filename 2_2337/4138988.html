			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book on the second day of the sky<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day of the sky<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly fell on the ruins, watching two relatively young, arrogant little girls, it is already speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the undercurrent of these two little girls is frantically surging, and the invisible pressure even crushes the surrounding gravel and furniture fragments a little bit. Powder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the black hair are falling like a mirror, and Nafi’s blue hair is flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiaofengyue looks like twelve or three years old, and his figure is a few years taller. And her strength has also grown significantly, and there is a faint temperament between the gestures. It seems that her control of power is not enough, so there will always be a breath of silk power leaking out of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nifei, who is opposite her, grew even more amazingly. She grew up a dozen centimeters in the night and looked like she was seven or eight years old. . The little face was a little childish, and Du Li was so obvious that he would grow bigger and look like a beautiful person who dumped all beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this beautiful little face of Nafi has nothing to do with the fat face of the fat man. When the two stood together, no one would see the blood relationship between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger strode forward, grabbed the wind and the moon from the air, took it in his arms, and then grabbed Naifie’s back neck, like She also lifted her up like a kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these two little guys, the fat man was full of anger and snorted. The result was just under the raging undercurrent, and the two little girls were replaced with a pure expression, which looked like a completely harmless look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at Nafi. The blue color in her eyes faded and she was replaced with the blue of the sea. The fat man looked at the wind and the moon, and the pair of silver plaques were watching her. However, Xiaofengyue has grown up at this time. Under such a close distance, the lethality of her cold face is too great, so that the fat people who are used to the faint color are slightly dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you fight?" asked the fat man with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that when he spoke, he knew it was wrong. Feng Yue and Nai Fei certainly did not do it. Because their two light confrontation is enough to destroy this hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two little girls glanced at each other and turned their heads. But no one answered Rogge's question. In fact, until now, Rogge has not heard them say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the voice gradually rose, and the unusual church was found to have gathered here. The sacred warriors and mages of the left-behind land are not strong enough. The powerful sacred churches have all been transferred to the North by the fat man. At the moment, they are still on a long return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessing the flight of the piano is the fastest, she landed. I saw the fat man with one hand and one hand, holding two little girls in the same place. This scene looks a bit funny, but the piano knows the horror of the two little guys, so she can't laugh at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the piano, Rogge said faintly: "I did a magical experiment and it made a mistake. Fortunately, there is no one in this hall. Because If you are dead, you are in accordance with the usual practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano nodded and was about to leave. He was stopped by Rogge. The fat man looked at the two little girls in the arms and smiled a bit. He said to the piano: "I want to go out and do something, let me go with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When I stepped back on the land of the city of Lille, Rogge’s heart that had already become desolated was only a micro-wave. He sat in a carriage without any markings and came out from the side door of St. James Cathedral. Headed for ‘Helen’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few years, Lille City is much more noisy than Rogge’s departure. The whole city has a strong sense of war and can be seen as a team. Soldier. The wide avenues were overwhelmed by the heavy trucks, and the people on the streets were muddy, and there were many speculators and adventurers who tried to send war money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge walked out of the carriage, and he looked up at Helen, who had been defying for a long time, silently. On the same day, the defender Elyssey was killed in the battle of the pig king. Helen changed to a new owner. Helen is now overhauled. It looks more luxurious, but it also loses the original taste without the elegant taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of the waiter. The fat man went directly to the top floor of Helen. There are only two suites on the entire floor, which is extremely luxurious. And the maids who served on the top floor were all beautiful and beautiful, and they seemed to have done a good job. It’s just that now these flamboyant dynasties can’t make the fat man tempted. He went directly to the room on the left. In the room, Kate and Franco had already waited there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two little girls who were behind the fat man were both surprised, but they were very deep at the moment, and the surprise was just a flash. Rogge let the piano take the two little guys to another room and sit at the table. The fat man doesn't want to put Fengyue and Naifi alone in the church. God knows that they will do something more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked around and asked, "What about Rennes? Why didn't he come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kate and Franco looked at each other, Franco said: "We did not inform Rens. In the past few years, his changes have not been small, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded. He is very clear about the character of Rens. This thief floats and floats, and his mind is not strong. Over the years, he has certainly not worked hard, and his superior life should have completely erased his willpower. At this moment, Rogge regained power, but after all, he was taken prisoner and returned to the land, and his identity was very sensitive. Kate and Franco met with him this time, and they took a lot of risks. Although Rogge did not ask, it must be that the two did not want Rens to know the content of the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three looked at each other and found that the other side had many years of weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They met twenty, thirty reunion, ten years, the finger has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a long time, Kate only said: "You are willing to surrender, after all, living is the most important. I heard that you are in charge of the Church in the Church of Light? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco indulged, said: "Rogge. Although you haven't been in the bright church for a few days, I have recently heard that your actions are very much. ... um, crazy. Since even I can hear this rumor, I am afraid that you have done a lot of work. You have made such a big foundation in the north, and as a result, you have been defeated and captured. I know that you must hate the church very much. But Kate is right, living is the premise of everything. Now that you have taken the real power. Why do you have to do this boring thing? Wait a day when you climb the pope's big place, and then slowly revenge is not too late! At that time, you have the power to hold it. Who is going to kill who is not doing it? We are not very clear about your life in the north these years, but since you can climb to such a high position in a short time, it should not be dead. Justice, faith, loyalty, these things that kill the dead do not let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "I am doing things for the church now, that is a last resort. Of course Dearly, His Majesty the Pope My position is really beyond my expectation. If it is not for another reason. As you said, I am slowly doing it in the church. The position of the pope is mine sooner or later. In fact, it is not bad. However, in this war, our battles between the vulgar and the vulgar are in fact insignificant. Those who really decide the fate are the gods who are high above me. I have nothing to do, that is, killing a few people in the church. Don’t say that it’s just a group of dogs raised by the church. Since the battle of the gods has already produced results, the ending of the secular war is already doomed. So now the church does not need so many dogs. Since they already have me A very good dog, then what is the big deal of the death of the church? And I can also try the Pope's bottom line to see how far he can tolerate me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate looked at Rogge and sighed: "Rogge, you were very tolerant, how old is now. Instead, it has become so arrogant? Even those who are holy It’s no use, but in all fairness, their personal strength is very good. Is it killing, but also a little value to kill? What's more, now they are also the knife in your hand, how can you not hack people, first lick your own knife "The truth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "Before, because there are too many people who can't afford to sin, they have to bear it. Now look at the whole In the plane, how many guys are qualified to let me endure them? Even the Austrian-Hungarian emperor and the Bavarian Grand Duke. I don’t need to look at their faces. Of course. The right thing, the bigger the better. Now the church In my hands. This kind of good opportunity does not need to be white. You should think about it, if you want to climb up again, who else is on your way. These people can pull down and pull down, it really can't fall, I am looking for someone to kill them. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate thought for a moment and said: "I have been with the brothers in the Legion for a short time, and I am reluctant to let them down. And the magic image of the Principality will soon be built. At that time, I will transform my army into a Golem army. So I It’s already very good at this position.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Golem? Is it related to the Devil of the Babylonian Empire?” Rogge asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate said: "I heard that Dagong caught the wind and sword Saint Lentini, it should be the secret of the magical image that was tortured from her mouth."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man nodded and got up and said: "The Magic Corps can be in your hands, of course it is best. But now the overall situation of the war has been fixed, it is estimated that the Golem is also It’s not very useful. It’s not too late, I have to visit my dear Granddaughter! You two...you must be careful in the future, but don’t just remember to call me alive, but I’m dead. The person who had already died should be in front of him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate smiled lowly and said: "We are such a person, I am afraid it is not easy to die!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco did not speak, just smiled in the shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three hugged each other and left. Rogge thought for a long time, or killed the piano and brought the wind and Naifa back to St. James Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano is a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge got off the carriage before the Grand Duchy and informed him of his identity. He was led by the waiter to Catherine's study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for Catherine, Rogge walked around in the study and took all the room to his eyes. He flipped through the neatly arranged documents on the desk and couldn't help but be surprised. These amazing documents were all reviewed by Catherine today and involved all aspects of the Principality. Rogge deliberately paid attention to the review and almost could not find any place to change. Judging from her review content, she has many aspects such as armaments, materials and people's livelihood. Rogge had to admit that he was still a lot worse than Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has hated Katherine. However, the fat man still quite appreciates her talents, and her cold and ruthless is also a fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Lord of the Church, Dear Lord Rogge, how come you suddenly think of visiting me? Can you say that you want to revisit the time between us? Have you ever had an intimate relationship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a gentle and perfect tone, the content of the red luo naked temptation, Rogge does not have to look back to know that it must be Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The experience of that half-month. It is truly memorable. But what impressed me most is the number of decisions you made to kill your own sister. Rogge said as he slowly turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine has a makeup, no modification. She really does not need to be modified, just revealing a white and plump chest muscle, it is enough to add enough temptation to her perfection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at Catherine and asked: "But I didn't understand it at the time. I don't even understand it when I take over the church. Why do you need to kill?" Androni? With the great power of the Church of Light, the Holy Church has at least the strength to match dozens of Sanctuaries. Why can't you accommodate a new Juggernaut?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine went to Roger and looked at his eyes and smiled and said: "This is really not about her strength. If the sister is not pregnant with your child, then she The strength of the earth is to grow a few steps. I am not interested in killing her. But in any case, the children in her stomach can't stay. So seriously, you actually killed her."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why are you killing her child?" Rogge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled and said: "It doesn't matter if she or your child is alone, but she and your child, I must kill." As for why, this can't tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s face does not change, but between the waves, Catherine’s slap in the face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge gave a glimpse on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first contact with Catherine. It was the time when Catherine began to torture him after being detained. When the fat man saw Catherine at first sight, he knew that the blood of Androni’s sword tipped on the ground must be from her body. Therefore, Rogge hated Katherine in his heart, and he had bitten Catherine's hand, but he couldn't even break the skin, so his slap in the face used a lot of effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge’s control over power is far superior to that of the general sanctuary. If his slap in the face is on ordinary people, it is enough to immediately put the other person’s skull. Crushed, but hitting Catherine's face should only bring pain to her, but it is still not enough to leave a scar. However, Rogge never imagined that Catherine would have hurt this point, at least until the bruise disappeared, her appearance is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what can you..." The fat man frowned and didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine reluctantly smiled and said: "Small Rogge, you want to ask, why am I hurt like this? It's not because you played too much! I think the Pope should give you a list. The people listed above are all you can't move. My name should also be on this list?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is indeed on this list, and it is the column that can't hurt at all. The reason why he wants to calculate the power to shoot is to want to beat her, so that the bad breath of a chest. As long as there are no scars, Rogge can be derelict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly picked up Catherine’s slender hand and smashed it. Her hands are unharmed, and it seems that the area of ​​sacred protection is her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and clenched his fist. He is prepared to do nothing, and then hit her half and die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine suddenly said softly: "The sacred protection of my body is very unstable, and it may disappear at any time. If you start heavy, it is likely to hit." Death of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looks blue, his fist is raised high, but nothing can be said. Because he was too hard, his fist was already shaking slightly, and occasionally there was a trace of electric fire. But in the end, he only had a sigh and turned around and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stopped him and smiled: "Little Rogge, you don't cure my face, be careful that the Pope will know what will be in a statue." The flame rises higher! Your divine power is very skilled, don't tell me that you won't be healed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man whirls back, Staring at Catherine. Between his wave, several treatments have been applied to Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the spell is surprisingly good, and Catherine’s perfect looks are instantly restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Catherine’s soft face has returned to its original state, and Rogge’s mouth floated with a smirk. He was about to break the bones of Catherine's body and up, and then healed her. Anyway, his magic is so full, so that he repeatedly toss three times five times, his magic will not consume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Catherine seems to know the thoughts of the fat man, smile gently, just said: "Right, little Rogge, my body's magic resistance is also very unstable When the time is strong, your treatment is likely to have no effect at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was shocked, but staring at Catherine’s eyes still It started to get colder. He is going to try and see if Catherine is telling the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine walked up to Roger without fear, almost pasting his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Rogge and smiled: "I know that you hate me to the extreme, and must be very convinced. But it doesn't matter, anyway, I am here. As for what I said is true, you can't try it, but I can bet you, if you hurt me, then the flame in a statue will be higher. If you kill me, Then the statue will become like other statues. How, little Rogge, do you have the guts to gamble with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed arrogantly, and the singular laughter filled every corner of the large study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
