This way Rogge did not go easy. He constantly experimented with Macbeth in words, and countless plans came out of his mind and were denied one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Chaoshan's Legion Headquarters is a grand four-story building with a rough and rustic shape, without any modification of the exterior walls, revealing the true color of the red rock. Extremely strong. In fact, the headquarters of the Legion itself is a small fortress. The dignified and thrilling deep red of the outer wall, in addition to the natural color of the rock, is also contaminated with the blood of countless enemies, including of course many soldiers of the Chaoshan Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the city on the first day of the city, Rogge will be in the future. Because Wallace didn't even assign him an office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the headquarters gate, a young guard shot a long shot and stopped the three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue Master, here is the place of the Legion, without the order of General Wallace, you can't go in! Please wait here for a moment, waiting to inform Huali Generals." The young guards were expressionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glimpsed, he never thought that the ‘tidal’ regiment was bold and rude to this point! However, under the fate of the fat man, there have been fixed orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said to the guard: "Do you know who I am? Tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The young guard replied: "You are the adult of Rogge Otta Rivers, the Prince of Empires."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why then why do I appear? Deer City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are ordered to lead the three regiments of the Chaoshan Legion and direct the battle on the Western Front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That said. You know very well that I am the highest commander here. Why don't you let me in?" The smile on Rogge's face has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young guards can see that there is some tension, but he still replied loudly: "As a non-commissioned officer of the Fourth Army, I can only go to China according to the sequence of the military. General Claus’s order is responsible.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older side of the gate looks like the older guards have felt that something is wrong and they have come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly turned back and looked at the old guard, faintly said: "I am the highest sergeant on the Western Front. I have the right to execute any smuggling place on the spot. Soldier. Now, go back to your post."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at Rogge. The old guard suddenly felt a cold, like a cold, slippery snake on his back. He jumped a few times on his lips and finally returned to his post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and looked at the young guard and said, "I am now ordering you, let us in."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard finally realized that the situation was not quite right. Under the gaze of a fat man, his face gradually turned pale, and the high forehead had fine sweat oozing out, but he still insisted: "Only the permission of General Wallace..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Rogge interrupted him with a smile and asked, "What is your name, serial number?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards respected a military ceremony, and sang: "The 4th Reloading Corps Defends the Warrior Wald!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded Road: "Very good, Wald. What is the eleventh article of the General Rules of the Emperor? Is it made?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Emperor should be unconditional Execution of the superior command, refused to execute the superior commander, according to the military rules." Wald's forehead on the fine sweat beads finally condensed into a cold sweat dripping. He is very aware of the meaning of these words in the military regulations. The imperial law is harsh, as long as you bring the two words, the ten ** is the death penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about Article 19?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden and crisp boot came from inside the gate, and Rogge’s beautiful adjutant rose quickly. She first bowed to Rogge and then whispered to Wald: "Go back to your post. General Wallace's order has been cancelled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;May turned to Rogge, the tone of respect, but the tone of indifference did not have any peace: "Roger, since you arrived, has not been to the headquarters of the Legion. General Wallace did not expect you to come today, but He is already in the middle of the office. However, these two are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked up and down this look and looked good. The temperament is as cold as the iceberg. Faintly said: "The identity of these two is naturally important, but this is not a secret that you can know by a small major. You can take the road well. Just, I have to meet Wallace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a faint sorrow in the eye of the eye, and the surface is still the indifference that is not moved by the foreign object, saying: "Please come with me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your subordinates are too disrespectful to you." Macbeth said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He communicated with Rogge in a spirit of volatility, and even Androni, who was behind him, couldn’t hear it, so he was not afraid to reveal any secrets. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge replied: "McWhite, this is normal. You know the war between me and the goddess of nature, and you can see that There are many natural goddess believers here. Unlike noble and holy angels, humble people are mostly selfish. They always expect to be able to control their own self-interest, whether it is what they deserve or whether it is true. Interests, or just some illusory fantasies. I have just transferred to the highest command here, holding the power to kill, but you see, these natural goddess believers have tried their best not to let me take over the command, or even let me enter Legion headquarters! Actually, the reason behind it is very clear! Indeed, I have had wars with the goddess of nature, but this is not the real reason why the soldiers here reject me. They are just for their own self-interest, just want to sit on me now. The position. If their faith is pious, someone should have jumped out to assassinate me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s spiritual fluctuations are still echoing in the air, Top suddenly sounded shrill scream of tearing the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A military heavy-duty arrow smashed into the air! In the afterglow of the setting sun, the triangular arrow made of hardened steel shines with faint blue light. On the edge of the barb, the barbs saw a smile on Rogge's chest, eager for the feast of blood and flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge looked at the giant python, and the smile on his face was not half a point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Macbeth adults! Can't let these pagans be so mad in front of you!..." Rogge's spiritual fluctuations are instantly conveyed to Macbeth's consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbee two long eyebrows, stretched out his left hand and grabbed it, the force that was enough to run through a reloading knight suddenly appeared in his hand, completely Nothing has just come to the air and come to the ground to kill people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the horrified eyes of Macquarie, Macbeth vigorously illuminates a cluster of transparent flames. The smashing arrow made of pure steel quickly rose red from the grip of his hand, in a blink of an eye. The whole arrow turns from green to red, from red to white, and finally into hot steel, spilled on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Macbeth’s left hand with a faint flame is still innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all happening too fast, not just Rose, but all the officers and fighters from the gate to the main building have not responded for a while. I stared at Macbeth's left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, a tall tower was uploaded with an exclamation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth snorted, his eyes glowed golden, and he didn’t see any movements. A sentinel in the tower screamed and seemed to be An invisible hand grabbed and volleyed to Macbeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue said again: "Macbeth! You can't let these pagans understand your power and brilliance. You have to lower it slightly." The difficulty of these skills, and take some small means, such as completely ruining the tower, the greater the momentum, the better the effect..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the foot of Macbeth, a golden magical array of fierce flames suddenly floated up, and at the same time, a gloomy roar came from the air. Dark gray thick smoke emerges from the door and window of the tower and all the gaps, covering the entire building. Subsequently, an invisible shock wave swept through the entire legion headquarters, and in a series of buzz, all the glass windows were blown up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to destroy the life of a vulnerable Terran warrior while destroying a tower in an instant. what does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an unpleasant snoring, Wallace’s sterling silver wine glass, which has a history of 1,300 years, is twisting. But Wallace did not know that his favorite cup had been completely destroyed. He just stood in front of the window, his face staring at Macbeth, watching the murderer floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace slammed back, pulling the adjutant alongside him, licking his collar and pushing hard, almost roaring and shouting: "Mom Earth! That's Oliver! Don't you say that you have sent Mrs. Frederick's wife and Miss Gongzi away? Why Oliver is still here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The The adjutant is half a shorthead than Wallace. Under the wrath of the sergeant, he must force his toes to not suffocate. He also tries to answer the question: "I... obviously watching their team leave! This... Oliver The younger son must have sneaked back from himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace must be open, glaring at the adjutant who was lifted off his feet and mad Trembling. After a while, he forced the adjutant to the ground and said it in a word: "Hua Jin, you better not play tricks behind me! Oliver Xiaogong is secretly coming back? Stolen back will steal the whole set of armor, will go on The post will be assigned to the squad?! Lao Tzu tells you that if something goes wrong with him, don't blame me for not thinking about the old love for ten years, so that you can live for the rest of your life!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Wallace went out like a gust of wind, his huge snoring quickly descended down the stairs: "Guards! All of his ** gave me out! Line up to meet Rogge adults ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjutant Hua Jin stood in the empty and dark room, smiled coldly, and slowly arranged the crumpled top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, everyone has sat down in the largest conference room at the Legion headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressionless Macbeth sits in the middle, and Oliver, who tries to assassinate Rogge, floats behind him. This is a very handsome young man, with a little childishness on his face, a golden light chain wrapped around his body, like a physical one, nailed his big hands and feet in the air. He looked a little scared, but when his eyes fell on Rogge. The panic turned into extreme anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals of the 'tidal' regiment are no strangers to magic, at least they recognize the gold chain that binds Oliver, which is a shackle. Only this magic has always been used to bind the dead spirit, but Macbeth can use it to bind ordinary humans! In Macbeth's hands, magic has transcended the common world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth’s eyes are slightly closed, as if they are not concerned about the outside world. From entering the gate to sitting here. He clearly felt that the gaze of people's secret bets has changed from contempt to respect and fear. There is even reverence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling this change with heart, Macbeth is thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no room for accommodation before the emperor's rules. The felony of assassinating the empire's prince and the top commander of the front line can only be the death penalty. General Wallace, this You should be clearer than I am." Rogge was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace is sitting next to more than a dozen generals. If it weren’t for Macbeth’s prestige, I’m afraid someone would have rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace slaps the table heavily and yells to the left and right: "Give me shut up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The generals are quiet. Wallace said slowly: "Adult Rogge has been leading for many years, and I must understand the feelings of our soldiers who have been a generation of soldiers. I don't want you to say that Oliver is a young child of Frederick. According to your opinion, how should this matter be handled? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge faintly said: "All is enforced according to the rules of the emperor. Convening a special court, arbitrating assassinations, and executing a ruling, that's it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace pondered for a moment and said, "Okay! Just follow the advice of Rogge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose standing behind Rogge suddenly said: "Uncle Rogge, even if you follow the rules of the emperor, you can't completely conclude that Oliver intends to assassinate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked up. I am cold and cold to the earth: "Here, I am the only one who has the right to interpret the emperor's rules. Major, if you open your mouth without permission, then I will be punished according to the crime of disrespectful officer. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the emperor. Disrespectful officers should be swayed in public. For Mei, the power of this punishment is unquestionable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace added: "What are the requirements for Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗A little glimpse, this looks very rough, Wallace is not simple, he never mentions Oliver’s business, and he is not encouraged by the passion of his men’s generals, refused to give himself more than even one. Ding point handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "Prepare a place for Macbeth adults, and I don't want to meet when I accompany Macbeth to visit the city of Sidde. To any hindrance. That's all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace waved an old general in charge of the Quartermaster, commanding: "Find the best private home in the city." Regardless of who the owner is, tell him that the house was requisitioned by the Legion. Also. Move out all the things in my office. There will be the office of Rogge in the future..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge shook his head and interrupted Wallace: "General. I don't need to prepare an office for me. The war on the west line, how do you want to fight, I will not intervene for the time being. As for both sides. How can the troops cooperate? You can discuss it directly with my generals. I just relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walace, this time, he is really I don't understand what Rogge means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at Oliver and said: "As for this young and brave Mr. Oliver, no matter how special his identity is, he must pass the emperor. **The trial of the special court. General Wallace, I will hand him over to you now. But such a felony must be strictly guarded, I want to double the guard is at least. General, if Mr. Oliver flees Then, all the prison guards in the prison will be dealt with according to the military regulations! As for the time for holding the special court, I think it will be better after seven days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The golden chain on Oliver turned into a little bit of shavings, and the invisible force field that bound him disappeared quietly. Oliver, who was pale, fell slowly on the ground, and his young face was still full of hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth and Androni stood up and followed Rogge. Rogge just walked to the door and suddenly patted his head and turned back: "Ah! I almost forgot. At the gate, the sergeant Wald refused to execute my order and immediately took over the prison! I will hang it tomorrow morning. As for Command procedure, Mei. You helped me to prepare it, and I will send it to my residence to sign it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace leads the generals all the way to send Rogge The headquarters of the Legion. He stood outside the gate until the figure of Rogge disappeared, and it slowly turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind him, there are dozens of gloomy generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sunset is still warmly stroking the city of Side, the generals seem to be dark, and the winds that roar over the streets are exceptional. cold. Wallace’s eyes fell on an old general with gray hair. Slowly asked: "How many guards should we have in one of our prisons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be a total of seventy-six people, including the prison officers." The voice of the old general is very dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two times the guard. That is one hundred and fifty-two people..." Wallace muttered, and he suddenly raised his voice and asked: "Can we find one hundred and fifty-two soldiers who are willing to sacrifice for Frederick?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have 30,000 willing sacrifice soldiers! "The spirit of the old general rallied, and replied eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand?" Wallace said a little self-deprecating. He looked around and thought that the conference room and even the entire city of Sild were shrouded in a huge shadow. In the sky, Mike White's cold face seems to be looking down at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Macbeth adults, this is the despicable character of human beings. Their attitude towards you. In fact, it directly reflects their evaluation of your heart. For example, the believers of these natural goddesses, because they look down on me, they don’t even prepare for me in an office...” Rogge and Macbeth traveled around the city and communicated with him with spiritual fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is still as they are, following them silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, Macbeth. It is the angel of the order of the gods of the order, the prince of the ancestor, who was given the glory of the four wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about Achilles? The Light Angels were created by Tiratemis. They have not even entered the official angel sequence, just the fighting machine, the doll of the Lord God! And how can the Tiramis's godhead compare with Frian Mill? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since coming to this world, there are only two people who truly respect and admire Macbeth before it exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is Catherine. One is Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth took a deep breath and spit out slowly. His subtle movements naturally did not escape Rogge's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanli Wasteland, the peak of the lonely peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon are sitting alone on the long handle of the Death Scythe, and a pair of swaying swaying, letting the swell of the cloud stroking her skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver eyes are quietly looking forward. Under the blue sky in front, there seemed to be a pair of bright red eyes, and she stared at her quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud sea below the windy moon surged, and Gregory’s huge body floated out, habitually stopping after flying to the wind and moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! I have sent Ston to the Moonlight Dragon City. Silver Dragon King Cranio promised to treat him with the last bit of water in the Dragon Pool. But... she doesn’t know it. Can such a small pool of water cure the injury of Ston.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon faintly, still quietly Look at the sky ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory knows that the owner is in a bad mood. At this moment, it is not a good opportunity to shoot a horse, so I chose to be quietly suspended in the sky. It was bored and looked forward to the wind and the moon's gaze, and it was desperate to go, and even the dragon scales behind the neck were erected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory wants to escape on the spot, but its fear of the wind and moon in the soul is overwhelming, so you can only choose to tremble in place. Under the endless fear, Gregory only felt a burst of hair in front of him, and his body became heavier and heavier. If there was a purple lightning bolt in his head, Gregory It is very likely to be the first sacred dragon to be stunned in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the front of the wind, the bald head, the black robe, the bright red eyes Achilles is coming out of the void, he is enough to charm the world Thousands of people smiled, raised their hands, the bright red light on the fingertips of the fingers, shuttled into a fine mesh, and instantly ushered in a red cloud in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is still sitting on the sickle and staring at Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles in the air, as if there is no such thing as the existence of the wind and moon, he danced. The red cloud was dragged by him, and it was wrapped in the shape of the genius. The silky traces stretched out in the wild maneuvers, like the dazzling gesture of the Alna dancer. In the bright red of the sky, the hands of the real dancers are divided and combined to convey the incomprehensible rhythm in the darkness. The two radiant glows bloom in the palm of the hand, turning into thousands of bright red silk threads from the top of the head. Like the Milky Way of the Blood in the night sky, it is a tribute to the dancers. Gregory suddenly felt that everything he saw was very familiar, and it took a moment to think about it. The exact same action. This Achilles is just a replay of the scene of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoning the power of Achilles's inability to measure, his fighting stance is undoubtedly a dance that fascinates all beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fengyue, so repeatedly enjoy this unique dance, unaware that the sunset is rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took until the last scent of the night sky dissipated, and the windy moon condensed into the air, throwing the death sickle into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory, who was half-awake and awake, suddenly woke up and immediately flew behind the windy moon. It felt that he should say something at this time, but he could not find it. When the right flattering, groggy, it suddenly worried: "Master, what does the Vena master do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
