How long can I live?" Rogge smiled and asked, relaxed, just like talking about other people's life and death. same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss looked up and down at Rogge and said: "If Miss Androni can stay with you all the time, then there will be no support for one year. Question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If she left?" Rogge continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It depends on your will and whether you can concentrate on it. According to the growth rate of the natural goddess, you will not be able to cope after half a year. Endless attacks, and died under the occasional slack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded and smiled: "Then my time is still very long. Well! There are still many things to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss looked at Rogge and was not in a hurry: "The wrath of the goddess of nature is a ninth-order magic. Purely from the magic system itself, the ninth-order magic has been at the peak of all the magic of the world. But the magic is only magic, and the magical works performed by the goddess of magic and nature by Druid are not in the same language. In this world. There hasn't been any magic that can't be cracked yet. So Rogge doesn't have to be discouraged, maybe one day the river of destiny will bring the cracking method to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge smiled, faintly said: "I hope so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss always sent Rogge out of the palace until he watched him step on the carriage, and then left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage is empty and there is no one, not even the driver. Rogge took the driver's seat and drove back to his residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the wrath of the natural goddess. Rogge is dead around. It’s not long before the strength of Furya’s land, and the elves guardian warriors are even less likely to approach Rogge. It is because Rogge can only drive by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that day, she has not had too many adverse reactions, but she is no longer inseparable from Rogge as she used to. Most of the time, she is completely missing, so Rogge can only face the attacks that may occur at any time. Only Androni will return to Rogge every day to guard him. Let him rest in peace of mind for a while, to restore magic and spiritual strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge returned to the government. The trail went to the room of Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the door gently, and after a while, Froya opened the door. As soon as the door opened, Rogge stepped back and opened the distance with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin hair is messy, the eyes are a bit black, and I haven’t been so sleepy for a few days. The clothes on her body are clean. But not neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly covered her mouth and yawned, only to think that Rogge was still standing outside, so he gave Rogge into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stood in the corner of the room, not farther apart. Froya is a very neat and clean woman, but at the moment her room is in chaos, magic potions, materials, utensils and books are piled up everywhere. In particular, the book about magical land is so amazing. The center of the large workbench on the other side of the room. I barely cleaned up a place with thick notes. The extremely gorgeous and flattering font is known from the hand of the little fairy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge saw Fu Luoya in the past, she was mostly deploying magic potions. But this time she seems to be studying the magic book, and this piece of hard work, let Rogge secretly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little demon saw Rogge standing next to a pile of magic books and immediately screamed: "Don't stand there! Don't change my book." Become a monster! What are we going to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles. Had to bring Fu Luoya to the terrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria, I have to leave for a dark forest in two days. I don’t think you are safe in the emperor. It is best if you can leave immediately. Go back to the city of the gods." Rogge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat, are Pompey and Alexander ready to harm you? But Druid has fallen, but you should have some use for them. They are not a raw hand in politics. How can this turn? Is it because...the wrath of the natural goddess? Do they think that you can't live for a long time. Nothing makes use of value?” Froya frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at this tempting little goblin, surprised by her keen political sense of smell. Some are fascinated by the style that she inadvertently reveals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he must stay away from Froya now, all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria and Rogge looked at Richelieu in the night. Only she is in the left corner, Rogge is standing in the right corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrace is very large and they are very far apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria, go back and pack up, bring all the elves back to the city of the gods. All the land..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria knows all the elves that Rogge refers to, including Wind Butterfly and Rumsfeld. She asked: "So the elves guard the warriors? Don't you need them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and nodded, said: "I am now ... don't want to see any elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it because of the wind butterfly, you don't want to face the elves?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed softly and said, "How can I be so fragile? The death of Wind Butterfly really makes me very sad, but I don't want to face the biggest reason of the elf, or because it will Reminds me of Ajani. After all, I didn't finish her last wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, wind butterfly...she was at least very peaceful when she went. Happy! Your dead fat man has always been alive in the first place, but death for her, I think, is really a relief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was silent, and he sighed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But one thing is very strange. Has Rumsfeld been transformed into a Shadow Knight by you and erased all the soul marks? Why does he appear? In the city of the Clouds, and it looks completely restored?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly said: "I have repeatedly checked his body. Pull In the field, the land is indeed restored to the elf's body. And the abilities are strengthened. But it is normal to say that the natural goddess' ability lies in nature and balance, so the unbalanced things are returned to their original state. The Druids are very good at one skill. Since I was able to transform Rumsfeld into a Shadow Knight, it’s no surprise that the City of Clouds has the ability to change him back to the Elf. From that day before he died. At least he recovered some of his memory. Maybe it’s just a piece of memory, but this has already been explained. How much arrogance I have said that has erased all his soul marks! The broad and far-reaching world of the soul is no less The world we are in now. I just opened the door to it. I thought I had traveled through every corner of it. I still remember that in the Church of the Light, the fifth page of the chapter on sin and punishment said that arrogance It is a sin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya was silent for a moment, and suddenly smiled and said: "Dead fat, how old you are! It is so old-fashioned." You don't even think about it, how many old guys can't fight you now! Ah. Right, you are not the most hateful church, how can you go to see their holy scriptures? I think you can recite them!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and said: "The first step is to understand the enemy. The Holy Scriptures of the Bright Church are very interesting and worth reading. If you open arrogance and prejudice, then it does record infinite wisdom, and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused. I smiled and said: "...the many secrets of the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya cried in surprise, saying: "The holy code is not rich. Can you buy the land? Believers who don’t have money can go to the local church to read it. How can you record the secrets of the gods, isn’t the Holy Scripture you got different from the version I saw?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head and said: "There is no difference between the land and the communists I got. I just dealt with several angels who came." Well, I know them a lot deeper. So there are many seemingly exaggerated and nonsense miraculous records in the Holy Scriptures. And those descriptions about past life in the same way as some small religions are many true!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chapter of the Order of the Holy Scriptures says on the 44th page that God reveals the truth to the people, but the eyes of all beings turn a blind eye to it." Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya suddenly remembered something, and the face of the unparalleled face gradually became pale: "If...if the things of the gods recorded in the scriptures are true , then... you are enemies with the Church of Light, are you not enemies with the gods? You... Have you ever thought about this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "I thought about it for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why then!" Froya stared at Rogge with green eyes. Cried: "In fact, you can't beat the church, you can't be enemies with the gods! Why is this impossible thing to do? You have the right now. The money is there, and it is not settled. Ok?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled. Tao: "In addition to the gods contained in the Holy Scriptures, there are other gods in the world. Moreover, some things can be done even if there is no hope. I have been so savvy for so long, and occasionally stupid, it is no big deal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's eyes are getting brighter and brighter, she is staring at Rogge: "Not like this, you must have another reason!" Roghaha smiled and said: "Okay, don't guess, how complicated is it? Don't worry about me, wait for me to come back from the dark forest, everything It will be fine. You are staying in the city of the gods, and I will come to you after I come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sighed, Knowing to ask again, this fat man must not say. She sighed and held her hand and looked at the distant lights. She asked quietly: "The army of the empire is so defeated in the dark forest! It is too dangerous, can you tell? I, what do you want to go to the dark forest? If it is not necessary, don't go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take something in the dark forest, and then go along Do something. These things are very important, don't go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sighed faintly and said: "Dead fat, ask you nothing. Ken said. You always don't trust others, and how can people really treat you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge, taste for a while This sentence of Ya. There is a slight sourness in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also sighed and said: "Froya, I have nothing to do with going to the dark forest this time. But in the dark forest, this place In action, a few people will be much easier than tens of thousands of troops. Don't worry, I am sure that there is no worry about life. If you know these things, you can't help me. But instead of worrying, why bother? You are in God. Take a rest in the city of Sui. I will come back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria didn't say anything for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she suddenly said, "Will you take Anne with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria said: "Then I will be more worried. Death class, how have you not seen him for so long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now Nicholas is not dead, it is estimated that it will not last long, the death class is very clear about this. His mission has been completed, naturally will not stay with me." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This dead old man! You know the money! Money! Money! When the mission is over, it slips, and there is no love at all! What I should have given him to drink. The next poison!" The little goblin couldn't help but groan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles. If you think that this little goblin is seriously poisoned, the body of the death class will be strong even if it is strong, and it is likely to be poisoned on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that she will easily be offended in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked at the moon in the night sky, stretched out and was ready to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Froya stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled back and said: "What else? I can't accompany you now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rogge nodded. Road: "This is no problem. Now within two minutes, it will never happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you close your eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, in order to suppress the wrath of the natural goddess, his mental power has been fully operational, and the skin is faintly revealing a faint silver glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the breeze, a touch of faint scent came quietly. Silently passed through the nose of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pieces of ice and ice softly touched the ears of Rogge, and then Fu Luoya’s low and slightly hoarse voice sounded, and that burst of Soft and quiet, swaying the deepest part of Rogge's heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can come back to see me, then I will be cheaper once. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the breeze of the blue, swept over Rogge and went to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue's face is a satisfying smile, and it takes a long time to open your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gale whistled past the vast wilderness of the North. The wind is covered with large and small sandstones. When the wind is weak, some large stones will fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is a roundabout over the wasteland, and a large number of gravel falls like rain. Knock on a huge keel wreck. A loud, loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint sky flashed a brilliance, and Wella’s figure appeared above the keel. The dragon soul gun in her hand pointed obliquely to the ground. In the transparent gun body, you can see that a silver light can't stop flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at the dragon's cheekbones below without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one-and-a-half-point piece of minced meat on the cheekbone, which is very clean. In this wilderness where there is no scavenger, this can only be explained as the dragon meat has been removed. The keel is broken, the dragon's teeth and the claw's tip are all gone, and there are countless marks of being cut on the thick ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, this predecessor of the horrible keel, once spit out the dragon and flames of the world, fighting alone against the five strong, and its In the middle of the enemy, there is even a god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genius of the Silver Dragons, Nicholas, who is known for his silver miracle in the world of dragons, is now so late? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina couldn’t help but feel a bit of disgust at Lentini and her Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who sees the body of Yinlong will not let go of the precious raw materials on the mountain. However, the silver miracle used to be a rare tyrannical existence in this world. After cutting through its body, why not spend a little more time, burying the bones that can not be taken, leaving it with a last dignity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently stroked the dragon soul gun in her hand and sighed. Although Lentini is annoying, she is doing it step by step according to her own plan. The effect is even better than the most optimistic situation in the plan. After all, it takes a certain amount of talent and enough metamorphosis to ruin the silver dragon bones to such a point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s wrist trembled a little, and the gun immediately revealed a faint silver mist, condensing into a dragon shape in the air. Although the fog is thin, it can still be seen that this is a proud, majestic and elegant superior dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the soul that was permanently sealed in the Dragon Soul Gun, Nicholas Angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's wings in the air circled a few laps and found the corpses on the ground. It immediately stopped. Unbelievably staring at the keel full of nicks. It hurts so badly that it is in pain. Some of the past episodes of the past are lightning-like and have passed through its soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas is extremely angry, it suddenly looks up to the sky, and sends out a dragonfly with endless anger and sadness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wella's right hand and five fingers tightened, the dragon soul gun flashed a burst of silver streamer, and the dragon soul that was still flying in the sky was immediately sucked back into the rifle by an irresistible force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned around in a desperate manner and stepped into the void. after all. This world is the strongest of her opponents, and one less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the day, Moonlight Dragon City has fewer points and more rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole moonlight dragon city has been emitting silvery silver for many years. These radiances not only add beauty to the Moonlight Dragon City, but are also a fairly reliable defense. The silvery light comes from the care of the dragon god, and it has a strong weakening effect on any negative energy that touches the darkness. In this way, even the Black Dragon, the most powerful enemy of Silver Dragon, is not willing to fight with the Silver Dragons within the scope of Moonlight Dragon City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, Moonlight Dragon City has already lost its brilliance, and the gale whispers through the high city that stands at the top of the dangerous peak. Ruthlessly smashing the outer wall of the Dragon City with sand and gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the wilderness of the North is already cold, and it will be felt in the moonlight dragon city that stands tall and almost close to the clouds of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In memory, Cranio is the first to realize what is cold. Listening to the whistling cold wind passing through the passage of the Dragon City, I do not know why, she feels colder and colder. Later, I started to shake slightly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio can't explain why a powerful silver dragon can't resist the chill in the wind. She only felt that in the endless chill, there was another sadness and panic that could not be suppressed. It seems that there is an invisible existence that she absolutely dare not face, and she is already standing in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling wind brought a sad dragon 吟...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio was shocked Jumped up, although this silent dragon is not heard by others, but she can! Kranio, who used to be the prophet of the Dragon God, has the ability to transcend other silver dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that it is the call of Nicholas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio flew up and flew out of the Moonlight Dragon City and quickly flew in the direction of the dragon's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long does it take to fly? Her gaze fell on the body of the dragon that had just appeared on the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio made a bleak dragon. There was an uncontrollable tear in the amber eyes. She swooped and fell almost straight to the ground. Then I couldn't help but roll a few, and finally stopped next to the dragon's cheekbones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was fragmented, even though it had not been cut, even though there was no trace of flesh and blood on the keel, Cranio knew immediately that the corpse belonged to Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver miracle that once was...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio whispered low with a faucet Gently arched the skull of the dragon's corpse, and extended the dragon tongue, not holding the dragon's skull. She didn't dare to look at the fascia that couldn't see a corner or a tooth at all, but she couldn't escape all the sights in front of her eyes. She even began to fantasize, the next moment, the dragon will turn back to the elegant silver miracle, and respond to her endless love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio’s tears flowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't know she is crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is getting colder and colder, and her heart is frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kranjla suddenly looked up to the sky, screaming and screaming through the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is her crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally cried out...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The array of dragons from sadness to weakness, by Qing Yue to hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cranio suddenly stopped the sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
