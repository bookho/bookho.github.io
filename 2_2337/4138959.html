As for the goblins and the underground gnomes, these little things that believe in darkness are not considered to be the Lord's The servants now. The orcs in the western part of the country are still observing the creed of the Lord God. However, the orcs in the Central Mountains have turned away from the faith of the Dark Lord. From your report, they still want to let the world recognize their ridiculous wisdom." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low voice of Feuerbach’s voice echoed in the study, and the slightly ironic and cold tone seemed to have lowered the temperature of the study. But Rogge just let go of it. He knew that the orcs could have been placed in chaos or dark camps, and they were still worried that the orcs had something to do with the dark gods that the emperor believed in. It now appears that the huge new orc empire of the Central Mountain Range has left the dark camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the darkness, is the orc trying to find light? Rogge suddenly felt that this conclusion was a bit funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, judging from the rescued elves, the orcs must have held major ceremonies in the orc temple. I think it should be dirty now. It’s time for the stupid guy to teach a lesson. Not to mention that there are tens of thousands of elves still in the hands of the orcs. These elves can also be used for the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great After a moment of indulging, I finally said: "It takes two months to get through the passage to the south. The time is very abundant. If you are an orc, you should do it. You need to talk directly to Sara Wenger." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated for a moment, and he stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach said: "Despite some words, the Lord God is very tolerant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge thought about it. Slowly said: "Your Majesty, what is the god of the Lord God for this action? The sudden rise of such a huge orc empire in the Central Mountain Range will never be for no reason. I think there must be a beast behind the beast. Quite a huge force, even a god standing behind them is not impossible. I tried to find out the location of the beast temple, but I am afraid that there are some powerful existences hidden in the beast temple. The theologians in the church have already searched the canones that can be found, but there is no such thing as a demon to be able to say clearly what kind of god the beast is. So in order to ensure that. I don’t know if the dark god can give me more. Some guidelines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach closed the book in his hand, stood up and walked to the map of the Empire hanging on the wall. Despite the indescribable darkness hidden in his body, his right leg was still awkward, and the mark left by the war did not disappear because of the dark power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great pointed to a piece of grassland west of the emperor and said: "For God, we believe. But we should not rely on it. You see, the empire originated from this film. A small tribe on the prairie. For centuries, the emperors extended a small tribe to the current great empire. They did not rely on the power of the dark god, although each generation of kings is the most faithful believer of the Lord God. Faith brings us There is only faith and courage, nothing else! So if you want to do this, then let go and do it. When you come to the head, pray for prophecy. It is not only impossible, it may affect your beliefs. Any prophecy can only see part of the fate, until the end of the moment, no one can know what the true fate is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach Going to the front of Rogge and patted his shoulder, it means profoundly: "God is not omnipotent. This thing. You should do it well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After coming out of the Emperor’s study, Rogge was at the waiter. Leading down to a partial hall, waiting for the boss. The fat man is thinking about how to ask Sarah Wenger for help. The door is open and the boss has walked in silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog stood up and looked at the boss, with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today’s boss’s attire is different from the past, and it’s replaced with a short robe that is easy to move. The back of the cockroach is straighter and the person seems to have more than ever. The spirit is much more. But this is the difference between lifelessness and a little anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes fell on a dilapidated suitcase carried by the boss’s hand. I respectfully asked: "The general manager. Your Majesty said that you will arrange for some help on the manpower and equipment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So equipment......." Rogge is respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Rogge did not expect the boss to refuse So crisp and neat. I still have some unwillingness, and my eyes are fixed on the suitcase in the hands of Sara Wenger. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't sense any magical smell in this box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss is still not dead and alive: "This is not a trivial matter. Since you let me assist you, I can’t worry about others, I have to run it once." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean that you want to participate in person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog does not believe in his own ears, I lost a word and asked. But he immediately smiled and excitedly shook hands: "This....... This makes me say something good! I really didn't think of it, didn't think of it! Oh, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Rogge is so rude, the boss can’t help but smile on his face. Whether it is true or not, this flatter is still very useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger, I am ready, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge said: "Good! Master, please come with me, we will start from the Great Temple of the Holy Church tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro is versatile, His accomplishments in architectural design are also masters. However, he was born in the Mozu, and his understanding of design, decoration and materials is very different from that of human beings. The temporary temple of the Holy Church in the port of Ludan is from his handwriting. The design of many places is wonderful, while others are very strange. In many structures, Miro uses a creature that grows out of the devil world and grows very quickly to replace the brick and stone structure commonly used by the Terran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, the elves and the devil have something in common. Only the elves use the land as plants, and the devils use Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and the boss in a carriage, directly from the side into the back of the Great Temple, and the car crossed two magic arrays, this stopped under. Their road seems to be flat, but in reality it is not a smooth road. If you look at the entire rear of the Great Temple as a huge World of Warcraft, then the entrance to the carriage is the mouth of Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge respectfully leads Sara Wenger through the room. Always walk into a luxuriously decorated hall. There are four or five sets of sofas in the hall, which is extremely luxurious and comfortable. At this time, all the strong players on the Rogge side have gathered here. Rogge and Sara Wenger came in and everyone looked at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the strong in the room like a cloud, Rogge could not help but secretly proud. At this moment, the strength of the people in the room is strong, and it has been catching up with the time when many strong people are coming to him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his tonight, there are still a few people who will listen to him. At this moment, they can gather so many powerful people, and they have already seen Rogge’s means. But the fat man intentionally or unintentionally ignored a point, that is, if there is no wind and moon behind him. His means are higher, and how many people will obey him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is intoxicated. In recent years, the strength of fat people has increased greatly, and the city of the heart machine has become deeper and deeper. But the vanity heart is there for everyone, and the rogue in this bone is certainly no exception. It’s just that he’s so powerful now that there’s not much that can make him vanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has not left from the happiness of vanity, and suddenly sees the smile of Hughes is not natural, and he seems to have not moved. But in fact, the body is moving quietly, it seems that I want to quit the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Sarah Wenger spoke up: "I didn't expect to see you here! How should I call you now, the dear elf? Elder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The always calm Shuuss suddenly seemed awkward at the moment, some helpless, and smiled bitterly: "It turned out to be Sarah Wenger. It has been gone for a long time. Time flies so fast! Since it’s an old man’s meeting, you don’t have to be so polite, you can call me Hughes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sala Wenger The turbid eyes stared at Hughes and slowly said: "It’s been a long time since we last met for a hundred years. The elf with a long life is really enviable. Now it looks like you and one hundred. Compared with years ago, I didn’t have much old age, and I have become an old man who can’t move. The king of the dark world, a hundred years ago, the elf killer who once wore a dragon and is now called Hughes. Very good. Very good. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, you can see through the eyes of the stone. Hughes only smiled and said: "Sara Wenger, I think you must have made a mistake. In the past, I did go into the Imperial Palace several times, and I took two things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four." Sarah Wenger is sinister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there are only three!" This time, Xius did not give in again, insisting: "And whether it is the same year or now, my strength is always inaccessible. Sanctuary, even if there is a bow of the Elf King in hand, it is impossible to shoot the dragons with one arrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah Wenger’s face wrinkles seem to be Blaming the faint black air, his words are even more chilly: "You are right, it is not an ordinary dragon, nor a general dragon, it is the Millennium Dark Dragon that guards the Imperial Palace! Only one arrow, one arrow It runs through the dragon skull!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can't be me!" Hughes denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" Sarah Wenger unexpectedly did not insist, but he immediately smiled and said: "Respected elf elder, your current name It’s Hughes. Didn’t I get it wrong? For a hundred years, I couldn’t think of the real name of the Dark World King when I was dying. I heard that you were in the Chichina Mountains...”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with Xiu Si's elegant smile, Sarah Wenger's old face is like a cold winter wood, his smile is a bit horrible, but his speech's lethality is obviously different. general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes immediately stopped his words, and smiled bitterly: "The general manager, now is not the time to revisit. So, I took it from the palace. Three things in the ground, except for the dragon gun that has been damaged, the other two are still there. Tonight, when things are done, I will pick it up and return it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Sarah Wenger sighed slowly and slowly: "Since you can take them away from my guards, these things should belong to you. The imperial power is strong, and there are no shortage of these artifacts. Just Time flies so fast. It’s a hundred years passed in the blink of an eye...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Effie pushed in. She may have just heard the last sentence of Sarah Wenger and immediately said: "The time of departure is here, don't be busy with the old, you are going to go back soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;It seems to have sensed what, Sarah Wenger turned his head and stared at Effie. Just as soon as he was in contact with the boss, Effie immediately shuddered. The blood in his face was gone, and he couldn't help but step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall figure suddenly appeared behind Effie. He stepped forward and blocked Effie behind him, blocking Sarah Wenger's gaze with his body. This person's face faintly reveals a layer of glass-like halo, not angry and self-defeating, it is Constantine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara Wenger and Constantine looked at each other, and suddenly there was a small and strong electric light between the two! The electric light flashed away and they looked calm. As if nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara Weng suddenly smiled twice and said: "I am really worth it this time! I didn’t expect to see the gods in the world. Bright ment division. With your local mana, you must have a high post in the Bright Church, at least it should be a cardinal. It is just a little dangerous for the people of the Church of Light!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Milo, who leaned on one side of the sofa, smiled two times with no good intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin’s gaze passed by one by one in the hall, the face became more and more dignified, and the sacred power of the body condensed. His skin began to become transparent under the intense brilliance of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the situation is a bit strange. Roghaha smiled and then strode forward, saying: "The time is not early, everyone has something to say, let's talk tonight! The orcs are our common enemy and solve them. We can have time to discuss martial arts, Than the test magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rogge did not say that most people in the hall suddenly remembered that the other side of the magic array was waiting for the patience of the person. And quite bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the strong ones joined together and entered the transmission magic array set next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peaks of Bimeng towering into the sky, shaped like the orc legend, the ancient behemoth who can spend thousands of years, and hence the name. The Temple of the Beast of the Sacrifice Beast is also established here. Under the peak of Bimen. The kingdom of the orc empire was built according to the peak. From the perspective of the orcs. The city is extremely prosperous, spectacular and grand, with more than 500,000 orcs of various races inhabited by the city. If you count all kinds of beasts that are used for mounts or other purposes. It has already exceeded one million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything in the Orc Capital is in perfect order, and it is hard to imagine that this would be a place where the orcs are known for their chaos and bloodthirsty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc's building is rough but tall and strong. This is fully explained by the beastly shrine in the peak of Bimen. It occupies almost the entire peak of Bimen, and the highest main hall is more than 50 meters. In terms of scale alone, it is not so much a temple, but rather a huge castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the main hall is decorated with a huge altar, which is different from the warm and bright fire of the torch on the wall. The green is the main color of the altar that does not extinguish the flame all the year round. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the altar, there was a figure wearing a thick robes. He wore a strange high crown, and his robes were decorated with feathers, skulls, gems, and magic crystals. He stretched out his hands and extended two light-colored flames in his palm, betting on the altar in the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than ten orcs of various races standing behind him. The equipment worn by these orcs is a rare magical device, and they all have a strong atmosphere of different qualities. If these orcs appear in the Terran nation, the most surprising thing is the wisdom of their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence in the Great Hall of the Sacrifice, and many orcs breathe in place, but they are too heavy and disturb the priest who is meditating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the torch in the temple is getting weaker and weaker, and the hall gradually becomes darker. It seems that the night has infiltrated the temple, but it is concentrated. The orcs did not notice this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest suddenly gave a slap in the face of hoarseness, and the flames in his hand leaped a few times and went out. He stood up straight, thought for a moment, and finally turned slowly. A particularly tall Centaur took a step forward and asked uneasily: "What did you see when the wise Auckenhaler priest? Did the beast god give us a god? How should we explain the suddenness in the prediction pool? The blood and black clouds that pop up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One troll on the other side also said: "The great priest, this unknown sign has been circulated among the tribes, there are several The tribal headhunter has been agitated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest Ogan Heller looks different from the ordinary orc, he is much thinner, There is a little bit of a fairy in the face. His eyebrows have become gray, and large drops of sweat are flowing down the wrinkles on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest took the staff around him with the hand of the manuscript, and looked around the orc leader of all ethnic groups in front of him, and said: "Since the prophecy pool has received blood and black After the pollution of the fog, I spent seven days and tried my best to see a little future. But the picture I saw was too cluttered and I couldn’t see any signs from it! According to the Beastly Code, this appeared. The situation shows that there is a powerful prophet who is also observing the future related to this sign. When the two prophets are paying attention to the same destiny, the eyes of their souls will interfere with each other, and no one can see the real The future. So it is known that there are a pair of powerful and dangerous eyes watching us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads of the orcs whispered for a while, then a half-orc offering The teacher asked: "The wise priest, the last plague brought hundreds of thousands of strong orcs back to the mountain of beasts. Do you think that these eyes that peep at us are related to this?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogan Heller One voice, said: "We orcs are not good at magic, so my eyes are far less than you. In order to get rid of primitiveness, obscurity and chaos, our families have paid too much for the power of magic. Even so, the magical power we can master is far too far away from our enemies, humans and elves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, Geng Heller suddenly felt a sharp pain in his chest, and there seemed to be a little beast biting his heart wildly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest suddenly raised his head, and the corner of his mouth began to flow out of the pale green blood. He hoared and screamed: "This... this is the most dangerous sign! Go... awaken the Prophet of the Earth! Then put all the ... the end of the day... the last day guards are released! Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
