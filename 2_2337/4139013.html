			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventh Day of the Book of the Seventh Day Trial (1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve Purgatory Angel Statues, Corresponding to the high heavens and twelve heavenly gods. When the twelve angels are gathered together, it is the time when the gates of heaven stand on the clouds of this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the Pope said to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands tall above the sky, staring at the faint space ripples that have not been scattered before, and there is a sentimental sentiment in the heart. Just now, he was thrown into the deepest sleep of Wei Na into the turbulent flow, as he did for Feng Yue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also originated from the origin of God, and also almost lost themselves in this plane, from the initial conflict to the future, to join hands to defend the enemy, Both for the other side to resist the enemy, but also in every aspect of the fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that all the past is going on with the weather. I don’t know if they will pass the endless stream in the endless stream of millions of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunrise rises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it has been in the air, Rogge finally sighed and slowly turned. A hoarfrost has condensed on the corner of his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not doing nothing now, but has too many things to do. Today, the infernal angels will be gathered together like a single one, although the statues are only a matter of time. And now there are eleven statues standing in the temple, the heavenly kings are infinitely powerful. If they continue to pay attention to this plane, perhaps the door to heaven will not need twelve statues of purgatory angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, the Purgatory Angel is always ready for the day, always good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes glanced across the land. He knew that the power of the Pope at the moment was already at stake. The new Infernal Angels are ready to be made at any time. Although the luck of the fat man seems to have always been good, he never believed in luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And instead of believing that the Church of Light will still be under the control of the Pope, the new statue will not appear, it is better to completely eliminate the possibility of the new statue. Rogge now knows that only when one of the forces reaches the peak, can it become the original image of the purgatory angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is thinking about the whole continent, and it is very rare to be qualified to become an infernal angel like the original existence. There are still a few strong ones that can barely be used on the mainland. However, many of them have fallen under the knife of Rogge and the Church of the Light. Rogge suddenly remembered that maybe the Pope had arranged this task for him. That is to save this mind. It is only in the eyes of Rogge that there is no difference between the old man who is in the high position and the ordinary, and the darkness of the message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge no longer thinks about this problem, he knows there is no answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again scanned the earth at the foot of the week, trying to find a strong presence, but nothing. Now Rogge knows the existence of the original statue of the Infernal Angel, except for himself. There is also a Bavarian Grand Duke. As for Xiaofengyue and Naifei, they are not perfect enough. The most important thing is that they have too little breath in this plane, so they are not suitable as the original image of the purgatory angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a day of departure, the Bavarian Grand Duke lost its sight as if it had suddenly evaporated, so that Rogge could not sense his breath. There are some hidden worries in the hearts of Rogge. I don’t know if the Grand Duke will make some conspiracy in the dark. However, he turned his mind and thought that it would be a battle with the heavens sooner or later. So what is the relationship later? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, Rogge left the incident aside and turned and flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top floor of the church is from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiaofengyue holds his jaw in his hands and concentrates on watching Rogge, who is busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is sweating, holding a sledgehammer in his hand, and is struggling to beat a tomahawk with a strong magical atmosphere. Just from the magical brilliance of the Tomahawk, it is not a special thing. It may even be close to artifacts. However, the matte sledgehammer in Rogge's hand looks even more like the top of the artifact. After three or two, the battle axe is beaten into a steel bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ding Ding's percussion sound is crisp and soft, and it looks very sweet. At the same time, there will be a sound of chorus, and the beauty of the sound can fully demonstrate the value of these equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One piece of precious and powerful magical equipment has become a long strip in the hands of Rogge. They vary in length and thickness. How ugly it is to be ugly. They not only change shape. And the magical attributes have completely changed. Regardless of the material of the equipment, it will become as soft as bread under the fat man. After a while, it was beaten and shaped. As more and more strips are placed on the ground, there will always be fluctuations in the magic between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, the fat man seems to be very strenuous, every time you hit a few, you have to stop and take a breath. After a short time, he was already sweating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has seen the lips, and the lips are slightly open, blowing out a wind that seems to have nothing. With a little coolness in the wind, flying around Rogge, he wiped the sweat from his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled at Xiaofengyue, but his mouth just opened, his expression was immediately stiff, and a layer of gray quickly climbed onto his face, then he The whole body is covered with a layer of frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon sighed softly, and the eyes immediately turned away. She is too strong and accustomed to destruction, blowing such a gentle wind, or for the first time in her life. As a result, she accidentally turned the soft wind into a hurricane, and the lethality was not generally strong. Even the fat man was frozen and temporarily unable to move. If the general strong person was changed, it would be seriously injured if it was changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man cried and laughed, and the whole body trembled. The body's frost was shaken off and the hammer was hammered to continue work. He grabbed it and added a long sword in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword is deep blue, and if it is the most quiet and quiet night sky, the blade will always have a little bit of deadly beautiful stardust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man silently lifted the starry sky to the front, staring at the blue sword front full of memories and temptations. The star-studded starlight reflects his face in a flickering mood, just like a fluctuating heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty who once held the sword quietly emerged in his heart. She is handsome and charming. The heart is hot, but there is still naive goodness in my heart. In a manly manner, she tries to find a place in her own power in the world of manpower that belongs to men only. But she is proud, conceited and simple, and is destined to the fate of failure. She dares to love and hate, to get everything she wants, and how to make it clear with those who are with the wind, with Froya and with him, how can they be clear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword is here. The Sage has gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and shook hands, and in the blink of an eye, the artifacts that are famous for their beauty and power are no longer there. Since the person is no longer there, what is the use of the sword? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy moon sits quietly opposite him. She was unaware of Roger's fluctuating fluctuations at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nefie?" Rogge asked while he was busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said that other things can help you, and the war that is destined to die is exempted. So she found a place to hide herself." Feng Yuedao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was surprised and thought for a while. Smiled and said: "It's a smart child." After that, he worked hard again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, the fat man has turned all the weapons and equipment into a small stick of varying lengths. When the last one was built, these extremely rough and ugly sticks suddenly glowed with magical light and made a subtle roar. A wave of * magical fluctuations constantly reverberate in them, and it is repeated. Later, every wave of magic light and shadow will trigger the vibration of the entire room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the windy moon is slightly dignified, these magical fluctuations meet each other, so many artifacts are integrated into one, so that she also instinctively feels some fear . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man keeps on his hands and uses these created thin sticks to form an iron cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cage is not big. After all, although the collection of the Guangming Church is rich, the equipment is not much in terms of two volumes, so the cage is not big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man can't press the joy of his heart, and he simply boasted: "Look at this cage! All the forces in the world are integrated, and they circulate, and the water does not leak! It's not that I blow, this cage door is closed, inside and outside is completely two planes, not only inside, but also two planes, not only Can block any attack from both inside and outside, and the time in the cage is almost static! What kind of artifact can do this? Hey, Laozi alone is enough to be famous, so if it is placed What is the price of the war of the god of war? Well, how can I get a big empire to change it! But it looks rough... No, this is rough!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man turned around the cage for a few laps, boasting for a long time, suddenly remembered that he had not yet named on such a great work, immediately picked up a small chisel and slanted his name. The calligraphy of the fat man is never worthy of compliment. Even after reading the book of Hilo, understanding the secrets of many planes does not help him to improve his calligraphy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but his name went up at once, and all the magical scent disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, come and see if you can find out what is unique about this cage." Rogge proudly said to Xiaofeng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon slowly rose, flew to the cage, carefully watched for a long time. Except for the things Rogge just boasted, she really couldn't find other unique things. She opened the cage door again and looked inside. Her silver plaque has clearly seen two completely different worlds inside and outside the cage. It may be because the cage door is open. The time flow inside and outside is almost completely synchronized, but it can still be seen that the world time in the cage is slightly slower. a little. But this fat man just said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiaofengyue came back and looked at Rogge with some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment she has grown up completely, except for the expression, the appearance is exactly the same as Fengyue. After all, this is the body of Fengyue. After she grew up, she became more and more icy and calm, and gradually became more consistent with the wind and moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart sighs, but his face is a smile that is not good-hearted: “You don’t think, is this cage the right size for you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiaofengyue was taken aback, not waiting for her reaction, but she took a lot of shots on her ass. She instinctively exclaimed, her figure flickered, and moved forward one meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was closed heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiaofengyue was really shocked. She tried to break out of the cage, but the world in the cage was self-contained, and the various forces complemented each other without any flaws. How to work hard, can not break the invisible barrier, touched the steel bars of the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several efforts did not work, she only looked at Rogge, would like to ask why she should be kept here. However, Rogge's movements are getting faster and faster, and in a blink of an eye, it becomes a variable light and shadow. Not only Rogge, but everything in the cage is like this. And all the sounds became monotonous and meaningless screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that this is not because Rogge is getting faster, but because the time in the cage is getting slower and slower. Xiaofengyue has rapidly increased its strength to be able to keep up with the rhythm of the world outside the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man stood outside the cage and looked at the small windy moon in the cage, sighing and saying: "Even if the plane is destroyed, this cage is not It will be bad. Although you can't hear my voice now, but... this is not your war, stay here well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He finally looked at the still-moving Xiaofengyue, shook his head, did not say anything, just patted the cage and turned and went outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Static. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden silence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absolute silence, the whole room quietly lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is in the same place, face like frost, staring at the strong light that penetrates through the window. There is endless pressure in the light, which is the majesty of the heavens! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly trembled in his body, behind a pair of blue wings unsettled stretching, relaxation to the maximum, and Shenghui and majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
