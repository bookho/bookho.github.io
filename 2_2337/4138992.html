			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book on the third day of the land<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat at the top of the main hall, staring at the distant sunset. The faint prayers echoed in the mountains, adding a mysterious color to this beautiful scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset slowly falls into the mountains, and the evening prayers of the church are also over. Rogge stood up, and a mouth spurted a faint black gas, and his face began to show a faint golden glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked at the sanctuary from the hall of prayer in twos and threes, Rog smiled and he even started to like these guys. After all, the power of their prayers really makes him feel very comfortable. For the first time in life, the fat man realized this feeling for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning and evening prayers are the lessons that every member of the church must attend. The content of the prayers is the same, and has never changed for hundreds of years. It is nothing more than a singer of the glory of the Most High God. However, a few days ago, the fat man brought back a thick sacred poem and exchanged the contents of the morning and evening prayers. In the first half of the sacred church, the singer's singer's content is different every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second half, it is a fat man, and must be pious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sacred church has long been accustomed to Rogmo’s order. The rigorous style of the sacred church made them wholehearted when they sang Rogge, without any water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the morning prayer, the fat man is like a person, and he looks good. Only when he walked down the top of the temple and walked toward the main hall, the radiance of his body had already disappeared. At the moment, he looks like a normal fat man with no power at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man stands alone in the transmission hall. Waiting quietly. There are more than ten small doors in the main hall, and behind most of the portals there is a transmission array leading to a certain cathedral. He did not wait for a long time, one of the small doors was opened, and the expressionless starry sword Saint-Pross walked out from behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a few steps forward and gave a gift to Pross, smiling: "Mr. Pross, you are coming, this is the whole The glory of the church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross looked at Rogge. I smiled awkwardly and said: "There are talents in the church of the Church of Light, and there are always four or five places that I can match. I am so powerful, it is no wonder that you can become a church at this age. Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross looked at Rogge, and finally his eyes fell on the starry sky of the fat man's waist, his face slightly dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge puts Prossian expressions in his eyes. But just smiled and said: "Mr. Pross, you are Anne's teacher. This time I invite you to visit the biggest secret of the Great Temple of Light, the Purgatory Angel Temple. I hope to make you The understanding of power goes one step further."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the words of the Purgatory Angel Temple, Pross’s face, which seems to have no anger, could not help but be moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Purgatory Angel Temple is as dark and deep as ever, and the space is filled with unknown powers. This power is invisible, but it seems to directly affect the soul. Walking in the hall, every step of the sound breaks the silence. It will provoke a screaming scream and resound in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross has completely dispelled the surprise on his face. From the moment he entered the hall, no matter how hard he tried, he could not make the steps of falling. sound. But he has no time to explore the secrets, because the first statue of the infernal angel has appeared in his field of vision! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every hall. Before every statue, Pross would be as if he had lost his soul and stayed for a long time. Until Rogge urged, he reluctantly moved to the next hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is very patient, while accompanying Prossia to walk around the temple, he seems to be casually asking: "Annie has always respected you very much, and obviously You also like her very much, otherwise you won't leave the starry sky to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross nodded, mostly minded still in front of me On the statue. Half a day replied: "She is the most talented of all my disciples. I have always treated her as my daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Prossis frowned, his eyes finally left from the image of the purgatory angel, and looked at Rogge. His eyes are as sharp as a knife, and he seems to go straight through the soul of Rogge and explore the true thoughts of his heart. Rogge smiled and stood as if he did not feel the fierce killing in Prossia's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stalemate for a while, Pross finally said: "Roger, your magic is going straight to the masters of Jero and Lhasa, and I used to I heard that your relationship with Annie is extraordinary. So this kind of revenge blade should not be lifted by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled. Dao: "Mr. Promiss, like a person who has been captured and converted to the church like me, the speciality of identity must be clear to you. I don't know how many eyes are staring at me every move! So my hands When the blade was just lifted, I thought there would be a strong hand pressing me down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pross also stared at Rogge for a while, this is Re-betting on the image of the Infernal Angel, faintly said: "Some enemies are tempted, she is one of them. She is not as simple as it appears on the surface, there are many secrets that you do not know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was silent for a while, smiled and said: "But I still I will go and provoke her. Look at Anne's place, can you tell me, when is the Grand Palace not under your protection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man nodded and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two went all the way slowly, but eventually they came to the last twin hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prossi looked up at the statue floating in the air, his face showing a false expression. He found. This statue is different from the statue in the front hall. There is a cold, arrogant atmosphere in the statue that is weak but extremely majestic. Prossia only felt that this faint breath seemed to have thousands of pressures. Even for a moment, he had the urge to back down and avoid it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starry Juggernaut slightly clenched his fists and began to sneak out of the stardust, which was able to withstand this invisible pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosses suddenly snorted and stared at the stars. Walk slowly toward the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he couldn’t see it, he already felt it was below the statue. There is a thundering force of terror. This power is rising, with a sacred breath of pure and strong, but also pervasive, and even the soul of Prossia feels burning. It feels like this powerful force is like a large burning flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prossia is both shocked and happy. This power is arrogant and pure, and the secret is infinite, just in line with the starry spirit. As long as he can unlock the mystery of this flame-like power. Then his starry spirit will enter a new realm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every step forward, Pross will feel the pressure of the increase, and this power is overbearing, even forced to ablate his perimeter defense Earth star shavings! He was engrossed, resisting the erosion of mysterious forces, and carefully searching for the secret of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge’s voice suddenly sounded behind him: “Mr. Pross, this is what I want you to watch. Heaven The Flame of the Holy Spirit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosses was shocked at the bottom of his heart, and suddenly found that the surrounding space did not know when it had completely turned into a deep night sky, countless splendid The stars are slowly floating around him. He first saw it, and then discovered that these stars were not formed by his starry spirit. In fact, the defense formed by his starry spirit has disappeared without a trace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the moment when the Stars Juggernaut lost all power. There was a sharp pain in his ass, and then a strong force came. Prossis finally lost his sorrow and screamed, and he couldn’t help but fall into the sacred flame of heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when the pain came from the body, Prossis finally saw the true form of the heavenly flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a beautiful, mysterious, powerful and arrogant flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is then dimmed, and the extremely hot heavenly flame has melted his fragile eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The celestial flame of heaven is like a monster that wakes up. In an instant, it roars and swallows delicious prey, and then falls asleep with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the decline of many heavenly flames. Rogge smiled with satisfaction. In his hands. The sapphire with its endless stars is quietly fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man thought about it and swallowed the sapphire. Just want to leave. But he took two steps and suddenly stopped again. He looked up at the statue, and for a long time, he sighed heavily, as if he had made up his mind, and his face finally showed a relaxed color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly jumped up and made a strange move in the deep space, and immediately rushed to the statue, took her, and then icy I kissed my lips heavily! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man hits his hand and immediately rises, and suddenly he has flashed out of the temple. His proud laughter rumbled and went all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark twin temples, the face of the statue is as cold as ever, but the corners of the mouth are slightly curved, and there seems to be a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the holy and solemn temple of the Great Light, the fat man squats along the little songs, as if not at all, fluttering to the Pope’s prayer hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus is standing outside the door of the prayer hall, waiting for Rogge. Seeing the fat man with such a frivolous appearance, the blood angel's majestic eyebrows are slightly wrinkled, and some are unhappy: "You are now the Lord of the Church, and you should be aware of some etiquette in this holy place." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "No problem! Anyway, I don’t know if it’s a dead or alive, and it’s still a lot of possibilities. Hey, I said, Augustus is an adult, don't you have a face all day! No expression doesn't necessarily mean majesty! But then, your wings are really good!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the fat man patted Augustus's shoulders intimately and strode into the Pope's prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus has a white face and stood for a moment. This is a bitter smile, as the fat man walked into the prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope saw the two coming in, slowly closing the light teachings in his hands, and walking weakly to the bookshelf, struggling to put the thick teachings back into place. . This simple action also caused the Pope of the old dragon to breathe for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little flattering, and the pope reached out and dipped a little fragrant dew in the Holy Grail next to the reading table. Sprinkled in front of him, muttering: "In the name of the Lord's glory. Those who believe in the Lord will have to walk through the barriers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is intermittent A small group of magical storms gathered in the prayer room, and then the space cracked, and a flashing space door appeared in the prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the space door, it is faintly visible behind the door is a splendid space storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a simple and direct space door is actually equivalent to a death trap. Even if it is a sanctuary, it is so straight through the space storm. It will also be torn into pieces immediately. Augustus and the fat man are no strangers to space storms, so this space door is nothing to them. Only the ** fragile Pope actually took the first step, stepped into the space door in one step, and disappeared into the space storm in a blink of an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was horrified, but seeing Augustus stepping into the space door as usual, he no longer hesitated, and he followed the space door. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the space storm, the mark of the Holy Light shines, and Rogge wears it from the other end of the space door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange hall. The ground and the walls are translucent, and looking through them is a far-reaching darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No days, no land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked down and saw only one piece of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small round altar in the center of the main hall. There was a holy fire on the altar. The flames are beating, not how bright. But in the darkness of this far-reaching world, the temple is like an island, and this flame is the only beacon of the sea of ​​darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
