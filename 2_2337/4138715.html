			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too sinister! It’s too mean!” Gregory sighed with deep enthusiasm, it was excited and excited, kept on the spot ** *. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The first time I felt a headache, this Gregory thought is too active now, it seems that this colorful world is really a big dye tank. Ah, is this guy not a good thing when he was in the Devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when, one master and one servant hid in the shadow of the cave and spy on everything that happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, he just wanted you to stop the big beautiful man at a critical moment, she and your brilliance is simply no match! But why are you not? What is the meaning of throwing a spear of a demon lotus? Don't you need to ignite the fire of the demon lotus on the bone spear beforehand, is your strength improved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I didn't want to throw the spear of the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear of the devil, do you have new skills? You must teach me, I have always been your most loyal servant! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the spear of the devil, at this distance, how can I have other skills to stop her sword?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory looked puzzled and asked: "If the master's master's mental impact does not work, her sword will not stab." Enter the owner's throat? That is a very powerful sword! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s brain was blank for a moment, "Is the master of the master not dead?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't die, his body is no longer human." I will stun the woman and fix his wounds. Since she has already killed him, she should not be able to get it for the second time. Humans are very strange creatures, sometimes very vicious, and sometimes very soft. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, master, repairing the wound will consume too much energy." There are too many enemies around us, although you have more than a dozen black warriors, but without you, those disgusting things will come into your territory. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will use his mental strength to mend his wounds." His mental strength is not very useful anyway. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the master, how do I feel that it is better to use the spear of the devil? Of course, your wisdom can't be guessed! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the spear of the devil, I will have one more bone spear. You also know how difficult it is to find materials that can be used as weapons. My death cockroaches are gone, and there are only six bone spears left, of course, to save some points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But! Master, you are not guaranteed to be able to stop the sword of the great beauty, he will take the risk."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe promise, the woman is not stabbed? Ok, I have been here three times, I am tired, I should go back." *** Coldly finished, back to the outside world went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory would stay and suddenly jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too sinister! It’s too mean!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shouted, almost excited To faint, the fart is chasing the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni calmed down slightly. She has been born in the home of the nobles since childhood. What has been seen in the past few years? In contrast, Rogge took up her body when she was in a coma, it is nothing. The ladies of the Rheinland aristocrats have never paid much attention to the festival. On the surface, they have maintained their loyalty to the family and their lover. In private, there are often many lovers. This is already an open secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure will not make Androni crazy. The daughters of the great aristocracy have no right to choose a partner. Their marriage has always been a political tool. The only way they meet with their lover is the lover. Since Anderney was seven or eight years old, her amazing talent and incomparable beauty have attracted countless marriages of marriage and marriage. Just this year, Pross, who had just become a sword, saw Androni, and her genius immediately conquered Pross, who was above the top. He immediately went to her father, Marshal Rosio, who has been a friend for many years. Asked to take this little girl away. Marshal Rosherio was far-sighted and readily agreed, and this was the fifteen years that made Pross extremely painful and regretful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I don’t know when from the beginning, the arrogant Androni has another quirk: extremely disgusted with the identity of men and women. She turned into a man's dress, and a few years later, she was convinced that she was a man. Two brothers, David and Gonzalez, had made a joke with this. As a result, she made a big fuss and even broke the Gonzalez bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of fifteen, she heard several large aristocratic children talking about the marshal’s family having a daughter who was easy to dress up and gay, and she immediately challenged the sword It is required to fight in the street, but it is deliberately killing these people after they have broken their hands and feet in the duel. The incident sensationalized the entire kingdom, and the heads of Marshal Rocherio took the difficulty and called the master to detain Androni. They are prepared to use this to eradicate the power of the Roscio family for a hundred years. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Marshal Rocherio has the support of the Bavarian Grand Duke, who has a heavy hand, and there is a Russell’s grandfather, who is in a stable position in the DPRK. After Pross heard about the incident, Starry Night arrived at the city of Wangdu Lille. He single-handedly killed the door and killed more than 30 warriors and magicians who had been encircling Androni on the same day. Marshal Rocherio moved at the same time, killing six families of political opponents, totaling more than 500 people, including two ancient families over seven hundred years, taking the opportunity to wipe out all political opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of the incident, called "Blood March", is a major event in the history of the League. However, the initiator of the incident, Androni was deliberately removed from all history books and materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven years, when the 22-year-old Androni returned to the kingdom in the name of Andre, he knew a few big things about the truth. The nobility is either a political alliance with Marshal Rosio, or a fierce and fierce fear of Prosecus. It seems that Marshal Rocherio has been three sons and five daughters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, she almost forgot that she was a woman, but now she has been beaten back to reality. She doesn't care about her failure, but she can't stand being touched by men. But somehow, Rogge always reminded her of Fu Luoya, no matter how can not kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not know that Rogge had stunned her soul with a fascinating human enchantment when she was in a coma, which secretly affected her thoughts. This magic he learned from the black crystal left by Alisis is the common trick of the devil to seduce human crimes. In fact, the celestial protoss also use this hand, but the name is called inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this type of magic that directly affects the soul, which is expensive and inefficient. If you don't want to be known to the recipient, the impact that can be exerted is very limited. On the issue of faith, the Heavenly and the Mozu have been fighting for the infidelity for many years. In the past millennium, the heavens have gradually begun to give up the method of calling for this unrewarding, and instead use the Guangming Church to directly intervene in human affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In somewhere in the world, Bone Gregory is still not getting rid of the excitement. It was thought that Rogge used the techniques commonly used by the devils of the most powerful devils, and could not help but shake the excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too sinister! It’s too mean!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory! Are you finished?" There was a sigh of anger behind him. Gregory immediately realized that the big event was not good. Before it escaped, *** had already caught its tail, and it took a few laps to throw it to the other side of the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni picked up his dark green breastplate. There is a Rogge next to it, how can I change it? She turned her head and said: "Rog, you should go out for a while!" She was empty behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni stunned, not knowing when the entire hall was empty. Rogge has already run? Was he just pretending to be impassioned? However, how can he explain that he gave the tears of the life-saving angel to himself when both of them had the poison of the dragon? Her heart is confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to change clothes, she walked over to the huge body of Trillen Hugh, standing still and thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I left, my brother David said to her: "Make sure you keep Rogge’s life, but if he falls in the church, You must kill him! If you have the opportunity to pull him into the family, don't let it go. If you chase it, or fight him, don't be too reluctant, let him go. In short, don't be with him. If you can't use it, you have to let him go alive. If he is in a day, then the church will not be peaceful. If one day you encounter an enemy who can't cope with it anyway, try to find him. That Rogge has too many secrets. So far, he has never really suffered from losses between the major forces. Don’t underestimate him because he is just a ten-level magician! This time the mission is very dangerous. Only the older brother can teach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit of the thousands of miles, the church's Kara Yang and Chris Ma's strength is known to them, they brought together hundreds of holy knights and law enforcers, but now only two of them, still have serious injuries, I do not know whether to survive Bright church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the beginning of his career, he has been arrogant, star-studded and sword-like, in addition to losing to Orphee Rocco. On Karajan and Chrisma, you can also win. But now it is not only incomprehensible to him, if Rogge is a little bit guilty, and when he is in a coma, he will add a sword to himself, and he will definitely die unclear. Even if he does not start, as long as the tears of angels are used by themselves, they will inevitably die under the poison of the green dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni always thought that Rogge came all the way with trepidation, but it was a series of accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But behind all the accidents, there must be inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed and remembered that she had just seen Rogge’s ability to rob her clothes and change her body shape. There are so many secrets in this fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If one day you encounter an enemy who can't cope with it anyway, try to find him!" David's voice rang in her ear again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closed her eyes and a tear in her eyes. "Floria, you are waiting for me. My body is dirty... but even if we can't be together, I won't see you going to destruction. You are not the opponent of my two brothers and the Bavarian Grand Duke, I No, but Rogge may be. Froya! Why don’t you go with me? We left this place, left the nobility’s ***, left politics and conspiracy, isn’t it good! Why! The world is not for us! Froya, do you know that you are willing to die under my sword and willing to give everything for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time, she Huodi stood up and wiped away the tears, like a frost. This is the end of the matter, and crying does not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the green dragon body suddenly came out with a slap in the face. She was taken aback and quickly circumvented the huge dragon corpse and saw Rogge falling to the ground in the sky, full of black air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hurried past, hesitated, did not help him, just kneeled beside him, coldly asked: "What happened to you, how can you fall here?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his eyes slightly, if the air is swaying, whispered: Is the service changed? Nothing.... I didn’t expect this dragon poison to be true* **It might not work..." After he finished, he turned his eyes and fainted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly panicked, she was extremely fast The ground finger clicked on Rogge's forehead, and the top was hot. She bit her lower lip and was helpless. All the detoxifying potions on her body were desperately given to Rogge, but the poison of the dragon's breath, which is These common antidote solutions have been solved?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni knows nothing about the poison, she stands up, looks around, wants to find some water, give Rogge The temperature dropped. However, there was no dripping water in the dragon cave. She stumbled and her body flashed like a light smoke. She didn't have time to think about it. Why is Rogge so shameless? How can a person who is lascivious when she is in a coma suddenly become such a gentleman, even if she changes her clothes and does not peek?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, Androni The figure returned to the Dragon Cave. She was holding a wet coat and didn't know where to find the clear water. She screwed the water on Rogge's face and body. So many times, Rogge's situation Slightly stable. She kicked a lot on Rogge's thigh, and said coldly: "I can do so much, you can't live, you can see your luck." Anyway, your luck seems to be good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found a corner and sat down in her clothes. There were too many things on this day, which made her confused, this sitting, body The injury was a bit more, and the fatigue struck, letting her fall asleep without knowing it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first rays of sunlight illuminate Ander from the crack in the top of the cave On Ronnie's face, she frowned and turned over, her arm blocked her face and went to sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog If the ghost is standing beside her, watching her two long legs straight and straight, she can't help but swallow. Since the biggest one in front of her eyes is halfway, she will not let her escape from the palm of her hand in the future. Heart! This time, the chasers who killed the church were almost completely annihilated, and Androni stepped into the trap he set. So now he is full of confidence in himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumored voice that was constantly coming over completely stirred up Androni’s dream. She slammed up and glared at her, and her hand was placed on the handle of the blue sky. A blink of an eye is a dazzling jewel in front of you. Androni stayed for a while, only to remember that last night was sleeping in the Dragon Cave, are these dragon treasures? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up, only to see a pile of various gold jewels and some magical items piled up in front of the open space. It was piled up more than a meter high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are a lot of wealth, but there seems to be some gap compared to the legendary dragon's treasure. What kind of treasures did Androni have not seen since childhood? These ordinary jewels are still not in her eyes. She looked around and saw that the fat figure of Rogge was busy on the dragon's body. It seemed that the action was not very convenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni walked over and watched Rogge slam into the scales of the dragon's back with a black shackle and sled the scales with enough strength From then on, the roots were cut for a while, and then a scale was removed. Rogge turned back and smiled at Androni. The black gas on his face retreated a lot, but it was still green. He went back and continued to peel off a scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want these dragon scales to do? Is it so troublesome to pull out one by one?" she asked inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Missy, these dragon scales are good armor materials! Oh, don't forget that I used to open the equipment store before!" Rogge answered While pulling hard on a dragon scale. He put down the scales and sat down to rest. There are already a dozen dragon scales on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni frowned, her blue light flashed, and when she was not too much, she used the blue sky to draw dozens of dragon scales from the dragon. . She said this: "Is this enough? This green dragon scale can't stop my blue sky, can the armor be good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Looking at the dragon scales all over the floor, Rogge’s spirit was swept up and he wrapped them up. He smiled and said: “Miss, can there be a few swords compared to the stars in the world? Only a few weapons can get this. Green dragon scales, why is this not a good thing? Well, these scales are enough to make two sets of armor. I want these dragon scales, and the rest of the green dragon's treasures are yours."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was surprised and asked: "Why do you give me the treasure of the Green Dragon? Do you want to do it yourself?" How did the fat man suddenly change his mind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled bitterly: "This dragon poison is very powerful, can I live without knowing tomorrow, what do you want to do? Besides, with these cumbersome How far can you escape? If you escape from the church, the money will be earned back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni "I changed my mind, or I want to kill you!" The blue sky is like a dream, and suddenly appears on the neck of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and looked at her, faintly said: "Due to poison, or die under your sword, not all the same. You want to kill Just kill, what does the mother-in-law do?" After that, he picked up the baggage of the dragon scales, and did not look at the stars and walked outside the dragon cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Androni cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't kill me, don't let me go, Miss Androne, what do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni bites her lower lip and sees Rogge’s heart swaying, almost ruining the image of the righteousness. "Where are you going to escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger indulged in the meeting to plot the elves in the Central Mountain Range. I am going to find the elves first to see if they can destroy the church. It is a pity that even if Kara Yang and Chrisma are injured, I am not their opponent. Otherwise, they can take them first and ask the light church what conspiracy there is. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s face was faint, and finally, she made up her mind and said coldly: "You promised me two things, what you did yesterday." Things are over. If you don't agree, I will kill you now! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles and talks about what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First The thing is that whenever and wherever you want, you must stand on the side of the Roscio family and work for the Roscio family. The second thing, if Froya is in trouble, you must help me to save her! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
