			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night before nothing "ah!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painful screaming resounded through the darkness . Then there was a shrill metal crash and a rubbing sound, accompanied by a soft woman's laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painful cry gradually subsided and was replaced by a heavy and difficult gasp. These wheezing sounds with a trembling sound that sounds like a broken bellows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft laughter rang again, this time without the interference of metal friction, the laughter seemed clearer. The laughter then became a cry, but even if it was a painful sigh, the voice also had the temptation of a sinister crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is high and empty, although the ground in the center of the main hall is erected with a dozen magical torches in a circle, but the jumping fire can not reach the top of the main hall. And the edge. Against the swaying fire, the scrolls on the tops and walls of the temple and the miracles of the gods of the heavens are flickering and faint. For a time, the gods and angels painted in it seem to be resurrected, staring at them. The center of the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a thick bloody atmosphere in the far-reaching hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the main hall, more than ten magic torches are circled, illuminating a steel platform in the center, and a naked body lying on the steel platform [*** The man, who passed through a steel nail on the hand and foot, was nailed to the steel platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel platform is still standing with a woman dressed up, her double sleeves are high and she is exposed, showing the snowy skin. Every movement of her looks so soft and elegant, no matter what she is doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art! This is real art!" The woman sighed with emotion and stared at the man on the steel platform for a long time. A small and delicate dagger was revealed, and the man’s chest was slowly drawn down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man's chest has long been cut, the wound appears a bit whitish, it seems that the blood has run out, only some transparent liquid is still slowly seeping out. His sternum was also cut, revealing that the following are still slightly creeping the internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heartbeat is still strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dagger is slowly and firmly piercing his heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart slammed and twitched, trying to resist the cutting of the dagger. The woman’s mouth was a strange smile. She held the dagger in both hands. Almost everyone leaned over the man and used all her strength to finally cut the heart into one by one. Two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man shuddered and gave a painful roar again. He clenched his fists and suddenly slammed the steel platform. A strong force rushed from the woman's foot, let her exclaim, fell to the sky, fell heavily on the ground. After such a violent action, the man's double-breasted muscles and steel nails rubbed, and the wound was a lot bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman immediately stood up and took care of some messy clothes and smiled and said: "I really can’t see it. In this case, you still have strength. Counterattack, it seems that I have to nail you a few more nails. Rogge, actually, you know that all the resistance is in vain, why bother to use that strength? Wait a minute, I am tired, today will Let go of you. You are a very intelligent person. Why are these stupid things going on and off these days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s nailed on the steel table Rogge, he turned his head hard, watching the woman close to the perfect face, snoring with all her strength. It’s just that he has been cut open at the moment, so he can only do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took a few large steel nails, through the magical fire, carefully distinguishing the engraved pattern on the steel nails, and finally she chose a coiled The steel nail of the long dragon, and a steel nail with seven angel wings, took out a small hammer that was circling the purple electro-optic light, and took a half-meter-long huge steel nail from Rogge's elbow. Nailed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her white arms look slender and tender, and the waving hammer is as delicate as a toy, but every weak and weak tapping will make a sound. The loud noise, in the harsh metal friction, the steel nails sank a few points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! A basin of milky white liquid with a strong sacred and life-like atmosphere was poured on Rogge. These fluids have a magical power that is almost magical. It is absorbed by Rogge's wounds at an incredible speed, and then the mist that is so thick that it can't be opened, sealing his wounds. The flesh of Rogge's wound began to creep and began to grow at a rate visible to the naked eye. The heart that was cut into two pieces was also connected with countless filaments, and then slowly pulled together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Rogge’s body is as good as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a perfect piece of art!" The woman's pair of crystals couldn't help but caress the fat body, her eyes bright and amazing, almost like a nightmare. The place is amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge recovered some anger and told the woman intermittently: "Catherine, don't bother, kill me directly...it will be simpler." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill you? Why kill you?" Catherine smiled softly, stroking Rogge's skin with her hand, saying: "After I killed you, It won't take long for you to resurrect with the soul of your life! You are the master of the soul, and I am only interested in your flesh. You see, although I don't know how to explore the secrets of your soul, I don't understand how to find out the position of the konjac from the connection of the soul, but you see, I can infer from the structure of your body that the existence of the konjac is also very powerful?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more Catherine said, the lower the voice, the more hoarse. She slowly fell on Rogge's naked body, looking at Rogge's eyes and slowly saying: "And your body is really a rare piece of art! Every time it is cut, it will be based on what it receives. Injury yourself to re-adjust the structure. Do you know that every time you cut your chest, the shuddering expectation can be crazy! You are a master of creation! But Rogge, you transform your body, Can you still be a person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed his eyes and ignored all her problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s breathing slowly rose, and the fragrant, blue-like breath slid softly on Rogge’s face, and the long, five-finger left hand touched Rogge. Lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you have a sacred konjac, how can you make it useful for you? Your soul will always be trapped in this body." In, endure endless suffering. Even if I kill you with the wrong hand, I have time to destroy your soul. So Ronald, you still give up all hope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's eyes flickered, a mouth, quickly biting Katherine's filigree fingers, his forehead blue veins emerged, almost all the strength of the whole body, bite down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine snorted, and his eyes were blurred, it seemed to be extremely enjoyable. Then she slowly pulled her left hand out of Rogge's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the bite is too hard, Rogge’s teeth have begun to ooze blood, but Catherine’s soft hand has only a few shallow teeth. mark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine laughed and said softly: "Have you seen it? My body has the protection of divine power, you can't hurt me completely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her right hand slowly wanders around Rogge's skin, gradually descending, and finally grasps the weapon that Rogge has always been proud of. Under the action of the slender five-finger, the instinct has made it stand tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes closed again, like a deep sleep. After being nailed to six steel nails with powerful magic on the hands and feet, he has completely lost control of the body. Whether it is emotion, pain or repairing the body, it is only his instinctive reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine suddenly picked up the gorgeous long skirt, she was completely naked under the skirt! She rolled over and sat on Rogge's body, her eyes had become blurred, and the hysterical screams spit out from her lips. At this moment, Catherine is completely different from the one that was held in the past, but has become a slave of desire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the empty hall, the snoring can not be hovered, and the festival is high, and finally, the scorpion has completely turned into a hoarse shout! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was shaking all over, his sweat on his forehead, his eyes could not be opened. Happy, crazy and repeated washing her nerves. Catherine couldn't help but groping on the steel platform and finally touched the dagger. So she screamed and finally climbed the peak of happiness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s face is still calm and his eyes are closed. It was just that a drop of sweat could not seep out from his forehead, and his eyes were still twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked up and shouted hysterically, clasping the dagger with both hands, one after another, heavily inserted in Rogge's chest! Every time she falls, her body will tremble involuntarily, and it seems that the tide of happiness has reached a new height! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the dagger falls, the skin is already broken, the sternum is also smashed, and even the organs that are known to belong to humans are cut to seventy-eight. Falling, and still being cut more finely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first implied with divine power, the steel nail is specially made, the steel platform is specially made for Rogge, and even the magic light is part of a big magical array. Here, every bit of pain that Rogge receives on his body will be magnified thousands of times and eventually passed on to his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this pain does not cause numbness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy waves finally faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine panted and sweated all over the body. Her eyes were full of burnout and joy, gently stirring the mixture of blood, flesh, broken bones and internal organs on the chest of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Rogge, you are not a good person, don't tell me what beliefs you have. You can do a lot of things like betrayal and surrender. Why didn't you surrender this time? You should know that the Allies have been finished, and now there is no power to stop the spread of the supreme god. Why do you still have to do something hopeless?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his eyes slightly, and the dull eyes only occasionally passed a piece of silver. His eyes crossed Catherine's face and fell into the endless void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the Allies have already lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, who has been struggling with endless pain, has always been embarrassed, and even has long lost time. However, he knew that after the First World War, the complete defeat of the Allies was only a matter of time. Even if he escapes, no matter how he struggles in the future, it will only delay the desperate moment by a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not surrender? Rogge also clearly remembers the words that he has always believed in: If I can't fight you, let me do it with you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the end of his gaze, in the darkness of nothingness, there is still a country of initial construction; in the face of the glory of the expansion of the heavenly gods, Still standing a dreamy, dreamlike figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the Lord God of Heaven is not tolerant, and that their inexhaustible glory does not leave her a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s face twitched, slowly looking at Catherine’s infinite face. He took a hard breath and then slowly opened his mouth, but his lips moved a little, and the sound was much weaker than the mosquitoes. Catherine couldn't hear what he was saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled slightly, lowered her head and placed her ear on Rogge's mouth, trying to capture the ethereal sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to you...Mom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Lille City is Immerse yourself in a joy. The miracle of the decisive battle has always been the overriding topic of street pubs. Now everyone believes that in the face of the glory of the Most High God, all the infidels who are tempted by the devil can only go on the road of destruction, even the seemingly powerful To the unstoppable army of the Asrofic Empire, the whole army was also wiped out in the final battle. Feuerbach, Alexander, Pompeii, and Rogge, the evil names that resounded throughout the continent, went along with this battle and turned into a symbol in the history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnants of the Astrofic Empire have now returned to the North, and the Emperor Dro has rumored that he has sent a secret envoy to try to find a decent enough to be preserved. Wang Quan’s surrender plan. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Astrafik Empire is still arrogant in the North, the Shenghui League marches northward and restores the belief of the Holy High in the Northland Wanli Prairie. A time problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, the hoof of the rumble, the hoof with the wind and thunder suddenly sounded in the city of Lille! On the road leading to the Grand Duke, several knights are rushing to the Grand Palace. If you can't see this scene, no one will believe that so many knights will bring out such hooves like the wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians on the streets have shunned, even some of the knights belonging to the blue enchantress, the human face spiders have also let the road open, not willing to come What is the dispute between people. They have already seen the knight's armor style and emblem, which is the mark of the Lions Legion. No one wants to provoke an opponent who is always looking for someone to fight. Although the Lions Legion was not the sinister army that used only for cannon fodder, but under the leadership of Kate, the brave and unparalleled fighting methods were mostly preserved. Perhaps because of this, in terms of the record on the battlefield, the Lions Legion will be the first of the legions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knights rushed to the main entrance of the Grand Palace before they stepped down, and the knight headed immediately strode to the house. At the moment of his step, several knights guarded at the gate of the Grand Duke had involuntarily stepped back a few steps. The people they have already recognized are the head of the Lions Legion, Kate, but under the pressure of his invisible murder, he is still horrified and unable to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate did not pay attention to these frightened guards, but strode to the Grand Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an unpredictable freight wagon quietly drove into the Grand Prosecutor’s House of Franco. Several of the big men in the car were wearing civilian costumes, but all of them were fierce and they had a bit of murder. They carefully lifted a large rectangular object from the carriage and moved to the side room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After things were put in place, a gloomy prosecutor, Franco, strode into the room and took a black cloth covering the object. Then I caught it on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the black cloth, it was a piece of ice, which sealed off an instant ice on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a long gun in the ice, and the gun standing on the opposite side is wearing two people with different postures. One is the Bauhinia butterfly of the whole body purple, and the other is the tall magic swordsman. The magic swordsman seems to be trying to place the Bauhinia butterfly wing under the body, and he has more than a dozen swords on his back. These swords were blocked by his heavy armor and his generous back, but his flesh and blood couldn't stop the gun that was so fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of style, this gun is a special weapon for the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco’s solemn face could not see a little expression, he went to the other side of the ice and looked at the expression of the moment before the death of the two . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is looking at her, and she is looking into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco reached out and gently stroked the piece of ice. For a long time, he said: "When you tell Kate, you said that I saw it. Now ...burn them up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Franco turned and walked out of the room, never looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the space in which the Great Light Temple is located is getting more and more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains here are still green and the water is still clear, and the waterfalls that flow down from the peaks are also magnificent. There are also butterflies flying in the flowers, flying birds in the sky, together constitute a beautiful and impeccable picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because it’s too beautiful, it’s perfect, so these scenes always have a feeling of looking at the picture. Painting is lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Hall of Light is still the same, and the whole body exudes a strong sacred glow. In the smog of the smog, there are dozens of angels floating in the air, floating in the soft wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every angel’s face can’t see a slight expression, even the posture is the same, only the occasional flapping of the back wings will show them Not a lifeless doll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of these angels is to guard the important figures in the Great Hall of Light. However, the brilliance revealed in the temple actually increased their ability by double, and even the low-order angels who could not have wings were able to have the temporary surname. From this point of view, I don’t know if the angels guarded the temple or the angels of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
