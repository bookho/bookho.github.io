			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two days of rest in Makur, Rogge once again marched into the mountains, and he was going to see how strong the Tickton tribes were. (Looking at the novel to the Internet www.23us.com) For Rogge, it is absolutely not allowed to have such a special case of disobeying under his own jurisdiction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the army entered the mountains, there was a shadow on the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog glanced at him, faintly said: "Leave him a life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow Raphael in the open of the Elf King's bow, shot with a lightning bolt. The figure flashed flexibly, but still couldn't escape the magic arrow of the Elf King's bow. In his screams, his right arm was pierced on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped down from the tree and disappeared on the other side of the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge saw that it was still a teenager, and could not help but reassess the fighting power of the Tickton tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-day, the army of Rogge has come to the village of the Tickton tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Frey has described the sturdiness of the village of Tickton in detail, Rogge couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tickton Village consists of more than a dozen huge circle buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circle building is made of megaliths, up to ten meters high. Only at the height of seven or eight meters from the ground, the windows are opened. These windows are also very small. . In each building, it seems that you can live with hundreds of people. More than a dozen circle buildings have become a large circle. Each building is about 20 meters apart. They are mutually responsive and mutually inclined. The defense is extremely strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that someone in this tribe can wear a hole in Frey, and the force is strong. It is no wonder that the country of the ferrets has not done the Tickton tribes. Before the country of the ferrets was dying, it was only 7,000 troops. If you want to crusade the Tiketon tribe, it seems that at least 3,000 people have been damaged. This sale is too uneconomical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tickton tribe has already been on alert, the tall windows on the upper floor are open, and the arrows are flashing behind each window. Cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s army listed the formation on a small platform five hundred meters away from the village. This place is too narrow and the army is not easy to expand. The front row only squeezed more than 100 heavy infantry. They put down the mask on the face and raised the thick tower shield. Although this distance has already surpassed the range of the average archer, on the same day, Frey was pierced by a hole at a distance of 400 meters, and 500 meters could not be said to be safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when the Elf King’s bow is in the hands of Raphael, the range can reach more than one kilometer. In the hands of the wind butterfly, the range will reach the horror of one thousand five. A hundred meters away. If it is in the hands of Hughes... Rogge couldn't help but shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the sly dragon's gun and went out. He wore a silver dragon, and he was not afraid of bow and arrow attacks, so he did not bless himself. But as soon as he appeared, he was still a magical flash of light. It turned out that Fu Luoya gave him a protective magic weapon such as defensive long-range attack and magic shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the vest-like silver dragon 铠 protection area is too small, Rogge does not want to put an arrow on the arm or on the thigh, so come to 400 meters Stop Malay and start yelling with the help of the sound reinforcement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The brave Tickton tribe people, I am the magician Rogge, also the snow The new owner of the country of 隼! I have heard about your bravery and martial arts more than once! But now, why can't I see it alone?! Brave tribes, you are all in the turtle shell, no one Do you dare to speak on behalf of your tribe? Your courage? Do you shoot my friend’s arrow skills?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, circle downstairs A small door opened, and an unusually burly big man was almost squeezed out of the small door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is two meters tall and looks like he is in his early fifties. His face is covered with traces of wind and frost. The thick beard is already white. He wore a white bearskin robes, and the large muscles of the knots were exposed in the cold wind. It seemed that he did not know what the cold was. He carried a heavy machete on his left and carried a huge horned bow that was one and a half meters long. The pale yellow bowstring is not made of any kind of creature's ribs. It has two fingers and the bow body shines with a faint luster. It seems to be very old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog snorted and said: "Don't think that I am as good as the Duke of Annas! You insulted my first tax official, and shot my Rickto governor, wanting to use a hundred beasts. The skin has finished this, and it’s a good idea to play too well? I don’t have the same waste as the Snowy Principality. They can’t help your fortress, I want to tear it down, it’s not difficult!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagul screamed and said: "Tickton tribes will never accept threats!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asked indifferently: "So, do you dare to accept the challenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur’s eyes flashed and he shouted: "What challenge!?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the Tickton tribe is self-proclaimed, then we both have five warriors and fight each other. If we win three games, Zagu Mr. Er, I asked the Tickton tribe to surrender to me. My army is in need of such brave warriors. As compensation, I will choose one in the future. The fat land will give you life, and you will not have to seek food and clothing in the mountains in the cold season."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagul sneered and asked: "That If you lose,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and said: "If we lose, we will recognize the independence of the Tickton tribe."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur Yang smiled for a while, said: "Roger, this bet, you are too cheap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"On the contrary, I ate a big loss, Mr. Zagul. You don’t have much bets in your hands to make this gamble with me. My army can completely level your village. But I like it very much. A needy brave Tickton warrior, although that doesn't mean I have to tolerate what the Tickton tribe did. Mr. Zagul! You tied my tax officer and shot my friend, these behaviors have insulted me first. I propose this gambling, nothing more than letting you know who is the real warrior! I want you to know, with your Wu Yong, There is no such qualification to insult me. I am treating you as a real warrior now, I hope I have made no mistakes this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gul was furious and his face rose red! He groaned for a long time before he said: "I agree! There is one more thing, I want to remind you that the strength of the Tickton tribe is not only the number of strong people, but also the quality of the soldiers!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "I understand, then after five games, we will have another 30 to thirty simulation battle. (Look at the novel to the net www.23us .com) If there are too many people, it is not good to have a death or injury. How do you look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur calmed down and said: "Very good. That's it! You will regret it for your decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute," Rogge called Zagur. "We have a devil." Teacher's. I think I should also remind you first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagul stunned for a moment, then meaningfully: "The bow and arrow at the Tickton Warriors and In front of throwing a spear, any magician is fragile!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to this, Frey's old face was red, and he was ashamed and annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the two sides distrust each other, these trials are scheduled to take place in the square outside the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tickton tribe is a warrior, but what makes Rogge unexpected is that there is a woman among these fighters! She is tall and tall, taller than Androni, and her long red hair is bundled into a huge ponytail that is nearly one meter long. She wore a helmet made of a huge beast skull, covering most of her face, with two huge scimitars hanging around her waist and five spears on her back. She is also completely unafraid of the cold, and her large skin on her shoulders, waist and thighs is exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has a strong understanding of these five battles. He scanned Zagur with his mental power and found that his vindictiveness is strong, but it is about fourteen. If the wind butterfly is not injured, these five games can easily win. But now, as long as you win three games, there is no wind butterfly, meaning little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the Tickton tribes began to walk out of the fortress and went to the square to watch the battle. Rogge and Charlie counted one by one, and finally estimated that there were nearly three hundred Tickton tribes living in a circle fortress. There are fifteen circle buildings in this village, which means that the Tickton tribe has at least 4,000 people. The adult men and women of this tribe seem to be excellent fighters, and the older children are also very combative. It seems that the soldiers of the Tickton tribe will have at least 800 to 1,000. Relying on such a sturdy defense system, it is no wonder that the Seongong Principality will be defeated several times in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagul seems to understand some of the tactics of the military. He has scheduled the order of the battle early, and he is in the center, playing the idea of ​​being able to attack and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlie, what do you think? How do we schedule the battle?" Rogge whispered to Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check the ideals don't want to, said: "Now is the scene of stability, there is no need to play strategy. From the strongest to the weakest, Andre is the first I played, then I, Princess Froya, the adult and the one you killed, I believe that the end of the trial of Princess Froya will end, you don’t need to play."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded and smiled. I have become more cautious and suspicious during this time, or Charlie is right. It is the best strategy to suppress opponents with absolute strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Androni and other people preparing to join the war stood in the square, Zagul’s face finally changed. He originally thought that the worst one in his game was the strongman of the 11th level. He had already won the victory, but he did not expect the other party to be completely different from the army of the former Principality of the Scorpion. The strength of the characters who played the game was so strong that he could not see clearly. . There is even a feminine girl who has fallen into the country! He knows that the more this seemingly bully, the more difficult it is to deal with. The warriors of the party have already appeared, and the girl even dared to challenge herself. It must not be a fuel-efficient lamp. What's more, the mysterious fifth warrior of the other party has only one shadow, and the body is vague and can't see clearly. What kind of terror ability is hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagul’s heart sank, and the comparison seemed to be fierce. But the blood of the proud Tickton warrior made him determined to fight to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s opponent is a warrior who makes a pure steel wolf. He is taller than Zagur and raises his strength. The muscles of the whole body are squirming, and the brilliance of the bronze is faint. There were several criss-cross scars on his face, and one animal bone crossed the bridge of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni whispered to ask about the strategy of Rogge’s battle. Rogge stunned and said: “Quickly, don’t kill, don’t kill. It’s all right.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagul listened to anger, and he snorted heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni floated out and walked straight to the opponent. The Tickton warrior saw such a handsome and thin swordsman, and the jack of the wolf was lifted high, but hesitated to know if it should be true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tate! Don't underestimate your opponent! Go out!" Zagul shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tikton Warrior’s earth-shattering arrogance, the mace with a gale to head down to Androni! There was a loud bang in the rumble, and the square was hit by a smashing shot, and the dust was flying all over the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tickton warrior stood still and could not move. Androni's toe was lightly placed on his mace, and the starry sky was in a false position on his rounded eyes. Although her long sword was not sheathed, everyone knows that with her strength, it is a small matter to send a long sword and break the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first test was like this. Zagur’s face was scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second game, Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The round table knight Charlie guns have been washed out, and they are practical and practical. His gun skills are unpretentious. He is known for his speed and accuracy. He has broken his wrist, knees, and throat. He has three guns like electric illusion. Others only think that there is a flower in front of him. His opponent has already thrown a giant sword and fell to the ground. Unswervingly staying at the tip of the gun at the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur’s face is completely green, and he walks into the field without a word, and stands steady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya chuckled and whispered in Rogge’s ear: "You are so willing to let me deal with this big man, so I can play girls." You wait! In the next three days, you don't want to touch me again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughs and says, "You won this game." Is it OK? His bow looks good, you have to be careful of his arrows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur was on the spot and didn't know what to say. For such a beautiful and beautiful girl, he has always been a hero, he really can't go. He instinctively despise any woman, disdain to play against a woman, let alone a little goblin that looks so weak? Zagur machete pointed to Rogge and said with anger: "You are despising me! Come and come, you are down, we are all leaders, let's compare and compare!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiled and said: "He? He is not as good as me! Since you are a hero, should you let me start first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Zagur screamed and said: "You will admit defeat to the end! My knife can't control it so well!" Without a word, he was surprised to see Fu Luoya with a stream of colorful , flying up the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this..." Zagur didn't know what to do. The Tickton tribe has fallen, and he has never seen a magician who can fly into the sky. But the hunter's intuition made him know that it was going to be bad when he saw the style of Froya! He took off the longbow in lightning, and he still hesitated in his heart. Did he really shoot such a tender girl? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comparison, won the disgrace, lost even more, Zagul could not help but be depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the hesitant husband, suddenly there is more than one sun in the sky, a large brilliance of brilliance, all the people looking up at the sky are in front of them A flower, I can't see anything in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart sighs that the 'Sun Beam' is used to destroy evil creatures. It is used here, and it’s so far away, against Tick. The warrior has almost no lethality. However, they did not have the ability to scan with their own mental power. There was such a strong ray in the sky. Where can I find Fuluya’s position? Next, naturally, it was slowly smashed by Froya's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one noticed that in the eyes of Zagul, a layer of lavender film fell, and Frau’s figure was clearly Appeared in his sight. The Tickton warriors hunt in the snowy mountains all the year round. The film in their eyes can filter out the glare reflected by the snow peaks and protect the eyes from harm. But where do these outsiders, Rogge and Fuya, know this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagul exhaled, and a powerful arrow shot at her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weight of the arrow used by Zagur is five feet long, the arrow has a spiral groove, and the tail feather is also a spiral of the same direction. The snoring of the monks. On that day, he was wearing a hole in Frey, and he was very contemptuous of Rogge’s men. But for Fu Luoya, he can't make a heavy hand, so this arrow is going to pass half a foot from her face, so that she can retreat and honestly admit defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur has great confidence in his own arrow skills, but he is a pure marksman. Now in all races, the marksman is a rare profession. Of course, except for the elves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the arrow was less than two meters from Froia, Froya was hit by an invisible fist and flew to the side. Zagur’s arrow finally turned into a meter away from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya was scared on the spot! A demon that is being prepared has also been interrupted. Fortunately, she took the advanced long-range attack defense for herself after she took off, which avoided the arrow of Zagul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hurriedly extended her left hand, and the three magic rings on the index finger, middle finger and ring finger lit up at the same time, lightning and ice rims fell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for these magic attacks to land, a flame column suddenly rises from the square, Zagord screams! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria was frightened and already a little hysterical. Her figure could not fly in the air, and the devil attacked the sky and fell on the square! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Zagur is strong and strong, but can not withstand this endless magic attack, dodging gradually slow, the body of the magic also more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge secretly feels that Froya’s magic strategy relies on a large number of magical equipment, using a large number of attacking monsters to suppress opponents, and a slightly weaker soldier does not fight back. may. Even with the strength of Zagul, a moment of soft heart, lost the first hand, he was immediately beaten without any help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Zagul obviously can’t support it, but Froja’s demon attack is getting more and more fierce and there are no signs of stop! The Tickton tribal warriors have begun to shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya’s brain was dizzy, and then he woke up, and immediately screamed badly, stopping the demon in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur was black, staggered, and unstable. He barely snorted: "Mom! A very good woman!" Just fell to the ground and fell into a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria fell on the side of Rogge, still shaking with trepidation. She has grown up from childhood to age and has never been so close to death. In the past, Master had protected her. After that, she had a powerful props full of strength. The status was honorable. People were also in the city. In addition to the incomprehensible Orphey Roque, who had ever taken her hand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur is a sharpshooter, a natural enem of the magician in close range, his arrow is intended to scare Fu Luoya, but the little goblin martial arts It was too general. I didn't see that the arrow would only pass by my face, and I thought I would pass through my throat. This time, she was really scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge patted Froya’s back gently, whispering: “Frightened? Ok, it’s okay. Take your healing Give me a bottle of medicine.... I know that you are not injured, to save the big man, I am still preparing to bury them, but I can't let him die."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stunned Zagul was finally awake after being filled with healing potions. This calmed down the Tikton people who were indignant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbed up hard and stared at Froya and said: "You actually lied to me! Fuck, oh! But you are really amazing. I lost nothing! Mom, there are still such powerful women in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur himself understands that the arrow just right is right She shot, can not break Fu Luoya's advanced long-range defense, unless he started with a powerful arrow skill 'sniper shot', even his most proud of 'wearing the cloud'. On the same day, Frey fell under the ‘through the cloud.’ However, Rogge did not have a killer when he won the first two games. How could he make such a heavy hand? As long as the first arrow of surprise is not able to shoot Fu Luoya, then he will never have a chance to fight back. Another option is to shoot Froya in a war, but he has promised to let Froya first shot, how can he say something? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, he did lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Zagur really is a hero who promises, losing is winning, winning is winning." Roghaha smiled and said: "This game we win Not very glorious, but Mr. Zagul, according to our previous agreement, since we have won, then the Tickton tribes will be classified into the Ayre Principality, and the Tickton warriors will also obey the call of the Principality. But Mr. Zagul can rest assured that I am extremely cherished for my life. My love for the heroic Tiketon warrior will not be under you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" The tall female warrior shouted: "The battle is not over yet! We have two more games!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, we have won three games in a row, dear ladies, this result has not been changed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female warrior reluctantly said: "I know! But proud The Tickton Warrior can't end the match with an unbeatable record! I asked to compare the remaining two games!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Charlie look at each other, Charlie whispers: "Be sure to blow them down! One can't let them win! Adults, continue to compare ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded, picking up the Dragon Slayer and stepping forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tickton female warrior scissor scabbard, huge scimitar danced a few knives between her fingers. Seeing that Rogge had already set up the rack, she gave a crisp drink and rushed over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge knows the difficulty of using this dragon-gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to use ‘弑神’, but this kind of scam is the most spiritual, and it’s not good. As for the straight stab, with his speed, strength and the horror power of the dragon-shooting gun, it will definitely be a lore. This Tikton female warrior is tougher and can’t afford to be a blow to the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the extremely large gun body of the Dragon Slayer, more than ten irregularly protruding spikes, it is a little bit, it will be difficult to heal. Horrible wounds. If you want to lift weights and smack the empty space around the female warrior, let her know and retreat, and with Rogge's two-handed gun skills, how can I get it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon-shooting gun suddenly flashed a silver ray, and lightning bolted to the ground in front of Roger! With a cry, a large piece of dust and sand hit the face of the female soldier in the fierce gale! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She apparently did not expect such an attack, shouted, the scimitar shines with brilliance, dances quickly, and the sand that hits in the future is blocked. Her left hand suddenly pulled out a spear from the back, Rogge threw it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying sandstone blocked the sight of the female warrior and also blocked Rogge’s sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a loud, powerful throwing spear in the middle of Rogge’s chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie and others stood up at once, and Zagul exclaimed, "Ohella! Don't take such a heavy hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy and powerful force on the spear throws Rogge out and falls heavily on the ground! He struggled twice on the ground before he climbed up. The pain in his chest still made his face white. He didn't know if there were ribs to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tiketon Warrior’s ability to throw a spear at a close distance is really horrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throwing spears fluttered in the air for a few laps before they landed on the ground. The robe of Rogge's chest broke a big hole, revealing the silver dragonfly that was inconspicuous and gray. Above the square, for a moment, there was no sound, and everyone looked at Rogge’s chest without confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have anything! Even if Rogge is pierced, people will not be so surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger anger, if you are not wearing a silver dragonfly, and you have changed some other armor, this spear has already broken into the chest. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s mouth smirked and said: “This respectable lady, since you want my life, then we will give life to one side of this battle. So good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s eyes were silvered, and one hand raised, and more than ten magic missiles shot around the female warrior, blocking her. Everything around the retreat. Subsequently, the dragon-shooting gun illuminates the dazzling silver awn, and stabbed Ma Yila with a strange whistling lightning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayila's face is completely white, she bites her teeth, another scimitar out of the sheath, crosses one, trying to block the dragon-gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scimitar and the dragon-throwing gun just touched each other, and they slammed into a broken iron! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaughtering of the Dragon Slayer has changed a little, and every spike has lit up a small group of silver! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge! Don't!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Slayer’s castration is abrupt At the five-inch chest of Majella. Although she did not hit her, the female soldier’s bronze breastplate had already cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni has hugged Rogge from the back, and only one of the players in the field has the ability to live in Rogola in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted with hatred, and did not look at the unsettled Majla, turning his head to Zagur: "Respected Mr. Zagul I don't want to compare the last game, so as to avoid any casualties and injuries. I don't have to hold the last group battle. Whether it is 30 or 300 people, the result is the same. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Rogge pointed to the Spartan Knights and the dark side of the moon, saying: "Mr. Zagur, this is my warrior." You should know that I didn't brag. Fighting with them, I didn't humiliate the warriors of Tickton. In the future, I will decide the size and richness of the land allocated to you according to the war of the Tiketon warriors. It’s fair, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zagur saw the original golden lion knights, and his face changed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a night of drinking with the Tickton tribe, Rogge and others returned to the military account. He has too many troops, so he is stationed in the open space outside the village. This is also the Tikton tribe people who Rogge is not worried about, and he is worried that his army will be attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
