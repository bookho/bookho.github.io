			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;盛世年华章章三神惑下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we have power, we use strength To overwhelm the enemy; when we have no power, we use skill to kill the enemy. When we have neither strength nor skill, what should we do?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground gnome jumped up and waved the short sword in his hand and shouted: "Then we use shameless shame... no! Use our wisdom, Use our great personality to defeat the opponent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: "This is right. Our only purpose is to successfully defeat the enemy, as long as this is achieved. Purpose, what kind of means is not important. However, the most effective means, one is to let your opponent despise you, the other is to let your opponent believe in you. When you become a gnome, it is easy for the enemy to despise you. When you need your opponent to believe in you, you will become a sacred dragon. You will find that in this plane, morality is a very useful weapon and a good camouflage. Morality is not just as simple as replacing your despicable shame with wisdom, although this is the first step. You will appreciate it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gregory seems to understand and nod. It touched the thick parchment in his arms and decided to give up all the above. On the parchment is the words that Hughes lists for Gregorian, those that are ethical or self-righteous, and the words that Gregory likes to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plane is indeed much more complicated than the world of death. The underground gnome pursues the path of power, which seems too tortuous and complicated. It has even exceeded the understanding of Gregory of wisdom, but it believes that Judah judges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory, born in the devil world, has a very simple understanding of power, and the one that survives is the most powerful. It has been observed by the elders of Hughes for a long time, no matter how sinister storms, the old fox can be stunned and safely spent. You must know that even if you have become the master of the wind and the god of the gods, I have repeatedly been seriously injured on the edge of death with her powerful strength! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Gregory is not yet understandable. But it still decided to keep in mind the teachings of Hughes, using the two weapons of ‘lower vision’ and ‘trust’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. A certain power is also necessary. The gnome of the earth smashed out the room of Xiusi in the night, and found a place where no one was going to practice swordsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is low and the blue moon is dim. Richelieu has fallen asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this quiet night, a carriage marked Straw’s emblem came out of Rogge. In the carriage, Serena is sitting alone. Her mouth was lightly smiling and her face was happy. There are also blushes on the cheeks that have not completely faded away, like a lotus flower with a clear dew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she was only half an hour with Rogge, she was completely satisfied. Serena knew that Rogge was very busy and could have half-hours of his wholeheartedness. Even though it was the only half an hour of the week, she was fully satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unspeakable joy is full of Serena’s chest, because Rogge is finally different to her. Tonight, she also bears a slap in the face of Straw. Be sure to let Rogge promise to seal the gap in the abyss. She had heard about this incident and knew that Rogge had not fully agreed, but she did not understand the seriousness of the matter. Until today, Straw has solemnly told her how serious the situation is, and the gap in the abyss has become more and more unstable, if there is any mistake. It is not only the problem of losing the power of the father alone, but also whether the life of hundreds of people in the entire family of Straw can continue under the anger of the Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Straw hinted at her, at all costs, and let Rogge take this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rumor, Rogge’s lust and addiction are also famous. Before Serena had been mentally prepared, she also made plans to lift the last line of defense. But she did not expect that Rogge would talk to her in the half hour of being alone, like the gentlest and gentleman. There was no intention to violate her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selena proposed to help Straw to close the abyss gap. Although Rogge showed a hesitant look, he finally agreed. Not only did not take the opportunity to propose additional conditions. He also enthusiastically asked Strau to hand over the seal magic to him so that he could prepare early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Serena left, Rogge immediately returned to his magic lab. Now his magic laboratory is extremely defensive, and does not say that the fat man has set up a lot of traps with the recent understanding of power and magic. There is not only a few people who live next to the magic lab. I can pass her off. What's more, there is still a Hughes living not far away? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central ground of the Magic Lab is engraved with Roger’s newly researched Elf. Each magic symbol is etched on a polished copper plate, and mercury is flowing in the engraved line connecting different magic symbols. The gentle and humid magical water mist rises and the temperature and humidity in the room feel very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the magic array, there is a little green light that slowly flies back and forth. Although its brightness is faint and dim, the magical fog that rises around it, like the beasts who meet the Beastmaster, instinctively gives way to the flight of the green mans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green mangling flies for a moment, and it will split a very tiny lightning bolt, hitting the magic energy around. The magical energy hit by lightning will instantly turn into green, and then infiltrate into the green awns along the electric light trail. The whole process looks like the green light is eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this process is repeated, it does not see that the green light becomes brighter. But the four white crystals that are placed in the corners of the magic array, which provide energy for the magic array operation, are rapidly becoming smaller. Obviously, the elf matrix is ​​very expensive at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sits in the corner of the lab and is flipping through the notes left by the gnome Nakbar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a little golden bell on the table at Rogge’s hand suddenly screamed, and a sound of the golden stone was heard. The bell body rises and the blue mist rises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lab door opened silently and Androni came in. As soon as she entered the door, her eyes were immediately attracted by the green mans in the center of the Elf. In the moment when the line of sight touched this green mantle, Androni only felt that the whole body was very comfortable, but I don’t know why, the depth of the soul actually rushed out of a raging feeling of fear, and instantly drowned her! that moment. Androni only felt that there was only endless green in her consciousness, she almost suffocated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's eyebrows are slightly raised. With a light drink, a spirit attack instantly hit Androni. Although the shock wave is weak, Libby's sharp needle, a puncture under the puncture brought her a severe pain! The pain was fleeting, but Androni’s gaze was able to get rid of that green man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a moment of change, but Androni is already cold and sweaty, and his face is pale as paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...what is this?" Androni was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a light curtain rises around the Elf. Covering the entire array, it naturally covers the green awn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog stood up and smiled: "This is the natural form of the goddess of nature. It is powerful in the natural goddess. Although this power is very weak, but also It's not that you can look directly at the naked eye. Although it has no power, the natural goddess' power will directly affect the soul. You have the martial arts of the sanctuary, but the spiritual power is not strong enough, naturally you can't see it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess of nature?" Androni is unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The goddess of nature and her followers have tossed me to death. I have to leave some benefits for me." Rogge said an understatement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at Rogge slyly and suddenly felt that the fat man in front of him became so strange. When did he start to control his power? This fat man with mediocrity is already unknowingly putting his hand into the kingdom of God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge came to Androni and reached out and shook in front of her eyes. Smiled and said: "Hey! Annie, what are you thinking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled reluctantly, watching this still a little shorter than her Fatty man, I don’t know what to say for a while: "Rogge, you seem to have changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "Where did I change? It’s not the same as before. In fact, it’s not as good as it used to be. After this injury, until now, my magic has only recovered to the level of about ten. How can I put this strength in your eyes?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you suddenly think of me?" Rogge looked at her and smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You won't change Froya to Miro?" Androni suddenly had no words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and said: "Is that kind of person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"maybe. "Androni's expression is extraordinarily serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was crying and laughing, but he shook his head helplessly. He suddenly found Androni turned his head and looked to the side, his eyes gradually rising a mist of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s heart was soft and asked: “What’s wrong, Anne?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm fine!” Androni rubbed her eyes hard and tried to hold back the tears, but her eyes were getting wet. She finally couldn’t conceal it, turned around in a whirlwind, and stopped Rogge from seeing her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, I...very tired." Androni’s voice was full of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, let me talk about anything, don't always worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You all know what you are doing, and Froya has found happiness. But I don't really know what I am doing." Androni said lowly: "I don't dare to go carefully." I want to think about my future. I am afraid that I am... desperate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed. He naturally knows that Androni wants O'Reilly, and knows that this idea is exactly a delusion. But how can this kind of thing be comforted? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man patted Androni’s back gently. She suddenly turned around and threw herself in Rogge's arms and burst into tears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hugged her quietly, waiting until she was slightly charged, and then laughed: "Annie, you know, the lives of all of us If the candle is in the storm, it may be extinguished at any time. So you want it. Just throw all your concerns and fight for it. Even if you don't get it in the end, it doesn't matter, at least you won't regret it in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni will chin on the shoulders of Rogge, sighing and sighing: "But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she is a goddess?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Dead fat, how do you know everything?" Androni has had too many surprises in the fat man, and now it is It’s not strange, it’s considered ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God is not invincible. On that day, when I opened the goddess of ice and snow, I suddenly felt that I had pushed down a wall in front of me. I saw a brand new The world. In fact, the world has always been there, never changed. It is blocked by the wall outside our line of sight. It is precisely our own. The goddess of ice and snow, how much is from the faith of believers? It’s ridiculous to say that we have created our own gods with our own beliefs. The gods are powerful because of their faith, and they are more faithful because they are strong. This is a very ridiculous cycle! Take the goddess O'Reilly. Say, you are desperate because you think that she is invincible, so you give up. Look. A wall is piled up by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge patted her back and continued: "In fact, you are desperate anyway. Why don't you try to challenge her? If you win, you will have the opportunity to stand in front of her, and your feelings will be There is a possibility of getting a return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s mouth finally showed a little smile, gently said: “Challenge her, how can I win?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not try to know? But I also plan to challenge her. Anne. In this case, we are competitors! If you want to come up with new sword skills, Come check me out, let's fight a fight, and know if your sword skills are useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni stood up straight and smiled : "Looking for you? Just now you have this magic. I am a little stronger, maybe you will cut you in half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat up and down Looking at her, the unsightly gaze made Androni's face flush. He said with awkward words: "Don't blame me for not reminding you, this time if you lose in my hands, I will not let you go as easily as I did last time. Anyway, I see that you now hate men's cleanliness. Changed a lot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge made a burst of laughter from the cracks and said, "Okay! After seven days, my magic will return to the 12th level. At that time, I am waiting for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are valuable. But unfortunately you have two enemies, any one is powerful enough to be far from what you can handle, and none of them will let you go. You What should I do?” Rogge stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows and looked at the very famous evening glow of Richelieu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesomely, Robersky immediately said: "This...the villain is stupid, and I am more pleased to ask the adults."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "It's actually very simple. You stand in the middle of two enemies. You can bind your hands! If the two enemies are smart, they will agree to divide you, anyway. If you die, the result will not be worse. But if they are not smart enough, or if they can’t come together for some reason, they will start to move each other for the sake of monopoly. The one that survives. It is very likely that it will not be your opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The adult is really unpredictable!" Robsky's flattering effort finally grew. This sentence is pious and can hardly hear any flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a little, not to say broken, just let Robsky retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casinaras and the goddess of nature, it is impossible to reach an agreement anyway. The fat man thought happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come out!" Rogge suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can you always find me, now you are seriously injured, and I am improving?" A crisp voice came from behind Rogge There is deep helplessness in the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood up and did not look back, just coldly said: "Nicone, I did not tell you, can you come alone?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rogge, a pretty figure slowly appeared, it was the night dancer, Nicole. She was somewhat guilty: "This time is... the elders sent us to the land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Rogge's voice is getting colder and colder. "You really think. Can I just enter and leave here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Nicole showing up as a man, he can’t resist himself. The anger, said: "Grand Rogge, you still owe us a dark night dancer of 550,000 gold coins, I hope..." He said half of his words, suddenly turned into a world of magical flames rushing to death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is devastated! The fireball appearing out of thin air is constantly magnifying in the pupil. He instinctively wants to dodge, but the command of the brain center is too late to reach the limbs. I have to wait and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned and moved with him. The fireball in front of the man disappeared out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty coldly said to him: "Roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male killer dare not Too many words, jumped out of the window, and was stunned by the window sill, and hurriedly left. Rogge stared at Nicole for a moment, and the brows became wrinkled and tight, and she couldn’t help herself. After a long time, the fat man said: "I took the task. But the debt of 550,000 gold coins should be written off! This is the last condition, so you can go back to life!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole cheered and shouted: "The deal! No need to return to life, the elders have confessed, this condition can be finalized immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stunned, and the flash of light in the brain flashed through a series of thoughts, and lost his voice: "It turns out! Be fooled!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole's face was awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and knew that Nicole would definitely not know anything. Waving her hand and letting her leave too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man owed a large sum of money to the night dancers because of a series of commissioned tasks. As Nicole said, nothing is worse than owing money to one of the biggest and mysterious killers in the North. And Rogge couldn't get the money at the same time, so the night dancers came to the door. Raeger also accepted it in order to complete the task to meet the debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
