			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern country at this time, it is already a scene of late spring and early summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille City is already very rough compared to other cities in the Rhine Union. However, compared with the northern cities, it is still very refined. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Principality is now in full swing. Whenever a knight with a strong armor walks through the streets, it will be cheered by the girls and the young people’s eager eyes. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; account of the war, the city of Lille bread, vegetables and meat prices have quietly risen doubled. Although the city of Lille has no alcohol, the price of spirits has soared several times. However, as the front-line news came one after another, the residents were immersed in the joy of victory, and the small difficulties encountered in life seemed to be insignificant at this time. Moreover, the Knights of the Principality are constantly recruiting trainee knights. Although this is basically the patent of the lower-level aristocratic children, many civilians have successfully become a trainee knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not a trainee, there is still a great chance to enter the infantry regiment or other minor legions. The treatment of the Principality of the Principality is very generous. The salary of an ordinary soldier of the main legion can already allow the wife and children to get enough food and clothing in the city of Lille, where the price soars, even if it is an ordinary soldier in the second and third squad, if it can be in the war. For several years, savings can also allow families to have a small enough land in the Principality. Of course, if it is unfortunately killed, the Principality’s generous pension will immediately bring a small piece of fertile land to this unfortunate family. The land of the Principality has long been divided, and the land that these new points give to the soldiers are all located within the Rhine Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a piece of your own land has become the biggest driving force for most plain warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every conquest is a process of re-division of land wealth and power. The land that the soldiers exchanged for their lives and blood only accounted for a small part of the land won by the Principality from the Rhine Union. There were large areas of fertile land, rich rivers and lakes, and countless mines waiting for the Principality. The minister of merit is divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Louis and his nephew have defended the last dignity of the Bourbon royal family in the fire, and several emperors and veterans have fled to the Dro Empire, now the whole Rhine The alliance has been incorporated into the territory of the Principality. But not only the senior generals of the Principality, but almost all the middle and lower ranks are waiting. What they are most looking forward to is not when the Grand Council will make meritorious deeds. The justice of the Bavarian Grand Duke and Mrs. Catherine is notorious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most anticipated of the 200,000 Principality is when the next war will begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of peace, the huge war machine of Catherine’s structure is also running wildly, and the high-quality sword armor has been exchanged in batches for the Principality of the Principality. Installed, there are constantly new and well-equipped corps to join the Principality battle sequence. Most of these new legions were expanded from the corps of the military during the Rhine War. Experienced veterans have been upgraded, and new rookies will get valuable advice from veterans, and high-quality armor swords and high-intensity training will give them a little more chance to save their lives on the first battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the entire South is waiting, and the horrible war monster of Bavaria will be its next target after the break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are eight countries bordering the Principality and the Rhine Union. Except for the allies of the four principalities, the other four countries are desperately expanding their arms and preparing for war. Obviously, even after the complete annexation of the Rhine League, the 200,000 army is also a heavy burden to the Bavarian Principality. It is only a matter of time before the new war. Thanks to the full support of the Bright Church, both the Austro-Hungarian and the Dero empire have taken a sit-in attitude towards the expansion of Bavaria, as long as the Principality does not burn the war to their country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to war, another topic that Lille City talks about is the newly born heir to the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine gave birth to a boy ten days ago. The next day, the Grand Duke of Bavaria enacted a decree to make the boy an heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven days later, the Pope personally presided over the baptism of the boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After giving birth to a child, just resting for ten days, Catherine sat down at her desk and began to consider the operation of the entire war machine of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lighter golden light on Dagong’s face became more and more obvious. The elliptical spar in the center of his forehead was a big circle, with a soft amber glow. The months of the battle not only did not add a little bit of color to the Dagong, but made him look younger. Now, at a glance, Dagong is in his early thirties. The face of Gu Qi Qing Qi is full of majesty and reveals a fascinating charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you rest for a few more days?" Looking at the high-rise documents in front of Catherine, Dagong couldn't help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine gracefully smiles quickly and recovers the body and extraordinary energy is the gift that the Supreme God gave me. Dear, you don't have to worry about me at all. We don't have much time now, we must seize every minute and every second to grasp every opportunity. Although the Rhine League has been conquered, your sword is still far from the sheath. Only when your scepter is inserted on the beach in the south is the time for us to take a break. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the conquest is concerned, Catherine’s face is radiant and beautiful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She gently took the hand of Dagong’s love, but now we don’t want to stop. The 200,000 soldiers are waiting, waiting for your sword to point them out, waiting for you to lead them. Conquer, to win wealth, glory, land and power woman. This is your greatest wealth, but also a sword hanging over your head. Even if we want to bring peace to the South, they will not agree For the glory of Bavaria to shine through the South, I am working harder, what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong nodded. Dear, remember to prioritize the refining elite army to David Rosello, who is on the border. First, give him 10,000 elite warriors, let his army reach the full 30,000 people. Recently, the Austro-Hungarian Empire is likely to make some small moves at the border to try our fighting power to pull down the claws they have stretched out, and they will let them smash the Principality. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine said: "Dear, your territory is big enough. When are you going to crown the throne?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke has been indulging for a long time and slowly said: "The throne is just a false title." As long as we have excellent generals, elite warriors, and sufficient money, it is not important to have a crown. The role of these virtual titles has been exaggerated in the hearts of many nobles. A duchy, at least it seems to be much weaker than a kingdom or an empire, although this is often not the case. Let our enemies underestimate that we have nothing bad. If we call the king, and we have to continue to expand, then we have to add a crown to ourselves. This will lead to unnecessary uneasiness in the Austro-Hungarian and German-Roman empire, and may even lead to interference. Dear, our eyes should be put a little longer, and these flashy things should not be worth mentioning. We can make concessions and maintain full courtesy in diplomatic etiquette and even some unimportant interests. It is vital that the two empires remain neutral at present, and it is no big deal to eat a small loss. But if they dare to touch our core interests, then they will take a few fingers and I will give them a few!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stares at the handsome man The demon face, softly said: "Dear, this is the hero in my heart! These days I turned over the history books, just to see the adage of a famous ancient star, I think it is very suitable as your lion heart knight The slogan of the regiment. Come take a look. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine opened a book on the table and pointed one of the words to the Grand Duke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Dagong’s gaze fell on the book and read softly: “I came, I saw it, I conquered it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong repeatedly reminiscent of these three words, the flame of the pale golden color does not rise. He is standing steadily, his face is full of arrogance, it is it. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong sat down beside Catherine, I am in the front line, you manage the Principality very well, very good, I have nothing to be discerning local. It’s just that the prosecutor you picked is not suitable. Although Sarmatt claims to be an iron fist, his ability is too limited. The position of the prosecutor is not to have a noble lineage and a good reputation. Dear, I have heard a lot of complaints about you during this time, complaining that you are too cold-blooded, complaining that you completely ignore the nobility. Tradition. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine still uses a slow and elegant tone: "So, dear, do you believe these complaints?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong smiles and laughs, you are too young, and experience and wisdom take time to accumulate. If I am in your position, I It will kill these people, and maybe there will be more kills. But it is not me who do you, do you understand? So the position of the prosecutor is very important, we need a smart person to wave this Butcher. He needs to be smart enough to find out who we want to kill. He must have enough courage and responsibility to dare to bring all anger and blame to himself. Best, he still has enough Wisdom, can make myself stay in this position for as long as possible. If we find such a person, then, what you have to do is just hint at him when you need it. The reputation of killing and cold-blooded It is entirely up to him to bear it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, this person is Franco. You have proposed to let him serve as a prosecutor. Then why did you change to Sarmat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catherine hesitated: "He is very intelligent and very loyal. The most important thing is that he sees the danger of this position. If you sit in the position of prosecutor, maybe it will not last long, in order to calm the anger of the nobles, we will I have to kill him. Dear, there are not many useful people in the Principality. It is not a pity to kill people like Sarmat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dagong sighed: "Dear, I know that he is a personal talent. O'Fee used to pay attention to Rogge, Kate and Franco, and personally brought them. Although this child is sentimental, the eyes of the selection are very Sharp. Kate successfully killed two great magisters and made great achievements. I am ready to let him lead the 5,000-strong forward army. Franco is thoughtful, ruthless, and clear, as long as the Principality One day the banner is not falling, his loyalty to us is nowhere As for the Rogge, it was even more difficult. In that year, he could eat the chasers of the Guangming Church on the way to escape. Now I heard that in the north, the situation has been messed up, and a small force has been established in a short period of time. These are talents, Philippine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine gently patted Dagong’s hand and said softly: "Dear, you lost an Orpheus. But our little Krassu grows up, it must be a hero!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong made some more, smiled and said: "That is of course! We want Use Kate and Franco well. They are not only personal, they will have a great influence when they face Rogge one day. Except through the eyes of the Most High God, tomorrow will never be unmeasurable. Who knows to what extent Rogge will be exhibited in the North? Dear, you can rest assured that Franco knows what to do to meet our requirements and to live in this position for a long time. In this position, he will be surrounded by enemies, except for attachment. For us, he has no way out as the price of his power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandfather turned cold and complained to Franco, he will be from next month The new prosecutor of the Principality. As for Sarmat, let him hang a dozen members of the Abbiati family in prison, and then you can find an excuse to kill him this month. By the way, he will calm down Abbiati. Marquis's anger. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war in the south has temporarily subsided, and the war in the North is nearing its end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie The horse was quite a gun, slowly marching along the wide central avenue of the Latvian kings. At the end of the boulevard, it was the royal palace of Latvia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangdu’s defenders Still stubbornly resisting, although they have been defeated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, small-scale battles are even on the side of Charlie. But the Cavaliers are surrounded by Charlie. It is the original gold lion knight. The Latvian city defense forces, with dozens of people, will be killed by the original Golden Lion Knights in a short period of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screaming, screaming, flames, smoke, to the former Latvian kings known for their prosperity, covered with a cloud of fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although winning In the grip, but Charlie’s mood is not happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he flew to Lat Under the city of Yawang, there were only 3,000 people in the city, even the Guards. Charlie immediately attacked the city, imaginary, and successfully attracted the main force and magician of the defending city to the other side, he concentrated Eight elves high-level magicians, full-strength bombardment of the city gate, in the blink of an eye will collapse the city gate without magician protection.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breaking into the king Charlie concentrated all the elite forces on the Latvian royal palace guarded by a thousand guards, and the other units began to disperse, searching for the city's remnants of the city defense forces and capturing the important targets selected in advance.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latvian Palace is defensively rigorous, but the ability of the Ecton Reloading Warrior with the support of the Elf Magician to conquer the fortified fortress is unparalleled. No matter which one of the eight Elf high-level magicians The magic is enough to play the role of a great magician in any country of the Holy Alliance. Charlie knows the horror of a magician with perfect protection. So he is not worried that he will not be able to attack the royal palace, or even worry about the wounds of the soldiers. It will be very big. After all, it is the most elite warrior in his hands to attack the kingdom. It is essentially different from the new army who have just left the rookie level.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie Worried about the days after the capture of the entire Kingdom of Latvia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of entering the kingdom, Charlie also annihilated several sporadic enemy forces. In the first few battles, the other recruits of Are also had chaos and even died on their own. Charlie had no choice but to adjust the elf shooter and the Tikton warrior before they completely annihilated the remnant army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the next few battles, these recruits will perform much better. But Charlie knows that this is not because the recruits' combat power is so fast, but because they have too many advantages, they can always get support from several elite troops, and Charlie is on command and dispatch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many of Charlie’s orders were not enforced in battle. A large number of recruits can be recruited, but excellent, courageous, and loyal middle and lower rank officers are not recruited. Charlie needs a large number of qualified junior and junior officers, but these people can only rely on long training or through multiple battles to develop. This is the fatal wound of the SAR’s tens of thousands of new troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to make these recruits become good warriors as soon as possible, Charlie still uses the recruits as much as possible. Before attacking Wang Du, in order to prevent the recruits from appearing chaotic again in the complicated street fighting, he ordered the death. When the accident was attacked, everyone was not allowed to retreat and must resist in the same place. The number of Aray troops is too great. If these recruits can support them for a while, the recruits will be surrounded by a few sneak attackers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the Latvian Royal Palace is already far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latvian king believes in the light, the royal and the good. After he was 30 years old, he also adopted a lot of orphans, and he chose to make martial arts magic. The best talents will be incorporated into the banned army when they grow up, and the rest will be appointed in the army. Although the number of these orphans is small, the loyalty to the Kingdom of Latvia is unshakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latvian Royal Palace has a large area and numerous buildings. The Guards faced the elite warriors of the Alle Principality who swarmed in, using every corner, every wall, and every cloister to carry out a desperate resistance. But this time Charlie will never let the Wright Fortress happen again. In this complex terrain, with the most elite heavy infantry and the protection of the Tiketon warriors, eight high-level elf magicians have fully swayed their amazing lethality. In particularly sinister locations, they often use strong magic to blow up the cover with the Guards. This captures the palace, although the progress is somewhat slow, but the elite soldiers have very little casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real obstacles came when they entered the king's palace in Latvia. Both Latvia and the Queen have retired to the Chamber of Secrets. There is only one narrow and long ramp leading to the Chamber of Secrets, barely able to accommodate two fully armed fighters. Dozens of the most elite and brave guards guarded this martyr with their own flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The martyrdom is too narrow, the tall and superhuman Tickton warriors can’t fight the battle, and the elf sorcerers are running out of magic. After a dead battle, even Zagur was seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the news report of the knight, Charlie immediately jumped up, and the figure that shone with the milky white glory disappeared in the direction of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Charlie holding a long sword and shining all over the body appeared in the martyrdom. In front of him, dozens of Guard soldiers who were bruised and bruised one after another, blocked Charlie’s way with his body. The most powerful of them is only a 13th-level fighter, but they can support it for so long. In addition to the geographical advantage, the determination to be generous to death is the main reason. While respecting the bravery of these fighters, Charlie on the battlefield is absolutely ruthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snorted and began to move forward slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flesh, arms, and even internal organs are splashing around him, and the whole ramp is already flushed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie finally stepped into the secret room, behind him, is a ruined body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completely dismembered the soldiers in front of him with unmatched vindictiveness and sword skills, and he was able to step into the Chamber of Secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber of Secrets is very large, with portraits of Latvian kings hanging on the walls. Precious antiques and jade are placed on rows of shelves. On the two thrones in the middle of the Chamber of Secrets, the kings and queens of Latvia are dressed up, and although they have already been poisoned, there are still some dignity before their death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that in the future in Latvia, I am afraid it will not be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a spring day, the bodies of Kings Iker and King Romon were transported to the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Ikerel’s death, an old king who could not afford to support could not support it for ten days. Or, he doesn't want to support for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the two deep purple ornate cypresses, Rogge’s heart quietly smacked. He then ordered that Ikerle be buried beside the valley lake, a beautiful place on the back of the mountain. On the same day, a lifelike statue of Ikerel was quietly placed in the Great Temple of the Elves, and there was already a statue beside her: Melan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don’t know how many statues will be placed in this empty hall after a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Rogge’s surprise was that the Elf Presbyterian had a quarrel about whether to bury Mr. Romon’s side next to Iker. One faction thinks that Romon is just a sinister and dirty person who smears Ikel, and must not let him stay with Iker. The other faction argued that Romon, who is willing to die for Ikerel, is true love for her, and all true love is pure and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the quarrel of the Presbyterian Church, Hughes has always been not advocating, and everything was decided by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the wide windows of the Presbyterian Church, Rogge quietly looked at the blue sky, and after a while he sighed that the life of the family was short, but could give up Life still needs extraordinary courage. Romon is really treating Eckel, but we don’t know what Ikler’s mind is... just bury them next to them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night Rogge did not meditate, nor did he exercise mental strength. He just stood quietly at the window, looking at the smooth mirrored lake and reflecting it. A round of meniscus in the lake.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight tonight is a bit of a bloody red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What are you thinking? Ai Luoote suddenly asked. This is the first time she spoke to Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge does not seem strange at all, calm Answered: "Recall all the things I did during this time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would you think about this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order not to make the same mistake again in the future." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think your heart is not enough in the past? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed: "Sometimes not enough, sometimes too embarrassing." The scale in this is really difficult to grasp. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Luoluote was silent for a while, and asked: "Do you laugh at me every day, are you very hard?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "Although it is not easy, but since I promised the death class, I will definitely do it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge..." Ai Luoluote’s voice was a bit strange.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Looking back, the clothes of the ice-faced body are slipping silently, and in the twinkling of an eye, Ai Luo Luo has been standing in front of him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the moonlight of the bloody color, Ai Luoluo's loose soft luster. Her whole body is not completely in the memory of Rogge, now it looks very thin, like a pigeon on the chest, although beautiful, but only It’s just a little uplifted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole person is made like ice, and the whole body is clean and tidy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; But what affects Rogge’s nerves is the dozens of faint scars that criss-cross her body!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s pupils can’t shrink, he sees Ai Luoluite's ice blue eyes, and finally just sighed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Luo Luote dressed casually, with her unique Bring any feelings Mixed with the sound of the ice wind whistling: "You don't have to make me laugh again in the future, as long as you are willing to take me with me, and promise me, never tell me a lie." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I ask you, have you regretted the things that happened in our village?" Ai Luoote looked at Rogge quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the clear eyes of the ice puppet, Rogge suddenly felt an invisible heavy pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regretted it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and calmly said: "I have never regretted what I have done. If I can return to the day, I will try to choose A better way to eliminate the chasing of the church. But if there is no better way, I will still do that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Luoluote seems to be low The low ground sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly smiled and was the Rogge in my heart. Ok, I have already laughed today, you don't have to worry about it. "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> Thinking about something, she suddenly said: "Don't you want to put a fairy into bed that day? Why did you suddenly stop? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and looked at it, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be I don't exist anymore, I really want to see it. Some people don't just like to be seen by others..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was taken aback, this Ai Lott knows a lot!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: I want to see it. When I am interested in these two days, I will call an elf. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," I don't know how, in the reflection of the moonlight tonight, Ai Luoluo's words are especially: "We still downstairs." There is a big beauty... Are you not ready to take such a good opportunity? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you a chance for Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is sad, don't you? Are you ready to take advantage of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed and said: "It turned out to be this thing! You don't have to worry about it, you have to collect the little goblin." It’s a rush, it’s anxious, let’s take it slowly. What's more, she has been tired for so long, let her take a break.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s time to comfort her, and now it will do more with less.” Ai Luoote insisted very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said, "Are you not jealous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and thought Stroking Ai Luo Luote's small face, but the ice was a small mouth, squirting a cold, and a piece of ice was condensed on Rogge's hand. Rogge smiled a bit and had to close his hand. A black flame flashed through his hand, and the ice disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a whole piece of ice now, there is no emotional presence at all. You are jealous? You think it is beautiful." Ai Luoote replied icyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a bit! I am going downstairs now, come with me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Luo Luot shook his head to find her, I did not follow. You can rest assured."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head helplessly, and he was helpless with this inexplicable little ice puppet. It was only her scar that made her feel a pain in her heart. In addition to the factors of the death class, Rogge is reluctant to violate the will of the girl who suffered because of his suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge’s figure disappearing at the door, the blue light in Ai Luolu’s eyes gradually disappeared and replaced with a whistling ice wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden groan in the dark room, and the figure of *** appeared like a ghost. She quietly looked at the doorway where Rog had left, and for a long time, she bowed her head and looked at her, looking at her quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still have a chance."*** faintly authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** No longer said anything, her hands were again caged in front of her chest, and her figure gradually blurred and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the city of the gods, it is a virgin forest with a thousand miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should have been a paradise for Warcraft and Venom, but one of the small forests is now lifeless. The slightly more spiritual Warcraft murderer has no trace at the moment. Only insect ants without wisdom will be here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bloody moon, this forest full of death will have a strong blue light flashing from time to time, then a roar, a tree or It is a few towering old trees that will fall down slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the frightened night bird flies over the sky, it will be hit by a blue electric mangray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of vacant lots in the forest. In one of the open spaces, Androni was sitting on the ground, staring blankly at the blue sky with soft blue light in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her length is very messy, and her elf guardian warrior suit is not broken. Androni frowned and bit his lower lip, thinking hard. Looking at her sly face, I don't know how long I have not slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really going to find the dead fat man?" Her face began to white again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze suddenly settled, and it was set on a pair of snow-white feet that were one foot off the ground and floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly stood up and shouted with joy and joy: "***!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black 眸 眸 *** remains as usual, as dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni wants to drop water in his eyes, bite his lower lip, just staring at the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the strength to stab me a sword." *** cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni obediently mentioned the blue sky, clear drink, the blue light is great, and the wind thunder is like a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The right hand is lightly lifted, and the grasp of the tip of the starry sky. Although she is volleyed, no matter how Androni urging her vindictiveness, she can't push her back. This time, the white hand of the white hand did not leave any trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***With a loose hand, Androni couldn’t help but step back a few steps. She was as charming as water. How are you getting better and better? It is. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Ignore her words completely, and Bingsheng’s right hand is again raised, pointing to Androni’s throat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small group of white flames on her fingertips. In terms of strength alone, it was slightly weaker than Androni’s full-fledged starry spirit.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looks dignified, she slashes her sword to the fingers of the ***, anyway, she knows how to cut the right hand of the ***.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Androni has been able to make the artifacts fall into the sky with a strong temperament, no matter what should not fall in the wind, at least the *** Blocking the first block. But somehow, the swordsman of the blue sky and the starry touch with the right hand of the *** every time, will feel a little lost at that moment, then it will be bounced to the side, it can not completely stop ** *The right hand is coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s heart is screaming, ***The power used at this moment is obviously not as good as himself!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye The right fingertip of *** is less than a foot away from her throat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni exclaimed, hurried back, but how is her degree? Can it compare with ***? In a moment, her throat is cold, and she has been gently smacked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ander Ronnie was stunned. She really didn't understand how *** was in her throat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but ***'s hand didn't stop or be Retracted, but the opportunity to explore Androni's clothes. And not only the right hand, but also the left hand also explored.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was soft and fair-eyed. She snorted and leaned softly on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the figure of *** suddenly disappeared, and then appeared a few meters away. Androni lost balance and fell heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you doing!” Androni stood up, her body still soft, she was shy and angry, could not help but snorted .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Still ignored her words, only faintly said: "Remember to help him later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni groaned and asked, "Who?" Rogge? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides who he can be?" "The bone dragon can't help it. He screamed out of the air and screamed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***In the eyes, the silver awns flashed, the bone dragon mourned, and was hard-boiled. The land was thrown back to the outside world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, he!" Androni chuckled. "Speaking, the last time he asked you, he was completely I was deceived by him! He may never have thought that I would lie too... What is the relationship between you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Slightly sighed in a small whisper, whispered: "In fact, let him not know... it doesn't matter." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about? "Androni didn't hear it clearly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the figure of *** has gradually blurred, and it has dissipated in a blink of an eye.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so fast after stealing!” Androni couldn’t help but groan. She remembered the feeling of just walking around the cold hands, and the heart jumped violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy, Andreoni, who is full of stunned and fascinating, calms down, and she carefully recollects every detail of the ***. Until then, looking at the weak, unstoppable finger to her throat...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumped up and shouted, just thinking: "The original The use and control of power is the key to entering the sanctuary! God, I am so stupid! Even the fat man said that my strength is enough, how do I always think about how to enhance vindictiveness? But... ...how did the dead fat man know? No matter how much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a trick, and the stars are flying again into her hands, Blu-ray is not The ground is shining in the forest...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a mountain in the outer world, the bone dragon is lying there, staring at a small pile of blue Spar. When the blue luster of the spar quickly recedes, the bone dragon will spray a small bit of dragon's breath, and the pile of stones will be coated with a blue glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon suddenly appeared a white tender hand. Before the bone dragon reacted, the little hand was directly inserted into the skull of the bone dragon, and the huge blue spar in the middle of his forehead was dug out. In front of this delicate little hand, the hard skull of the bone dragon is made like flour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is nervous and trembling, it waits for this moment, it is too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The blue spar in the hand suddenly lit up, and the blue color became thicker and thicker until it finally became as thick as it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The blue spar is again placed in the skull of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory screamed, the huge faucet rose high, and the hollow eyes began to ignite a light blue flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon flew into the sky and hovered in the air for a few weeks before diving down. A small group of heavy blue breath spouted like a cannonball, hitting A boulder with one meter square. The bone dragon then made up a claw, and the boulder exploded into a sky-filled star, and even a little stone powder did not stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is jumping up and down like a madman, flying around the whole mountain, and constantly turning a piece of boulder into blue crystal. Again, the blast is repeated, and the power of his breath is tested again and again. The result of each test will make the bone dragon excitedly scream a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
