			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the seventh day of the book, the last day (3)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind continues to blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a bit of a cold bone in this gentle wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked back at the picturesque scene of the mysterious world, took a deep breath of cool air, and then stepped on the long light temple. Long ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when Rogge embarked on a long step, there were hundreds of low-order angels descending from the sky and falling on both sides of the long-term. Every hundredth-order, there will be one To the angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the arrogant and hateful attitudes that have been shown in front of Rogge, these descending low-level angels are humble and awe at this moment. Whenever Rogge passes through a pair of angels, the two angels will kneel down and show the light wings behind them to show obedience to the superiors. The light wings of these descending angels are different, and the closer to the Great Light Temple, the light wings will be brighter. The ten angels standing at the gate of the Great Temple of Light have the same lightness behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the strength of the angels who are close to the Great Temple of Light, but the closer they are to the Great Temple of Light, the more power they gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of Light is not the faint sacred glow of the past, but a soft blue glow. The entire Great Temple of Light is trembled slightly, screaming, and if there is life, the condescending look down on Rogge, who is picking up the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is in the sky. The blue sky is faintly endlessly majestic and powerful. The whole sky seems to be the eye of God, watching everything that happens in the mortal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two giant gates of the Great Temple of Light are slowly opening in the roar. At the opening of the door, the Pope wears a high crown. Wearing a Chinese costume, holding a high-scepter, slowly walked out of the gate and stood on the edge of the steps. At this time, the Pope was euphemistically embarrassed, and his face was solemn and solemn, and the face of the wrinkles was faintly faintly shining at the moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope walked to the top of the long-term and slowly opened his eyes. In those moments of illusion, the eyes of countless planes are open and the eyes open. It seems that the body that is not burly is already higher than the bright temple of the bright! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hymns rang in the whole secret, and the sacred glory of the sacred glory was like a wave. Falling from the sky, or from the earth, the mountains, washing the dust of the world. There are countless petals falling from the air like rain, falling on Rogge and the long steps in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the colorful rains, there are many tiny angels who dance around Rogge. He sang his deeds and looked forward to being able to bathe him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stopped and looked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, Fengyue and Naifei Yingying followed, and the color was incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked forward again, and it seemed to be a never-ending long ladder, with humble angels, colorful flowers and rains, and glory and glory. There are even little angels dedicated to singing him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at his own hand again, holding the two white wings tightly in the hand. The wing belongs to the wise angel who once had a glorious infinity, Victoria. At this moment she was angry, jealous, confused and frightened. She struggles, but all struggles are in vain. Her wings are only one pair and she is in the hands of others. As long as Rogge's hand is a little tight, she will have no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact. Victoria is suffering from unspeakable suffering. In her body, there seems to be a tiny space storm that is raging. The power of the wise angel is endless, but every time a new power is born, it will be absorbed by a much stronger space storm. Not only that, but the Victorian entity is constantly breaking down and breaking down into the unconscious source of heaven. There are also countless space cracks that are circling in her body. Wherever, the solid material will be torn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria understands that all of this stems from the fact that her ascending power exceeds the limits of this plane, causing disorder and disintegration. However, before the power is raised to the limit that space can accommodate. She should be aware of it. But I don't know why. Victoria did not find the power limit of this plane. When her power breaks through the upper limit of the plane, another option is to temporarily break through the space barrier. Hide in the space storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heavens, the radiant brilliance of the wise angels is enough to suppress the angels of light who have not entered the sequence of angels, and the power is far from the wise angels. However, in the case of limited power on both sides, in a single battle, only one Wiener is comparable to Victoria. Moreover, her eyes were devastated, and she was unable to get in touch with the main god, Setanistoria, so many powerful skills could not be cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria’s mind was only awake for a moment, and she tried to gather strength, tried to burn herself, turned herself into the unconscious source of God, and returned to heaven. In spite of this, in a sense, the thirteenth intellectual angel of the heavens can be said to have died, but she is willing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the angel of wisdom will never allow her to be so insulted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wing that once carried the infinite glory, how can it be reduced to a humble, mundane, a wicked heresy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that her strength has just been raised, and Rogge has already noticed that his hand is tight, and a force like nothing is passed from Victoria’s wings. Into, wherever she went, all the energy changes in her body disappeared without a trace. As soon as the power of resistance disappeared, Victoria’s consciousness gradually blurred, and she snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to call, but she can’t call it. Looking out with your eyes, there is only a raging energy flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, if it wasn’t for Rogge to suppress the energy storm that raged in her body, Victoria had already burned a flame at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After suppressing Victoria’s resistance, Rog smiled and looked up and ushered in the top of the long-term, seemingly supporting the world. The pope's gaze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when the eyes meet, the world is silent and the wind stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the sacred glow, the flower rain and the little angel, there is an invisible huge lightning passing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rog smiled. Faced with such glory and so brilliant. There was a bitterness in his smile that could not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He steps and regains the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time in the mystery seems to flow very slowly, and it seems to be as fast as the river. In a twinkling of an eye, Rogge has already stepped through the 10,000-level long-term, standing in front of the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his eyes, the pope is still a huge darkness, and there is no light in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus is standing behind the pope. The face is a bit odd. He looked at the hundred angels who still looked down on the long-term, and looked at Fengyue and Nephi. And the wise angel in the hands of Rogge. When he saw that there was already a faint blue flame coming from Rogge, his face changed again, and finally he went to the ground with one knee and slammed it to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog did not notice the obedience of the blood angel, he just looked at the pope's eyes. In the inexpressible eyes, there are too many planes to destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long the Pope finally lifted the scepter. After a heavy meal, the whole mystery trembled. Corresponding to his movements, there are countless thunderstorms in the sky of the mystery, and the sacred songs of the sorghum and the clouds resound through every corner of the mystery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavens opened, and a beautiful and somewhat weak angel descended from the sky. There was a pair of blue wings behind her, and her hands were respectfully stretched out. There was a light ball in the palm of her hand that slowly swirled and looked carefully. This ball of light is made up of countless mysterious and complicated symbols. Every symbol represents a power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel slowly fell in front of Rogge, stretched out his hands and offered the ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stares at the ball of light and feels familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't remember how many nights awakened from that nightmare, every time he woke up. He is all vain and sweaty. When he first entered the dream, he had seen three tens of thousands of eyes in a very close distance. In the golden body made of unknown metal, the symbol that emerges is very similar to this ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a lot of times, knowing the truth is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 30 years, Rogge has gone from nothing to the present, and even has been able to participate in the battle between the heavenly gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall at this time, the front is like a cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly wants to go back to the past. Go back to the simple day of fighting and drinking women. After all, life at that time. There is chaos and passion, and there is still hope in humbleness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the Pope’s voice will return Rogra to reality. There is a strange rhythm in the voice of the old: "Rogge, the great destroyer of the Lord Desmasen and the Redeemer, Isaac have noticed your piety and feat, so Desmasson lowers the gods and gives you Share his glory of glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge heard the words, and his eyes fell on the ball of light in the hands of angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, all knowledge about this glory appears in his consciousness. What the angels are offering is indeed the power that stems from the Lord of destruction. But that is both strength and chain. The consequences of betraying the devotee’s faith are not what he swears in the name of the dead world kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally reached out. His hand is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope slowly said: "In the face of unbearable glory, remember to be humble. But when God puts glory before you, don't doubt if you are qualified." Get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked to the Great Temple of Light. Although he could not see it, he felt that in the temple, that had become a statue, she still stood quietly in the flame of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, his hand has reached the ball of light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, countless symbols representing power have fallen into his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the world is silent. It was a little blue, and the mountains were blue. In fact, everything in Roger’s eyes was blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a silence, Rogge finally noticed that I don’t know when Augustus was completely crouched on the ground, and his wings were open to the most respectful The gesture is facing yourself. It was only that Rogge’s thoughts seemed to be somewhat sluggish, and it took a while to respond to the humility of the blood angels. Rogge felt that there was something strange on his back. He moved slightly and brushed, and two huge blue wings had been stretched from the back to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently stroked two blue wings, and his heart was slightly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods have their own divisions, each from their own class. If you have a division, you have strength and power. If you have strength and power, you must Its kind. The gods cannot surpass their class, and if they pass, they will fall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilo's book, page 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the sixth page, it is still the phrase 'the gods are not omnipotent, and Hilo is omnipotent.' <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very end of Rogge’s consciousness, the book of Hilo shines with soft light and is slowly spinning. This time, unlike the past, after the content of the sixth page of the book of Hilo emerged, it did not re-emerge in the deepest part of the sea of ​​Rogge consciousness, but still floated on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book of Hilo, which records the secrets of the gods, is like an ordinary book at the moment, turned over on the sixth page, seems to be waiting Some people come to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly knows that as soon as he thinks, he can turn the sixth page over! What is recorded on the seventh page of the book of Hilo? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog remembers that when he handed him the book of Hilo, Hughes once said that this book is the source of all the disasters of the elves. However, he has read six pages. From the content point of view, Rogge really does not understand why this book will become a disaster of the elf. Moreover, historically, the Elf Empire has never had major disputes and civil wars. The elves with firm beliefs and no greed should not make things that harm the whole family in order to compete for this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of all this should be recorded on the seventh page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
