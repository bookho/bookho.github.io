			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth day of the book is destroyed on the fifth day (2)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield has long since been far away, at this moment Rogge is stepping out in a mysterious and beautiful world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different from the dark, cold country of Fengyue, this country is extremely vast, and there is no boundary at all, and the sky is blue, the wind is soft, the mountains are stacked, the rivers are horizontal and vertical. It looks endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this place, not only are the unknown plants that are welcoming the wind full of vitality, but even the earth and the stone are full of vitality. In this magical country, no matter what, it may be contaminated with the ubiquitous anger, and have its own life since then. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge all the way to see the beautiful scenery in the country, while walking forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a country, Rogge will have a new understanding every step of the way. The stone, the water, the tree and the flower are filled with endless secrets. Although he was addicted to indulging, he still firmly walked toward the distant mountains and the magnificent palace. Rogge knows that once he stops, he may stop to delve into the secrets of the goddess of nature. When will he be able to move again at that time, but he is not sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the natural goddess is far beyond the imagination of Rogge, but he is clear about the many basic rules that make up this country, so the distance between him and the palace is Far away, but in a twinkling of an eye, Rogge has crossed the plains of Dachuan and appeared at the main entrance of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple of the natural goddess is very different from the temple dedicated to her. It is crystal clear and transparent, scattering a faint green brilliance, and the whole hall is like a huge crystal. Dozens of crystal columns up to 100 meters stretched out into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly stepping through the hall of the natural goddess, looking at the crystal clear world around, Rogge felt a dizzy feeling. From the moment he stepped on the kingdom, Rogge knew that the goddess of nature was far beyond his original expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural goddess does not have the unimaginable power of the heavenly gods, and the lord of destruction does not have the power to tear the entire plane, but her Divine power is winning and creating. The country is so complex that Rogge, who thinks he has enough control over everything, can hardly solve his secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way. It is an ordinary stone, which is enough to make him think for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge originally thought. He has no need to think about everything, everything will show his face in front of his eyes, just as he saw the moment of the natural goddess guarded by the summoned, he knows how to reach the kingdom of the goddess of nature. At the moment of his mind, his feet have already stepped on the kingdom of the goddess of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge doesn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now with the brilliance of Desmasson, and can even provoke the power of the Lord of Destruction as the gods descend when necessary. Even if you lose to the goddess of nature, you can still deprive the goddess of nature with the power of the lord of destruction. For his actions this time, the Lord of Destruction has given him a new land ability, which is very short-lived, but enough to penetrate the guardian of the natural goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple of the goddess of nature, Rogge walked slowly, and as he followed, a pair of blue wings quietly unfolded. In this green world. Occasionally, there will be a shadow passing over his blue wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Rogge has traveled all over the natural goddess, and there is no trace of the natural goddess! He was somewhat puzzled, and for a moment he did not understand why the country was still there, and the goddess of nature had disappeared. Rogge discovered at this time that it seems that he always thought. The goddess of nature should of course stay in the temple of the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is speechless, just glanced at the entire hall with his eyes. His eyes could not change all kinds of colors, and his eyes not only penetrated the temple, but also spread throughout the country, and even the vast extent of the sea of ​​nothingness should be within his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the scenes that should appear in his eyes have never appeared. No matter how many obstacles his eyes penetrated, how far he looked at the corners, which appeared in Rogge's eyes, only the beautiful scene of the natural goddess kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this vast and boundless country, Rogge suddenly felt a trace of gloom. He has an faint idea, maybe not everything is in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thought and this, Rogge suddenly burst into a thunder. He suddenly swayed, almost fell to the ground, his face pale, and his body gradually blurred, it is difficult to maintain a stable form of existence in the nature of the goddess of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a glare flashed, Rogge returned to the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Druid has long been turned into fly ash, and on the original site of the town, there is a dead body in the ground. The small temple in the center of the city has also disappeared, but the bodies of the more than ten elders of Druid are not visible. They summoned the guardian guarding the natural goddess kingdom, but it is an easy task to summon these guards who only survive in the kingdom of God to the world. The cost of summoning is that more than a dozen high-level Druid elders burn their souls and **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angels in front of the guardian and destroyer of the natural goddess have disappeared, and only a few hundred churches are busy cleaning the battlefield. Next to the small town, the huge sea dragon was planted on the ground, and the blood stained the land dozens of meters around. The other sea dragon is carrying Nafi flying in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge appearing in the air, Nephi immediately drove the sea dragon to fly. Just not waiting for her to fly, Rogge shook, suddenly planted to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie was shocked and jumped away from the sea dragon's back, flying at a much faster speed than the sea dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of snowy hands suddenly reached out and caught Rogge’s falling body. The fat man snorted and barely opened his eyes. Appeared in front of his eyes. It is the familiar silver carp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge only feels exhausted, it seems that the strength of the whole body has been lost. But in that gentle embrace, he felt extremely relaxed, just thinking about sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We...go back to the church..." Rogge said reluctantly, he could no longer support it, his eyes closed, and he fell into the deepest sleep. Among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his consciousness. Only darkness. In a world where there is no light, time is no longer meaningful. Even the memory has become blurred. Fortunately, this darkness is very warm, which is that he can let go of all the warmth, with a little bit of fragrance in the warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He relaxed his mind and fell into a deep sleep again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door quietly opened, and Xiaofengyue floated into the room silently. As soon as she entered the door, she stood on the spot in an instant, with a small mouth. The fingertips are also shaking slightly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the crystal table in the middle of the room, Rogge lay on his back and was still asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is extremely quiet, except for the crystal table that radiates a faint glow, there is nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just in the silver plaque of Xiaofengyue, clearly and clearly, next to the crystal table, there is a woman who is unparalleled and graceful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue does not know how to describe this woman who is actually a shadow. She is beautiful, nothing, high on the top, cold as frost. It seems that only her existence is enough to make the sentient beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood on the lips of the little wind quickly fades, and the black hair is windless. She wants to retreat but wants to escape, but the body does not listen to her command at all, and she can't move at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has the power of the peak, but in front of this woman who is nothing. Even a little power can't be called, even the Death Scythe no longer listens to her call, and refuses to appear from the parallel space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be alarmed by the appearance of Fengyue. If the woman who has nothing to do turns slowly, the invisible eyes fall on Fengyue. In an instant, Fengyue only felt that the soul was trembled. Although it could not be seen, Fengyue had a feeling that the woman’s eyes were also silver! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind trembles even more. Because she already knows. This woman is the original local owner of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Xiaofengyue finally raised his head and met the woman’s gaze. It was discovered that the snowy woman did not know when it had disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon are dim, just a sigh. She knows that if the woman wants to get her body back, she may not even have a resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melancholy silver scorpion looked at him in his sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he protect her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first rays of the morning sun shine on the earth, a cry of babies is heard in the Grand Duchy of Lille City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected... Dear Mrs. Catherine, is...a boy, no, it’s a girl, not..." The maid is holding her newborn Baby, trembling. She lifted the baby away from her, could not help but tremble and look at her, as if at any time it was possible to drop the baby to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big bed, Catherine gasped weakly, her eyes closed slightly, and she had not recovered from the pain of childbirth. Several maids are cleaning her body with warm wipes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a windowless secret hall, only one passage leads to the outside, few people know. Although she had just given birth to a child, her body has returned to perfect lines under the magical light, and the sweaty skin has been wiped off as smooth as satin. Every time Catherine bathes, the maid who wipes her is often attracted to her full body, but this time, all the maids are not on her body. Their faces are pale, their eyes are quietly aiming at the newborn baby, and once they fall on him, they will quickly turn to one side, as if they look at it and they will encounter an unpredictable fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine rested for a while, breathing a little flat. She opened her eyes and said to the maid: "Show me the child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress holding the child hurriedly stepped forward and handed the baby In front of Catherine, and looking forward to Catherine picking up her own child, as if she was holding a piece of red iron in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is sure to look at the baby, a slight surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This newborn baby has cried after crying twice. Seeing Catherine looking at him, he also stared back unceremoniously, and then the corner of his mouth showed a sneer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold eyes, the arrogant sneer can never belong to a newborn baby, but this is not the most important. The delicate body of the baby is constantly twisting, and there are countless tiny monsters hidden under the white skin. And his face seems to be hidden behind a faint mist, and it can't help but change, and every moment there will be thousands of faces coming out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was amazed and disappeared, his face was full of joy, he took the baby and looked at every inch of his skin carefully. The more he smiled, the more he smiled. beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baby seems to be extremely impatient, struggling desperately, wanting to escape from Catherine's hands. But no matter how he struggles, he can't escape from Catherine. The baby is angry, but he seems to be afraid of something, always intentionally or unconsciously avoiding Catherine's gaze. But he couldn't vent his anger, suddenly staring at a maid and making a scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid trembled, then suddenly two thin blood lines spurted in her eyes, and the body swayed and fell to the ground, never moving again. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine smiled and said: "Small things, your temper is not small! Why, don't you like them? That's good, mom killed them all. Anyway, our secrets can't be made known to others, except of course, your damn father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Catherine waved a shot on the baby's ass The baby made another scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maids who listened to Catherine’s words and began to flee, shouted and screamed at the same time, and then provoked two blood lines in their eyes. Fall down here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stood up and put the baby on the bed, ignoring the fallen maids and putting on their clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
