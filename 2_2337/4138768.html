			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In less than a month, Marcus, the small town of the country of the Snowy Country, has become famous in the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcul is located on a small plain at the foot of the mountain, with two small rivers passing by. The small town is not big, only 10,000 people, most people in the city rely on logging, processing wood and hunting for a living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makull’s fame is not from the citizens, but from the brave Tickton tribes in the mountains. The Tickton tribes are the best hunters and fighters, and the rulers of the country of the Snowy Mountains cannot fully accept them. In desperation, they have to accept the symbolic surrender of a certain number of fierce beasts per year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rulers of the country of the Snowy Kingdom also tried to crusade, but the result of several crusades was a loss. This time, the country of the snowy country changed to a new ruler. The new tax official sent to the city of Makur was obviously not familiar with the local situation. When he was provoked by the original city owner of Marcus, he took 50 soldiers. The mountain received the 'Tickon tribe that never paid taxes to the Ayre Principality'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this mountain retreat was that the tax officials and their subordinates were all collected by the Tickton tribe, and they were bundled and sent back. In the tough Tickton tribe, this is already very polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freaking news was furious, and personally brought five hundred soldiers into the mountains to clear these unruly mobs, but the strength of the Tikton tribes was far out. His prediction, the result of being too lightly enemies, caused Frey not to be shot, and was seriously injured by a long-distance arrow. The soldiers under his command quickly rescued Frey and withdrew from the mountains. The Tickton tribes have not taken the shots since then, and they have not pursued the retreating Aley team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the city of Makur actually rebelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night after the defeat of the Marshall City, the original city owner of Marcus was surrounded by the city of Frei. As a result of the internal rape policy, the door of the lord's office was opened, and five hundred soldiers died in the melee. Fry forced to use the Druid's secret method in a critical situation and turned into a fiery four-meter dragon. This led to the rescue of the remnants. Out of the city of Makur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak, who was injured and injured, fled back to the government. Now his army has only 600 troops, and it is difficult to protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This victory made the small town of Marcus famous, the country of the snowy, and even some rebels of the Goshawk and the vultures to Makur Gathered together. The city of Makur was the second son of the Grand Duke of the Grand Duke, and claimed to restore the country of the snow captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcur’s rebellion shook the sacred alliance that had gradually accepted the facts. Members of the remaining 11 countries of the Holy Alliance discussed the demise of the Three Principality of the Highlands in the Parliament of the Holy Alliance. Two members of the Principality even proposed that the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands should be restored. As compensation for the Principality of Aray and the Kingdom of Layton, the Three Kingdoms will pay a large sum of money to the two countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the factors of King Romont and Elf Eckel, the Layton Kingdom is not willing to spit out the fat that has been swallowed. . It was Clark who came to Dresden again, urging Roger to settle the rebellion of Marcus, so as not to have a long night dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, before Clark’s trip, Marshal Alams sternly warned him and never wanted to provoke aunt. As for the agreement that Rogge promised him, whether it can be realized, everything goes with the flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge has been inactive for half a month. During this time, he is not alone in hiding every day to practice the trick, that is, sitting in meditation, and occasionally studying the mystery of the Elf magic array with Froya. When he is in a good mood, he will also take up some of her. Small and cheap. After the stagnation of the night, the little goblin was always from Rogge 'wife'. But she is also very busy these days. Rogge’s collection of green dragon longan has been exploited by her, and she studies it wildly every day, and Rogge does not bother her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Dragon is the inferior dragon in the Dragon, but it is also the only dragon that is good at acidity. Rogge once mentioned with Flora that he wanted a poison that was specially used for poison dragons, especially for silver dragons that were almost immune to poison. According to this little goblin, all the hopes of this poison are on this pair of green dragons. Fortunately, she has used the blood and bone marrow of Yinlong to refine a lot of drugs. She is very familiar with the body and resistance of Yinlong. It is hoped that this almost impossible poison can be formulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the voice of the Three Kingdoms resurrection in the Highlands is getting louder and louder in the Holy Assembly, and Clark has urged Rogge almost every few days. Sending troops, even said that they can mobilize 10,000 troops from the Kingdom of Leighton and belong to Rogge, so as to settle the chaos as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, Rogge meditated and saw Clark waiting outside his room and smiled and greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When are you ready to send troops to settle the rebellion of Marcus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That's tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Clark could hardly believe his ears. He thought he would return empty-handed this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These chaotic parties are usually hidden very deeply. I will give them a stage now, so that they all jump out and gather together, so that they can do it all! Save time and effort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clarke nodded the singer, really wise, do you need the Leighton Kingdom to help send troops? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: "No. I will bring 3,000 people in the past, I think enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Marcus’s current chaotic party is said to have 3,000 people too! They have a city to defend, you see, are you going to bring more people? Lest the soldiers be killed or injured too much? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows what Clark is worried about. He hopes that Rogge can help him in the battle for the position, and that the weakening of allies is not a good thing." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some of the rabble, not worth worrying about. This small town of Marcourt is in the face of my magic, just like no city defense. "The next day, Rogge left Clark in Dresden, with his newly trained Spartan Knights, two thousand Ale The national warrior and a thousand elf shooters went out of the flat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army marched all the way and arrived in Recto in a few days.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raketo's situation is actually very critical. It is almost impossible for Frey to rely on six hundred soldiers to station in this 80,000-strong city. Bluffing, he returned to the city on the second day and patrolled the city in a spirited manner. The story of his transformation into a dragon on the same day suddenly spread in Recto, which scared some deliberate bad thoughts.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marcus rebels have begun to attack Recto with the increasing number of people, but as the power increased, the rebels also began to lead within. The rebel leaders have been arguing for a few days, and they have delayed the time of the game.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger army in Recto After a short break, he entered Marcus the next day. Frey also followed the army. His injury was actually very heavy. When he attacked the Tickton tribe on that day, the stone-splitting arrow pierced his right chest. Or the other party is not willing to kill him, only to choose this position. Frey knows that the martial arts of the archery person is unusual and brilliant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freaked Frey immediately knows Difficult to retreat. But when Markur rebelled, he reluctantly cast a transformation, which made his injury even heavier.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now even with Fuluo Ya’s healing pill, according to Frey’s injury, must have at least half a month to display magic. When he needs to be rehabilitated, he will live with the army, for no reason, just because he is dreaming of blue. The swordsman is now at the side of Rogge!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was first surprised to see Frey, and the two laughed and went their separate ways.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, when Frey goodbye Androni, he has fully recovered his normal state. Exercising people, appearance and martial arts, knowledge and understanding are the best choices, there is no small charm between the gestures, and it is still very pleasing to him. But he tries to avoid Androni as much as possible. Occasionally talking a few words, but also in the elegance of the cold. Frey has been determined to put this thought forever in the deepest part of my heart, only in the dead of night, will occasionally come out to recollect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderney is even more so. She already understood Frey's special hobby, and every time she saw him, she felt uncomfortable. One morning, in the military camp, I met Frey. After greeting, she immediately appeared in the door of the military camp. Roger’s figure flashed. Her keen eyes also caught Rogge seemingly laughing at the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is now angry and angry, rushing into the Chinese military camp, lightning, mentioning Rogge, heavily on the column in the account! Under her shame, she was extremely hard, and this shocked the entire camp. Not waiting for Rogge to open, she immediately slammed a boxing on Rogge's abdomen and beat all his words back. Then she stared at Rogge and said in a word: "I know that you are deliberate. But if you dare to laugh again, I will never be polite again!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni's pretty face is very close to Rogge, and almost the tip of the nose must be touched together! Rogge suddenly smiled and kissed her little mouth! Androni screamed and flew back five meters away, and the little face was still pale. She suddenly felt that her feet were a little hot. When she looked down, a magical array didn't know when it appeared at her feet. The black flame sprang up a foot high, and the fire tongue suddenly shrank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was shocked, this is the dark world of the devil! Even if she is strong in martial arts, this magic will be in turmoil without precaution. It’s just that the flame is so small, it’s a bit strange. She looked up and saw that Rogge was covered with faint black mist. Androni immediately understood that the magical array that appeared quietly under his feet was Roger's masterpiece. It’s just that she never thought that Rogge would be able to lead the flames of Yan Zhuo. Obviously, the control of magic has become so unimaginable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Androni!" Somehow, Rogge’s cold voice made Androni feel uncomfortable for a while. "I don’t want to play whenever you want." I want to be embarrassed. Maybe the past is, but now it is no longer. How many big things do I have to do every day, where are the moods to laugh at you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dramatic change in Rogge’s attitude made Androni feel overwhelmed. She had never seen Rogge’s temper, and her face was white and ate. “Rogge didn’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Androni," Rogge's tone eased. "This is a military camp. I am the commander of the whole army." You are like this to me, let the soldiers see it, what do they think? What is my prestige? What do I use to convince them, obey me, and die for me? Here is the battlefield, not a place where you can play at will! You have experienced so many things, how have you not grown up? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni's face is whiter, she knows that Rogge is right, but still can't resist his own shame. If it is someone else She will only sneer away. But Rogge's position in her heart is very strange. After one time, the feeling is always different. But there is no difference, she can't say it. This time, I will meet again. It’s obviously a lot more powerful than before, and it made her feel unpredictable for the first time. Just like this unrelenting scolding, she didn’t even think about it, let her stay away from the ground. I got to the end!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A crisp resent suddenly came, but this time the object is Rogge: "Dead fat! You yell, I am not bullying Annie? For a moment, no matter who you are, you want to steal it again? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria said as she walked in. She gently slammed Androni and whispered comfortably: "Don't ignore the fat man, he It’s crazy again, let’s go! "Speaking, Androni, who has been bitten in the eye and has some redness, has left the account.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a day of marching, at night, the army has once again set aside Camp. Now only 30 kilometers away from Makur, tomorrow, when the day is bright, you can enter the rebel base camp.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the strongest of the round table knights Charlie is here, this military camp is well-regulated and dripping. As for the night attack, Rogge and Charlie are not worried. The elf archers with night vision ability are definitely a disaster for any night attack troops.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is quiet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military camp is in a state of silence inside and outside. Unlike the ordinary military camp, there is no point in the camp of Rogge’s army. *.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rare silence was torn by a series of screams as the moon passed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The army of Rogge is extremely strict. Although he heard the sound of killing and fighting, he did not hear the order. The soldiers just stayed at the self. The bed continued to rest. They all knew that the Elven Archers in the dark night would only sigh for the tragic fate of the thief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, riots and screams It didn't take long for the sound to disappear completely. The two hundred infantry were summoned to sort out the battlefield and clean up the body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised these soldiers was that they only had one Kung Fu, there are more than 400 bodies in the body, and each body has only inserted at least two sharp arrows. Under the faint torches, they can still see these bodies look black and blue. They follow the instructions of the officers. Thick cloth padding, pulling a sharp arrow out of the body, neatly placed, and then carefully tidying up the body of the body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield After cleaning up, the officer’s second order made the soldiers somewhat shocked: the heads of all the bodies were cut down!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hoof sounded again, and the elf cavalry who had captured the dislocated horse had returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the entire military camp has returned to peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just tranquility, just like the sea before the storm...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly slammed into the bed Jumping up, grabbed the Dragon Slayer and shouted: "Who is! Come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A low, hoarse but unforgettable The voice rang in the wide camp: "Sure enough, it seems that your strength has increased a lot during this time! What is even more rare is that you can always be alert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver mans in the eyes of Rogge illuminate the entire camp in an instant! He said coldly: "Death class! How can you be so polite this time? I have died in your hand, I don't want to die again for the second time, how can I stay alert?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low laughter sounded again, and although the account already had light, the Death Class still didn't know where it was hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death is just my nickname, just call me class. Also, don't think that you can have fear in your hand. His life and death. It’s not within my consideration.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog’s stunned, but then I smiled and didn’t get into the Northern League, but you’re killing first. I am once. The wrath of the sky has not yet reached the invincible level of the world? It’s not so easy to make an enemy like me. Even if you don't care about Frey's life and death, this time may not kill me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry anger has never despised you, so it will only be my last time to end your life. As for the reason for killing you, you will not Have you completely forgotten the Druid village in the Central Mountain Range?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not forgetting! Those Druids are killed by the people of the Light Church, are these? Also count on my head?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know best if you should remember it on your head! But I am coming today, not to pursue this "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled ironically: "There is nothing to do with death, but what can you do if you come to take my life? But can you do it? It’s hard to say!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the class appeared in the center of the camp. At first glance, he is just a normal middle-aged man, about forty years old, a dark brown leather armor, can not see any special places, there is no trace of magic blessing. The leather armor is well maintained, but it does not cover the traces left by it for a long time. Rogge even saw fine cracks on it. The sword that once took his life hangs casually behind his waist, and it looks like an ordinary fine sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t seen you for so long, you have been preparing for it. The Shadow Knight is a great one. It’s not bad. The young man is awesome! Two outside the camp The little girls are coming in too, the wind is cold outside, huh, huh. One is the apprentice of Procis, one is... your sultry look should be the disciple of Jero."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androgg and Froya looked surprised and walked into the camp. They are still in the most alert state, and they dare not relax. Although the reputation of the death class is not loud, but a killer entering the sanctuary, how to describe his horror can not be overemphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class is still standing there casually, and there is no sign of anger. But Rogge remembered the words that Hughes said: "It is a basic skill of a killer to raise the temper to the peak in an instant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue is more cautious. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ban smiles: "Rogge, your mind is very deep! Drag these two beautiful girls to be your bodyguards, their strength is not yet Weak. These are all right. Are you sure that I am not willing to offend a Juggernaut and a great Magister at the same time, will it be so fearless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was very strange. He brushed the old fox smile of Xius in his mind. He fixed his mind and replied: "In the eyes of the killer, there should be no difference between the strong and the weak. There are only two kinds of people in the eyes of the killer. And unprepared people. So I don't think that you will give up your task because of concerns about Prossis and Jero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
