			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale-faced Rogge finally returned to the city of the gods with the help of two elf guardian warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnificent temple of God has become a ruin, and the temple and the elders are also in ruins, but most of the buildings are still intact. The resurrected god was helped by the countless elves in fear, suspicion, and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge fell on the chair, and the exhaustion that could not be resisted almost made him sleepy. But he knows that when he is not sleeping, there are too many aftermath to deal with. Elves are a race that loves and hates, and a very innocent race. They will not give up their faith because you saved their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s mental strength is strong, but the magic is not good. The continuous cast of 'Flesh and Blood' has been overdrafting his magic. If it wasn't for his recollection of the erosion in the world of death, and the large amount of death that Heinrich left behind, the horrible magic of ‘blood flesh and blood’ was not released at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Heinrich, Rogge could not help but be proud. On the way to the world when his soul returned to the world, he did not know how, but was locked by the ninth knight Heinrich, one of the seven monarchs! The Necromancer was inseparable for his pursuit, although Rogge kept escaping in countless faces, and it was still chasing after him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge’s experience in entering and leaving the space is far beyond Heinrich, who has never been out of bounds. Like escaping into other planes, he rushed back to his own world and then rushed to other spaces. Halfway through, the soul body suddenly stopped, only condensed into a bait with spiritual power, breaking through the space and growing away. Heinrich didn't even think about it, just followed the bait and went to the sky. When it comes to understand, it has broken through the space and can no longer be accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sneer and scream in Rogge, the king of the dead world, the great ninth knight Heinrich, had to start it in countless Finding a journey back home in space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smirked smugly, one of the seven kings was missing, and it would be not so easy to seal it. What's more, *** in the battle of blackmail and hot, it is far more than yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guardian warriors were scared by Rogge’s laughter. Since Rogge has exhibited such a large-scale illusion and ‘flesh and blood,’ all the elves have been subconsciously away from Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly realized what he was doing and asked: "The dark side of the moon is transferred back to the city of the gods? Ajani, why didn't you see her? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guardian warriors are the dark side of Ajani's good friend's follow-up from Rogge. Their obedience to Rogge's orders has become instinct. Although Rogge casts the most evil necrotic magic, they still do not want to stay away from Rogge like other elf warriors. In fact, all the elf warriors of the 'dark side of the moon' have followed Rogge as an instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guardian warrior hesitated for a long time and finally said: "God makes the adults, and Ajani died in the day to save you..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" Rogge suddenly stood up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes an adult, don't worry. I thought Ajani was dead, but suddenly a soldier with full black armor appeared, she repelled Killer, and save Ajani with the blood on his wings. Adult, I have a strange feeling, she is not the person in our world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge nodded, and he knew it was *** as soon as he heard the description of the elf. It seems that when I die, I have a lot of things, and I have to ask carefully before I go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the Ajani?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults...the temple rituals Say, Ajani is resurrected with unclean blood. All, she is the spokesperson of the devil. Now... she is locked in the dungeon under the temple..." She said, her eyes were red. stand up. The five guardian warriors who followed Rogge together have always been the best friends, with deep feelings and no other than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wrath of the grid, the chair was smashed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zhao Xiong! I haven’t settled with her yet, she actually came to the head of Laozi’s head! You immediately went to the temple and said I said, immediately give me Ajani to come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge said to another guardian warrior: "You go to find someone, please come over to Elder Suss, I have something to discuss with him. I know that he is not hurt, but he must carry him up! Do this well. Then tell me about what happened during this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more you listen, the calmer you feel in Rogge's heart. Recently, every time he decides to put his opponent to death, he will become extremely calm. It seems that human feelings are no longer related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifices of the temples have completely suppressed the Presbyterian Church. Rogge’s death came and they accepted the 'dark side of the moon’. Command. Shortly afterwards, Zhao Yu called on all the elves to restore the ancient traditions of the Elves. She believes that only the elves that follow the tradition are the real elves. The dark side of the moon was smothered by Rogge because it was contaminated with too much blood in his hands, so he became the object of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to allow the existence of elf hunters around the Elf City. In the past, Rogge was there, forcing all the elves to stay in the city of the gods, and not to provoke adventurers who roam the mountains. Not only that, but the fat man also took out a lot of wealth accumulated by the elves in the past generations. The so-called 'undead tombs' have a number of adventurers filled with the collection of the elves of the millennium. This fact made the proud elves extremely uncomfortable, so when Zhao Wei ordered the elves to attack the adventurers, the city of the gods immediately cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few days, hundreds of adventurers have been sleeping in the Central Mountains forever. The combat power of the 'dark side of the moon' led by Rumsfeld in the mountains can be described as terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-energized wind butterfly is more beautiful and thrilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are also old people in the adventurers who secretly follow the elves' forces and finally the location of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These adventurers quietly left the Central Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark side of the moon on the blockade has already withdrawn the city of the gods, and the seriously wounded *** has no time to take care of the elves. With the connection of the soul, *** soon knew that Rogge's soul had come to his own world and locked his position. Since then, *** has begun to fully prepare for the war with the Lich Ella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the information about the Elf City was sold at an astonishing price of 10,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless adventurers flocking, and the three neighboring countries have joined forces to pressure Carlos, forcing him to agree to the 10,000-strong coalition of the three countries through Aray. In the territory, enter the Central Mountain Range to search for the elves. In order to appease the people in the country, at the request of Carlos, the army led by the Duke of Annas did not enter any city and quietly entered the Central Mountain Range. The Duke of Annas also recruited a large number of adventurers along the way, promising the benefits of equalizing the spoils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the heart of the Duke, still quite afraid of the horrible fighting power of the Great Sorcerer Roger's Elf Guard. He is prepared to let these adventurers act as cannon fodder to reduce the casualties of his elite troops. In this way, when this army entered the Central Mountain Range, it had become an army of 20,000 people because of the pool of adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves quickly realized that the big event was not good, and the 'dark side of the moon' launched a fierce guerrilla war with the army of Annas. In the mountains, the forces of Annas could not capture the ‘the dark side of the moon’ and fight against it. Although the dark side of the moon caused heavy casualties to the forces of Annas, he was also an old fox. Annas firmly believes in the ancient wisdom of "smashing the wolf's nest and not hitting the wolf" and unswervingly marching into the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in the forest outside the city of the gods, Rumsfeld had to start a decisive battle with Annas. In a fierce battle, the elves were outnumbered to the dark side of the crowd. In the case of more than half of the casualties, they had to retreat into the city of the gods and make the final struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas’s casualties have passed 4,000, but there are still nearly 20,000 warriors who have not injured their muscles. When facing the city of the gods, Annas was not anxious, although the greedy flame in his heart was hotter than anyone else! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He camped slowly, scouted, blocked, and asked Lapas and his disciples to prepare for the big magic of siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the city is beautiful like a dreamy city, but the defense is surprisingly thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the middle of Annas, and the adventurers are taking the lead and his heart. When the elves in the city were dragged down, the power of the defending city was consumed almost, and he planned to fight. After all, siege is to rely on the regular army. A discarding adventurer has no other value besides being cannon fodder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisive battle has finally begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lapas cast the Thunderbolt, everything changed and began to take control of Annas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dresden’s adventurers are more and more, Frey knows that the big thing is not good, he immediately brings the fat body’s 'corpse’, Quietly ran to the city of the gods. The fat man is dead, but at least he was a god-given singer before his death. Zhao Yu gave his body the respect he deserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Rogge suddenly thought that if Zhao Hao knew that he had a day of resurrection, would he simply give his own body a hand? The fire is burning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pondered for a moment and suddenly asked the elf guardian warrior nearby: "You also saw that I just cast the dead magic. Are you not afraid?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian warrior stunned for a moment, and did not know how to answer for a while, how could she not be afraid? But it seems that it is not appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the voice of Xiu Si’s old man came out of the door: “I’m so scared by the flesh and blood, even I am afraid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice, Hughes walked in with the help of a guardian warrior. Under the sign of Hughes, the two guardian warriors left the house and were ordered not to let anyone in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Xiusi, I am able to use 'Flesh,' which is obviously deep in relationship with the evil undead. Do you have no idea?" Rogge Asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Xiusi smiled using the necromantic magic, dark magic, or even you became a demon in front of me, I only know Without your resurrection, the city of the gods must be quite today. In fact, today I have further confirmed that the idea in my heart is the messenger of Hilo. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes asked again: "God makes adults, eyes before the elves The family has already encountered a real crisis. How do you think we should pass this barrier? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asks: "Elders of Xiusi, with your wisdom, to deal with such a situation will not be a way! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injured Xiusi still maintains an elegant manner and a perfect sitting posture. He seems to be in a hurry for the situation of the elves, slowly and casually: " To get rid of a vine growing on a big tree, it is useless to cut off its leaves. The best way is to cut off the roots it is tied to in the soil. Rogge, the current disaster in Elf City has its roots. In my opinion, now is the time to solve these root causes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge came to the interest and tried to test: "Elders of Shusi, you have never given me such explicit hints!" Does this not conflict with your beliefs? The temple’s practice of restoring tradition is well received by the elves! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes adults, the practice of the temple cannot be said to be wrong." The elves who have lost their glorious traditions can no longer be called elves. Tens of thousands of years ago, because of differences in beliefs and ideas, Lunacles, one of the great Elf kings, led an elf tribe to leave the sacred forest and find a new truth for the elves. In the long journey, the great Elf King did not resist the temptation of darkness, and invested in the embrace of the evil spirits, which eventually evolved into the dark elves of today's abyss. I think it is this point that the sacrifices of the temples are concerned about. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge relaxes, but his mental power is running dark.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elders of Xiusi, Part of the power I use is also derived from the darkness, even the power of the dead. Don't you be afraid that more than 10,000 elves will become another dark elf under my guidance? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
