			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Heaven in Chapter 7 under the Holy Baby<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Rogge is speechless Standing in front of Amoro. This huge, powerful, superior Mozu is now extremely desperate. The magical array that extracted its magic has long since stopped working. With the current state of weakness of the Amorro, a little bit of energy may have its life. Fortunately, there are enough energy stored in the ancient trees of the elves to support a period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amorro, what is going on?" asked Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorro fell to the ground and heard Rogge’s voice, just a huge ear moved and gestured to hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how Roger threatens to induce, it is not willing to say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has learned from the wizard wizard that the magical array that extracted the mental power of the Amorro incident suddenly went crazy and almost drained all of its vitality. It seems that now, in less than ten days and a half, it is impossible for Amaro, who has an amazing resilience, to recover. But the three Elf Masters who were there that night were stunned at the same time, only the one that knew what happened was Amorro. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the wizards, the Amorro seemed to have anticipated what it was, very flustered, and even asked them to increase the defense of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that only the Amorro knows the truth, but it has already made up its mind to say a word, so that Rogge can do nothing. The fat man is not the heart of the life of Amuro. He is just worried about the strong who can come anywhere in the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time back to the City of God, he had wanted to arrange everything. On the north empire, we will fight with the Druids. The battle with the city of the Clouds is different from the battle between the two countries. The battle between the two powerful players will determine the outcome of the war. At this point, Rogge is very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This confidence comes largely from the elder Druid who is still in Dresden. The elder has become Roger's excellent test of all kinds of torture and dark and undead magic. Of course he will not forget to torture all the Druid's spells in the memory of the elders. It is a pity that most of Druid's powerful magic needs to be faithful to the goddess of nature. Rogge has a magical talent and can't display it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other elders in the Presbyterian Church are at the same level as the elders, Rogge has the confidence to win. But there are many variables in the war. For example, the true strength of the wrath of the sky and the movement of the Yinlong family are enough to influence the direction of victory and defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time north, Rogge is not prepared to bring too many people. Only bring the dark side of the moon to the side. He left all the Tickton warriors in the Principality. Now that Du Lin is tracking the orcs' footprints in the mountains, Bauhinia is busy setting up training camps. But the fat man is not at ease with them. He is led by Zagur, and the fierce Tikton warrior is enough to suppress the small rebellion that the two brothers and sisters may bring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hurriedly looked at the various workshops and laboratories in the city and returned to the temple of God. An elf manager has already been waiting there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the recent situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger, under the help of Hilo In this month, the city of the gods has added four more lives. Three women and one man. In the last six months, the entire city of the gods has added twenty new elves, which is faster than other elves. I want to After a hundred years, the prosperity of the city of the gods can be expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silently, half a day said: "The elf girl born within two years of birth They are all gathered and sent to Dresden to receive the baptism of the Holy Light, which is good for the growing elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor should be. Rogge finally couldn't help but ask: "Between your elves and couples, um, I mean... Why are you so little and so slow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervisor Awkward. I didn't think that Rogge would ask this question, but he still replied: "The elf can have a descendant every ten years, which you already know. Moreover, the new elf needs the care of parents and tribes, and it takes thirty years. Independence. This is a big burden for both parents and tribes, so we are not willing to have too many offspring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly thought that looking at the history of the mainland, all the powerful races with long lives are basically facing the problem of low fertility. Whether it is a dragon with a strong individual strength or a giant, or an elf who has created a brilliant magical civilization. According to the records of the collection, it is in the glory days that the total number of people in the Elven Empire has never exceeded 10 million. On the contrary, dwarves, humans and even orcs with relatively short life spans and low individual abilities have established huge empire. Nowadays, the human beings with the worst individual ability have become the most powerful race on the mainland. The territory of the human empire occupies more than half of the known parts of the mainland. The dwarf empire is also everywhere, in the depths of the mountains where humans cannot reach. There are two underground cities of dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficient wisdom, large population, proper division of labor, and enough **. This is the key to a racial rise and glory. The elves are all good, that is, the number is small. It is too little. Although Roger is so careful, the number of elves is still getting less and less, even if you add the 200,000 elves left in the green sea, it does not help. Looking at the situation of the Terran, it is now within the territory of the Ayre Principality, with a population of nearly 10 million. Rogge suddenly realized that the elves want to return to the glorious era, and it is no longer possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that is the trouble of the elf, not his troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man crept to a familiar back and held her in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf who was attacked did not panic at all. She looked back and saw Rogge, immediately said: "Rogge, I think only you will do this. Boring things. Where do you want to do this time? I will go to you when I put down my hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogger pushed her to the wall , smiled and said: "Just here! Now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie finally got some panic, busy: "Not here, this is the corridor! Someone will watch Arrived!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Effie’s expression in a panic. In the heart of Rogge's unspeakable pleasure, taking advantage of her chances of holding clothes in her hands, he quickly untied Effie's clothes and occupied her body in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man gestured and smiled: "I am afraid of something! Even if someone comes, I will find it in advance. What's more, it doesn't matter if you look at it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..." Effie struggled, trying to escape from Rogge in vain. "Now someone is watching!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smiled: "Where is someone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge turned his head and saw the butterfly standing on the other side of the corridor. I was watching them quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly? You...when did you come to the land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is shallow A smile, said: "Just arrived, you continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the intimate gaze of the wind, Rogge suddenly felt uncomfortable, his hands loose Effie took the opportunity to escape. She sorted out the clothes and picked up the clothes that were scattered on the floor to be washed. Hurry to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just turned a corner, and Effie was stopped by the wind butterfly that suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly looked at Effie with God, and Effie looked up and down. The wind butterfly is now replaced with a brand new armor, and the armor is still tailored for her, decorated with rosettes with various magic effects. It's just the coloring of the armor, the blue or green ground tone that the elves love, but the black base and the red one. If the past wind butterfly is clear and delicate, she is now immersed in the innocence of the scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you? Why can you feel my presence?" Wind Butterfly asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Effie. The elf, the maid, is responsible for cleaning the temple. If there are other duties, it is what God asked the adults to ask." Time, go to bed with him. Do you still have questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of the wind butterfly slightly moved, a dark green dagger jumped into her hands. At this point she wore a pointed glove with a pointed finger on her right hand. The long, five-finger nails are stained with dark black ink. These pieces of nails are dyed with magical paint, and the effect is more than just beauty and decoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie did not panic, said: "Wind butterfly adult, you used to be a moonlight lily growing under the ancient tree of the elves, but now you have turned into a beautiful and dangerous blood-colored rose. The city of the gods is a peace. The garden, your bloody rose is very conspicuous wherever it appears. I just smelled the murderousness of your body and found your arrival."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The wind butterfly sighed, and it took a long time to sigh. Her right hand and five fingers gently dialed, and the dark green short sword was silently sheathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie met. Holding the clothing trails away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Wind Butterfly suddenly stopped Effie. "Rog... When you come back, you will come to you. Have you been like this before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie thought about it. Dao: "God has made the adults know me for a short time. From the time of his understanding, he spent a total of fifteen days in the city of the gods. I went to bed with him for seventeen times. That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly was straightforward and unprepared for Effie. He only felt a sigh of relief in his chest and didn’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why!" She looked at Effie's back and finally cried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I don't want anything, so he feels no pressure!" Effie's crisp voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Rogge left the city of the gods with the dark side of the full moon, which also took more than 20 elf girls. . As soon as you enter the territory of the Principality, you will see two or three couples on the avenue carrying new children to Dresden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before rushing to Dresden, Rogge issued an order to the entire Principality to claim the next candidate for the Eye of Wisdom . The selection is for a young and bright baby girl under one year old. The announcement also indicates the race is not limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the baby girl is selected by the goddess, it will be cultivated by the eyes of wisdom until it grows up. And the parents of the baby girl will not only get a lot of wealth, but if they have a military or public office, they will be promoted immediately. If you are a nobleman with a knighthood, you will also be given a new place of residence and a promotion on the title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a favorable condition immediately sensationalized the entire Ayre Principality. Almost all families with baby girls have carried their children to Dresden. They all heard that when they chose, the goddess would personally bless all the holy infants with the Holy Light. After receiving the blessing of the goddess, the girl’s life will be peaceful and smooth, rich and beautiful. In this case, there is a lot of benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are of course rumors that Rogge intends to send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he has just learned through the flames of the altar that the strong light of the selection of baby girls has greatly damaged these girls. A baby girl who can resist the burning of the Holy Light. It is the ideal to come to the object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked around the altar and repeatedly thought about how to make this lie seamlessly. Fortunately, the damage to the baby girl by the Holy Light is not fatal. Most symptoms may not be discovered until many years later. So long, it has exceeded the scope of Rogge's consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, more than 2,000 baby girls have been sent to the main hall of Dresden in the Eye of Wisdom, and there are still girls Sent. Even if he knew that the light would damage the baby girl, Rogge was not prepared to cancel the plan. A successful goddess, a goddess who has always been very fond of him, will have a decisive influence on the situation in the whole north. Coupled with the wind and moon challenge Silver Dragon King. He was prompted to temporarily postpone the Northbound plan. After all, these two pieces are the top priority. What the fat man is worried about now is whether, in the current situation, the Druids still have enough power to separate the manpower to make him messy. In the past several encounters, the Druids have suffered heavy losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, trying to mess up on the fat man’s land is not an easy task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering such a large number of baby girls, Rogby thought that he could ask for the joy of the goddess, but the only thing that came from the flame of the altar was unanswered. It’s hard to say that the fat man’s performance is too good. This made Rogge have some doubts. He launched the power of the country to concentrate on so many baby girls. Who else can do better than him in this matter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wella created a beautiful holy flame recliner for herself with a pure white sacred flame. At this moment, she leaned back and forth on the chair, and looked through the memory of God's origin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the question of the bone dragon. She lazily replied: "There will be a total of 3,100 female babies on the scheduled day of the gods. What is this! The Church of Light provided the alternative body for the ordinary angels, which time was not The perfect body that I first fell on, I don’t know how many people I chose, and I don’t know how long the church has been cultivated. Let him choose the body that comes to me, that’s really no way. Only three thousand choices, it is very lucky to find the desired. Hey, use it first, and later see a good body, may wish to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bone Dragon took a big shot. Then carefully and carefully: "Vina master. You are not in the body of Nicholas? Silver miracle body should be better than these ordinary baby girls?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Weina sighed and said: "The high dragon is not so good. I don't have much confidence in catching Nicholas. Even if I catch it, the process of destroying it will be very difficult. Oh, in the process, In the unlikely event that someone with a bad heart or something is done, isn’t it dangerous?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon’s heart is jumping, busy: “Vena Master, I am a piece of loyalty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faintly said: "The 'loyalty' of Gregory, your loyalty will become a model for future generations. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon just wanted to show his loyalty again, and he saw that the holy flame on Wella’s lounge chair was suddenly extinguished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a ripple in the world of painting, such as a distorted mirror, which eventually shattered under a huge pressure. The hurricane blew the bone dragon and turned it over several times. It was thrown to hundreds of meters away, and it stabilized the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue and Weina are once again in the air, but this time, there are some inexplicable things between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Moon, how do you recover quickly, where did you find the energy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer, but it seems that she is full of power and she seems to have no plans to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina smiled lightly and said, "You just don't say it, I will know it after a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue suddenly said: "Why don't you want this body? Don't you always want to grab control?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina chuckles: "Because I think your condition is not good enough! You want to use the body to exchange my protection for him. Although I like your body very much, protecting him is not only against my heart. This is a very troublesome thing in itself. Hey, I have endured it very hard on several occasions, and I have not killed him by mistake. You still want me to protect him? Fengyue, you are really just doing this in order to be implanted in the depths of the soul. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is faintly authentic: "Motion is not something I care about. Now that you have lost an opportunity, I have regained strength. Let's play again." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Moon, from the moment you return to the abandoned land and fall asleep. Whether you are willing or not You finally lost to me once. I didn't want your body, and didn't kill him. Should you compensate me some? So, in the future, only I have the right to act first. How do you see it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a glance, she did not expect that Weiner would make such a strange condition. past. There is a possibility of fighting between them at any time, and they are all focused on each other, so there is no difference in who starts first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, when Fengyue finally could not maintain the existence of another world and had to return to the world of death, she knew that she was seriously injured, that is, the state In good condition, it is impossible to prepare Verna opponents. So she chose to kill Yinlong Gudi in a way that was almost the same. And on the condition of himself, exchange Wella's future protection of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue certainly knows that Wella can completely ignore her request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she’s really tried her best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
