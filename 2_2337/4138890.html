			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the 16th chapter of the crime <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is snowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of lead color is as sullen as falling down, and the wind flies sharply against the goose-like snow flakes, and instantly pulls huge places between heaven and earth. White. As far as the eye can see, in addition to the dense snow, it is the ice beads that are as fine as rice. In the gap of the wind, you can also hear the squeaking of the snow layer, and the snow layer is constantly thickening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a bad weather, there are still people rushing. Dozens of riders braved the wind and snow, guarding three carriages, Mercedes-Benz on the avenue leading to the eastern part of the Empire. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several knights with thick blood-stained bandages that look like new injuries, but they are strong and full of fanaticism. Endure the pain and the cold and continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriages are surrounded by traces of burnt black and knives, and it seems to have experienced the baptism of war. The car is damaged everywhere, and the air leaks on all sides, so the car is not warmer than the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtains of the front of a carriage window were opened, an old face looked out and the curtains were lowered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sighed: "It’s snowing again, but this is the favorite weather for those guys who climb out of the ice! I think they will never let go. This opportunity. Miss Mora, do you feel their existence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Karlon, there are traces of ice and snow in the falling snow. They It should be not far from us." Mora was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora is sitting opposite the three magicians like Carmon, this time she did not wear the white robe that she used to wear, but she wore a black long skirt. The low-necked one-line cut reveals a rounded shoulder line, a V-shaped front chest, deep open to the two fingers under the cleavage, revealing a large half of the **, completely ignoring the severe blizzard blast. The robes are softly and softly draped over the waist of Mora, and on the outside of the right leg is a long and skirt opening, although the silver-purple double-color line covers the contents densely. But I can imagine the thrilling beauty if she walks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice muscles are like a blown skin. Lined with dark robes, the whole person of Mora glows more radiantly than the moon. She put her hands on her lap, sitting in a dignified manner, like a sect in the church facing the thousands of believers, only the lips on the ground touched the purple black rouge, and the blue eyes without feelings, making her holy There is a hint of murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mora is very beautiful. Although her clothes are extremely tempting, but the three elders who know her magical powers can only remember her majesty, and can't get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing that Mora sensed that the enemy was nearby, Calmon immediately opened the window and passed a command to a knight outside. The other two masters in the carriage took the magic scroll and the wand in an orderly manner, and then the two began to set up a magical array of defensive ice attribute magic attacks in the compartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two carriages in the back are also the magicians of the Eye of Wisdom. After a while, the three carriages illuminate the light blue magic light. The magic array representing the defensive ice attribute has been activated. The knights around the carriage also began to gather and listed the battle formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the command of the first knight, the hoof roared, the entire team suddenly began to accelerate, rushing forward against the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should be the third interception? Such a big snow..." Carmon muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goddess shows us to the east, we must go." Mora said indifferently: "Even if we waited for us in front of Rockefeller. Even if we Fight until there is only the last person, but also to the east. It is all down, we have to fall to the east."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon sighed: "Mo Miss La, I am not afraid to lose my life. But this time all the high-ranking mages and warriors in the church have been dispatched, and there is no decent resilience in the cathedral. If... if we all fall on the way of ice and snow, silver The Holy Religion once again took the opportunity to assault our cathedral, then the history of the Eye of Wisdom may end here, and no longer believers will worship the goddess, oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the only place where the eye of wisdom is dominant is that O'Reilly has shown miracles frequently, which is completely different from the silent goddess of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora smiled a little and said: "The believers gather because of the goddess and dedicate themselves to their faith. Before the goddess of the goddess, devout believers can sacrifice everything. The Eye of Wisdom is destroyed in the holy war. As long as the goddess persists, then she will have new believers, and the believers will re-establish a new church. Why should we worry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mora suddenly sensed something and looked a whole face. She took out a magic scroll that was sealed with a heavy golden pattern, gently stroked it and sighed: "Rockefeller is in front. I will try to restrain him as much as possible. You have to rush out of the blockade and go to Schild. Looking for Rogge in the city... Revenge for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon breathed at the magic scroll in the hands of Mora, and spit out for a long time, saying: " This is... the field of forbidden magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banned magic field is a seventh-order magic that is not included in the formal magic system. The way to ban magic is to drain all the magical energy in the area of ​​action, so naturally no magic will be displayed, or half of the magic will be interrupted. However, the banned magic field is a very imperfect magic. It does not solve the problem of where the extracted magic goes. It can only be stored in the caster's body. Therefore, any one of the casters, even if it is a big magician, the result of the long time of continuous display of the banned magic field is that it is burned and killed by excessive magic in the body. However, if you want to stop the banned magic field that has already been cast, you need a high degree of magical control. This is not something that an ordinary magician can do. It is just a half of a great magician who only grasps it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this magic in the field of forbidden magic has always been synonymous with death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred religion of the silver has always been known as the Ice and Snow Master. Their level of escort guard is not much better than the warrior's eye. Interrupted the magic of the ice and snow mage, the rest of the eyes of wisdom have the opportunity to rush out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow is getting bigger and bigger, the gale is whistling, and the snowflakes are rushing toward the team of the eye of wisdom. The knights have dismounted, with a gust of wind, struggling step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young knight in the forefront suddenly made a long scream! Just a large group of snow fluttering on his breastplate, he suddenly felt a cold heart. When I looked down, I found that there was a thin and long ice cone in the snow. Almost all the ice cones fell into his chest. Just leave a short cut outside the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers led him to the back of the team and looked at his injury, his face immediately. He put the young warrior on the ground and shouted: "All, lift the shield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the knights held the steel shield to protect the head and chest. Roaring and moving on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is more gloomy, and the ice cones in the snow are getting more and more. The strength is getting more and more. In the local loud noise of the jingle, a cone of ice beats the shields of the knights, and from time to time there will be a knight who is hit by a cone of ice, and slowly falls to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice cones that have been flying all over the world have begun to be attached with ice magic, so once they enter the body, the blood of the injured knights will condense in a short time. Even if the skin is pierced by the ice cone, a large piece of skin around the wound will be necrotic in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three carriages are still moving forward, although the knights who guard them are falling one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road ahead. It is already possible to glimpse a row of snow-capped guards with a large axe, a heavy armor and a white cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go ahead! Try to consume Rockefeller's magic." Mora in the carriage commanded. Her beautiful eyes lifted slightly, and her eyes seemed to pass through the carriage and the snow, looking at the end of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the road, the unusually tall Snow Palace guard leader is in awe of Rockefeller’s side: "You have to sit down in person, this time." **The witch must not escape. It is a great honor to be able to see your magical snowstorm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller is wrapped in a white robe . When he heard the leader of the guard, his face changed and he scolded: "Whenever you face the gods, you can't care! Let all your cavalry get ready to go, hear my orders and immediately charge, never stay. Give them a chance! This jihad is a victory or defeat, it is here. If you dare to have a slight scorn, then I will immediately change someone to command the Snow Palace Guard!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller’s attention to the team that was struggling before the wind and snow, slowly said: “You can’t understand my decision. It’s not surprising. Because the goddess of ice shows the gods, let me try to intercept the eyes of wisdom. The team that walks through. The goddess of the goddess has made it clear that no matter what the price is, the people of the eye of wisdom will never retreat or detour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guard leader shook his voice: "What do you say? Did the goddess of ice finally drop the gods? This... is this true?" He really couldn’t suppress the excitement in his heart, and he did not notice that the words of the talents had seriously offended the snow. The Great Magister Rockefeller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rockefeller has no time to care about this, he looked at the distant team, his face is getting more and more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roof of the front of a carriage suddenly exploded, and a group of dark black mist floated out of the compartment and slowly rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the black fog, a jade hand that cannot describe its beauty appears. This slender hand holds the black fog and is slowly rising. Gradually revealing the white arm and the upper arm, then Mora is like a holy face shrouded in a layer of halo. Her blond hair was like the first dawn of dawn, illuminating the gloomy sky and the bloody battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the snow has disappeared, the sound has disappeared, and even the distant mountains, forests and snow-covered roads have disappeared! In the eyes of the Snow Palace Guard and Ice and Snow Mage. At this moment, there is only a Mora like a goddess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a glimpse of the sky in the Mora, and the long, strong legs are looming in the skirt. The view is wonderful. This is the temptation of the red luo naked, pointing to the most primitive instinct of the human heart, that is, the determined snow and ice masters are not arrogant, the heart is like a drumstick, those who are weaker and even physically have changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller sighed, and he picked up a short spell, a cold wind instantly. He circled around hundreds of silver saints and warriors. Sudden chills pulled their consciousness back, and the eyes of a pair of intoxicated eyes were full of doubts at this moment, and they did not know what happened just at that moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the natural charm of Mora! Passing my orders, except for the Snow and Ice Master, everyone else will look flat, not watching Mora! , Li Yi!" Rockefeller Shen Shen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escort leader immediately ordered. He secretly had a cold sweat, because he also had a natural charm for a while. It was not found that Mora had risen into the air unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's pair of blue eyes will surely look at the silver sacred people in front, the left hand is high, the virtual care has become a few meters long. Rolling black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be endless suction in the black fog, the snow, ice cones and cold winds within a few tens of meters are thrown into the black fog, then in the fog Miraculously disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, around the Eyes of Wisdom team. The snow that has been firmly suppressed by the knights has completely disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when the snow disappeared, the three carriages began to drive! More than 30 knights remnantly thundered and launched a charge on foot! Countless attacking magic with a variety of gorgeous trails over the top of the assault knight, fell into the ranks of the silver saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Mora in the sky, Rockefeller’s eyes twitched slightly, and the corners of his eyes twitched involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I actually used the banned field? Mora, it seems that I have been underestimating you. However, blood, courage and sacrifice are not guarantees of success. "The big snow magician is thinking about it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All Snow and Ice Mage! Fully add **Wind and Snow Magic!" Rockefeller whispered the final order! At this moment, Mora is like a leader who is greedily swallowing all the magic around him. And Rockefeller to do the land is to put too much food for her. Until the explosion of her stomach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky has become more gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's face suddenly turned white. She bit her lip and supported it. I don’t know what blood is flowing from the purple-black lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnant of Rockefeller's eyes suddenly swept into a strange snowflake. This falling snow turned out to be blue. Look carefully and look at the very beautiful blue middle. It seems that a little starlight is flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller’s pupils contracted immediately, and he turned back in a whirlwind, and he was shocked to see that the snow underneath had turned into a blue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blue snow and little bit of flying stars, Androni, who has the grace of the city, is on the snow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her maroon long hair flutters in the wind, the blue sky and the stars slanted to the ground, and the shining stars guarded her body to add a mysterious atmosphere to her beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s mouth sneered with a sneer, she said coldly: "Master Rockefeller, you are really cautious! Until now I have waited for this opportunity. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller's face is extremely ugly, his eyes only on Androni's slow-moving boots! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance! The distance is the devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Master will be instilled in this view from the first day of learning magic. For the Master, the distance is the first major event of life and death. Master's life must deal with distance, and there is no shortage of scope or effective distance in any description of magic. Even the Master has attributed all the art of magical combat to distance control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlling distance is not only an art for the Master, but also for those who are enemies of the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni doesn’t know how long it has been lurking. She waited until Rockefeller's attention was concentrated on Mora, and ordered all the ice and snow mage to suddenly add to the snow, and finally succeeded in getting closer to Rockefeller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller is not good at one-on-one battles, but he has been a big magician for a long time, and there are many ice and snow mage and snow palace guards around him. Under normal circumstances, fighting with Androni still wins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at such a close distance, Rockefeller was before the spell. Will be cut off by Androni's sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled coldly and leaned forward slightly. Then her beautiful figure pulled out a blue image, lightning-like bypassing the snow palace guards that came to intercept, and rushed into the ice and snow mage group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a beautiful blue cross in the blue sky, staggered over Rockefeller! Androni started with amazement, this sword is clearly to cut Rockefeller into four! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Cross passed over Rockefeller, who stood still, and the image of the Ice and Snow Magisters was distorted and disappeared. The site reveals a random portal that has not completely disappeared. It turned out that Rockefeller was not good at the situation. When he made a decision, he immediately fled with random transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took back the blue sky as the electric power, and held the great axe of the snow palace guard leader. She flew by the force of this axe. Going backwards, the blue sky and the stars are swallowing all the way, and the hands of two ice and snow mage have been cut off, and the lumbar vertebra of a snow and ice mage has been cut off. Androni this time attached to the sword is not starry. It is an ordinary vindictiveness. After a sword, the residual vindictiveness will break out again, and the wounds of the three ice and snow mage will be blown up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three ice and snow mage non-human screams, horrible wounds, bloody beads and broken meat that make the surviving ice and snow mage and the Snow Palace guards are one Staying, the blizzard magic lost the magic of support for a while, the power immediately weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is slowly rising. Her movement seemed to be slow and fast, and she had already come to Mora in an instant, and she slammed into her and slammed her out. The 'Forbidden Magic Field' was finally forcibly interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni reached out and took Mora, who was about to fall from the sky, slowly landed and looked at the silver sacred people coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more than 200 snow palace guards in the silver sacred religion, but Rockefeller’s sorrow and ice and snow mage have been scrapped three times, not to mention Carmon et al. The magic of the people is far superior to the ordinary ice and snow mage. Just in the number of masters, the eye of wisdom that comes out of the nest has taken the upper hand at this moment. Plus an Androni. The situation on the battlefield has been on the one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sacred priests who were stunned and ignorant of the war, Androni asked: "What should I do with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mora’s voice was weak and weak, but the chill in the tone went straight to Rockefeller’s blizzard magic: “All blood sacrifices! For the goddess, there is no tolerance in the holy war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know When did one of the bards once said: "The real adventurer, every drop of blood in his body is full of the spirit of exploration and the desire for wealth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Indeed, for thousands of years, the unknown and wealth have attracted generations of adventurers to leave their homes and embark on an unknown journey. Whether it is the wilderness, the Wanlishahai, the vast ocean, the innocent jungle, or the cold and hot summer, the wind, frost and snow, can not stop the adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steep snow peaks are no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bronze whiskers! Are you leading the wrong way? We climbed all day, except for ice and ice, nothing!" The two-meter heavy armored warrior groaned violently. His face was stunned, his skin color was a little green, and he looked like some half-orc. The giant hammer that heighs a hundred pounds in his hand is by no means an ordinary human warrior can move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear by my beard! It’s definitely right here! Unless the map is marked wrong! Jack, you still want to come with the wisdom of your half-orc Do you laugh at the geology and surveying skills of the alpine dwarf?" A dwarf wrapped in a thick bronze armor, squatting, even though he was just about the waist of a half-orc warrior, his door was not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bronze whisk! Jack! You both shut me up!" A man whose face was hidden under the red robe, the Master dressed up, yelled . It sounds like the voice of a middle-aged man. There is some evil and cruelty in elegance. After drinking the reckless half-orcs and dwarves, he turned and said to other people: "The map should indicate here. If we have already come up, then we will search the entire peak. I will move it to me. The rewards are worth our lives!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a team of more than 20 adventurers with a variety of careers and reasonable personal strength. I can tell. Such a team must have a reputation in the human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look over there! That's the Ice Devil!" an archer called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, on the edge of a tall ice platform in the distance. Standing on a pale blue ice demon, its blue eyes stared at the uninvited invaders, and the mouth full of sharp teeth began to spew out a group of pale blue cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongpao Master Shen Sheng: "Everyone is careful! There must be more than one ice demon here! We are looking for something on the high platform, line up, We attacked!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence that has lasted for a thousand years on the ice peak was finally broken by the sound of the horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! The half-orc's giant hammer with a gale slammed into an ice demon. The light blue, the body that was condensed by the 10,000-year-old ice was not afraid of the knife and the sword. However, he could not withstand the shock of the giant hammer. Numerous cracks appeared in the body of the ice demon. Then, with a slamming sound, the ice devil exploded into pieces of broken ice from below the chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifth!**, how endless..." The Orc warrior roared on the high ice platform, and then he suddenly opened up. Mouth, standing on the edge of the ice table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarfs of the dwarfs screamed and slammed into the leg of the Orc Warrior. He flew him, avoiding the two-footed claw of an ice demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jack! You stupid half-orc, what to do..." The dwarf looked forward to the Orc’s gaze, between The sizzling buzzing abruptly stopped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers are on the ice platform, they all stand on the spot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the wide ice platform. Inserted with a whole body flowing with silver brilliance, like a gun made of crystal. The brilliance of the gun body is coated with a soft silver luster on the ice surface within a few tens of meters. This gun looks like life, and the dark luster on the gun body seems to be in the dark and should be the heartbeat of this gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Artifact...that must be an artifact..." A thin hunter finally squeezed out a few words. His voice sounded like a cognac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Robe Master has not completely lost his mind. He shouted: "Everyone is careful! All artifacts. There must be guardian..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice is not falling, he feels dark. There was a violent tremor at the foot, followed by a thunderous bang and a whistling ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious existence of the Guardian artifact has finally emerged! Its huge body is several tens of meters long, and it is covered with huge scales of dark blue. On its back, there are pieces of dorsal fins like war flags. The mouth of the teeth is full of white mist and blue eyes. Staring at the adventurer in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... Is it a sea dragon?" Master Red Robe first recovered from the shock, and his common sense seemed to be very profound, and he recognized it. This very rare creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how can Hailong, who has always lived in the vast ocean, suddenly appear in the towering peaks of snow? And although this sea dragon is fierce, but it does not move on the ice, just can't stop breathing, it seems like a dying appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe mage suddenly realized! He felt that every drop of blood in his blood vessels was slowly getting cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly darkened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keen addict suddenly looked up and immediately consciously groaned: "We are finished! That...that is the dragon..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the adventurer, they are licking the creatures they least want to meet. A dragon. This dragon is full of sacred glory, with a majestic and elegant posture, which is different from any dragon that everyone has heard of. However, the adventurers would rather encounter a dragon that can be recognized, even if it is a black dragon, at least they can learn more. And now? The most likely knot is that they met a legendary mysterious dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four other figures in the sky that land slowly and stand still at ten meters from the ground. They are condescending and look at these adventurers coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slowest half-orc warrior among the adventurers has now felt the faint scent of the four people in the sky. Under a heavy invisible pressure. His hand could not stop shaking. With a bang, he finally couldn’t hold the hammer in his hand. Let it fall on the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe mage looked at the sky and said hard: "Sanctuary... or four...hehe, haha..." The last two laughs and bitterly The noise of the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An invisible heart quietly passed the hearts of the adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon descend from the sky, and the emptiness stands before the shackles. She didn't look at the adventurers, only clear and cold: "Find out why they found it, and then kill them all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of adventurers In front of the flower, a black robe who was originally standing in the air suddenly appeared in front of them. Two sharp-edged bone blades slowly protrude from the wide cuffs of the black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute!" cried the red robe mage, trying to make a final effort: "If you kill us, don't even wonder why we are going to Find it here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other black robes in the sky made a low-pitched laughter, a hand bone holding a white bone wand from the cuffs of the sleeves When it came out, his words sang the last death knell for the adventurers: "Don't worry, your soul will tell me everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Haha... turned out to be a lich!..." The Red Robe Master is fortunate, his consciousness has been in a frenzy before being chopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone commissioned these adventurers to find lost treasures through a killer organization." The lich hiding in the black robe said from the adventurer The result of torture in our souls. A magical array is drawn underneath the cymbal. In the head of its white-bone stick, there is a constant flow of hot blood, which is poured into the blood-red magic on the ice. Whenever a demon is completed, the faces of the adventurers on the edge of the ice will be defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy month nodded. Her hand was a trick, and the dying sea dragon floated above the dragonfly. The Death Scythe flashed in her hand, and then the sea dragon's throat broke through a cross-shaped split, and the large strands of large blue blood spewed out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hailong’s painful convulsions, the scales of the whole body suddenly flicker, but the huge body seems to be firmly bound by the invisible shackles of the road, No movements can be made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailong every time you struggle, there will be a bloody spurt. The angels on the embarrassed do not know when they will turn to the sky, and the wings will stretch out, and the bloody rain will be caught by the air. The blue blood touches the angel or the cockroach. It will be like a dry sponge. Infiltrate immediately, and one drop does not leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea ice of the polar ice is between Yalong and the real dragon. Power is not strong. It’s just that they have been hiding under the ice caps of the kilometer, which is extremely difficult to capture. The most special thing about the ice ocean sea dragons is their strong regenerative ability. The source of this ability lies in their blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the top of the lonely peak, Hailong’s screams were lower than one, and finally, its eyes closed weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel took the last drop of blood and slowly squatted, defending the shackles with wings. The body blood of the huge sea dragon can be filled with several cockroaches of this size, but now it is like a bottomless pit. The blood of the sea dragon is still exhausted, and it floats in the air and does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four dark dragon statues are lit one by one, but the last statue has only a very faint glow, and this light is so full that it seems to be extinguished at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the ice peak was silent, only the wind was whistling in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night whispered over the entire ice peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last glimmer of the dark dragon statue gradually dissipated, and the windy moon finally sighed faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respect for the wind, only the blood of the icy sea dragon is not enough. It seems that we still need to implement the first program." Elgara. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original plan? Well... well... let me think about it..." The voice and tone of Fengyue suddenly became unspeakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her silver eyes are slightly lifted, like a two-bend new moon, seems to be looking at the night sky. In fact, she is now turning a blind eye to everything in front of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The initial plan...the initial plan... well, that’s it!! Hey! Fear of him!... No, how can I Fear... Wait, think again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Fengyue’s spirits is disorderly and even occasionally leaked into Gregory’s consciousness. However, the sacred dragon has not been able to satisfy his curious heart at this moment. The scales of his body are slightly erected, his wings are unfolding, and he is extremely nervously staring at the right hand of Fengyue, posing with the posture ready to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four strong men are standing in the air, but their eyes are also focused on the right hand of Fengyue. The atmosphere on the top of the ice peak has become abnormally dignified. Although the four strong men are not as nervous as Gregory, they are also secretly gathering strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of Fengyue is getting tighter and tighter, and the power that condenses on her fist rises wildly, seemingly endless! Around her right fist, several lavender lightning balls appeared out of thin air, drifting irregularly, and as the strength of the wind and moon increased, there was a new lightning ball that could not be generated. Gregory knows that every beautiful lightning ball contains a terrible force in it, enough to destroy it completely! And once these lightning balls are out of control, the speed of the wind is so fast that Gregory does not dare to say that he can avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing another spherical lightning gradually formed, Gregory finally couldn’t stand it, and he gathered his courage and shivered: the beautiful windy moon master, you... .... What are you doing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind suddenly wakes up from a dream, she immediately feels a strange, right fist to the sky, the few extremely dangerous electric ball belt The splendid flame tail flies into the night sky, touches the clouds, and blooms into beautiful purple fireworks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
