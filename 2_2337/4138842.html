			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Heavenly Chapter of the Heavenly Gods in Hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, at two hundred Under the escort of the Qingqi, the northbound team finally entered the territory of the Asrofic Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a prince of the Empire, Rogge is not safe in the Empire, at least not as safe as in the country. In front of the real powerhouse, the two hundred light cavalry are just a practical decoration. If the city of Yunxiao is really coming, they can't even play the role of the meat shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is slowly moving. At this moment, if there is a big magician ambushing on the side, a large range of high-level magic can send the entire team to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge is not worried about his safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old-fashioned killer of the Death Class is never willing to sit in the carriage. He has long left the team and wandered alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of Xiusi is rather strange. On the day of departure, he suddenly said that he was ill and needed to recuperate in the carriage. As a result, he was suddenly sick at noon. Well, I only sent an elf to say that the terrain is complicated. He has to go and see if there are any enemies. Because time is tight, he will not come to say goodbye to Rogge. Rogge did not blame the ghosts of Hughes for a long time. Hearing this excuse, the fat man just smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Androni, it is absolutely unwilling to stay in the carriage. Missy has long been a solitary sword, stepping on the mountains and drowning, I do not know where to harass the beautiful girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most unreasonable thing for Rogge is that there is only fourteen levels of vindictiveness, but one step on his foot is completely lost, only to be slaughtered. God servant Serrafi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the punishment of Rogge on the same day. She never appeared again. But Rogge has an instinct, that is, Serafi will definitely go north with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of the goddess has said that let Serrafi follow him to the north. Mora never lie to anything related to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, Serrafi’s insidiousness and deceitfulness were more or less revealing, and they were not commensurate with the noble status of her servant. Although the fat man has a look of reluctance, but he has always been bold, that is, facing O'Reilly has been a color. Still moving hands, not to mention that Serafi is just a servant? The fat man can't bear it. That is to know that she is definitely not her opponent at the moment, but also has to use her strength to fight the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraffy said that there are ten levels of vindictiveness enough to pack his words, the fat man is convinced. But that refers to the positive decisive battle, against the strong, the positive decisive battle has always been the fat man's last choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, around the seemingly undefended team, there are actually four strong players. Anyone who wants to sneak into such a team. I can only blame the god of destiny for not paying attention to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, no matter how the fat man thinks, he can’t figure out how to strengthen his own defensive power, and supplemented with spiritual strength. Why? Still can't stand Selafi with only a small amount of vindictive one step? Moreover, this stepping also put the fat man on a half-dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge knows that once he has figured out this problem, his own strength will be greatly improved. Even if the magic does not increase, it will never be like this. If you encounter a strong sanctuary, you will be helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the carriage window and seemed to always be the same forest and distant mountains. Wipe off the fine sweat on your forehead. The wind butterfly crouched on the fat man and had already fallen asleep due to excessive fatigue. Her red luo's body looked weak and thin, and a silver-gray long hair like a condensed clear stream, shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this special carriage, she slept like a baby. Since the double curse of darkness and bloodthirsty, there has been only a moment of time after the wild. It is the time when she can really get peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of crystal water drops from the sky and falls on the back of Rogge's hand. The fat man looked up and just met the humiliation and anger of Marika. The noble imperial princess treatment at this moment does not match her identity. She was naked in the whole body, her hands and feet were tied to the four corners of the top of the car, and her mouth was blocked tightly, so she was hung on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will treat her like a bitch, only Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you can stick to the emperor... Marika secretly thinks. The anger in the eyes is even stronger. She used this to cheer herself up every day. Otherwise, she couldn't support it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog suddenly looked up and glanced at Marika, and the proud princess was shocked and shivered. The fat man snorted and admired the view from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, there is still a period of time in the emperor, he is confident to completely conquer this annoying and stubborn princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this trip is not quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes moved cautiously in the forest. Although he is already cautious in his case, in fact his speed is very amazing, a few faint figures flash, it will appear on the peak of another mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few flashes, he will stop and arrange a little, not to eliminate his own traces, or to disguise the followers to confuse the followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes has taken off his robes, revealing the pale green leather inside. The old fox is burning with a nearly transparent pale green flame. For a killer in the dark world who needs to hide the traces at all times, this faint vindictive flame is a sign that has done its best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movements of Xius are still chic, but compared with the fact that the weights of the past are lighter, this time it shows a little bit of embarrassment. He set up a disguise in a hurry and went in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a mountain in the far distance, there is a fiery figure flashing past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for this figure to appear in the place where Xiusi was disguised. She held the sword of the cross sword, took care of the messy blond hair, and observed the traces on the ground. Her face is full of sculptural beauty. Anyone who has seen it will not forget. Wrapped around the milky white vindictive light, it shows that she has raised the fourteenth level of fighting spirit to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment no one in the wild, Serrafi's blue pupils flashed a glimmer of silver. She suddenly looked up and looked at the direction in which Hughes fled. With a sneer, Serafi's figure gradually disappeared from the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took to escape, and Xiusi jumped on an old tree and looked around for a long time. Finally relieved. But he just found a teapot from his arms, and the cold voice of Serrafi came from under the tree: "Go down. Master Xius."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Si's hand trembled and almost dropped the teapot in his hand. He sighed and leaped down the tree with a sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serafi’s eyes brightened, slowly pulling out the cross sword, and a little spark on the tip of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it!" She was cold and cold. In the red lips with sharp edges and corners, it seems that it is vomiting the cold wind that can freeze everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes immediately shook his head and said: "No. Resolutely! Our vindictiveness is two levels worse. I am sixteen, but you are actually fourteen. Level of vindictiveness, this can't be played at all. What should I call you, is it Wina, Serrafi, or O'Reilly? No matter what the name, if you bully me, this will go to the end of life. The old elf will be the stain of your life. For your honor and unparalleled beauty considerations, I will never promise to carry out this battle! With our power gap, this is not a duel, but a beating! You can't This is for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God Seraf, it is the Wella who has come and completed the growth process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is indifferent to the long story of Hughes, just saying: "If you don't want to start, then stand there and don't move! Otherwise, I don't think about any power." Things like the gap..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled a bit and immediately stood there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina reversed the cross sword back into the scabbard, staring at Hughes, and the pupil began to shine again. Under the silver light, all the past experiences of Xiusi emerged one by one. It’s just that Weina feels more and more strange when she looks at it. She always feels that there are many breaks in the experience of Xiusi, and no matter from which point of view, he should not be so standard elf life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is possible! Wella thought for a moment. She quickly checked the experience of Xius, and soon I read Xiusi's plain life. Until you are under your own order. Under the tree, I honestly accept this scene of the field of insight. But Hughes is not standing there. He kept writing on a piece of paper until he finally unfolded the piece of paper in front of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the paper is a text message: "Welcome, the emperor will see you again. See me in my loyalty to God, let me let me go." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner was shocked and looked at it carefully. It was discovered that the Shuuss in front of him was actually composed of illusion, and it was the first level of illusion! Weina hated the grin, she has been wary of the amazing stunts of Hughes, or the high-level spells such as random portals, which he thought would use such a junior illusion to lie. people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old fox is so lucky that it is a high-level illusion that several great mentors have teamed up to perform, and it is hard not to be seen by Weina. However, she did not expect that Hughes would cast such a low-level illusion, so she was inadvertently given to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at her eyes and still smiled calmly, and said coldly: "Do you want to leave?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly took out the cross sword, and a sword pierced the chest of Xiusi's phantom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several mountain peaks, he was rushing to Xiusi for a sudden meal, and then spewed a small bloody fog. He coughed twice and took off his leather to see it. He found that the heart seemed to be slammed by something, it was completely cracked, and the crack was still spreading around. Hughes had no choice but to smile, and whispered in a low voice: "Good hand! Oh, can't hide, but can't beat... My old man, is it really old?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Weiner fell, the phantom of Xiusi disappeared completely. She immediately slammed, originally, she thought she could stab a few more swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner brows wrinkled. This time she judged wrong again. This was never possible, but it was such a small mistake that allowed Xiusi to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the wind is also there, how can the old fox run away? She couldn't help thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the wind is also there. The two joined forces, and only by the phantom left by Hughes, the old fox could be seriously injured. At that time he must no longer hide his whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina shook her head gently, put away the cross sword, and disappeared again in the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extremely weak Gregory is squatting on a mountain with a weak force. Its body is completely divided into two sections, and a pair of milky white wings are Root cut. At the moment, I am holding it in the hands of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the rush of Weina, all of my heart was betting on the growth of the new body. The transformation of the loyal Gregory adults has long since been forgotten. But the bone dragon is very fortunate. Just as the force that separates the death and the divine energy in the body collapses, the wind and moon return to the world of death in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see the endangered bone dragon, the treatment of Fengyue is very simple. She took the wall directly and then punched a fist with her hands, and the death and divine energy of the upcoming confrontation were broken. The remaining sacred and death forces of the bone dragon have been unable to conflict with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this. At this moment, Gregory is extremely weak, let alone not talking about power, and even maintaining the fire of the soul is very difficult. But it is not afraid, because Fengyue is already working on transforming its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon suddenly felt that whether it was the loyal Gregory, the holy Gregory, or the invincible Gregory in its dream, obviously Not as good as the lucky Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked around bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the mountain, tens of thousands of zombies and scorpions are moving earth and stone under the command of a corpse. It is actually building a huge magical array! However, this is already the wind and moon that can collect all the undead creatures in the land within a thousand miles. After experiencing several catastrophe caused by Wella, the world of death is already very famous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
