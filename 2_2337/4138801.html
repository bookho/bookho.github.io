			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short time in the city of the gods is the rare quiet day of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall situation of the Holy Alliance is now fixed, leaving only the mess. Roger simply handed over the affairs of the Principality of Ale to Auntie and Charlie to take care of himself, and he was hiding in the city of the gods with infinite scenery to practice magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, his cultivation career is not boring, and even the most men can be envied, especially in recent days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning sun, Rogge came down from the big bed with a satisfied smile, took a towel and rubbed the sweat on his head, and then ran it with his hand. I got a robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the low voice, Effie also struggled to climb down from the bed. When she was about to pick up her own clothes, she was taken over by Rogge and kissed a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie smiled lightly, and it was not too early to push the Rogge away. I have to go through the room!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "Are you ready to move?" Rest for a long time, martial arts is good, don't be a maid in the future, just be my personal guard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie shook his head and said: "The maid is the maid. . Even if I go to bed with you, I am still a maid, and I have to do my part. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggled to put on her clothes, and she took care of the sweaty gold and walked outside the door.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Effie, you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm fine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf girl replied crisply: "I am willing to accompany you, but you cannot lose justice." "When you go out, you go out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's face is weird, and he opens his mouth and can't speak for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! I’ve been sitting quietly in the corner of the room, and Ai Luoluo laughed. Rogge stared at the little iceman with hatred, and took her helpless.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the beauty of Effie is far from the wind butterfly, Androni and other beautiful ladies, martial arts are unremarkable, and there is no outstanding talent, if it is flattering, confusing all beings, even more Compared with Fu Luoya, there is always a special feeling in her body, a feeling that makes Rogge feel unrecognizable. In the past few days, Rogge has practiced magic, and some people will involuntarily go to Effie. Child.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it for the clear eyes of the Elf girl, or because of her simple and neat personality? Rogge himself does not know the answer.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl is very simple, not dragging the water, but also stubbornly nearly old-fashioned. Since that night, Effie After I was very happy and went to bed with Rogge, Rogge had asked for it, and she would immediately let go of her hand. Effie on the bed was extremely wild, and even wild was so surprised that Rogge was not like a first test. The elf girl, there is no shame that the elf should have.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent winds of the past, tired girls will need the comfort or warmth of the lover. But this is also not Applicable to this alternative elf girl. In addition to the first time to rest for half a day, every time Effie and Rogge carnival, regardless of physical fatigue, will immediately dress up neatly, to do his own maid work Every time Rogge had the heart to bring Effie around, but she was rejected by her, and even the request to let her rest more for a while will be simply rejected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;; Rogner, why not this stubborn elf girl, he can do it, just be gentle when intimate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except in the bathroom He and Effie's first time, after each time they were intimate Ice 茜 茜 茜 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛 洛Although the fat man was depressed by the elf girl, the task of the iceman has become much easier. It is worthwhile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge Repeatedly thinking about why Effie is so happy to get away from himself. The elves guardian warriors are willing, because Rogge's gods are identifiable because they regard this as a dedication and sacrifice to Hilo. Androni and Froya, first, the special relationship between them was used shamelessly by Rogge, one because of Roger's growing strength and power. The marriage between the great aristocracy is mostly a product of interests and politics. As a fat man, even if she is married to Froya who has never died, she is not insulted by her identity. So what about butterflies? The wind butterfly is on his side for revenge. In her mind, in addition to hatred, it is estimated that there is no other thing. On the same day, Amy would love Rogge. The big reason is that he is far from the youth, Druid's temperament, experience and strength in the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the mountain, there are a large territory belonging to him, there are thousands of people who belong to him, there are nearly 10,000 elite warriors, and there are nearly 100,000 troops who are training equipment quickly! And this beautiful elf city, The city of gods, which is entrusted with countless elves, has become a horrible war bastion. All kinds of powerful magical equipment are constantly being created from the hands of elf craftsmen. More than 10,000 elves will become brave warriors, hazy killers when they need them, or conquer the enemy with their own looks like Melan and Ikerel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he fled from the south, Rogge was just an inferior nobleman. Now, he has already boarded the respected position of the Grand Duke. Soon after, he will go to the emperor to accept the canon and become one of the three great empires, the prince of the Asrofik Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the strong, Rogge has the *** and death classes in the sanctuary, and Androni, who is already on the edge of the sanctuary, and mysterious Unpredictable Elders of Hughes. These lineups are enough to rival a big country. Rogge himself is a magician killer. His spiritual shocks, magical moments, alien spells, purgatory and special physique are not the nemesis of other magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has a huge power, honor status and strong personal strength, even if you are just a fat man with a plain appearance, it is enough for the vast majority The beauty is moving, right? Rog smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Effie’s clear eyes couldn’t see the power of magic. In her glass-like pupil, Rogge saw only himself. The reason why the Elf girl did this was because of him, because he was Rogge. Maybe he felt special from Effie, it was because of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog couldn’t help but smile. If you remove these auras from your body, what else do you have? Any one of the elf men is probably seven or eight times more handsome than the fat one. Can she still like her own sinister sin? Can you still use the road that is covered with blood and corpse behind yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood upright and quietly looked at the scenery outside the window. For a moment, all the mountains and rivers in his eyes seemed to be covered with a thick layer of blood, thick as he had walked and the road to be embarked on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this cruel world, just as looks and body are the criteria for evaluating women, power and strength are the medals that men advertise themselves. What people see is only the glory of the medal. No one will pay attention to what is hidden behind the medal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and took all the distracting thoughts out of his mind. After a few more years, he will be thirty years old. Rogge knows that although he has a beautiful scenery at the moment, in this world, whether he can see the sky of thirty years old is hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the heart of the fat man, he has always been a hero in success or failure. He only needs the results, regardless of the process. If the results are not satisfactory, what is the point of the process? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After countless hurricanes, Rogge knew that he could never find any excuse for his failure. He had already put the words 'Hope of Heaven' from himself. The dictionary was ticked out. Rogge is not willing to let his will be weak and shaken. Although Rodriguez's inheritance has brought him great strength, God knows when the arbitrator of the Church of Light will appear in front of him. He did not want to come to the end, but regretted that he did not work hard to prepare for the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of Rogge’s thoughts, the door opened, and Froya, who had a lot of documents in her arms, came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead fat, what do you stay?" Froya threw the pile of papers on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Rogge’s nightgown, she snorted and asked in a strange tone: “Is that elf so tasteful? Look at you these days. When I have time, I am fascinated by her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge came over and smiled: "Effie is really very tasteful. These What are the documents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all reports from the Principality of Aray that those people are not much, but everyone can write a report, one sentence I can write down ten pages for what I can say. I will sort it out for you and read the top three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogger Start with the top three reports and read them in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is the report written by Charlie. After nearly a month of fighting, he has swept away the large-scale resistance forces in Latvia. All towns have been included under the rule of the Principality of Aray. The next thing to do is to transfer new troops from the Alai Principality to replace these long-running forces and serve as the occupying forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that Charlie mentioned is that qualified junior and junior officers are extremely scarce. Training middle and lower-level military officers is nothing more than two methods of warfare and military school. He suggested that the law be paralleled. On the one hand, a military school specializing in cultivating lower-level officers was established in the public. On the one hand, a group of loyal and brave officers were selected and sent to the Astrofic Empire for training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second document was sent by Auntie. After plundering the royal family of Latvia, Ale’s nearly collapsed national strength finally got a breather. After preliminary statistics on the treasury of the Kingdom of Latvia, Auntie estimated that at least ARay’s huge war machine could be operated for more than a year. This crazy woman immediately developed a new armament plan, ready to arm Allah’s 100,000 army to the teeth. However, Auntie, who has a strong desire for power, has long-term vision in some respects. She proposed a huge arms improvement plan and prepared to pay a large sum of money to establish a national alchemy laboratory in the Principality to mass-produce new types of magic equipment and war machinery. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyelids jumped, and the big character of the Principality’s National Alchemy Lab was not irritating to him. He couldn't help but miss the happy time of the hammer of the gods of the day. If the lab can be hosted by the big alchemist of Faith, under the pressure of Auntie, he still doesn't know how many strange things will come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one is the report of General Horne. The new intelligence network established by this savage fox has only begun to take shape, but it has already cost a lot of money. As for the original remaining intelligence network, Horn is prepared to support the activities of the organization. The old fox’s plan is to let the resistance organizations accumulate small wins until they reach a certain scale, and then induce them to gather together the scattered or dark resistance, and then give them a devastating blow. Although this does not guarantee the complete elimination of the resistance movement, it will certainly make them vulnerable, and will not be able to resume large-scale activities within 10 years. At these times, Horn believes that Rogge’s rule in Latvia must be indestructible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge put down three reports and meditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie is bent on returning to the South, but he knows that Rogge will not be able to rebel against the Asrofic Empire at least in recent years. However, he is still training his troops. In addition to suppressing the possible resistance of the occupied area, and in order to be in the future when the Imperial Army is pointing south, the Principality of Aray can play more roles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horry’s plan is to fight drugs. It is very feasible to first fatten the pigs and kill them again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just Auntie’s plan, it seems to be too ambitious. Fortunately, the Asrofic Empire is still a wind, and any duke has tens of thousands of troops. If the two empire in the south, the sin of Rogge’s expansion and plotting is not enough to lead to the catastrophe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reports Rogge was not interested in watching. Since Froya doesn't think it's important, it's really nothing important. This little goblin is a weird elf, but it will never be confused on these big things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly came a painful pain in the soft ribs of his back, pulling him back from reality to his reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man had a cold breath and looked back. He saw a small electric fire still beating on Froya’s fingertips. Her eyes were all smiling in her green eyes, and the rippling eyes almost drowned the fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead fat, are you so good at breaking reports? So for a long time, I don’t even look at me with my eyes?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and reached out and took Fu Luoya over. He carefully looked at the double-spring Biquan, which is close to the feet and deep in the cold pool. Froya’s eyes ignited a flaming fire and stared back without hesitation. Her full-bodied chest was heavily pressed against Rogge's chest, and Rogge couldn't help but panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are playing with fire? Be careful not to burn yourself!" Rogge frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to play with fire! What can you do with me?" The little goblins began to provoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger took her up and strode into the bedroom and threw her to the bed. This said: "What are you doing? That's it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two large electric lights suddenly illuminate, still in the air, and Froya’s hands are lit with lightning.格!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was caught off guard, hit by lightning, and fell in the entanglement of small electric fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya whispered, and with a backhand, several free blue electric balls flew behind him. She also blessed herself with a fire shield. Now she is almost immune to fire damage, and she must harden the flame wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of silver threads suddenly appeared around Froya, slammed around her shield, and slammed it down! Her outermost two magical protections could not withstand it, bursting into a beautiful magical fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya panicked, not waiting for her to recite the next spell, Rogge’s low voice suddenly sounded in her ear: "His Royal Highness, still awkward Go to bed!" Froya's waist came from a strong, and in the exclamation, the little goblin was finally thrown into the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and began to undress, but the silver awning in his eyes did not weaken. This little goblin has too many tricks, not to mention that she is an artifact, even if it is naked, it is also extremely dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Froya is a little confused and fat! Are you not coming to really? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? Rogge replied coldly, and his hands kept moving.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good... come on!" Froya replied idly, pulling The quilt covered her face, but her bare shoulders were slightly swaying, seemingly sobbing low.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently opened the quilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s eyes are closed, and two drops of tears are flowing down her cheeks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗Hesitated for a moment and asked: "I remember the day again? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya trembled a bit, slowly nodded, whispered: "Don't care for me." Come on! Anyway, you only need people, don't mind. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and gently wiped away the tears of Froya. I will let you go this time. However, the next time I can't. Polite!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Froya opened her eyes, her eyes still hang tears, but the green eyes were full of smiles. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge screamed a bad one, and before he could react, he was firmly sealed by a blue ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblins escaped the room in a gust of wind, and the crisp laughter came from far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the ice that trapped Rogge suddenly exploded, and he stood up as if nothing had happened, looking at the direction in which Froya fled, laughing low. One voice: "I actually let you cheat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is in the long corridor of the temple, Effie is holding a big red porcelain vase Go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" The sudden call behind the scene made Effie tremble and almost fell the vase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl looked back and Fu Luoya was standing behind her. The little goblins are casually standing, and there are countless thousands of styles. She had a pair of green eyes, and she looked at Effie carefully from top to bottom, and Effie was watching her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you Eve?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not pretty, of average size, bad martial arts, identity is only a maid, and Straight to go, the character is not cute. Miss Froya, what else do you want to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl simply surprised Froya, she was so easy to return It’s Roger..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because I don't want anything, just go to bed with him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie's naked straightness let Froya breathe a little. She couldn't think of hearing this answer from an elf mouth. For a moment, I broke my tongue and lost my voice: "What is this reason? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
