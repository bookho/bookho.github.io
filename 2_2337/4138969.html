The large staff of hundreds of staff members arrived in Oshnia earlier, and agreed with the Drodi side to determine how the two sides should respond, replenish, coordinate operations, divide the theater, and receive the transfer to Asrofik. A city defended by the Imperial Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Imperial Glacier began to march toward the Dro Empire, the calendar in the hands of the Death Class just took the last day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the densely packed calendar in his hand, for a long time, the Death Class stood up. He pushed open the window and looked out into the distant horizon. At this time, the morning light just reflected the land of the Northland, and the sun suddenly leaped out of the clouds. Just somehow, this beautiful morning glow in the eyes of the Death Class, each piece of red is set with a looming black edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of death is as condensed as frost, and the corner of his mouth twitches slightly. This morning, he was upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For his kind of killer who walks in the dark world and is always responsible for harvesting his life, he is very valued. The killer hidden in the dark is often in an unprotected state. A missed shot is likely to be the end of the commandment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the sound of the military squad, watching a team of iron horses rolling to the south, the death class does not know how many people in these soldiers after a few months Can stand in front of him. He knows that this is going to the south. It will surely be a battle that has never been experienced before, and its ups and downs may not be less than an epic battle between the Terran Alliance and the Elven Empire thousands of years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a war, there will be a few people standing on the top of the wave, and it has been recorded in history, but there will be more people like the tide in the tide. Can only be helplessly rolled away by the waves. Since then, it has been attributed to dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the Death Class has entered the Sanctuary for many years, before the tide of war that swept the world. He also has a small boat, in the process of drifting, I do not know when it will hit the reef hidden under the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class suddenly missed the quiet days along the North Lake. He has an intuition that he should immediately leave the world and fight, and live peacefully and peacefully in the last decades of his life. However, there was a sudden flow of heat at the waist. The death class looked down and the sword at the waist seemed to be summoned. Suddenly fluttering, the sword body scatters five colors of brilliance, alternating and shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the fascinating brilliance that was enough to sneak up, the Death Class finally sighed heavily. He gently stroked each thin line on the hilt of the sword with his fingers, and experienced every powerful beat of the surging force in the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beat is like his heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad leader gave a sigh of relief, and the killer’s instinct finally made him determined, and then took the last risk of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death class is coming out. In a twinkling of an eye, his figure was like a light smoke, appearing in front of the prayer room of the Great Shrine. After gently slamming the door, Mora led him into the prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the prayer room, Androni is holding her starry sky and is sitting in the corner. Her head is hanging down on her lap. The half-long maroon hair that hangs down covers the face of the fallen city, but it can't hide the sorrow that comes out of her body. The Death Class can't see her face, but he can feel her sadness. Class and Androni have something in common in many aspects. After many days of getting along, the class has already understood where her incomprehensible knot is. But he can't help her, he also has his own incomprehensible knot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a god today?" asked the Death Class, and he still hesitated in his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before he made a real decision, Mora said: "Yes, the goddess has already lowered the gods, so I have been waiting for you. Now, please give me your sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes are as clear as spring, and her hands are condensed. However, in the eyes of the Death Class, I don’t know why, this fiber is even more terrible than the devil's claws that can tear the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sabre was placed in the hands of Mora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's eyes suddenly changed! In the eyelids, there are two windows that open to the unknown country, which are extremely deep and far-reaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emptiness is replaced by the silver light. At this moment, it seems that the wind and moon that lived alone in the kingdom of God has stood behind Moura and is through her eyes. Watching the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the god swept from the hilt of the sword to the tip of the sword, where the gaze went, a thick green pan from the five colors of the sword Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only for a moment of gaze, the sixth movement is complete! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora's eyes were restored to their original condition, and she returned the sword in her hand to the Death Class. The class silently inserted the fine sword back into the waist and walked out of the prayer room with a heavy step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the prayer room was just closed, and Androni, who was sitting in the corner, suddenly jumped up and hugged Mora tightly, all over her body. Trembling. She just held it like this and said nothing. But in the neck of Mora, I felt a warm drop of water dripping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mola patted Androni’s back and gently said: "Okay, the goddess has gone."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni slowly let go of Mora, barely smiled, and the tearful smile was extraordinarily cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora gently wiped the tears on her face, softly asked: "Annie, Rogge has already sent a message, he wants you Staying at Ludan Port, don't you think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni shook his head and clenched his hands, firmly saying: "I already thought It’s very clear. I just want to see her again. And I want to see her now, but it’s only possible to follow you to the South. In fact, you and I know that she... she will not let this war go. As long as I can see her again, I don't care... I don't care about being enemies with my father and my brother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora looked at Androni's beautiful and near demon face. Sigh gently: "This is not a problem. You... Do you know that Effie predicts the future? This is the main reason why Rogge adults let you stay. If you are not sure, it is best to see Effie. Ask the content of the prophecy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s gaze has already crossed Mora and landed in the mysterious country beyond the endless void. She still shook her head firmly, only saying: "Under the final moment, fate has not really decided. Even if fate has already decided, I will accept it all. As long as I can see her again! As for the prediction of Effie I won't read it. No matter what she predicted, it won't affect my decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora sighed, she gently held With Androni's face, she suddenly had a kiss on her lips, and then screamed: "Remember, in the South, don't leave Rogge too far anyway."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled and stopped talking. After giving Mora a light hug, he turned and walked through the stars, and his head would not walk out of the prayer room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the empty prayer room, Mora fell to the altar and prayed low and low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the turbulent flow of space storms, Wella continued to walk through. This time, her speed was faster than the previous one, and in a blink of an eye, she rushed to the front of the space standing in the storm. The figure then sneaked into the space door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall of the air is still mysterious and beautiful, but I don’t know why, the demon posture with the chain on the pedestal has changed, and it has more than ten twists on the head. Half of the staggered long corners broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, Wella did not notice this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the country of the windy month, Wella is already familiar with the rules of this country and is beginning to have the ability to fly. So her progress is much faster. In the twinkling of an eye, it has already risen to the gate of the air hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is still standing before the huge ice crystal. Her posture, even her demeanor, is exactly the same as when Weina left last time, and it seems to have never been moved. The arrival of Wella did not make her react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the indifference of Fengyue, Weina has long been accustomed to it. She said to herself: "Fengyue, why did you cut off contact with me during this time? I have to be here." I am looking for you because I suddenly discovered that the danger of the Devil General Artest is unexpected. Its real strength far exceeds the power shown. This power should not appear in a Mozu! Its actions in recent decades have been very strange. I suspect that it has been carrying out any plots. But no matter what method I use. I can’t completely find out his past. I feel that I can’t let it go at this critical moment. The big variable exists, or simply kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue finally opened his eyes slightly, faintly said: "Then you kill it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the coldness of the wind, Wella frowned and continued to talk about her intentions: "With my expectations, Artest’s hidden power no matter how powerful I haven't seen it as my opponent. But ask It is useless to help the two demons who can help, even if they are added, if Artest wants to escape, I may not be sure to stop him. So I come to you, you and I join hands, it is inevitable He can be immediately killed in the Central Mountain Range. With the power of Artest, even if he does not have a godhead, I am afraid that he will have the power of the field. These forces are very useful to us. This is one. The second thing is The South is already fighting, but you suddenly cut off contact with me. What if the war situation changes? You also know that we are truly enemies of the Light Church and the Heavenly Gods. Others in the church do not say that it is only the Pope. There are too many secrets. The power he possesses seems to be unrestricted! There is also the goddess of nature, and we still don’t know whether this plane still has her avatar or servant...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue’s eyes opened again, and she interrupted Weina coldly. “You’re dealing with dusty chores, and I will not leave the realm of God, no matter what the success or failure. ”<br /><br />&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina was on the spot, she really couldn't believe the words of Fengyue, couldn't help but ask: "Fengyue, what are you talking about? When he is in danger, you also Ready to sit back and ignore? You...have you really forgotten everything in the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Fengyue does not have a slight emotional swing, indifference The meaning is cold. Quietly passed through the heart of Wella, almost frozen her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is Rogge's destruction, and I will not leave here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what you are talking about?!" Wella's eyes began to ignite raging anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue eyes closed again, faintly said: "I certainly know what I am talking about. It’s just that you are in the field of God, so you don’t understand that I am What to say. I will send you back. From now on, the gate here has been closed to you. If you want to come again, come in. Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vena Still want to persuade the wind, but did not wait for her to speak. In front of the eyes, the light and shadow flashed, and then there was a sharp pain in the whole body. In an instant, Wella has been popped up in a turbulent space, standing above the Central Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Moon! You are a jerk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wena screams in the Central Mountains It echoed in the sky. This is called the power of the thunder and rumbling, there are thousands of thunder and blast at the same time in the air! For a while, but where Verna screamed, all the Warcraft that felt a little sharper immediately hid. Those who are not able to hide are in the same place. Has trembled to lose mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vena’s voice is of course not transmitted to the kingdom of God. Silence was restored in the palace hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the wind and the moon flicker open, and the flashing silver light flashes the whole hall! The two silver plaques have two quiet lakes, and the lake slowly recedes to both sides. Two headless angels surfaced. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it’s been that I’ve never changed my posture, and I’m going to get back to the hands of the Death Sword, which has followed her from the dead world. Death sickle seems to know that he will drink blood, and the huge blade is excited to tremble slightly, giving a low humming sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silvery eyes of Fengyue, through all obstacles in an instant. Scanned the space around her country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under her silvery eyes, everything in the air and in the kingdom of God became a vain image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eternal darkness, she is the only visible existence. Just, in the void of darkness. How many invisible visitors are hidden? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue will slash the slashing knife in front of the front, with the left hand and fifteen fingers gently stroking the sharp edge of the blade. The blade of death was slightly trembled with a slamming sound, and a small wound was cut on the fingertips of Fengyue! A drop of golden blood slowly oozes from her fingertips, and the spin is sucked in by the Death Scythe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death slasher screamed again and again, as if it was very satisfying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Moon retracted his left hand and placed the injured finger in front of his eyes. Under the gaze of her eyes, the insignificant wound healed in a blink of an eye, leaving no scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Scythe slowly swings from left to right, and the huge blade is like a mountain. It seems heavy and stagnate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Scythe of Death is from right to left, but this time it is incredible. Even the tangible existence has disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy moon suddenly rises to the top, and the silver-eyed blast in both eyes explodes, and instantly sweeps through the numerous or tangible or invisible planes around her country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to take a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the windy month almost the colorless lips opened slightly, and the sound of a clear whistle suddenly sounded in countless spaces! This whistle is getting higher and higher, and it has jumped to an unimaginable height in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly bursts into a smashing smoldering fireworks, and then there is endless energy and the fire and rain are falling, the beauty of that moment is fascinating! I don't know which small plane can withstand the pressure of the wind and the whistling sound, and is destroyed into pure energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling sound of Gaochun Qingyue is still rising! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! There was a broken sound in the void, and then it was absolute silence. Even the whistling of the windy moon stopped for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In absolute silence, countless fireworks blasted quietly, and the next moment, a flame storm that was enough to destroy everything swept through the void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the flowing energy flame, several shadows of almost nothingness are slowly emerging. They have no entity at all, but the inexhaustible pressure of the body reveals that people can't help but believe that in the face of these illusory existence, all tangible entities are extremely fragile and vulnerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the whistle of the wind have stopped, she has appeared in front of a virtual shadow in an instant, the surface of the Death Scythe in the hands of the surface of the water ripples, it seems to become There is a vain existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in the moment, the Death Scythe has no idea how many notes to the shadow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom couldn’t change, leaping, twisting, and even making a very whistling whistle. It seems that under the attack of the Death Scythe, it is suffering from unparalleled pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, a few other ghosts are scattered in the Quartet, but they are just a flash, they have been surrounded by the windy month, scrambling to the wind and the moon ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of white wings suddenly opened in the void, and then countless white feathers fluttering. In the snowflake, there are floating golden drops of water...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of God, the passage of time is different from the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s been a thousand years, or just a short moment, the country of the wind and moon is again in the void. If the wind and the moon are weak and helpless, the leaves will float and fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind her, a phantom flashed, struggling to squeeze into the country of the wind, and chased her to the fall. Just somehow, the one blow that it must have suddenly appeared under the windy moon, and the slashing knife that has broken the majority of the blade has been inserted in its body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
