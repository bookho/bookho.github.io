			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 骷髅 doesn’t look like a high-level monster, not even a sergeant. The whole skeleton is not big, and it can be seen that it was not a very tall person before life. There are mottled marks on the bones, some bones, such as the important skull, and several very prominent cracks. As for the ribs, there are not as many as twenty in number, and perhaps I don’t know which wild dog is used as a life-saving hunger. The only thing that is different is that there are two slender skeletons that seem to be wings and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the creature created by the origin of God? ? Rogge’s chin is about to fall. How can this cockroach not be related to the gods of the heavens? Can it be said that the gods who enjoy the infinite glory that day are no different in nature and evil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s mental power slowly extended over, gradually merged with the cockroach, began to try to control, check this skill that may be a new breed of magic. Everything is going well, this cockroach seems to have no special ability, except that the power is bigger than usual. After a burst of fatigue, Rogge knew that his mana had been used up. What to say, you are also my pet, and your name will be called Fengyue in the future. "I don't want to go into the relationship between the 骷髅 and the wind, Rogge sent the 回 back to the outside world. Just at the moment when 骷髅 disappeared, Rogge seemed to feel that it was a little depressed, it was dissatisfied with the name. Just kidding. I am also depressed? "I must be too tired. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, after three consecutive pet calls and exhaustion of magic, Rogge finally accepted the fact that his pet is awkward. Routine meditation Make up the magic, time is near dusk. "It's time to have a drink." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Oak Grove" bar is quite a bit old, not small, only three blocks from the North Magic Academy, and also the site of the mercenary union mission. 1. Therefore, magic apprentices and mercenaries gather, naturally, there are also hot girls and girls who want to catch a golden turtle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Rogge? Long time no see I heard that you have changed your sex in the past six months. Are you really ready to be a great magician?" Rogge saw that it was Etter, who had been fighting with a friend. Etter's five big three thick heads, three years older than Rogge, Laozi is the cavalry captain of the city defense army, also considered an intermediate knight, has been training Ete to become a knight since childhood, but somehow sent his son to the Magic Academy. However, Ete is still a little talented. He entered the school a year later than Rogge, but he became a third-level magician half a year earlier. He is working hard on the fourth-level Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked down to Ette and sat down, drinking without a word, for a long time, sighed. There are three other people at the same table who know that they are blind children, and they wear the fine swords commonly used by nobles. The two dancers are laughing and joking with everyone. Etter kissed Rogge's shoulders intimately. "I said my brother, these days, you are really boring. You don't have so much instinct for you. Why, my heart is annoying, isn't that girl not put on it? Haha. Pack a drink on my big brother! Man, put two bottles of your tequila!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the bar is gradually coming to the **, from time to time One or two women’s screams and a few big tricks of laughter. Gedi, let me introduce, this is Rens Blom, the second son of Earl Bloom; this is Kate, his father is my dad’s boss. This is Franco, the nephew of the Marquis of Floren. "Ete puts his tongue out and introduces Rogge again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that the girl over there is not bad, it seems that it is not very good. "Lens stared at a corner of the bar. Everyone was busy looking at him. There were four men and two women sitting on a table in the corner. It looked like a mercenary, and one of them was dressed as a mage. A girl about ten." * Dress up the fire, a dark short armor, bare white slender thighs, a belt tied to the thigh, with three flying knives on it. The breastplate does not look big in the dark light of the bar. But there is no doubt that the workmanship is excellent, and the curves of the girl's chest are well highlighted. The chest collar is very low, and a deep cleavage almost causes the eyes of Rens to fall in. The big sword around the hand is let Several people were slightly awake, after all, the weight of the giant sword on the side illustrates the girl's strength. The woman's face is hot and gorgeous, a pale brown corrugated long scattered around.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman warrior is sitting next to a noble girl with a powder makeup, looks like only fifteen or six years old, a long skirt in addition to exquisite workmanship and valuable materials, there are very few Excessive decoration. girl The only conspicuous decoration on the body was a pair of earrings of sapphire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rude gaze of several people was immediately noticed. The female warrior came back and ran Busy back to a whistle. The female warrior looked cold and touched the hilt, but was dragged by the mage. "Don't make trouble here, Qiwei."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Offi Rock! The Golden Lion of the Rhine League, how could he come here?" The low-pitched arguments came one after another. Orpheq is the only son of the lord of the Bavarian Principality of the Rhine Union. He was sent to the Holy Shrine of the Holy Church for guidance at an early age, and returned to the Rhine League in the first half of the year. Orpheq is one of the youngest of the three high-ranking knights in the church. At the same time, he showed outstanding military talent, plus a natural handsome and prominent younger brother. The limelight even overshadowed several princes of the Rhine League. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod is surrounded by a woman like an iceberg, just a little less than a tall golden lion. There is no expression on the beautiful face. The woman’s rare black mage robe, like a black flame constantly rising in the pace, the swaying posture is the temptation of the endless. Behind the woman are two guards, and there is a real murderousness that shows that the two have passed through countless times between life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officox walked up the stairs. For a long time, the bar was restored to the usual noisy. In the heart of Rogge, he was restless. I don’t know why. In the face of Orphey, he always saw a pair of silver eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large wine glass blasted around Rogge, and the ale inside was sprinkled with a rogue that was too late to guard. But Rens is even worse, the drop of the wine glass is on his forehead. Rogge turned around and saw the murderous female warrior coming up with a big sword. The four male mercenaries also followed behind and had a fighting stance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of wine drinking, and Lance’s heart was rising again, staring at the chest of the woman’s warrior while squinting, while dancing in the arms of the woman’s chest. The screaming of the fate. When the female warrior turned back again, he also pulled out his hard-working handle from the dancer's clothes and shrugged at the other side towards the middle finger. Then the glass of the female warrior opened the flower on the forehead of Rens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly fighting for a woman in a bar is commonplace for Rogge, but these few seem to be warriors who are war-torn. A few have dealt with it. Just as a nobleman usually deceives people, no matter how they fall, they will not escape. Rogge wants to escape, but in retrospect, these few wine and meat friends are not a wealthy, they still have a background. It’s also helpful to promote fighting friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete is the oldest and has considerable combat experience. Immediately jumped up and began to curse, but the wine was much more drunk, and the curse of a sour arrow was inexplicable, and it didn't come out for a long time. At this time, the other party had been fought with the three of Rens, and soon the three men were bruised. The female warrior started to be particularly fierce. A squatting leg went straight to Rennes, and Lens saw the situation. He quickly turned to this foot and flew out of the battle circle. Etter screamed and grabbed the sword from one side and temporarily transferred to a knight and entered the battle group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several mercenaries are obviously indifferent because their opponents are nobles. Rogge’s brain was still clear, and the magic missile was flying. The two light bullets flew in a curved shape to a male warrior. The warrior arbitrarily waved a sword, Rogge's spirit was moving, the light bomb suddenly went in the air, the soldier immediately blocked the air, and then the two light bombs circled again and exploded on the soldier's face. Although the magic missile is the first level of magic, the power is limited, but the thickness of the warrior's skin seems to be far less solid than the chain armor. Then the soldier looked bloody and swayed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other soldier saw the situation and immediately sprinted the sword. The whole person slid like ice on the ice, and swiftly rushed over. Rogge was shocked, too late to move the magic, biting his teeth and moving again, this time is the foot of the warrior. The fighters in the rushing spurt were suddenly stunned and rushed to Rogge. Rogge lifted a table and blocked the head of the front of the sergeant from hitting the table. Just as the warrior was still in dizziness, Rogge, who had fought in battle, grabbed the other's helmet and slammed his knees. The nose of the soldier broke. The strength of Rogge, who has been physically modified, is no longer a small one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving the two fighters, Ett and others have been able to support with three dozens. Kate, who is known for his defense, has a slap in the chest and successfully caught her attention and took most of the offensive. Et and Franco are already attacking and defending another fighter. At this time, I don’t know when Rens, who had secretly hid under the table, suddenly had a sword, stabbed the soldier’s thigh, and turned back and turned to the female warrior’s yin. The female warrior was not prepared, one side, blocking the sword with a shackle on the thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary mages have never entered the battle, but did not expect a moment, the battle turned sharply. His face was full of anger, his fingers drew a symbol, and a blue transparent protective magic "magic absorption" was prepared to cover the whole body. This level 4 magic can absorb at least 10 levels of magical energy and is one of the most commonly used magical magicians. However, Rogge, who has a very different understanding of magic, disapproves. "*, do you need a protective cover for several magic apprentices?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
