The fierce wind rushed in with him, and took the opportunity to pounce on the alcoholic guests sitting by the door. Many drinkers who were red-faced and red-faced were opening their arms and slid into the collar and into the leather robe. A shudder at least half of the good wine that just went down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intermittent buzz continued to come, and the waiter rushed from the bar to close the door. However, Roger did not care, and he went to the bar of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a quiet moment in the pub, followed by whistling and strange noises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Rose that followed Rogge into the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a black windbreaker on her body today, the erected collar covers half of her face, and a short blond hair flutters in the wind. Her hair color is not the sun-bright gold, the slightly maroon-colored, lining the jasper-like bright eyes under the forehead, it is just right, wild and unremarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meizu Deng black lizard boots, windbreaker brass indigo button buckle from top to bottom, neatly, did not reveal a point of skin, but that is like an iceberg The sleek color is matched with the smothered and smothered dress, and it is not in the heart of the emperor’s banquet. Her right hand was on the side of her legs, and her delicate fingers came out from the sleeves of the windbreaker, which allowed her to see her skin of the snow. Looking at the many drunkards in the pub's evil shape, the frosty face, the eyes of the finely-cut golden short hair reveal a cold and angry light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boots at the foot of the rose stepped out of the crisp step and followed Rogge to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brawny man with bare chest is standing up and swaying. Stop the way to Rose. "Hey, pretty chick, how about staying with me for a drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden smile, and the style between the moments made the brawny stay on time. In place! She smiled and said: "Why not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the words, there is already a copper pot in the hand of the rose, and a flower in front of the drunk in the pub At that time, the heavy copper pot has been slammed on the face of the drunkard! A clear bone crack was heard under the copper pot. The brave man did not say anything, and immediately fell to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose smiles and looks around the audience. The five long fingers were loosened one by one, and the copper pot that had been completely deformed fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the pub saw her sleek, glaring hands on her slender and beautiful hands, and turned their heads. A few silent figures looked at the cuffs of her black trench coat, which was lined with a row of five brass cufflinks with faintly negative lines on the cufflinks. That is the coat of arms of the ‘tidal’ army. They seemed to sigh and bowed their heads to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May came to Rogge. Forced to shoot the bar, the occupant's Cyclops boss said: "Take the strongest wine here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss shook his head and took one from the bar. The bottle of old-fashioned whiskey came out and took out a glass of wine. I didn’t expect the rose to grab the bottle. She has two fingers and a clip, and has already clamped the bottle neck bottle, and then she looked up and sipped. Already a half bottle of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May's eyes are getting brighter and brighter, and the body begins to faintly reveal murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub in the pub is getting smaller and smaller, and already timid alcoholic sneak away. The one-eyed dragon boss smiled and shook his head. Under the bright and scary eyes of Mei, he swallowed all the complaints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge leaned on the bar and shook the glass of his hand. Put a gold coin on the bar and say, "Hey, man, I heard that you called Corbetian?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-eyed dragon reached out and took the gold coin. Road: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose looked at Rogge's eyes a little different. With her major title, every two months, the military will have a gold coin. Although she doesn't care about money at all, it is difficult to understand why Rogge used a gold coin to prove a message she had known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are hundreds of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One gold coin. “Who is the best blacksmith?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you want to build equipment?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I just want to study a piece of equipment. I heard that there is such a blacksmith in this city that can't control and only analyze and analyze ready-made equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The one-eyed dragon looked at the whole bag of gold coins in front of him, and there was no intention to open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose suddenly reached out. Grabbed the collar of the one-eyed dragon boss. Almost pulled him out of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell all you know!" Rose is cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rose! Put him down!" Rogge whispered softly. Rose glanced at Rogge and slapped his hand. Let Corbetian fall back to the original place. She took the bottle and drank the remaining spirits from the bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge licked it all over the body, and couldn’t find anything worthwhile. He was slightly addicted and took off a magic ring on his hand. Put it on the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cyclops boss took the magic ring and looked at it for a long time, sighed, and reluctantly said: "This ring is good, but compared with this news. Still a little worse, hey, the loss is lost, this time I recognized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched his neck and whispered in Rogge An address. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and took two shoulders of the one-eyed dragon boss, swaying him, and said: "Thank you, thank you! Be sure to take care of your business. Rose, go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s two of you coming together, it’s still ok...” Shoulder, muttering to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Rogge, he suddenly turned back and stared at Corbetian. The middle-aged one-eyed dragon was shocked and immediately laughed: "Miss Rose is going slowly, I will come again next time! Be sure to come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a handful of guests left in the pub at the moment, they suddenly pulled out their weapons and rushed to Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight side of the body, and there was a sneak attack on the sneak attack. Her black windbreaker suddenly opened and a long leg flew out. The shiny tip of the shoe hooked the neck of the killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog seems to be turning very slowly, but when he turns around completely, with the warmest smile to greet the two killers who have swooped up and left, The two of them moved in the air by a distance of about half a foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has a magical long blade with a faint black color in his hand. He smiles, no matter what the rules, just sighs at the two killers. The eyes of the two killers flashed a horrifying look. However, they could not control their own body, and they could only rush toward the black and white in front of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long legs of the rose are cleverly collected. The killer has already brought a circle. The shiny black lizard boots immediately hit the shoulders of the killer, and the hair was clear and violent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer slammed into the ground, his spine could not withstand the tremendous pressure of sudden bursts, and there was a burst of cracks in the caries. The killer spurted a large amount of blood, and then fell to the ground like a soft pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden bloody sigh in the back of the rose. She slowly turned and saw Rogge standing in the blood and body of the land. With his hands in his pockets, he was smiling at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge and the smile of the sun, Mei suddenly burst into a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, dude! You have seen it. This time, the guys of the wind wolf first came to me to trouble. I just defended myself, not violating you. The rules!" Rogge confessed to the one-eyed dragon, and went with the rose door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last guest suddenly stopped and looked incredulously at the tip of his sword. He tried to look back. I saw the owner of the one-eyed dragon smiling at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with difficulty: "You are here...not forbidden...killing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-eyed dragon He smiled and said: "My rules have always been effective for the guests!" He twisted the short sword and smashed the heart of the victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the blood, broken limbs and internal organs of a place, the one-eyed dragon sighed a little embarrassedly: "The guys of these wind wolves are really troublesome..." Sighing, he rolled up his sleeves and began to clean the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took the rose and squatted in front of a small, dilapidated building. The fat man once again looked at the house number and determined that he did not admit the wrong place, immediately kicked the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is very simple. It looks like nothing special. Suddenly there was a sharp scream on the second floor. Then a one-meter-high dwarf figure flew down the stairs, and it turned out to be a dwarf who was not old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Naqba?" Rogge asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me! Who are you?" The gnome saw his name. The tone eased a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "I want you to analyze a magical equipment for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first sight, people are asking for it, and the arrogance of the gnome is arrogant. He almost jumped up and shouted: "Aha! You broke my door and wanted me to analyze the equipment for you? The genius Naqba has always worked only for his own preferences. Don't think that gold coins can make me work for you. Impossible! Don't say gold coins, it's not a gem! You can give me out now! No, before I go out, I will lose my door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge laughed and said: "The genius of Naqba, you made a mistake, I did not intend to pay you gold coins, let alone gems. But you will still agree to analyze the equipment for me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome’s eyes are red, which is a typical sign of this race’s extreme anger. In order to show their own majesty, the gnome will try to jump as high as he can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have angered the genius of Naqba!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price of angering Naqba It is very heavy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nakbar is an important person protected by the wind wolf!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is finally impatient with this gnome who is jumping around, he faintly said: "May, think of ways to make him obedient A little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the eyebrows is slightly wrinkled, watching the gnomes jumping around, and the dangerous eyes are revealed in the slightest eyes. She explored her left hand and caught the gnome's collar and brought him to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right shakes his right hand. Singular short blades of seven different shapes slipped out of the cuffs, and her right hand immediately clenched her fists. Each finger was pinched with one or two sharp sharp edges flashing with a cold face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May will shake the right hand of the blade and shake it in front of the gnome. All the swear words in the gnome's mouth disappeared immediately. Rose smiled coldly and said to Rogge: "Would you like to visit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and shook his head: "There is an empty room, you are free. Let's play, don't kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sigh. Carrying the gnome into the room. The door slammed shut, and there was a gnome that was like a pig-like scream and pleading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door has opened again. Mary took the gnome and walked out. Her hand was loose, and Naqba fell to the top. He struggled to stand up, but he was scared so badly that his legs were soft and completely unrelenting, tossing a few times, still like a mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So fast?" Rogge was quite surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge smiled and slammed down. He said to Naqba: "Natural nucleus, are you rethinking my suggestion now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No problem! I don't want gold coins or gems. Naqba is now your most courteous servant! Please tell me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Na Keba has started the magic array in the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome is not low in his alchemy and magical equipment despite his fear of evil and greed. Once started, the gnomes are caught in a state of enthusiasm. He ran around in the room, jumped up and down, kept tweeting the switch, or adding one or two more materials to the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central part of the magical array, quietly floating a dagger with a dark red flame, Kasinas dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a busy day. The gnome took out a beautifully decorated small box, carefully grabbed a small blue sand from the inside, muttered for a half-day spell, and the five fingers smashed the sand to the Kasinaras dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also opened a magical equipment store in the early years, very familiar with all kinds of magic materials, so at a glance, these blue sands are extremely precious. Star sand, this star sand has the mysterious power to track the spatial connection between the past and the time span. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the gnome spell, the mysterious mantra of the Kasinaras daggers appeared on the layer, followed by dozens of dark reds. The filament line is highlighted. One end of these wires is connected to the spell on the dagger, and the other end leads to the other plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome has rounded his eyes. Carefully identify each magic symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casinaras.Dimon Fisala Mizolab. Ah. This name belongs to the lineage of the abyss demon, it seems that you The power of the dagger comes from the lava abyss. Dimon is the title that only the existence of the big devil can have. It seems that this is the reason why this dagger is so powerful. Well? Wait a minute, the sensation of Casinaras is very dim. , indicating that this is not the name of the devil's life, but it is indeed associated with a particular big demon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome is squatting while holding his head think. He suddenly jumped up and shouted: "I understand! Cassinaras is not the avatar of a big demon, it is the projection of another plane! Ah, then everything is obvious, Nuck Bazhen is a genius!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May heard a confused, Rogge is a sublime admiration, this gnome can really be called a genius. With so many daggers, I infer so many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome turned to the red line leading to the ectopic plane on the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure! No one of the demons is a good thing! The only effect of these lines is to pass the curse, but this is the holder of the Kasinaras for the dagger. The curse. So no matter who becomes the master of this dagger, you have to accept the Casinas, or the curse of the devil can easily obliterate the life of our plane. But very strange, these lines It should be connected to you through the dagger, ah! Naqba is not cursing you, but you are not the master of this dagger, why does the red line of the curse lead to other directions?" The gnome started to have a headache again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha laughed: "Nakba, you are a genius! You are not mistaken at all, the line of curse is to go to other people. Haha! Very good, it seems that I didn't come white this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogger pointed to the red silk of the rest and asked: "That is so How many? Is Casinaras used to sense and control the dagger holder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome took a crystal lens. Carefully study the tiny magic symbol attached to the root of the red line, and then hesitate: "It seems to be. But I am not sure. Although Naqba is a genius, he also needs time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded and asked: "Since Casinaras can control the dagger holder through these mantras, then we can also pass these mantras in reverse. To attack it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnomish vocal: "That is of course! Divine power is an inseparable part of God, and all divine power is two-way, God is Giving mortal power at the same time. It also provides a chance for mortals to touch him! So you can attack Casinalas if you believe that power can be compared with it!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naqba looked extremely angry and jumped up and said: "This is what the gnome god told us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! No, I mean, the quotations of God are recorded in the chronology of the gnomes. I am a genius in the gnomes, of course I have seen the Chronicles!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Rogge did not continue to delve into it, the gnome breathed a sigh of relief. He took out two months of white gems and slammed each other, leading to a small group of electric lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me see again, how these curses work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Amazed, he still could stop him in the future, and the electric light fell on the dagger, and then disappeared along with several red lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power is completely negligible, almost certainly toward the wrath of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was quiet in an instant. Then a strange squeaking sound rang, and it was impossible to distinguish the source. There was no transition from far and near, like every molecule in the air, driving everything in the room along with its frequency. beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May a short blond hair began to float slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a hell!" Rogge cursed and pulled the gnome over. Press under yourself. He spoke a curse very quickly in his mouth, and behind him, there was also a low voice cursing at the same time. Roger’s left hand was not idle. He couldn’t hold the silver light flow on his fingertips. He painted magic symbols in dazzling movements. Each time he painted four magic characters, he condensed into a silver in the void. The light shield guard is in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very quick response, and she was very uncomfortable. She immediately took her head with her arms and slammed it out of the window. The crispness of the "唏哩哗啦" did not affect the rhythm of the sound of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is turned from dark to light. At the moment when the thoughts are still not working, the purple-blue light has ruled this side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning potential that appears across the void is unstoppable. Such as the raging wave of anger, filled the room every inch of space! The inexhaustible lightnings twisted and swayed in the air like a snake. Every lightning flashed a purple-blue thunder, and the tumbling burst overwhelmed all the gaps. The purple electricity that could not be vented was sprayed from the door and from the window, and one of them smashed the rose that had not yet landed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scream, and it was hit by the blue-violet current, and it fell heavily. The rest of the situation was inexhaustible, and she was firmly pressed against the ground. But she had a strong pain in paralysis, and a sessile dagger appeared in her left cuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May used the last effort to insert it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning madness suddenly disappeared, and there was no trace of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a paralysis of the whole body, lying on the ground, slightly squatting. Her left hand with the sword is already black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the room, Rogge's clothes were ragged, the roots of the hair were erected, and the pain of burning all over the body. Unlike Rose, Rogge is the frontal impact of thunder and lightning in order to protect the gnomes. Fortunately, the fat man is strong in spirit and has strong resistance against various negative states. Therefore, he is not affected by the paralyzed effect of lightning. Even so, he is burnt enough by the electric fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge couldn’t take care of himself, and hurriedly looked at the state of the gnome, which surprised him that the gnome under his body was black and almost turned into a piece of coke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome squeezed out a very ugly smile, intermittently: "Curiosity will kill a cat...and...kill a gnome... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge noticed that the gnome's fingertips were spliced ​​with a looming red line. It is no wonder that under his multiple magical protection, the gnomes are still burnt into coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and took back the Kasinaras dagger. He quickly searched through the entire small building. The raging thunderstorm almost turned everything in the building into fly ash. In addition to a piece of incomplete and fragile notes, Rogge never found anything else worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
