			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如如梦章八八音下<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-green flame floats in the air, The deep-reflected hall was flickering. Under the faint light and shadow of the flashing lights, it seems that the dozens of 100-meter-high pillars on the walls of the main hall are not twisting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible winds in the temple are colder than the gale in the Arctic Ocean. They pass through the cloister, bypass the giant columns, and finally hover in the middle of the main hall. A weak woman on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this high and wide hall, this woman is like a lotus flower floating on the quiet and tranquil sea, clear and slender. The cold wind swayed her broken dress, stroked her skin, and solidified the blood that still gushed from her wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, she moved, as if she was struggling to sit up, but she still fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue fire floating in the hall did not know how many circles circled, and she moved again. This time, she finally struggled to sit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her scattered black hair has long since disappeared like a mirror, and the silver plaque is also confused and struggling. In addition, there is pain in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is something she has never shown before others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy month finally propped up and slowly raised his head. Her face was almost white, and she was completely bloodless. In the background color of the green and green, she is a woman rendered by black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her lips slightly and suddenly coughed up violently. Then the world has one more gold that cannot be expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver eyes slowly hang down, and the arms of Fengyue are still shaking. She seems to be able to fall back to the ground at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly. Fengyue raised her head again, and she struggled to stand up! However, there was a painful heartache behind her, and she almost fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original god will also hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thin fingertips almost touched the ground, but she finally stood up and swayed. The windy moon bites the lower lip, and a few golden bloodshots gush from the row of snow teeth, converge on a knife-shaped lower jaw into a drop of golden blood beads, and then fall in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally. She struggled to come to the huge ice crystal in the temple and raised her trembling hand. Let's tear off the broken dress on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the ** that is not in the world is so naked in front of the ice crystal. Feng Yue stared at the figure reflected in the ice crystal, she almost could not believe, the dream figure is her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly shook a bit, unable to help hold the ice crystal, which stabilized the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is going to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the country has consumed her too much power. The fierce battles that have been dying in succession have drained the last bit of power in her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God will be tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the state of the wind, it is time to enter a deep sleep. The time of long sleep may be a short moment, maybe it will be a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the establishment of his own country, Fengyue has understood that if God sleeps in his own country, then the kingdom will choose a material plane hidden in it. Of course, God can also choose the hidden plane. Even pick the hiding place in the plane. In any material plane, there is rarely a strong enough to threaten the existence of a nation that protects the sleeping gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when a god is asleep, the other gods will completely lose their sense of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more than a billion in the space, even if it is the main god of heaven, if you want a plane to search for a place where a god sleeps, it is not at all Possible tasks. The goddess of ice and snow does not know why it is sleeping in this material plane. It was only after she woke up that she immediately released her gods. As a result, Macbeth traced the message of divine power and discovered the hiding place of her body. This was the only battle in the northern ice world, and her godhead was finally usurped by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southern War will open, and there is no hidden power in the Church of Light. Perhaps she only knows. Although the goddess of nature is hidden in the kingdom of nothingness, her eyes never leave this plane. In addition, there are the gods of that day...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can't sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue stares at the figure in the ice crystal. The hand slowly touched the shoulder of the red luo. Then over the shoulder, the fingertips slipped onto the skin of the red luo on the back. Her filigree fingers finally covered the two wounds on the back that were not afraid of healing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's silver eyes slightly picked up. The five fingers suddenly exerted strength and slammed on the wound on the back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Fengyue’s face is white again! She suddenly looked up, and the biting silver teeth could no longer stop the cry that contained too much pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her painful cry screamed in the hall, and with a loud bang, the piece of ice crystal exploded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smog of the sky, the wind trembles, pulling out the deep-inserted fingers from the wound, and then inserting it again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole kingdom of the gods is constantly trembled, the air palace is like a lonely lamp in the storm, when it is dark, it does not live left and right, fixed The three giant chains of the air palace collapsed tightly, and the chain ring and the chain ring could not rub together, and even a large group of sparks broke out! The three giant statues that make up the base also trembled, and they also made a whimper similar to the whine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace in the palace suddenly rushed into the sky, and the momentary momentum almost pulled the entire base off the ground! After a roar, the dragon statue with the chain suddenly exploded two pieces of fire, the pieces flew in, its wings and dragon tail have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painful call echoed in every corner of the Kingdom of God, which caused the earth to tremble, and the fire was thundering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when, the kingdom of God was finally quiet, the tight and thick steel chain slackened, and the palace floating in the air re-radiated the soft light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the hall is as soft as the outside, and a glimmer of halo is reflected in the beautiful ** that is not in the world. Her hands clasped the shoulders of the red luo, and a silver band of light rose around. Eventually condensed into a silver dress, the skin of the red luo is covered under the silver silk satin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new ice crystal re-established in the hall, she slowly rose, standing between the ice crystals, slowly closing the silver eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of God restored silence, as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cry, Rogge suddenly sat up. He was sweating and gasping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with you, is it a nightmare?" Folly, who was sleepy, poked his head out of the quilt. Asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked out the window, the outside was dark and silent, it seems that there is still a long time away from dawn. He wanted to get out of bed with a cloak, and the hand was pulled by Fu Luoya. The little goblin was so sleepy that he didn't open his eyes at all, just said: "It's still early! Dead fat man, sleep with me for a while. You have to host a big ceremony today. How can you not rest?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge patted her head gently, the little goblin whispered something, and retracted and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quietly walked out of the room, walked through the room, and came to the meditation room. It is just that no matter how hard he tries, he can't rule out the fluctuations in his thoughts and enter the deep spiritual world. The screaming cry always echoed in his heart, always refused to disperse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only feels heartbeat. The voice in the dream is too familiar, but he does not know why he heard the cry of this voice. Rogge has long since he does not need to sleep, and he will not dream. But the two bizarre dreams before and after make him always find the answer. The first dream seems to be the same as what Weina said, and it is related to what is hidden in his memory. It was only after that, when Vena took out his memory, he never explained to him what was hidden in his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time, what is this dream again? Why is the shouting voice so strange? But I feel so familiar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very rare thing for today’s fat people to have such a dream that there is no sign and no explanation at all. In particular, this dream touched his heart that had already become cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the mood is not meditation. Roger simply came to the study. He took up the teachings of the Church of Light and studied it in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this thick teaching. Rogge can almost be backed up. When he turned over the chapter on the day of the judgment, the faint morning light finally penetrated the window and spilled on the desk in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sophie Palace, which combines art and luxury, has awakened. More than a dozen waitresses, both of whom are very good in appearance, are holding a variety of clothing and come to Rogge's study. It is already an open secret that the Pope's energy is extraordinary. They know that at this time, Rogge usually handles the teaching affairs in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge silver-plated crystal mirror was carried in. Under the service of these trained maids, Rogge wore the high crown of the goddess. Wearing a robe of robes, and taking the scepter of Feuerbach from the hand of the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge in the crystal mirror, solemn and majestic at this moment, he smiled and sly, but his eyes were cold and cold, no warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was very satisfied with his image, nodded, and walked out of the Sophie Palace under the guidance of the maid. At this moment, hundreds of high-level clerics of the Holy Church have been waiting at the gate of the Imperial Palace to welcome Pope Rogge. Today Rogge will host a blessing ceremony for the Holy Church in Ossia's first Great Shrine, and to preach the teachings of the goddess to believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predecessor of the Great Shrine of the Holy Church is actually the Great Shrine of the Light Church in Oshnia. In a short period of time, the priests of the Holy Church made a transformation to transform the altar dedicated to the gods of the heavens into the altar of the goddess O'Reilly. Only because the time is too short, there are many sculptures and murals inside and outside the church to replace the cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the war between the Bavarian Principality and the Dro Empire, the high-level clerics of the Church of Light in this Great Shrine have been retired, leaving only a few insignificant The local clerics and the servants guarded the Great Shrine. For this reason, the Emperor of Delois understood. He and his empire have been abandoned by the Church of Light, so they turned their full support to the Holy Church of Rogge. Of course, the fat man understands that the Emperor of Droo is far more than the faith in the color of O'Reilly. The reason why he seems so religious is that the huge sect of the Holy Church and the rumored group of powerful people can play a role in the war and save the rule of the Drodi room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge stepped out of the gates of the imperial palace, the avenues in front of the palace gate were already crowded with the people of the Dro Empire. Every few meters on the boulevard, there is a royal black armor garrison that maintains order. These civilians in the Dro Empire did not greet Rogge because of their faith. There are few believers among the sacred churches, and most of them just come to see the excitement. A small number of people are faithful believers in the Church of Light, because they heard that the Church of Light was expelled from the Imperial Chamber, and they had some ideas for trouble. However, after all, the faith is no match for reality. In the face of the sharp armor of the black armor, these believers finally chose to withdraw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hundreds of sacred church clergy, Rogge slowly stepped onto the car that was specially prepared for him. The car is covered with red satin and the branches are woven into four pillars. And finally made a vault on the top of Rogge. Each of the four corners of the car is carrying a girl in a priesthood. They hold the scriptures, holy emblems, scepters and short swords that symbolize theocracy. And the one that drives this huge car is two fierce dragons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragon is a rare and fierce World of Warcraft that is extremely difficult to tame. All countries in the mainland dream of being able to form a Dragon Knight Legion, but it has not been for thousands of years. A country has succeeded. The two five-meter-high dragons hang heavy iron chains on their bodies, and the domesticators shouted loudly, but they still couldn’t hold the gas, and they were carrying red eyes. Make a rush to the crowd around you. The uneasy movements of the two dragons caused the entire car to shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly boarded the car. From the moment his foot fell on the pedal of the car, the two fierce dragons suddenly met the natural enemies, and immediately put away all the vicious, gentle as a two lambs. Waiting for Rogge to sit firmly in the car, the two dragons did not wait for the instructions, and immediately started on their own. Pulling the car and driving slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the avenue, the people of the Droan Empire slammed into the ground and talked about it. For those civilians who have never seen miracles and have no access to the world, this scene is shocking enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a whole hour, the tedious religious ceremony ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog in front of the altar stood up. I looked deeply at the statue of God above the high. This turned around and scanned the believers who sat in the Great Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of contact with Rogge. All believers felt a sigh of relief and their heartbeat paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge seems to be thinking about it over and over again, for a long time no opening. The silence in the hall, the believers and the clergy are waiting for the possible gods, and the high-ranking aristocrats of the Dro Empire, who participated in the meeting, tried to judge the future movement of the Holy Church from the first speech of the Pope in Ossia. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge seems to have made up his mind to bring up the scepter and slowly point to the congregation below the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Rogge’s movements, an inexplicable heart slammed through the hearts of everyone in the temple. At this moment, the hall is like entering a new space, the light becomes dim, and the scenery is as if it is at the bottom of the water, becoming distorted and blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you!" Rogge’s voice was like a gloomy thunder, which exploded in the heart of everyone, and the rest of the time was not rested for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His evangelism is simple and powerful. First, it attacks the bright church to betray, throws the butcher knife at its own believers, and then describes the great miracles of the goddess to the people present. Finally, it is to give believers the benefits of the present. Every sentence of Rogge repeatedly echoed in the hearts of the people. The first sentence was not finished, and the next sentence has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all the evangelists of Rogge are not as sensational as his last words: "All members of the Holy Church will be exempt from any war-related taxes in the future." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of you know that since the beginning of the war, the Dro Empire has successively issued a number of new tax items to raise military expenses. When new tax items are passed from the empire's vast bureaucracy to the lowest civilian population, the tax has been at least tripled. So Rogge promised this. It will inevitably lead to a surge in the number of believers, even if it is just to escape heavy taxes, and there are many people who are willing to change their faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lengthy religious ceremony is finally over. The crowd leaving the hall rushed to the Quartet, rushing to inform the people who knew it about the generosity promise of the Holy Church Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left, Rogge changed to a carriage. In addition to him, Rogersky and the other two Rogge were sitting in the carriage. A very important member of the club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time. Generally, Robsky, who is the best to understand Rogge's mind, first flattered: "You are just giving the believers a promise to exempt the war tax. I don't think it will take long for our followers in the Dro Empire to More than a million miles. It seems that the Emperor of Dro is very powerful, and he is willing to make this blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge keeps his eyes closed, faintly authentic "The Emperor of Delo still doesn't know about this. When you pass by the Imperial Palace, you can tell him about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robsky was shocked. : "The emperor still doesn't know? This. This... he will not agree!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will agree." Rogge is expressionless, still Closed his eyes, cold and cold: "He hasn't gotten confused yet. You should understand that since I have released the promise, then I don't agree with him. You tell him if you want to keep the crown on his head, then Restricting his servants to less corruption is more direct and effective than taxing my followers."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the weather is not too hot. Robsky still wiped the sweat from his head. I don't know why, when he was in front of Rogge, he always felt nervous and fear involuntarily. However, although Robsky is sleek, he knows that loyalty is more likely to flatter Rogge than flattery, so he still swears hard: "Rogge. You do this, even if the Emperor of Dro had to give in, but in his heart. It will definitely hate. This can be detrimental to our future relationship with the Dro Empire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The future relationship?" Rogge smiled coldly, saying: " After the end of the war, will we still have a future with the Dro Empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky, no longer dare to say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this time, a new religion was raised in the three newly established provinces on the west bank of the Longines. This religion is also known as the goddess O'Reilly, but they believe that the goddess is tolerant and kind. The glory of the goddess should be brought to the various races. And should be inclusive to weak religions. Moreover, they oppose the sacred church's elite system represented by the sacred church, and instead advocate all believers regardless of their origin and wealth. All should be equal, especially to protect the interests of the lowest level of the community. These Protestant members publicly declared that all the actions of the first priest church, Pope Rogge, were to exploit the broad masses of the lower classes to support the elites of the upper echelons of the church. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in just one month, this can be said to be a branch of the Holy Church. Protestantism has grown rapidly and the religious reforms they advocate have also been More and more middle and lower levels of the public are recognized. Local officials and sacred church clergy have tried all means, but instead of failing to put out the Protestantism, they have become increasingly crowded. Even more embarrassing is that although they know that the Protestant leader is St. Martin, in which area, but he can't catch him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to do so, the member of the club had to come to report the matter to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the report, Rogge’s eyes were slightly open, and he looked at the savvy and savvy members of the guild, and the icy ice in his eyes almost frozen him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s eyelids hang down again, thinking for a moment, slowly said: “You know why you have so many troops in your hands, but you can’t Is it impossible to put out the Protestant movement to St. Martin? Because he is right, I really support the nobles of yours by the money received from the poor believers. But the number of poor believers is better than you. The so-called elites must be hundreds of times more than a thousand times. You said, is your strength in power, or is it their strength? Protestantism has developed so rapidly, except for the dissatisfaction of the people in the occupied territories to the empire, the most important reason is probably Are you collecting too much money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the squadron rolled down and did not dare to look up at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silence in the carriage, only to hear the hooves outside the car and the whistling of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally broke this suffocating silence and said to the members of the meeting: "Go to inform Saint Martin, say that after seven days, I will be The Red Rock Valley waits for him. There is nothing to talk about between believers who share a common belief. If he really wants to win something for the bottom members of the Holy Church, then come over and see. Go now. Do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the club whispered and hurried away. When he stepped out of the carriage, he trembled too much, and even went out of the car and fell out directly from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven days are fleeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Rock Valley is located on the border of the Dro Empire and is named after the red-hot rock in the valley. The cliffs are surrounded by cliffs, and the bottom is very flat, which looks majestic and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun moved through the sky, there was a squadron at the Red Rock Valley. They recognized the direction and ran to the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley has already set up a high umbrella cover to block the blazing sun. There was a high back chair under the umbrella, and Pope Rogge was sitting in danger and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rogge, there are dozens of clerics and hundreds of ice warriors riding on the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, people are speechless, horses are not stunned, and the entire Red Rock Valley is almost maddening! The dozens of knights in the valley mouth saw the scene in the valley, they were all a glimpse. They all turned to dismount and walked to the long-awaited Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his eyes, his eyes swept over these people, and finally stayed on a middle-aged man, smiling and asked: "Saint Martin ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man has a beard and a face that is majestic and determined. He did not fear Rogge's gaze, but stared at Rogge and said, "I am. I have heard that the Pope is very young, but I didn't expect you to be so young. You haven't reached thirty?"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "Not far from thirty. Dear Mr. St. Martin, you have not let me down, you see, almost the Holy Church is all in the waves The high-ranking clerics in the West Coast area of ​​Sehai are already standing behind me. Today I let them come, just want them to see you and learn how to treat every believer in the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
