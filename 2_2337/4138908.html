			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is still burning in the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Delaware Empire has surrendered, but Rogge does not dare to relax. In his original marching route, there were millions of grievances. It was not only the cities that were ravaged by the massacre but also all the villages and towns within 50 kilometers of the army. The seeds of hatred have been sown, and a hundred years are not enough to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s army has suffered a lot of casualties, and today there are fewer than 60,000 people. In a sense, every soldier who stays in Delaware is Surrounded by more than a hundred enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s mood is very depressed, just like the dark clouds over Tiffany. His mind is no longer on this undead land. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brave Sergey Principal not only ignored his surrender request, but stunned and sent out, surrounded by the weak guardian city of Side. Although the defense of the city of Sidde was terrible, the old generals of the defending city were known for their defense. However, Rogge did not believe that the three thousand defenders in the city could stop the attack of 20,000 troops. But what if the city of Schild is lost? In the eyes of Rogge, this is nothing but the unwilling struggle of the enemy who is doomed to failure. In the face of absolute power gap, it is not enough to have courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is preparing to give a deep lesson to the Principality of the Clayley on his way back to the Empire. At this moment, Pompey is on the Eastern Front. Although there have been repeated battles, the progress has been limited. It is completely different from Rogge’s brilliant achievements in the battle against the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the role of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gathering an unprecedented strongman, Rogge’s army can know all the movements of the enemy, and can easily open the gap in the most solid city defense, which can break through any firm. Array. The strength of the strong men is not enough to control the battle, but they can greatly enlarge the combat power of the existing army. Even if a sanctuary does not take the enemy's life, it is only by relying on the reconnaissance of the enemy's movements. It is very likely that a well-matched battle will become a party's victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the hearts of those kings who are high above, is the existence of these powerful men a curse or a blessing? Rogge thought about this problem, and his heart moved slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning hours, all the royals of Delaware, under the escort of the emperor, quietly left Tiffany and embarked on the avenue leading to the empire. The former emperor was forty-five years old. He was tall and thin, and his manners were gentle and gentle. Naturally, it would make people feel close. Although the queen around him has traces of the years, it is still elegant and beautiful. They calmly got on the carriage and didn't seem to take the future's sin. The three emperors and the four princesses are also very royal, not noisy. However, more than a dozen emperors and many emperors and relatives cry and cry, do not want to board the car. However, in front of the soldiers' swords, they had to pick up the good things in a hurry and get on the train one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leading officer has quietly asked Rogge several times, whether or not to kill all of them in the middle of the road. Rogge also hesitated, but eventually refused the temptation to scribble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing... or let the emperor go to a headache." Rogge thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s heart has already flown back to Richelieu. The religious war in the north has entered a state of heat, because Mora and all the mad believers are busy following the goddess attacking the Delaware Empire, and as a result the believers of the Eye of Wisdom lack sufficient support to establish in the territory of the Asrofic Empire. Almost all the churches were destroyed, and even the Eye of Wisdom was attacked in the Great Shrine of Dresden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the unyielding Principality of the Clay, this credit is temporarily given to Pompey. Rogers groaned, or the religious war is even more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that no matter how worried the fat man is, it will take a few days for the Tiffany to settle down. There are so many things to worry about and headaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the floating city flies north, except for the two dragons, there are only the three kings of the death world and the *** who do not know whether to wake up, the rest of the strong and the Ladu stayed in Tiffany. The meaning of Roggemoo O'Reilly is to let these strong men stay to assist him. However, since they are strong, most of them are a bit quirky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Wenna, who ranks among the top ten mages with a great alchemist, has a very hot temper these days. He condescended to surrender, and the result was that he did not become a floating city, nor could he sit down with the ectopic lich. Therefore, he kept himself in the laboratory on the tower every day, claiming that he would not go anywhere except the city of floating and Tiffany. Since you can't go to the city of floating, it's good to stay and repair his beloved Tiffany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge asked, but the death class just gave him a scornful look with a smile, which means that you have insufficient knowledge, and you said it to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is going around Tiffany every day. Every time Rogge sensed her, she felt that she was moving high and seemed to be looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Xiusi, he has been staying with Froya, drinking tea, and taking the magic medicine as a fruit to taste, to be more leisurely and leisurely. Rogge repeatedly asked the old fox to ask for his future actions. As a result, he only got one sentence at a time: "You only need to follow the glorious guidance of the goddess, and you will naturally receive the protection of God."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The devout tone and sacred gesture of Hughes’s words can easily deceive the vast majority of the world, but Rogge is determined not to believe. Hughes was an elf, but since the appearance of O'Reilly, his old man no longer mentions Hilo. The piety of faith has thus been evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the two old buddies also made him a headache, Robsky wanted to be the owner of Tiffany, and Etter wanted to lead the army, three Both ends of the sky are noisy at his ear. Rogge finally decided to bring the two to the Imperial Capital, and Tiffany was stationed by Wallace. As for Etter’s request for the leader, I will slowly find a solution later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic swordsman's personal strength is enough. The tenth level of vindictiveness and the magic of the sixth level are also enough to fight against the warriors who have the thirteenth level of vindictiveness. However, if Etter is only vindictive, he should have had a fourteen-level vindictiveness now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the level of personal strength is actually nothing to do with the leader. The entire southeast front is in crisis, and the complex and dangerous situation is completely different from when the dragons and the American mercenaries were beaten in the same year. Rogge didn't want to reunite. The brother of that year died on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, Roger will bring the rose to her side, and she will not be afraid of her vindictiveness. As always, Mei is doing his job as an adjutant. It’s just that she is very clear. Once she reveals her resistance or the consciousness of running away, Rogge’s immediate death magic will immediately fall on her head. After her death, the real hell will be revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge, who is too busy to deal with, has handled the affairs of Tiffany, and the 10,000-strong army is ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is on the main building of the palace. In addition to Winner's magic tower, this is the tallest building of Tiffany, enough to overlook the entire capital. It seems that the former emperor is also a very thoughtful person. Although he has no fame, he can lead a small empire to compete with the Asrofik Empire for so many years, and can definitely be regarded as a promising emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, everything is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany in the day is orderly, but the bustling night is not able to recover between day and night. *** The crowded wine cellars in the night and the crowds were obviously depressed. Except for the mercenaries or adventurers who came to the Nuggets, they could hardly see the locals. The streets and alleys are empty, only the hooves that the Imperial Cavalry occasionally passes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Moon has passed through the sky, and the night mist shrouds Tiffany in the cold night. Looking at it, Wanjia ***, in the fog, a yellow or white halo, bringing a lot of warmth to the cold night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May has gone to rest. Since that time, her performance has been absolutely safe and self-sufficient, and seems to have accepted her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger breathed a sigh of relief, watching the group of white mist dissipate in the night sky. Until now he was able to sneak a little. He suddenly felt that it was always busy for others to do things, but the things around him have not been understood. From the time he first met Rodriguez, it has been eight years since the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks to the north, that is the direction in which the floating city disappears. Among the flying castles, there is his most worried ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub has always been a good place for sleepless people, although the grand occasion is not as good as before, Tiffany's biggest "bear and cow" pub is still very lively. Although almost full, there are still guests coming in from time to time. Adventurers, travelers, and mercenaries can be placed on the wall of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the atmosphere in the pub is now abnormally dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub is a place where people of all kinds gather, and people of other races are not uncommon. But it was the first time that a dwarf gnome appeared in this pub. The wines of the various colors were piled up with the table in front of the gnome, and he had to stand in the chair before he could get the jugs. The underground gnome is wrapped in a tattered black robe. Don't look at him small, but the amount of alcohol is not small. After a while, he has already drank a few pots of different spirits, still not a little drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many good people in the servants who drink alcohol or adventurers. They have already seen that the beautiful women who imagine this world are very weak. Such a woman came alone in this pub, and it was a lamb that entered the wolf's nest! Is she looking at the underground gnome to protect her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the woman has a strange majesty, so that in a crowded pub, no one is willing to sit within a few meters of her, not only that Those fierce warriors could not even stay on her even with their eyes. As long as the beautiful figure comes into view, an invisible force will come in quietly, and they will subconsciously look elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the woman looked up and indifferently swept across the hall. Her eyes are clear and there is no performance. Some of the strongest guys suddenly have a feeling. This beautiful woman who seems to be weak and helpless is looking at the people in the pub with a discerning eye of an old diners. I don’t want to turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their eyes will still be involuntarily turned back, not looking at the beautiful woman who is unparalleled in the wind, but looking at the strange rifle inserted around her. The gun seems to be carved from a whole piece of crystal, which is nearly transparent, and the silver inside the gun body is like a cloud. Everyone who saw it seemed to hear the guns screaming and roaring in anger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Artifact?" A beautiful and dangerous word quietly floated in the hearts of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha! The underground gnome poured a large glass of strong mint wine in the blink of an eye, and he breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina master, wine is a good thing! After the body feels, the world is so beautiful!" The underground gnome is very authentic. It can't use the spirit of volatility to communicate with the owner, only to say. But the words of the underground gnome are not understood by one person because it speaks the dragon language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner Every wine is just a little bit on the tip of his tongue. After savoring it, throw the whole jug of wine to the side. She is not convinced of the emotions of the underground gnomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the reason why the wine is really a little bit more, the courage of the underground dwarf is also a little bigger than before, and it feels that it has suffered some grievances: "Why is the master of Wella, why did the owner suddenly leave? She actually dropped the loyal Gregory, and would rather bring the three guys who came from the world of death and the silver dragon who only knows the battle!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina seems to be thinking about something, and only half a day back: "Your *** master has made up his mind to concentrate on being her goddess. Lego, every time he calls ***, can you hear it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory immediately nodded: "Yes! Master's Lord... No, he is used to calling me when he calls the *** master. In fact, even if he does not call me, because of the existence of the *** master soul contract, I can also know." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was originally used to the owner of the master, but since its owner has one more, each time it is called When the grid-based human host, will provoke Wella master's meal repair. However, it is difficult to change the habits, and Gregory often said that when he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina indulge in a moment of Lego, and when he summons ***, you must tell me immediately! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has just struggled with half of a decade of brandy brandy, and he was shocked and immediately said: "Vina master, You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be understood. The underground gnomes don’t want to get involved in the war between the two masters.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When he calls *** again, I will go for her. "Weina faintly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina smiled and screamed with To. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome of the earth is a moment of sorrow, revealing the expression of a sudden realization, but it immediately remembers that when the master appears every time, it is through the space. You are still very weak now, as if... you can't do this. You see, is it here to add some strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;威Na looked around, her brows were slightly wrinkled, and she said coldly: "They have too little power and they look dirty. I am not interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
