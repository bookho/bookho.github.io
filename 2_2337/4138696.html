			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clark Chamber of Commerce has formed a large caravan. The truck is loaded with a heavy wooden box, except for bundles of weapons. The dwarf, of course, the dwarf's ration. Rogge and others once again guested the caravan of the caravan. All the way back to Selesburg without any danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tools for the 3,000 dwarves to eat, live, and work are not trivial. After three days of work, Rogge and Franco arranged all kinds of work. The dwarves all live in a family way. In the mountains, the stone is more, the dwarves are born to be stonemasons, so there is no need to worry about building a house. It was only a tool that smashed and brazed more than a thousand times, so that Rogge had been hurt for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauer was extremely angry when he saw these three thousand dwarf slaves. Rogge said, these dwarves are already slaves. I can still eat and work warmly when I work here. If I am under someone else, isn’t it a dead end? So my name is compassion. Doyle was an honest man, and he was ruined by Rogge. When I saw Doyle, Rogge thought of Qi Wei, but I couldn’t help but feel itchy, but the overall situation was heavy, and I temporarily dismissed the idea. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placed everything in Saleres, Rogge returned with only thirty dragons and beautiful knights escorting the weapons provided by the Clark Chamber of Commerce. Lille City. Soon after returning to the city, Rogge, Kate and Franco were summoned by Orpheq. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general meeting will come, and several aristocratic youths came to the government office with a hard scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a small chamber, Orphee stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, silently watching the scene of the winter outside the window. Elysses sat quietly in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, Kate, Franco, and Rens are on the ground, and they don’t dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you talking about, why aren’t fifty gold lion knights coming back?" For a long time, Orphey’s voice was like ice. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is gnashing his teeth, things are like this..." He briefly returned the answers that everyone had negotiated.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Orphey was silent for a moment, faintly asked: "How did Paulus and the last two golden lion knights who died?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" was betrayed! "The ears of the young nobles are like a giant bell roaring, and the fear swallows up all their consciousness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate and Rogge are desperately calm, ready to shoot, It is good to reserve a little space for escape. Suddenly an invisible cold creeps over and firmly binds the two. Rogge, who has a Warcraft-like body, completely loses control of the body.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophic’s fingers tapped on the scabbard on the waist side, sinking for a long time, and it’s very difficult.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After a long time, Orphee Rodriguez slowly said: "Paulus is Kate first to harm, Rogge is also sinful. In addition, the loss of this operation was heavy. Several of you were commanders. After the plan was made, it was impossible to adapt to changes in the battlefield situation. It was also a crime. But you caught the most urgently needed craftsmen in the Principality and contacted the Allies of the Clark Chamber of Commerce to guarantee the supply of military equipment in the future. Both of these are great achievements. If I kill you, I am afraid that not only will you not accept, but others will also have criticism. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is strict: "Kate cuts all the positions of the Lionheart Knights and enters the Lions Camp from the trainee knight for a year!" Rogge lifted all positions in the Third Knights! Also cancel your nobility title. I will propose this matter to the House of Lords. Rogge’s position was taken over by Franco. Rogge, you still have the identity of a church guardian knight, and I am not in charge of you, in the future... you are good at it. Go out! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sweat soaked the clothes of Kate and Rogge, and the two heard that they didn't have to kill the head and the prisoners, they were more or less relieved. The battalion is used to punish the knights who committed the felony. The members are usually the same as the average knight. In the battle, they are charged at the forefront. In fact, they are no different from the death squad. During the war, few people survived the lion tooth camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people came out of the Grand Duchy, and then went to the military to handle the corresponding procedures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Orpherock sighed, it was when he was using someone, why did I think so? It’s just that they are too much this time. A few talents are of course important, but the military discipline is even more important! I sent Paulus, who had long thought of them, to the idea that they had learned to make the hostile people use them. I didn't expect... I was too conceited. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses said: "Ophelia, this is not your fault." If it wasn't for Froya to start in the dark, the result would not be like this. As you said yourself, any plan will never be static. We didn't expect Froya to get involved. Do you expect those young people who have no experience to fight with the little fox? If you say responsibility, Orphee, you are also a little faulty. "Ofrock is slightly sighing that this time they can have some lessons, politics and battlefield, but they are not the pubs they are used to. But, Eni You really value them now, if you didn't stop the escape of the two boys, at least let them spend three months in the black prison!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elysses softly said: "Ophelia, I want to be able to have a few people who can really help you. Of course you can be without fear of anyone, and I know that you are a real person." The strength of the powerful man is also limited. Why did your Golden Lion Knights and Dagong’s Lionheart Knights have not been the top ten Knights of the Big Six, but the non-day Knights of the Ron Principality entered the Ten Knights? Orphee, I don't know much about military affairs, but I know that in the devil world, the most powerful dragons of the individual have never been the emperor, because their number is too small. Anyway, this time. How many people are there to go out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"As for that Rogge," Elysian took a moment. "He saved me once. And now I can feel his potential. Give him some time, it will be a very Ou Fei, I really hope that such people can help you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to say any more. He disappointed me too much. Orpheus looked at Elysses, hesitated, and said, "When I come back, let me talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the military, Rogge clearly I saw the look of the watchman and his arrogance towards Kate. It is no wonder that the most snobbish in the officialdom, who will be polite to the two people who have lost their lives? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked silently for a while, and Kate finally said: "I am all impulsive, and the result has dragged you. Hey!"<br />< Rogge smiled bitterly. "If you want to blame, we will blame our hearts for not being stunned. It would be nice to kill those three men at the time. Give him a death without proof. This time you go." The lion tooth camp is careful, and lives first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate haha ​​smiles, and the firm and honest face reveals a hero. He took a lot of Rogge. "Reassure, Lao Tzu has a breakthrough after the war and death. Now he is already a 11th-level knight!" He suddenly lowered his voice: "The one that Paulus actually practiced is The sacred sacred ritual of the Holy Knight of the Light Church, hey, this book is in my hands, but it is not good to use it. It is much stronger than my second child's second-rate cold ice. But is there any improvement in fat man? I have been mixing with the princess for so long, I haven’t learned any magic?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s smile can be no shortcut. But it shouldn't take long, I should be a tenth-level wizard. Let's taste the history of decomposition! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate was shocked. "This is a bark and magician fight is a loss!" You are not doing nothing right now. Let's manage our small territory and build the church's guardian knight. If Laozi is not happy in the army, he will enter the church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at Kate and asked: "Do you want to change places?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Honestly, David has already looked for me, promised to give at least one deputy head of the Knights in the future, and the title will also give a territory. Earl. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think?" Rogge asked. The fat man’s heart is also a bit strange. It is reasonable to say that the character looks good. The tall and heroic Kate is much stronger than himself. Why is it that this kind of thing is going to fall on his own head?<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katehaha laughs and has something to think about, definitely not to go! On the side of Orphey Roque, how long it will last, no one will value the small man who is free to change the club. If you run out of it, you have to remove it. Why bother? We are not holding a heavy hand or holding a big man in a city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humph! Kate is very disdainful to Rogge. "You are also a necromancer who is in the church and is qualified to say that I am a priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Haha, the two laughed a few times and each went back to their place to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night Rogge sleepless night. He sat on the roof and looked at the gloomy night sky. The sky is full of clouds, and there is no starlight. The night is already deep, and if there is only a few *** in the big Lille city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few words that discussed the fate with Froya suddenly flashed from Roger’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, what is that God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God can be seen as in destiny Birds flying on the river, they can see the direction of many tributaries of fate, and can choose to transfer one or two fish from one river to another."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "How can one or two people change the entire fish population at a time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not right," Froya A smile, "It is not a secret when God chooses these two small fish. They will let all people see the fate of the chosen person change. People are not rational animals, for the position of those two voters. Even if one knows that there are a million people competing with themselves, they will go all the way. So, the result is where the birds on the river fly, and where the fish in the river will follow. You see, God will do business. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, the so-called 'elector' is actually a bait?" Rogge suddenly Some chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost. I heard that there is an ancient person in the mysterious Eastern world. Fishing is not used, and it is similar to God!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know yourself, there is a 'elector' position in front of you, will you also smash your head and grab the countless fish around you? Rogge shook his head and couldn't answer the question. Suddenly, the wind on the roof became more icy and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought flashed in the heart of Rogge,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miracle, isn't it the biggest Bait? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For four hundred years, three miracles have created the three great powers on the Big 6. The Bright Church has also been transformed from a small, unremarkable church to the now Big Six First Church. There are countless ‘intentional and knowledgeable’ people like themselves who trotting into the church all the way, regardless of the purpose of these people. At least the bright church’s current talents and the gestures are enough to influence the political pattern of the entire Big Six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the four hundred years of the rise of the Church of Light, countless religions and beliefs have either disappeared or moved underground. The church has never spared no effort in the fight against heresy. The prosperity of the Church of Light seems to prove that the power of the Creator and his servants believed by the church is far beyond the worship of other religions. But is that really the case? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood on the roof and looked at the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of human activity is limited to only two-thirds of Gloria's 6th, and the rest is occupied by a variety of powerful aliens. Outside the Big 6, there seems to be an endless mysterious world. There is a mysterious Eastern 6 and there are countless legends. But what is the connection between the two big 6 bridges, but no one knows. However, there will always be people in the East 6 who appear mysteriously on this big 6 and they can’t tell themselves how to come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of Light is not without failure. For four hundred years, the church has organized six Crusaders, most of which are crusades of aliens and explorations. For example, the predecessor of the Great Hall of Light, where the Pope lived, is the Temple of the Elves. The largest crusader crossed the sea a hundred years ago to detect the mysterious East 6 and never heard from it. Taking advantage of this opportunity, a mysterious religion seized power in Asrof. After that, Astrofike retired more than a dozen times of attacks on the church and its dependent countries, and finally forced the Church of Light to seek peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唉! Rogge sighed, the world is so big, where do you go in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in David’s mansion, Andre, who was wearing a silk shirt at random, was anxiously pacing back and forth on the cloister. Suddenly, the lake in front of him boiled, and a water elf jumped out of the lake. As soon as the water came out, three ice arrows came to him. The sneak attack is obviously beyond the expectations of Andrei. His charming and beautiful face is also serious, because the water elf can't have only one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning to the end, Andre took the hand and stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled, and if this smile was changed to a woman’s face, it would have to be lost to countless men. The color of Andrea's face is almost inferior to that of Elysses or Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, you still can't come out? Do you want me to catch you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Furuo smiled and Ying Ying appeared from the tree. "You can break my water elf without moving. You haven't been idle during this time. You are about to break through the realm of the Paladin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Andre rushed to the side of Froja, swaying her waist and holding the other hand heavily, and slamming it hard. "You little fairy, since you came back, don't hurry to see me, actually dare to tease me! See how I will clean you up!" said, Andre's hand has already explored the clothes of Fu Luoya, not inside Stop exploring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria winks like a silk, gently provokes Andre’s chin with his fingers, softly said: “I don’t know who will pack it for a while. ...... 唔!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two coughs interrupted the scene of Xiang Yan. David stood on the cloister and looked at the two men who were kissing and exploring each other's body. They looked a little worried. In fact, both of them are absolutely beautiful, this scene is enough to make anyone bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no traces of these two people. Andre’s hand is still sliding down the princess’s waist. He doesn’t go back to the ground: “My dear brother, is there anything important? If it’s not that important, you’ll have another hour...hours come again. Look for me! Or are you interested in visiting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David has some helplessness, cold and cold: "My dear brother, your strange hobbies, I am in charge No. If you can't do something that you can't do, then the father will punish it, but it's not so easy to pass! You are the only paladin in the family. Don't end up with the most incompetent ones!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre’s action stopped, but then he did not care to say: “Don’t always take my father to pressure me! I have my own heart. If you don’t believe me, don’t let me Do anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hope so!" David threw a cold sentence and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear brother! I heard that Rogge has a woman who is not bad. Can I try it?" Andre is at the background of David. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David’s whole body, the voice said: “If you want to try, I can’t control you. However, your father’s tricks should be good. Think about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria pulled away Andre’s fat-faced face, greasy: "Do you still want to try that chick? Ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre whispered: "I heard that the girl is good, or else, you come together? We can..." The lower. Froya blushes and laughs a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly asked: "You brother doesn't seem to be too close to me. What does Marshal want you to do, make David so nervous?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre’s face suddenly passed a layer of shadow, he was obsessed with the beautiful face of Fu Luoya, long time sighed a little thing, don’t let In my heart. No matter what happens, you must remember that I am the one who loves you the most in the world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Andre smiled for so long, let me see if there is more meat on your body..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, Rogge came to the 'Night Return' hotel. After a period of time, the business of the small hotel was much better. Lilith also hired two girls to entertain and found a chef. Looking at Rogge stepping into the store door, her face was full of happiness and surprise, floating like a butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they entered the backyard, Rogge hugged Lilith from behind, and the girl snorted and shyly whispered: "No. Here, someone will see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger can, no matter how much, one hand savagely explores Lilith's skirt, and puts it inside a few times The pants fell off. He walked up the room while holding the girl, while he was restlessly moving between the girls' legs. As soon as he entered the door, he threw the girl on the bed and then rushed up. Lilys, who had not been fully prepared, snorted and snorted, but she saw Rogge’s gloomy face and a pain in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this time, he often went to the small hotel of Liliths, and occasionally drunk. Lilith struggled to drag his heavy body upstairs every time. However, for her, this half-month is the happiest time of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Elysses secretly visited Rogge twice and pointed out some magic problems. This made Rogge somewhat flattered, and even some of them wanted to get up. When I was down, the fat man quickly inquired about the news of the two artifacts of "The Kingdom of Sin". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'The Kingdom of Sin' I don't know how to look at me like that, I am not omnipotent!" Elyss sits in the small building of Rogge In it, I changed my sitting position. It is a pity that she is not Fu Luoya, Rogge did not see a little spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'The Lost Paradise' is actually in her hands, but it really made me miss it! 'Lost Paradise'... You heard about Knox Fort The legend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded. Two hundred years ago, it was said that an old and sick red dragon carrying all the wealth accumulated in the long years was entrenched in an abandoned castle in the Central Mountain Range. The castle was named the Knox Fort by the adventurers under the name of the Red Dragon. For a time, there are multiple versions of the Knoxron Fort map on the Big Six, each with a different map. The great wealth of the Red Dragon has attracted countless adventurers to explore, but in a decade, most adventurers have gone. The location of the Long Fort declared by a few survivors is also different. Each of them insists that they are the real Dragon Fort. As the years passed, Knoxron suddenly disappeared without a trace, and it has become a mystery in the adventure world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knoxron Fort is actually a paradise," said Elysses calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened his mouth and stayed for a moment, suddenly loudly: "I understand! Lost Paradise is the biggest trap!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses smiled and continued: "At that time, the host of the "lost paradise" was the famous 6th magician Lei. He turned the lost paradise into the shape of Longbao, and then The adventurers seduce them to kill them one by one. Originally, there were only ten people who were qualified to be his opponents at the time of the Grand Six. In the paradise of paradise, he was invincible as the master. Later, the suspicious place of Knoxburg More and more attention has been paid. Finally, the pope at that time led all the high-level holy knights and bright masters of the church to explore this secret. I heard that God also inserted a foot in this matter. But Ray is during this time. The strength is too strong, and he managed to escape with the loss of paradise. At that time, the Pope thought that he could no longer live, and the lost paradise that was continuously hit also lost most of his power, and he would not pursue it. This is the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli Princeton meal to Hierro is not an ordinary good luck, he now actually make this artifact! Little Rogge, discuss it, how do we go to grab the lost paradise? Your reward is the little princess. After I seal her magic, if you want to do something, look at your courage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stunned and asked carefully: "But she has two artifacts in her hand, and there is Andre next to it... this... no It's a good job! He didn't dare to say that Elysses was not an opponent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses suddenly smiled and saw Rogge stunned, his heart ignited I just want to pounce on her feet to confide in her mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The little girl has limited magic, and it is not my opponent to give her more artifacts. You are relieved, how are you, are you interested? "Elysses looked at Rogge with a smile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled bitterly, and he said: "How did you know the secret of Paradise Lost?" of? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what the father told me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's be respected....The former cardinal, no, no, is it the pope?" Rogge began to get nervous again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not, this is recorded in a collection he grabbed from the Church of Light." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge wipes the cold sweat on his head, and wisely no longer asks. Jero only steals the tomb of the pope, the old of Elysses Dad actually robbed the bright church! The things of these big men are still less known.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, Fu Luoya has these two artifacts in hand, dealing with small A small dwarf tribe is not a problem at all. You are very smart, now it is time to understand why the loss is so big. Even if you easily deal with all the dwarves, there is her next to it, I am afraid that the Golden Lion Knight will not come back. We did not think that she would be so unscrupulous. Orphee does not blame you for losing the manpower, but angry that you killed Paulus when it was not suitable. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
