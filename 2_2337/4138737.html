			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old eyes of Tickirk's dim, the rose into the room seems to have a layer of faint smoke, which is extraordinarily mysterious and beautiful. Her slender and beautiful ears make the old man swell and swell, and his heart jumps like he wants to get out of his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man suddenly felt that his whole body was hot, and his gorgeous and graceful dress made his heart troublesome. He stretched his left hand to the collar and thought about loosening it. He suddenly remembered that he would let her give the portrait and put his hand down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief executive of Dagong’s body was very understanding and placed a glass of ice water. Dagong had a drink and it felt better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Lan sat down in front of the canvas, concentrating on debugging the oil paint, and did not look up at the old man in front of him. The elves' keen sense allowed her to capture the rapid breathing and the intense heartbeat. Melanie sighed faintly, is this the Terran? So naked, unobtrusive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the eyes of Mei Lan, the old man tried his best to suppress his own. However, every slight vibration of the elf's ear will make his desire for fire more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf's slender ear has always been the favorite thing for the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame quickly engulfed the last sensibility of the old man. He suddenly dropped his scepter and slammed into the body of Melan. Melanie exclaimed with a sigh of relief, and fell to the ground. The two entangled human bodies rolled over the ground several times, and the old man finally managed to catch the hands of Melan and pressed her firmly under her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss has seen the overall situation, has quietly quit the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears of the orchids flowed down, screaming, drinking, or begging for mercy. But her eyes are clear and there is no emotional fluctuation. She controls her struggles and strengths so that they don't go beyond the frail old age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closed her eyes and felt that the old man couldn’t keep kissing on her face, neck and ears, feeling that the old man had torn open her Clothes and dry hands could not caress her skin; she felt that the old man was so eager to take off his shirt that he was not willing to waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Melanie flashed the faces of all loved ones, and the last one was his own lover. She whispered insignificantly: "Don't, my love..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she felt the weak and weak entry of the old man...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The over-exciting enthusiasm made Tikick lose control almost as soon as he entered. He was not willing to scream, and he began to pour himself in the body of Melan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic symbol on the lower abdomen of the orchids shines slightly, and the powerful curse enters the old man's body bit by bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thicker suddenly felt that the sluice gate had collapsed completely, and the torrents of the road rushed out. In the extreme pleasure, Tikick suddenly felt a sense of uneasiness, the torrent was getting bigger and bigger, and there was no sign of stopping! After the diarrhea, the blood is flowing, and after the blood is exhausted, the last essence of life flows out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clear and mirrored eyes of Meilan, Tikick suddenly saw that his face was rapidly becoming dry, and the sparse white was also in the same place. Ground off. He only felt that breathing was getting harder and harder, and his eyes gradually darkened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he murmured: "Why? Elf...will...so insidious..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Lan will almost become the corpse of the corpse pushed from the body and slowly stood up. A maid came in with a glass of wine and a hot towel. The thoughtful boss knows that Dagong can't last long, and it's time to let the maid come in, so that Dagong can rest and maintain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the horror scene in the room, the maid immediately screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing the exhortation of the maid, the boss took the Wang family guard into the house. He turned over the Grand Duke, who had almost become a corpse, tried to breathe, listened to the heartbeat, screamed, and cried with the body of the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss suddenly jumped up and pulled over the captain of the guard team. He lowered his voice and said: "Dagong is dead! This news must not be revealed. Go and inform His Royal Highness Carlos, Master Rogge, and Hilley! Also, Dagong died strangely, mostly related to this elf, first shut her up and see if I can torture what is coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merran calmly The wolf-like guards dragged themselves out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duchy entered a state of emergency, and all the maids and servants had to stay in the house, not to go out, and to violate the rules. Several guards galloped and galloped all over Dresden to inform the Principality of the Principality and deal with the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bodyguard was riding on a long street, suddenly appeared in front of him a man wearing a black cloak, and the war horse stood up. Almost took him down. The guard pulled out the sabre and screamed: "Give the old man off! Missing the big thing, the old man chopped your whole family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is not panicked, not tight Not slow to ask: "What big thing? Is it to report to the hall of Dan Luo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard was surprised and said unconsciously: "How do you know? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man started the set and smiled: "Of course I know." It is Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This news, I will inform Dan Luo later, you should take a good break!" A black flame suddenly rose under the guard. He and his horse were swallowed up in the flames of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, all the Principalities of the Principality gathered in the dungeons of the Grand Duke. No one has taken care of this damp, messy and horrible environment, and everyone's minds are in the tortured elves in the torture chamber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangfu Guardian fully demonstrated the skills of torture, and in just two hours, Meilan has been tortured. After being awake again by the ice water, she finally weakly said: "I said... The Lord made me cursed... is Daniel's Highness. Let me... hurry to die..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers and nobles looked at each other and finally their eyes fell on Carlos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos grabbed his head in pain and cried, "This can't be true! Big Brother will never do this! She is lying!" Give me a slap in the face! Until she tells the truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guard Captain hurried forward, whispering: "His Royal Highness, can't fight again!" She couldn't stand it anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilley looked at the color, coughed and said slowly: "The evidence is conclusive. I think I will first put down the Royal Highness. Please come over and have a good look at this elf woman. I am afraid...Hid Royal Highness will misunderstand and will not come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of Hilley stood up Go and ask your Royal Highness! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were all the ministers who returned to the Chamber of the Grand Duke, waiting for the arrival of Danro.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon was quiet, and Mei Lan breathed a sigh of relief. A jailer with a flesh and blood came in, ** said: "You are such a beautiful elf, I have never seen it in my life!" Now that the adults have finished asking, you are useless, it’s my turn to be happy! Haha! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jailer's ** is not over yet, and a blood arrow has been marked on the throat and fell to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rogue of a black robe appeared in a ghostly manner after he died. He walked over to Melan and looked at the strong and brave Elf woman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My child, all suffering is over. The nightmare is over and Hilo is waiting for you in front. The elves will always remember everything you do. "Rogue's words are kind and peaceful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is my glory to be able to sacrifice for the elves and God." The glory in the eyes of Melan was dim. Going on...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of the Principality of Ale are waiting anxiously in the Chamber of Deputies. There was a noise in the distance, slowly quieting down again. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness Carlos! When I went to ask Daniel's Highness, he suddenly led the troops to resist! And killed the villain a lot of men... The little man couldn't help himself, and he advised Daniel's good words, saying that His Royal Highness Carlos is not malicious. I just wanted to discuss the aftermath of the Grand Duke with His Royal Highness. But I never expected that after Daniel’s men were taken down by the villain, they actually died...”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no upset in the Chamber of Deputies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?! Big Brother, he actually committed suicide? Did he say anything before he died?" Carlos shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said that he would never want to live a dark life in the dark every day. Since the big event is not successful, death is also a relief. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many arguments in the hall. Except for a very small number of people, these ministers have never thought that this night will have so many things! The Grand Duke and the eldest son of the Ayre Principality It’s not a death in the night, not only in the Principality, but even in the entire Holy Alliance. The people who have held the power for many years have been thinking about the gains and losses of the moment.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of Hilley said again: "His Royal Highness Carlos, when the villain is dealing with the aftermath of Daniel, these two things are present, please pass the eyes." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos looked at him immediately and was furious. The two things that were brought up were a gold seal with the badge of the Principality of Aray and Dan. Luo's name, the other is a black cover magic book. The cover of the magic book depicts the purgatory picture of blood and fire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos took over The magic book was handed over to Rogge: "Master Rogge, your magical magic is unparalleled. Can you see what this evil magic book is for?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge flipped through for a while and said: "There is no doubt that this book records the most insidious evil curse magic. The curse of magic in the Tick Creek Grand Duke is one of the records in this book. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos gnashed his teeth and said: "It seems that things are already obvious!" Big Brother... Luo this bastard in order to compete for the throne, not only wants to assassinate me, he even gave his father a poisoned hand! Although he has committed suicide, one of his accomplices can't let go! Come on! Use my orders to mobilize the Dagong Guards and grab all Dan Luo’s family and men! Also, give the Snow Bear Knights a look at me, first disarm them, wait until the overall situation is settled, and then investigate who is Dan Luo's party! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos successively ordered the order, and his face involuntarily revealed the excitement and cruelty. The ministers in the hall were chilling, but no clear standing card The people on the Los Angeles side are secretly happy in their hearts, and they are not listed on the list of cleaning by Carlos.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of Hilley is leading After a short time, another knight came in and said that all the family members and men of Danro had prepared a potent poison and committed suicide.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos Since the wrath, the aristocrats in the hall are also self-defeating. They never thought that the usual indecisive Carlos was so vicious at the moment of the incident. Anyone who had a relationship with Dan Luo was not prepared to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cleaning is afraid that many people will die.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog glanced at it Hiley, the old state affairs book is the old fritters that slipped into the house. Can you still see it? He immediately stood out and thundered the country for one night. There are two unfortunate things in my heart, but my heart is extremely sad. But now is not the time we are sad. Our Ayre Principality is a small country, and such a big event, to prevent some people from looting. In my opinion, In front of us, we need to temporarily block all news, and let His Royal Highness Carlos inherit the position of the Grand Duke as soon as possible to stabilize the hearts of the people. When all the big news has been decided, then the Holy Alliance countries will be notified. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;[######################################################################################################################## It is already the heir appointed by the Grand Duke. Now Dagong is killed by Dan Luo. His Royal Highness Carlos inherits the position of the Grand Duke! The situation is urgent. I don’t have to wait any longer. I will arrange the succession ceremony of His Highness Carlos tonight. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, no one dares to agree with this proposal. The bloody means that Carlos had just shown made the hearts of the ministers stunned. Dan Luo had just finished the ban, and the big Guamwara died in Rogge’s hands, and the control of the Snow Bear Knight was lost. How can he have strength and motivation to harm the Grand Duke? The people present were all rolling over for many years in the struggle for power. I knew in my heart that the person who really started to work for Dagong must be Carlos. In the midst of killing his father and killing his brother, His Royal Highness had to destroy his brother’s full door, and his mind and the poison of his hands were unexpected. The aristocrats in the field were afraid that Carlos's butcher's knife would point to himself, and the overall situation was fixed, and they all hollowed out the loyalty of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night full of blood and killing finally passed, and a thousand people returned to the Lord's arms forever in this turbulent night. At dawn, the new Grand Duke of the Principality of Ale, Carlos, has sat on the throne that originally belonged to Tikrick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xin Dagong and his group of ministers were all sleepless all night, and their eyes were covered with bloodshot eyes. Carlos sat in this position for the first time, extremely excited and a little uneasy. Looking at the attitude of the group's own attitude, he was respectful and fearful for a moment. He felt happy from the bottom of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Master Rogge is right, as long as he starts with enough, these nobles will obey me! Haha!" Carlos was proud of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn’t know was that the aristocrats who held the power were afraid of his bloody means, but Rogge standing behind him. The great magicians with powerful magic, mysterious Druids and the Elven Guards are by no means comparable to the nobles of these small Principalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day, Carlos issued a series of decrees, the most important of which was to reform the military system and attribute the command of the Snow Bear Knight to Rogge. hand. After the big cleaning last night, there were many vacancies in various key departments. This time, the old state affairs book, Hilley, became the biggest winner. In addition to the original administrative power, the legal department in charge of intelligence and law and order fell into the hands of his faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos consciously arranged this arrangement very well. He has begun to be uncomfortable with Roger’s excessively strong force. Still let him get married soon, and he secretly thought. However, Carlos turned to think that he even killed his father and his eldest brother. It is conceivable how much political marriage can be guaranteed. Fortunately, there is now Hilley in the administrative aspect of the checks and balances of Rogge, and the great magician is also known to be not interested in secular power, which makes Carlos feel relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Hilley quietly handed a report to Carlos. This is a detailed family tree of Danro, which lists all the people who are related to Danro, except for Carlos. But even Auntie and the Three Princes were listed. All the descendants of Dan Luo and the names of the people concerned have already used the Zhu pen to make a heavy fork. Carlos repeatedly looked at it several times, indulged for a moment, and made a mark on several names, making a disgusting gesture to Hilley. Hilary nodded and whispered: "The Grand Duke is assured that the old minister will let them live tomorrow's dawn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the guardian of the elf guardian warrior Next, Rogge also holds a genealogy in his hands. The difference is that this genealogy is much more detailed, listing all the people of the Tickrick family. After one night of cleaning, one third of the names have been marked with a red cross. Rogge watched for a moment, and another secret letter was sent from Hilley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man made a gesture, and the wind butterfly reluctantly opened the secret letter. The content of the letter is surprisingly simple, with only a few names. Wind Butterfly found these names on the Tick Creek genealogy, and hit a shocking red cross with a red pen. She suddenly felt dizzy and almost vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every red cross is a life! In order to add this red cross, I don't know how many people will be involved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Rogge was a little tired. He closed his eyes slightly, and an elf guardian began to gently massage his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly, are you still used to bleeding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogue Master" When the butterfly thought about it, he finally said: "It is necessary to kill so many people. Do you have sacrificed a thousand lives to the plan that you have developed for Carlos? I know that the elves need to survive, they need to be powerful... ....but, must you step on the blood-stained ladder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles, you have made some progress, at least calculate my How many people will be sacrificed in the program. But this is not enough. I need you to do this far. Ok, let me talk about it briefly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Rogge, Ajani hangs the family of the Tikick family on the wall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every elf knows that if there is a fire on the grassland, even if all the grass is burned to ash, in the spring of the next year, the grassland will be green. This is because the fierce grassland fires can't burn the roots of the grass. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge refers to the position of the Grand Duke and his children on the lineage. "This is the grass we can see." Then the fat man waved down and said: "You see, this nearly a thousand names are more or less the blood of the Tikick family." These names are the roots of grass. To clean up the grassland of the Ade Principality, it is necessary to clean these roots. If not, not necessarily when, the short sword of revenge will appear in front of us. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the wind butterfly and the elves became pale. They didn't think of this layer at all. They didn't expect the seemingly rude and rude tricks to hide such a sinister purpose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves are all beautiful and like peace." Rogge's voice is still calm, and the elves' reactions have long been expected. "In order for most elves to maintain their nature and live happily, a small number of elves must sacrifice themselves, break into the darkness, and do things that other elves are unwilling to do. I hope that you will be willing to be such an elf." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s gaze swept through the faces of the six elves, and all the elves, including the wind butterfly, nodded. However, their faces are pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled a little, and with the precedent of Meilan, he lobbied in the name of the elves to say that these elves had sacrificed themselves a lot easier. Of course, this is far from the blind obedience he needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since all of you have such determination, let us continue to talk about the situation in the Principality. You think about it, if you are the aristocrat of the Principality of Are, press The program we have implemented, who do you think is the father of Dagong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves don't like conspiracy, but they are definitely not stupid. An elf warrior replied: "Dan Luo is being blamed, this is too obvious. Melan... Danro's hands will not have elves like Melan. Because God makes the relationship of adults, only Carlos can send The elf is drawn." The more she replied, the more ugly she was. She stood in the perspective of a third party and described the fact that the elf woman was sent as a gift, and she still had some tolerance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Then I will ask you again, if you are in the Principality, will you be willing to be loyal to someone who even dare to kill his father?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are silent, and the wind butterfly is thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled, this smile can't be said in the eyes of the elf: "Carlos has his benefits, has ambitions, and hesitates. Originally, he was at a disadvantage in the battle for the throne. He relied on our strength to sit on the position of the Grand Duke. If he wants to sit still in this position, he still has to rely on us. So, the Grand Duke Carlos still masters. In our hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rugton had a meal and said: "He killed so many people, making the Principality self-defeating, in fact ** The throne underneath is not very stable. In order to stabilize this position, he has to rely on more bloody means to suppress the rebels, even the possible rebels." Say, Rogge reached out to the prince's pedigree, slowing down Slowly circle all the names associated with the Three Princes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Ruling a country, bloody means can only be a moment, can not be long-term. If he is not obedient in the future, and even want to turn against us, we clean up He is much easier. At least no one will stand up and defend a tyrant with hands full of blood of his relatives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All names on the Carlos lineage They are also painted in red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, at a glance, the entire pedigree family’s pedigree is only a few of the aunts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said in a word: "We came to the Principality of Are, not to be good people. Our goal is to eradicate the Tikick family and seize The entire Ayre Principality. Helping Carlos or anyone else is a means to achieve this. You are very smart and hope for the future of the elves. Today, everything I will tell you, you must remember well. Maybe it won't take long for you to go out and fight alone. By that time, I don't want the unique nature of the Elf to influence you to make a correct judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly suddenly asked: "If you want to occupy the Ayre Principality, our Elf army can do it. Why is it so complicated? The sacrifice of the orchid is completely unnecessary, assassination of Tikick For me, it’s not very difficult!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s glanced eyes, laughing: “Wind butterfly, you are finally willing to use your brain I think about it. It’s easy to win the Principality of Aray, but Our eyes can't be confined to such a small piece of land as the Principality of Are. The reaction of more than a dozen countries of the Holy Alliance is something we must consider. Maybe in just a few days, the Elven army can occupy the whole territory of the Principality, but only ten In a few days, the Allied forces of the Holy Alliance will drive the Elves back to the mountains. If the Elves want to merge with the Terran into a human society, there must be a high-ranking order from the top down. For example, Tikick Dagong ordered that we can move freely in the Principality of Are. So this high person, if not me, must be under our control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
