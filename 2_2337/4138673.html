			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small police chief’s report has had an unexpected effect, driven by some people’s intentional or unintentional promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report’s rapporteurs are slightly whispered, but the reported incidents are quite different. The large-scale mercenary groups in neighboring countries are tolerant of their wanted criminals, no matter what they are doing, This conspiracy must be very simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conspiracy must not be simple! After observing the report, the obese Regional Police Director slammed the table and made a loud announcement.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary next to him handed another document. He whispered: "Adults, this conspiracy is not a trivial matter. This report of the report can be carefully scrutinized." With this great credit, I have to put the chief of the Provincial Police Department and the Minister of the Law and Politics in the forefront. Although you only have a second time for adults, you will definitely benefit from your future career. This is a new report by the villain. You have passed the goal. By the way, adults, this matter is extraordinary. The villain wants to leave for the town tomorrow to inquire carefully and see if this is true or false. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian took the report, the more he saw the more dancing, he couldn’t help but slammed the table and wrote it well! Hahahaha! You will leave for the town tomorrow to see if there is such a thing!””<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the report went to the Provincial Police Department. The head of the office and the head of the Faculty of Justice are on the desk. The content of the report has also changed. It is about the premeditated battles of the mercenaries in the alliance, which led to the rebellion in the alliance, the confession of the alliance, the murder of Qiwei, and the cover of the business travel. Fortunately, the chief of the police department and the head of the law and government are far-sighted. They have early insight into the conspiracy and pre-wired the network. The Regional Police Commissioner took the lead and fought bravely to kill the enemy, killing more than a dozen mercenaries and injuring the enemy mercenary captain. However, due to the disparity in the strength of the enemy and the enemy, the mastermind Doyle and Qiwei’s husband and wife escaped and are now fully chasing. The town sheriff assisted from the side and also contributed. The report was detailed and the test was conclusive. The two adults did not pay much attention to the revision. They only added a zero after killing the mercenary and submitted it to the report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen days, after the police and the Ministry of Justice, the report finally came to the table of the two ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty days later, the report was placed on the desk of Russell’s Grand Duke. Russell Russell frowned and pondered for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Rogge did not know this, and he did not know that he was immersed in the joy of returning home. For him, it doesn't matter if the water is late for some late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of returning home, naturally can not go back empty-handed, Rogge bought a lot of wind chicken, wax duck, roast suckling pig in a town nearest to home The annual items of the class, bought a large bucket of locally produced pine nuts brandy, hired a big car, ordered four knights to go home first, Rogge’s own professional work, and in the weapons store, magic equipment store, art Shopping in a circle like nothing, nothing, so slowly into the home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much distance from the town, there is a small road to the south from the boulevard. Going along this path for ten miles, I went to the territory of the Rivers family. On both sides of the path are lush sycamore trees, but it seems a bit cold in this winter. This land is barren red soil, except for some fruit trees, the yield of other crops is not high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter noon time is a good time for residents in the territory to enter the big towns, but now there is no one on the road. Rogge frowned, urging the horse under the seat and stepping forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few miles away, I saw a group of people in front of noisy people, among which a few knights were gorgeous, this is not their own 'Dragon and Beauty' knight? Could it be that the territory of your family has rioted? As soon as he thought of the word "riot", Rogge immediately mentioned the tomahawk and urged the horse to rush. The knights who followed followed, all of them put down their helmets, pointed at the front of the axe, and sprinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four encircled "Dragon and Beauty" knights held the truck in the center, the axe gun pointed straight into the sky, the left hand showed the handcuffs, aligned The crowd surrounded by. There are twenty-five soldiers dressed around, four or five guys who look like knights, plus a small figure. The reason why ‘like a knight’ is said is that even in the eyes of ordinary people, the equipment of these guys is too ruined. Although the breastplate looks sparkling, but the two nails on the leather armor are thought to be the knight's breastplate? The strength is bigger, and the root stick is also worn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge smiled and beat the horse for a few laps. He drank: "I am the only son of the Rivers family, Rogge! You are going to smash the people, how about the Baron Rivers! Not to surrender, do you want to be old? I can't peel your skin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That little sneak, rushing to the front of the adult, is a misunderstanding! It is a misunderstanding! The villain is the tax collector of the Rivers family, these are the guards and warriors of the Rivers family! Rogge has never returned to his hometown for many years. They don't know your subordinates, so they are a little misunderstood! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I am stupid? ! Rogge was furious: "I have a few sons in my old man. How many people are there in this small place? How much tax do I know?" ! Can you afford so many knights and warriors? Fuck you ***, this level is also called the knight and the warrior! Is it a rogue to become a knight? Is this rogue genius behind me, how long did it take to become a knight? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, a previously encircled ‘Dragon and Beauty’ knight came up and whispered: “Adults, they seem to be taxing!” It is said that we have not paid 60% of the entry tax for this car. It is smuggling and we have to confiscate it. The small stop did not let the cart, they called these people want to take us. The villain thinks that this is the land of the father of the grown-up, and he does not dare to be too embarrassed, but he does not dare to make a life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge heard 'not dare to be too embarrassed', looking across the side, and I saw several people with a bruised face and a swollen body, but the injury was not interrupted. A few bones, it is really not too embarrassing to start. As for the internal injuries, the eyes are still not visible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge calmly asks: 655% of the entry tax Who is it? How long has it been implemented?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little swearing: “Roger, this tax has been in practice for more than a year, and the little people are light. The tax is determined by the people, the villain does not know." At this time, the guards of the Rivers family had a drum rush to rule the knight! George Knight is here! This time I want you to teach the history of the George Knight! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the hoof in the distance, a knight of the silver armor of the white horse, like a wind, far away: "Who dares to be in the Rivers family?" The territory is messed up! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is so angry that he is the only son of Rivers, and he has been repeatedly asked in his own territory. What is the world? Rogge has no outstanding appearance, body and magic. When he was in the School of Magic, he was defeated by many girls, so the most hated is the handsome knight. After all, the magician is outstanding and his age is not small. This is a direct threat. At this moment, George is dressed up and arrogant, and is guilty of Rogge's taboo.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George rushed to the 30 meters, still It has not been reduced, and the front of the rifle is the standard knight's fighting stance. Rogge's heart is an idiot, and the object also includes the Baron Old Rivers. How to find such a bunch of waste to protect the territory is purely insufficient. Naturally, Rogge is not prepared to let this George go, and this George's rank is estimated. A spiritual shock has passed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp George was originally sprinting, and it is expected to be reduced at ten meters. The man turned to the end of the week and let the subordinates look at the skills of the real knight. He was intoxicated, suddenly felt a heavy hammer on the helmet, the Venus in front of the eyes shine, the whole person flew from the sky and ploped Heavy fell to the ground, two nosebleeds sprayed out of the helmet's fence. The rifle turned two laps in the air, and straight into his chest, everyone exclaimed!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the George Knight is going to die on the spot inexplicably, the rifle suddenly misses and is placed close to the body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge Axe waved, the evil opponent said: "Give me the dismembered armies, fuck him, someone will dare to resist, you will be when I am not here!" Laozi still can't manage these slaves? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rivers family guards suddenly fell to the back of the hope of the mountain, and Rogge claimed to be the only son of Rivers, plus these people I am used to being blessed, but they are also some people who are bullying and fearful. They encounter a wolf-like dragon and beauty knight and never dare to resist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly remembered something, watching George struggle to climb from the ground, his spirits moving gently, and opened the mask of his helmet. Roghaha smiled to be George Cousin! You are not a trainee knight in the Knights of the Kings. How did you suddenly condescend to run this small place as a guardian knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commanded a knight to put George, who is still unclear, on the horse, Rogge picked up a seemingly fierce guard, the 'Knight', who was with him and went to the house first. All the way, Rogge casually asked: "Is it okay in this year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My uncle Brown is good? Are you still used to staying here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Knight' replied: "Brown adults like it very much... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger turned to look at him and smiled: "Fuck you, what are you going to marry me? Looks like you too Know who I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Knight' heard, turned from respectful to arrogant, and snorted: "Rogge, we have been Follow Brother Brown's dear! Although this time George is not careful, but you must know that his brother Blanc is more brilliant! The villain advises you to keep your hands careful!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart is very angry, and the smile on his face is more joyful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of Robsky heard the conversation between the two, and made up his mind if there was a conflict, the first one would rush up, hey, this beat the countryside The opportunity of a dog and a big loyalty, which is there casually? Although Robsky is timid, these escort qualities are actually somewhat inferior to those of the thieves who used to be. Thinking of this, Robertsky couldn't help but regret it. I knew that I would give it to some great aristocrats. The days should be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This big brother!" Rogge changed his name to the singer, and he was used. "The younger brother is a little fat, and the axe is heavy. The trouble big brother helped me." Say the soul's flat to the 'Knight'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Knight' slammed out a hand and caught the soul, and said in his mouth: "Rogue adults, knights are subject to long-term rigorous training. In order to be competent! For example, I...唉哟!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has released his hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three hundred kilograms of 'dead' suddenly fell, this pressure is so heavy, immediately pressed the 'Knight' left hand elbow off. The ‘Bound of the Soul’ did not slow down, and then slammed on the horse. What kind of horses can there be in such a small place? The horse screamed, his legs were soft, and he fell to the ground, pressing the ‘Knight’ below. 'Broken Soul' still does not give up, followed by falling on the 'Knight' on one of the laps, only to hear the 'click' sound, the 'Knight''s thigh bone has been smashed, 'At this moment, there is a scream, two The eyes turned and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky was pale and hurriedly jumped out of Malay, trotting a few steps, rushing to pick up the ‘Bound Soul’. He is not known for his strength. Although the weight of more than three hundred kilograms is not enough for a seven-level fighter, he is also blushing with a thick neck. He tried to lift the ‘Bounded Soul’ over his head, and Rogge gave it up and hung it behind him, and Robertsky spit out a sigh of relief. Seeing that this Tomahawk is quite delicate and delicate, how can it be so heavy? I think that Rogge’s hand is swaying on weekdays. It seems that there is no weight. Robsky is more and more chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at this time, Rogge looked at it with a deep sense, and Robsky felt that this eyes seemed to be in his own soul, his teeth fighting, a * * Sitting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and turned to drive the horse. Robsky rushed to the horse and followed. The two men ignored the fainting knight and went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward to the only town in the Rivers family territory, the Rivers home is located on a small hill outside the town. The Rivers family home is a white, two-story Georgian building that has been in existence for more than three hundred years. The white lattice windows, the quaint and large foyer, and the neatly trimmed lawn in front of the building have always been Rogge’s favorite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men stepped into the town slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibrant town in Rogge’s memory has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole town is dark, messy, and dilapidated. The townspeople were blue-eyed and staring at Rogge and Robersky. Rogge’s hand was holding the reins, and the knuckles were somewhat white because of too much effort. The fine leather horses were squatting under his hands, twisted, and the cracks of the road spread quietly. Rogge didn't know it, just wanted to find out where he was familiar in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silently stopped in front of a second floor red brick building. The small building has been run down, the oak door is tightly closed, and the red paint on the top has been smashed by seven or eighty-eight. A copper metal bracket is nailed to the door, which has been rusted in the wind and rain. The cold wind blew, and the copper rings that were still hung on it rang out, and the signboard that was supposed to hang on the copper ring had disappeared. Rogge rolled over and gently stroked the oak door and whispered to Robsky: "This is the only pub in the town. I liked it when I was five, and left home until I was fifteen. This has always been the place I am most willing to come." Smart, like Robsky, naturally knows that it is not appropriate to talk at this time, just sigh with a long sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the small central square, there is a two-story building with some years and months. Several guards 'Knights' are carrying a girl with hands tied, and one person is drinking against an old man: "Give you three days! You still can't get taxes, it's really confused!" If it wasn't for Mr. Blanc, who had seen your granddaughter, I would have hung you in the square! Mr. Blanke let go of the words, when will the town hand over the tax, and when will you come to lead your granddaughter home!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual smile on Rogge’s face has disappeared. The horse was parked 15 meters away and waved to Robsky. Robsky had been waiting for this opportunity of allegiance. He immediately plucked the sword and rushed on it. He shouted: "Give me a hand! I want to catch people and ask us about Rogge!" Guardian 'Knights' A glimpse, see Robersky clothing ordinary (have not had time to put on the 'Dragon and Beauty' Cavalier equipment), but the Rogge armor on the side is sharp, riding a god, like a big man, it is a little more careful, If you don't come up, start playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocksky shouted on his mouth, but the sword was not idle, brushing two swords, two guards in the wrist of the wrist, the weapon landing. Robsky also smothered the throat of the knight who captured the girl. The man was so scared that he was squirting and squirting. Robsky took a light stroke on the horse with a sword. The horse carried the girl and ran to Rogge. When the girl was seventeen or eight years old, a golden shawl dissipated, such as a golden waterfall hanging over her shoulder, and the worn clothes on her body could not cover the youthful atmosphere. The girl's skin is crystal clear, the delicate little nose is constantly screaming, and the pair of blue eyes are full of tears, such as a helpless lamb in the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the girl carefully and suddenly called: "You are Lilith!" The girl tried to recognize it for a long time through her tearful eyes, still did not recognize it. . Rogge smashed the twine that tied the girl and smiled. "I am Rogge, are you forgetting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl called Up, obviously remembered, and looked at Rogge with doubts: "How do you wear this look like a good man?" With Roger's thick skin, he couldn't help but be red. When Rogge left home, Lilith was only ten years old. Since her childhood, Rogge has never done anything like licking her nephew and marrying her skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Robsky was attacking the ‘Knight’, and the rest of the guards’ ‘Knight’ had fallen to the ground and looked down. Rogge’s eyes have already seen that these people have not hurt the key, just pretend to die. When it comes to pretending to be dead, it is also a common trick for the Knights of the Dragon and the Beauty. However, the ‘Dragon and the Beauty’ knights are pretending to be behind the sneak attack. These ‘Knights’ are dead, just want to avoid the disaster. Although they are all dead and the realm is high, they must not be confused. That is the Cavaliers still have two sons, actually held up these times, set up seven or eight swords, still not down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was impatient, raised his hand and drew a magic symbol in the air, and the symbol flashed, and a flash of lightning suddenly popped out, kneeling in the 'knight' Body. This is just an ordinary low-order lightning magic. It is only used by the more and more Rogge who uses the comprehension of mental power. The standard is very different, and it is right on the head of the knight. The knight was originally wearing a leather helmet, just for the prestige, and nailed a few shiny rivets. At this moment, a smoky smog came out under the helmet. The knight sat straight and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge remembered the old man who fell to the ground, and helped him to look up, and it was the old mayor he knew. The old man also recognized Rogge, and he couldn’t speak for a while. I haven't seen it for five years, but the old man seems to be more than ten years old. Rogge and Lilith took the old man to the house and fed the old man a few mouthfuls of water. The old man calmed down and slowly revealed the truth of all this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year and a half ago, the old brother of Old Rivers suddenly came with two sons, Blanc and George. Brown was also a captain, and barely crossed the threshold of the nobility. I don't know why, the old Rivers listened to this Brown brother, and a year ago, he gave the power of the management of the territory to Brown and his son. Since then, Brown and his son have brought more than 30 followers on the grounds of protection and safety. In order to support these ‘Knights’ Foss’s expenses have soared. Later, Brown first announced the increase of the income tax rate in the territory, and levied a 'safety tax'. Later, various kinds of tax categories of various names were emerged in an endless stream. In the end, each household was almost ten taxes and nine, and still could not satisfy the greed of the fathers and sons of Brown. The townspeople had petitioned the old Rivers, but the old Rivers ignored them, and they were all handled by Brown. The result was that the shackles of several townspeople were hanged in the square to show the crowd. If it were not for human life, I was afraid that Brown would keep them hanging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of the sadness, Lilith kept sobbing on the side, and Roger’s face was faintly visible. Seeing that the spirit of the old man is gradually getting worse, Rogge told Lilith to take care of his grandfather. Other things don't have to worry anymore. Seeing that the old man had been on the wall, he also told Robsky to leave the bacon bread that he had used for dry food before he left the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
