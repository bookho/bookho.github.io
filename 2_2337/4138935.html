Miro paced in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness is likely to arrive at any time, so Miro, you better put a tribute in front of your name, otherwise you will be in trouble." Novo and Hart reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! What kind of trouble? Do I be afraid of her?" Miro was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also true. Although your strength is worse than your Royal Highness, the difference is very limited. If you fight with your Highness, you may not lose. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nord Hart’s voice has not fallen, a strange, with a hoarse sexy voice suddenly sounded in the courtyard: "But if I am with If he fights a battle, no matter who wins or loses, the father will send her over. It seems that the respected Miro is very eager to work with her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sound reverberates in the courtyard, but both Miro and Nordhad know that the master of the sound is still far away. They know that she has always been cautious. In such a strong city, she will certainly not risk using instant movements, and will only walk step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, the courtyard door opened silently, and a black woman came in. It’s just the moment when the courtyard door opens. Not only is the door bolt made of fine iron instantly turned into a group of fluffy rust, but even the many magical alarms and traps that Miro and Nordhad set on the courtyard door follow this black. The woman’s push is a cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro’s face changed, and he lost again in the indirect battlefield of the courtyard. However, after Miro went to the ground, it was not a magic route. He is only practicing some magic that can enhance his talent, so losing to a magical opponent in a magic trap is not a shameful thing. It’s just that he was a little surprised when he thought about the consequences of the decisive battle with Adrienne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, no one except the devil is willing to go too close to that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Holy Your Excellency Adrienne, you are finally here." Miro's face was faint, and his expression changed several times. Finally, I greet the woman in black with the etiquette of the devil standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman said faintly: "Respecting Miro, I am very happy that you have finally recovered your senses and calmness. If we can accomplish the task, then for us. Both are good. Although we hate each other since we were young, I hope that this time we can cooperate well for the common good. 'The poet of the blood, 'Miro, you are not the most understanding of the word of cooperation in the devil world. "People?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is once again facing the enemy of life, Miro has returned to absolute calm, this is before he will face the enemy Calm. He gave it gracefully, saying: "Respectfully, His Excellency Adrienne. You can rest assured that I will definitely focus on the interests of my family. The courtyard is not the place to discuss major events. I think we will still talk in the living room. It's better. The black tea in this plane is worth a try, and the Fenglan black tea produced in the north is the best black tea. I think you will like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; It can be seen that the original local owner of this courtyard wanted to decorate the small living room with a retro style, but unfortunately, the financial resources were insufficient, and many details were revealed. The choice of accessories, paintings and sculptures is also very general. However, between the rushes, Miro will not be able to take care of this. And Adrian, Miro and Noord Hart know that her requirements for the living environment are simple. Whether it is the gorgeous floating city of the most brilliant period of the elves, or the rancid swamp of the dark dragons, it is the same for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Adrienne has taken off her black robes. Her long gray hair fell like a waterfall. There is a pearl-like luster on the top, which makes it mean that the death and the ruined gray have become so vibrant. If you see her hair, it will make people realize that the original gray can also be such a beautiful color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the black cloak, Adrienne is a regular black dress with no extra decoration. It is just a tailoring fit. Indeed, every curve on Adrienne is so perfect and tempting. To express her beauty is just the curves themselves. It is enough. Why do you need other modifications? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just strange that, as a controller, Adrienne doesn’t have any magical accessories. And she sat quietly there, exactly the same as an ordinary humanoid woman, and she couldn't feel some micro-magic fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so perfect, and the arrogance that is faintly revealed in the momentum is just right, not irritating, but only makes people think, Such a woman should be so cold and proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should be so beautiful, Li will not be at least for any woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't look at her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Adelaide has grown up with such a normal face! Her eyes, nose, lips and eyebrows are all good, but it is only there. They are placed together, but there is nothing to add to each other. Careful evaluation of Adelaide's appearance will not be able to find out what shortcomings she has, but it is impossible to find out where the light shines or the heart is moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either a kind person or a mean person, after seeing her face, there is only one evaluation, an ordinary girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference in Ade Renee’s face is that her eyes are different in color, one is light blue and the other is light gold. This adds a little bit of glamour to her plain face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two cups of black tea, after a round of dessert, Nordhurt has briefly described the situation in the whole north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne said faintly: "I already understand. Dear Mr. Miro, you are good at strategy, now must have a plan? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro nodded: "Yes, the plan is already there. I think that our own strength alone is not enough, and my family is in this position." The reputation of the face is extremely poor, and it cannot be acted on in a blatant manner. So we need to find someone who can be used. The candidate already has it. He is the prince of the Asrofic Empire, Rogge."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelene asked: "Wait a minute, my family has not been active in this plane for a long time, why is the reputation very bad?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro thought for a moment and said: "Maybe it is the reason why the tradition of my family is too different from this plane. We only respect the strong, and always use and enslave the weak. And think It’s natural for them to fight or kill. Words such as dignity, integrity and cooperation are all The slang is between the strong. In this plane, each race tends to value something called morality, and morality is the protection of the weak. Even though these morals are initiated or advocated, they think and actually It is often done to oppress and enslave the weak, and to teach the weak to resist their rule. But at least, they publicly claim to put the interests of the weak in the first place, and everything they do is For their good. And my family? Some pioneers of my family have been practicing this plane in the tradition of the devil world for thousands of years. This is the problem. You can enslave the weak. You can deceive the weak, you can even Do what you want to do for them, but you must not say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hypothesis." Adelaide said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, in the name of justice, doing evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s really complicated. Well, since you know this plane so well, say your plan. See what I should do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro sinks Looking at Ade Renee's strange eyes. With a feeling of indifference and ignorance: "The exchange of interests is the eternal theme of all planes. It is no exception here. If Rogge supports us, he must give him enough benefits. He is greedy, lustful and shameless. It is very difficult for people to pull and control, but he is not old-fashioned, so we do have a chance to win over him. But his power and wealth are enough. In terms of magic, he is practicing the dark and the top of the dead. Magic, we can't get enough temptations. So the only breakthrough is the female color."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Adelaide Blue and Gold Next, Miro took a deep breath, and the black flame of life could not flow from his body. These magic flames give people a very strange feeling. The temperature of the magical flames is much higher than the ordinary fire of the earth, and many attributes are attached. But the flame on Miro turned out to be cold! This icy magical flame slowly condensed and turned into a purple and black two-color armor. As soon as the armor was formed, Miro slowly rose into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only by the manipulation of power. Miro is already enough to disdain the ordinary sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne is still sitting calmly, just looking at Miro in a faint gaze, not seeing any signs of her preparation for magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro stares at Adrienne’s eyes, literally: “I am going to give you a gift, give it to Rogge, and exchange him back. A woman who is in love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adeleney suddenly flicked a glimmer of light, and Miro’s armor immediately twitched the faint inch of Xu Bingyan. The faint pressure brought by his sudden increase in power caused the ornaments in the living room to be shattered. Only the surroundings of Noord Hart were gone, and even the chairs under the seat of Adrien were suddenly broken into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But nothing happened, and the terrorist attacks that Miro expected did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aide Renee slowly stood up and suddenly smiled and said: "How do you look at this face, you don't know. Miro, You don't want to insult me ​​intentionally? Do you want to fight with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro shook his head and solemnly said:" The true charm of a woman is not in appearance. It must be admitted that Rogge is a very intelligent person, and he will definitely see the extraordinaryness of His Highness. And this plan seems to be very difficult. After all, there are several beautiful women around him. But I think this is the safest way. How can the women around him compare with your Highness? And, most importantly, the cold person of Rogge must be different when he is emotional. I once abandoned everything for Princess Elysses, exiled to the North, and was enemies with the Church of Light until today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne has been lowered My eyes suddenly opened, staring at Miro in the air, and asked: "Elysses?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specific."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to my investigation and observation. The dark spells used by Rogge are the imperial curse of the royal family, and the curse of Princess Elysian specializes in practice. He just does not know because For what reason, he has recently lost his magic power and is now in a recovery period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne’s eyes hang down slowly, saying: "Elysian Didn't teach the magic that he is best at, this man named Rogge? In addition, what did she promise to give him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" His Royal Highness, in fact, Princess Elysses had never promised to give him anything. The princess has been openly lover. It is the Orpheco, who is known as the Golden Lion. I think you must know what character Orpheq is."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne raised her hands slowly and caged her chest. The gray hair began to have no wind and automatic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The story of Elysses in this plane has long been widely known in the devil world." She was indifferent. "But I think that on this strange battlefield, you have almost no chance of victory. Force is enough." Milo said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne slowly looked up, her eyes have penetrated countless planes. In the depths of the endless void. The beautiful woman who had been burning the black flames of the demon world was standing there, and seemed to be staring at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In any battlefield, I will win." Adrianne said with no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro grew a sigh of relief, landed on the ground, and put away the armor of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just landed, suddenly found that I don’t know when, Adelaide was already staring at him. Her blue eyes are like morning stars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro is stunned, no longer dare to move. At this moment he has just recovered his strength. It has been too late to get enough defense power in Adrienne's attack and body. He couldn't help but regret deeply, and should not relax his vigilance so early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miro, in addition to my great cause, your real purpose is actually the woman you want to change back? In the name of justice, Do sinful things. Is this your experience in this position?" The brilliance of Adelaide Blue is flickering, and every time the gloss changes, it will bring a slight jump to the heart of Miro. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
