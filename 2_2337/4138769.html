Charlie said disdainfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at Marcus City Defense and asked: "Look, how long can we take it down? How much will it cost?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With you and Princess Froya, it is very easy to open the gate. Although our number is not much more than the other, but give me half a day, I can Conquering this city! Loss... It should be between two hundred and three hundred people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled a little bit. At least half of the three thousand rebellious parties in the city are the embers of the Goshawk and the vulture country, and we can make things easier! Come, go and call the city, I will give them half a day. If surrendered, then the rebel party in the country of the snowy country will not pursue it, and only the foreign rebel party will be executed. If you dare to resist, then after the city breaks, I will kill the city! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several commanders who rushed to the city of Makur. They shouted in unison and repeated the words of Rogge. There was a riot on the city. After a short time, several mighty fighters in the city suddenly shouted, and several arrows were shot, and the soldiers were shot on the spot. The rest of the commanders fled back in a hurry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger frowned, said to Froya: "Give them a powerful look! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little demon licks his mouth and reluctantly recites the spell. After a short time, a fireball flies to the city. Then there were two fireballs flying over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Marcus was shouting, and the soldiers were shooting arrows at the fireball, but Fu Luoya’s Fireball is so easy to deal with? Even after receiving dozens of arrows, it slammed away. But the latter two fireballs can't be too late to shoot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; A flame wave plowed the head of the city of Makur, and a scream was heard on the door. Several firemen jumped from the city to the ground, and the screams still did not stop.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the soldiers who escaped from the fire wave have just come out from the hiding place, and desperately, the second wave of two fireballs flew to the wall again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams are ringing again, this time there are dozens of firemen falling from the city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Once a magical blow is surprising There is no magician in the rebel army. How can a few magic apprentices be able to confront the magic of Froya? The little goblin is the best magical equipment, and the magic is too fast; her magic is high. The power of fireballs released from her hands is far less than that of ordinary magicians.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this magical blow is surprisingly good. Rogge immediately ordered the army to retreat. After the 500 meters, rest in place, wait for the afternoon to attack the city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the final time limit given by Rogge, the rebellion in the city of Makur The party’s quarrels are getting more and more fierce. The soldiers from the other two principalities in the highlands are all dead, and naturally they advocate a deadly battle. But the people who are the original city of Makur are hesitant. Although they all know that this is Rogge’s provocation. The intrigue of the infighting, but after experiencing the baptism of Froya's horror magic, they no longer think that they can hold Marcus.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makull is small, But it is impossible for Rogge’s three thousand people to be encircled. The main force is placed outside a city gate, and the rest of the gates are only monitored by a small number of riders. Once the rebel party defeats and begins to flee, then Charlie's Spartan knight and the moon's dark-faced elf shooter are chasing, waiting for rebellion. The party will be a one-sided slaughter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, time has passed at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makull burst into a while, the gate suddenly opened and dozens of people rushed out. However, the city gate was immediately closed, and the city’s head was shot down, and dozens of people who had defected were nailed to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infantry outside the city stood up and the Cavaliers also stepped onto the horse. In the melodious military sound, Rogge’s army slowly pushed forward, this time it continued to advance to the next 300 meters before the city stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has reached the edge of the city's archers. A slamming order rang over the city, and dozens of arrows shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, dozens of archers on the city's head have been planted. For a time, no one dared to show up in the city of Makur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparse arrows that were shot in the city were stopped by the Spartan knights with a giant shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ordered again, two huge earth elements staggered and stood up, after blessing the stone skin, adding blessings, they quickly Rushing to the gate, huge fists fell heavily! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makul's one-foot-thick, out-of-the-box metal gate couldn't stand the hit of this behemoth, and it was distorted only a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Marcus was immediately panicked and the dog flew. Under the suppression of the dark bow of the moon, the defenders on the head of the city couldn't take the head, and they could not pose any threat to Rogge's army, but couldn't help the two huge earth elements that were in the middle of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roger, the rebels will soon abandon the city and flee. I will take the team around the city to kill it now!" Charlie said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving Rogge’s approval, Charlie led seventy Spartan knights and two hundred months of darkness from the flank, to Makur City. After the package was copied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud bang in the rumble, and the city gate of Marcus was finally overwhelmed by the heavy punches of the earth, and it fell down, and it also killed dozens of behind the door. A soldier who is desperately supported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved his hand and re-entered the infantry. The light infantry guarded the two wings and rushed to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's several fireballs accurately crossed the two earth elements squeezed at the gate of the city, blasting in the city, several fire waves behind the gates Cleared out a vacant lot of a dozen meters. The soil elements of the two wounded were also affected, and finally fell to the ground and turned into a pile of mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the well-equipped Ayre Principal Heavy Infantry, street fighting has become a nightmare for the rebels. Especially under the leadership of the martial arts high-powered Androni and the elf guardian warrior, all the traps and ambushes of the rebels lost their role. Rogge sat downright and centered on the command. He finally realized the ambition of strategizing and not only moving his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate on the other side of Marcus City suddenly opened, and nearly a thousand rebel troops came out and fled to the mountains. However, at this time, the iron ride led by Charlie had passed around the city and chased the rebel squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deserters saw fewer Charlie, did not care, the whole army turned around and tried to eat the more than 200 cavalry. But Charlie didn't fight hard with them, and the exquisite riding always traveled 100 meters away from the enemy. The dark side killer of the moon and the archers immediately showed their interest in the blink of an eye. The first wave of arrows has passed, and dozens of rebels have been shot down. Even the knights who are close to each other are all picked up by Ma Li, the Cavaliers of Charlie. Among the seventy people of the Spartan Knights, there are thirty original gold lion knights. Which one will look at these ugly people? Under the fierce attack of their guns, there is basically no enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More deadly, Rafael is also in this team. The bow of the Elf King in his hand flashed, and a rebel would fall down in one arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes of short-lived fighting, for the rebels, as long as hours, they finally couldn’t bear the blow, shouted and began to distract Escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie sneered, and the army chased it down. At this moment, the whole country of the country is in control. If he does not rush to kill, he is too sorry for these rebel parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat in the head of Marcus, listening to the battle report with his eyes open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the war is extremely fast, except for Charlie’s casualties, this time the siege only killed 90 people and seriously injured 60 people. However, Charlie is led by the most elite knights. It is hard to say whether there is a war or death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the rebels, a total of more than 600 people were killed and 1,000 people were captured. More than 900 people fled from the other side of the city and should be being intercepted by Charlie. The rebels captured at the moment were forced to sit on the ground and become a ***. The infantry of the Ayre Principality took the edge and watched them. Not far from the captured rebels, there are piles of bodies of war dead rebellious parties. Hundreds of bodies seem to be few, but they are piled together, just like a hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred heavy infantrymen armed with giant shield axe, firmly blocked the broken city gate. The road for the citizens to return to the city was completely blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the city are concentrated on Rogge’s body, concentrated on this great magician who has already been famous in the Holy Alliance, focusing on this can control their lives. Kill the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time facing such a scene, Rogge had a hint of tension, and the five fingers that grabbed the armrests of the chair could not help but use it. There was a cold and soft feeling on his hand. He turned his head and saw that Froya was smiling and quietly holding his hand. Her voice is very low, so low that only Rogge can hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s no big deal to kill some people. It will definitely be nervous for the first time, don't be afraid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge calmed down, and once again reviewed the similar scenes in "The Book of Powers" in his heart, slowly stood up and went to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment it is near dusk, the evening sun, the cold wind, the dead trees, it seems extremely sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McCur's citizens, I think you should recognize me now, or you should admit that I am recognized. I am Rogge. It is Lake. The province is also the new owner of the country of the original snowy. I know that many of you do not admit it, maybe most people refuse to admit it. But whether you admit it or not, this is already a fact. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the effect of the magic of the sound, Rogge’s low and majestic voice could not reverberate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name "Marcur has recently been mentioned in the Parliament of the Holy Alliance. I don't know if you are lucky or unfortunate, you have become the high country of the Three Kingdoms. The base of the country, the base camp of the rebels. There are even a few Principalities that have given you a lot of support in public or in the back! Unfortunately, your power is not as strong as you think, I know that you already have Three thousand warriors, so I only brought three thousand soldiers to come here. You have already seen the results of the war, you, I am very disappointed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As your new master, I am not cruel, but not generous. Under my rule, if you yell because of the child's hunger, I will forgive you and bring bread to you; if you are affected by your wife I will forgive you and bring you clothes when you are frozen and marching. But you have rebelled because of the rights of the old princes and killed my loyal warriors. Can I forgive you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s voice is calm, but everyone who listens feels chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the rebel party, I never need to be captured!" Rogge's voice is so sullen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf archers appeared on the wall, and rows of sharp arrows fell like rain, falling into the rebel prisoners! The captives jumped up and cried and tried to escape, but how could they rush through the well-equipped Ayre Principal Infantry with their bare hands and their hands tied? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They escaped from the arrow rain of the elves, and they did not escape the axe of the Aley Infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of Marcus are agitated, and hundreds of people of all ages cry and rush to the rebel prisoners. Obviously there are their loved ones in the captives. <br /><br />####################################################################################################### Rushed over the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer who presided over the blockade changed his face and looked up at the city, just in time to meet Rogge’s cold eyes. He immediately grabbed a spear of a soldier nearby and threw it out. In a twinkling of an eye, a teenage boy rushing to the front was nailed to the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen spears flew out, and the citizens who crossed the blockade line were nailed to the ground regardless of gender, regardless of age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens who were trying to hit the blockade line were quiet at once. They stared blankly at the people on the lance. For a time, only the prisoners outside the city were screaming before they died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance hoof rumbling, Charlie has chased the battle, and returned. When he saw the massacre outside the city of Makur, his face changed dramatically. But now that everything is over, all the prisoners have been killed. The soldiers of the Principality of Ale began to pile up their bodies together, piled up with firewood, and prepared to set fire to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is finally over. Rog stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The citizens of Marcus, my patience is limited, you have seen the end of the insurgents! If Makul once again rebelled, Then, waiting for your ending only one, that is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The massacre!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The night is deep, and the cold wind is not blowing the bloody suffocating air above Marcus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the capital of the city of Markur, Charlie was emotional and snorted: "Why! They are captives, they have given up resistance! Why kill them, The killing of prisoners is by no means a knight's behavior!" Rogge smiled and said: "Well, Charlie, don't be so excited. Treat the captives caught from the battlefield, Of course we have to obey the Knights' courtesy. But the rebels are not real warriors, they are not worthy of our enemies. I don't want my soldiers to die in a desperate battle, but instead die behind the rebels." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie frowned at the adult, I am not a pedantic knight. I can't even be a knight. It’s just that you are here, I’m afraid that people from all over the city will hate you for generations. The bloody slaughter will only suppress the moment, and you can’t suppress it forever! Do you really want to kill the city? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger sighed and sighed Marcus reincarnation, I had to do this. I can't let any rebels have fantasies, count on me." There will be any kindness to them. In doing so, the insurgents will be more determined, but on the other hand, those who are not determined enough will think twice and will probably give up the rebellion plan. Charlie can suppress them for a while, Give me some time, this is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie suddenly asked: "Roger, who is your real goal? Why are you so anxious? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge didn't answer. After a while, he asked: "Charlie, if your opponent is a giant, and his power is daily." Still growing, what can you do? You only grow faster than it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check the ideal, smiled: " Master Rogge, I think I have already understood. From now on, all this massacre is handled by me. Execute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hesitated, but you used to be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is already a thing of the past. I just want to know what happened to Orpheus. By the way, are you not going to take a look at your son? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge faintly said: "When I am here, settle down and say it." I will go now and will only bring bad luck to them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until Charlie left for a long time, Rogge gently said: "I also want to know, what happened..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria seems to be very worried, she walked through the long corridor and walked quietly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly Stopped, and a cold face of Androni is in front of her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiled softly, gently stroking Androni's face with Rogge's wife, naturally going to sleep with him. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Androni slammed Froya’s hand and said, "Don’t think that I don’t know what you are thinking." You want to avenge me! You can do whatever you want, but why do you have to use this way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria looks at Androni's beautiful Face, low and low: "Annie, I said. Since you don't want me, I don't want to be myself. Let me go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said, she passed by Androni and walked to Rogge's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floria!" Androni was angry, she caught Froya’s neck and lifted her like a kitten. come. "I will never allow! You are still my person, go back with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya gently kissed her face on the weak Allerney, and smiled lowly: "Annie, what I want to do, you can't stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and Yingying walked into Rogge’s room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni finally recovered her ability to move. She jumped up and wanted to rush into Rogge’s room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something strange in the air, Androni stopped and turned suddenly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Quietly floating in the air, a pair of expressionless silver cymbals are looking at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly smiled, smiling and unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked over to ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The silver mans in the eyes jumped a little, her hand suddenly lifted, and the death sickle was already placed on Androni’s neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You won't kill me. Otherwise, I was already dead last time!" Androni smiled with victory, her eyes dying Staring at the red lips of ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her hand and tried to open the blasphemy of death, thought about it, and let it go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Also put away the Death Scythe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other quietly, Androni’s heart was happy, and her face could not help but smile. It’s just that she can’t stop reminding herself, and she’s not to anger again. She was a bit strange, and this time with Rogge, it seems that the number of encounters with *** is particularly large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the location of the Green Sea?" *** finally opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like me to find you at any time?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** A faint voice is heard in Androni’s ear, just like a thunder! The joy in her heart is almost overflowing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you say? This is not true..." She blushes on her face and is incoherent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Slightly wrinkled.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni hurriedly said: "Of course I am willing! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, then read it. *** Extend the index finger of the right hand and start to draw a strange symbol in the air. Her fingertips have a silver flame flowing out, condensing in the air, forming a silver symbol. Each symbol appears. There will be a corresponding voice in Androni’s mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recites one by one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the last symbol was finished, *** stretched out a bullet, a drop of golden blood flew out of her fingertips, and fell into Androni's eyebrows.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God! Another drop..." The bone dragon hiding in the dark couldn't help but wailing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni only felt a dizzy head, it seemed to have a strange The feeling of penetrating her own soul. The joy in her heart has been melted away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, protect him. "*** Point to Rogge's room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andro, a sneak peek, this mysterious *** really has a relationship with Rogge It seems that in the future, I will start from this slutty fat man, but I can’t find ***. However, she turned to think again, now she can find herself at any time, is it forced to ask the bottom of the *** from the fat man? It’s not that important anymore.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni nodded, just wanted to say something, *** waited for her to open, and immediately entered the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Androni, who stood out from the sorrow, came back to God. She was blushing on her face, and she was shocked and biting, biting her lower lip, hating the earthly way: when I finished, I ran, every time! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon flying from a different world suddenly plunged to the ground!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lego! "*** obviously has anger that can't be concealed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Master, I didn’t hear anything... yes! "The bone dragon has stabilized his body. It has no choice but to escape. It is extremely fast...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is standing alone at the window. Quietly watching the distant night sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is meditation today, this is not like your style!" Or is it that many people are killed today, and some are uncomfortable? "Froya came to Rogge and leaned over his shoulders.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue comfortably closed his eyes, he patted What is the name of Froya's jade hand? How can I be so useless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the window and sat in the sand. Froya followed, sitting next to Rogge, arms on his shoulder, looking at him with a beautiful face, and asked: "Your change is really big. Just thinking What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What am I thinking about?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya ate Amazed, beautiful eyes looked at Rogge: "Little Rogge, is it scared to kill people today? How do you start thinking about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and knew that God exists, but what is God, in what way, what is thinking, what is the relationship between God and God? None of these people have ever known. I didn't think about these things before. I suddenly remembered it today, and now I know that my understanding of God is still so small. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Rogge, you really changed." What you used to think was not about cheating money to lie to women, but how to fight for power. It seems that you have grown up so that I can marry me willingly! By the way, how do you become so interested in God, is it really intended to be a believer from a heresy? "Froya's cold fingers gently stroked on the neck of Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and didn't answer, he glanced at Fu Luoya This little goblin wore a low-cut pajamas, looking at him from his point of view, just a large piece of white chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will take Fulu Ya is in her arms, and the other hand has been placed on her bare chest muscles, and the full and smooth touch is enough to make all men crazy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, I will now also want to lie to lie to lie to women. You come to me at this time, do you want to try again? "Speaking, Rogge's restless hand has already sneaked into the pajamas and picked up the abundance of nephrite. Froya looks beautiful and beautiful, and her body is also very thin, only a pair of peaks on the chest is unexpectedly huge. Rogge's palms were all incomplete with a hill. He stroked a few times, and the two fingers grabbed a bud, and gently said, Fu Luoya immediately snorted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very different from the usual seductiveness. At this moment, Flora’s body is stiff and her eyes are closed, and a drop of cold sweat can’t flow down her forehead. Her lips are completely bloodless. A row of white teeth is deeply stuck in the lower lip, almost biting the bleeding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria will not be like a man like Androni Any touch can't stand it, but for Rogge to touch her sensitive parts, she still can't stand it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog put his hand back, Fu Luo Ya grew a sigh of relief, opened her eyes, smiled weakly, whispered: "I'm sorry. Let me take a break and we can try again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which is what I am sorry about." Your Highness, why bother to torture yourself? If you just want to find someone to marry in name, then I can hang a name. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! "Froya suddenly said firmly: "You promised me, I will help me to avenge Anne!" According to the current progress, she will soon be hooked, I absolutely believe this! You can rest assured that I will force her again. Her beautiful eyes slammed dangerously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed, the emotional thing was very subtle, barely coming. Since the past I forgot it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
