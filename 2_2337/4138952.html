His skin is not thick, and he does not regard the wolf as a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't answered my question yet." Adrienne smiled and reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "Probably she accidentally lost, so I am not convinced."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is normal for her to lose to you. You must have done something else!" Adelaide smiled and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the name of the dark gods, I absolutely have nothing to do!" Rogge solemnly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has nothing to do with Adrienne. If there is one, there should be just wariness. But I don't know why, maybe because of the exchange agreement proposed by Miro, perhaps because he always sees the figure of Elysses from her, maybe it is the atmosphere she intends to create, and there seems to be something between them. Unclear and unclear relationship. So Rogge instinctively chooses an answer that will satisfy any woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Adrian is obviously not convinced. She smiled and said: "The gods of darkness can be different from Hilo or other bright gods. They avenge and revenge. You swear in their name, and most of them will have bad fate. Worst. The ending is that the agents of the gods will find you directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was shocked and said: "I am not a big man, no. Is it worth the care of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Adrienne again. Alert: "You don't know which agent of the dark gods? It must be like this, or how could you be so powerful? On the mainland, you have a man who surpasses the magic of the great magi at your age, I can return one. I haven't seen it yet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne smiled softly and said: "I don't have the qualification to be an agent of the gods. But I do Knowing such an agent, maybe you will have a chance to see it soon. I am really not malicious, you don't really have to be so wary of me. To put it bluntly, how can you not know me? What about family identity?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man didn’t expect her to be so directly. I was a little embarrassed, so I smiled. Start thinking about it: "Hey, isn't Miro coming? Isn't he always following you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, in a closed door Introspection! We don't care about him." Adrienne smiled. She suddenly walked to Rogge and came to the front of Rogge. She stretched out his hand and said softly: "I know that you are very busy, but you can take some time now. Can you talk to me for a conversation?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smiled bitterly and said, "Can I say no?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the two have appeared on a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne is standing on the peak, and the wind blowing in her face blows her elegant dress, and looking back, it is really touching. She took care of her for a week and then sighed, “It’s a beautiful world.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrain around Richelieu is flat. The mountain is not high, not dangerous, looking around, the sky is densely covered with clouds and snow on the ground. There is a large dense coniferous forest at the foot of the mountain. The dark green crown also makes people feel depressed. Even Rogge can tell. No matter where you look at it, you can't say anything good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne seems to know the thoughts in Rogge’s mind, so he said: "If you have been to the Devil, and have stayed in the Great Devils for some time. If you do, then you will feel that any place in the world is so full of vitality. Where there is vitality, it is a beautiful place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?? Rogge heard a new word and immediately asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge asked again: "Which are the five great devils? You are so powerful, must you practice in one of them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I chose The misty demon domain. The characteristic there is loneliness. Any demon who enters the foggy demon domain will be overwhelmed by the fog with infinite power, losing all directions and time. There is no way to sense the outside world, only to see the surrounding meters. In fact, the cultivation of the foggy domain is very simple. It is to walk in and find the way to go out from the other side. The strength will naturally increase."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne Speaking understatement, but Rogge heard the heart stunned. He is also an expert in torture, knowing that it is one of the most powerful penalties to isolate a prisoner in a space where there is no light, no sound, no space. Few inmates can survive for too many days without going crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and asked: "How big is the foggy demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai De Renee turned and looked at Rogge and smiled. "You are very smart. So you know the uniqueness of the foggy domain so quickly. If measured by the measurement unit of this world, the foggy demon should have a square. Ten thousand kilometers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man took a sip of cold air, frowning at Adrienne, slowly receding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne smiled softly and said, "I want to kill you and kill it. Even the two goddesses behind you may not have to save." You! They are not long after God, and the time of the existence of the Lord of the Dark is likely to be longer than the history of this plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue It was a big surprise. He suddenly said: "Is it a man who steals things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Adelaide frowned and puzzled. Asked: "Stolen your things? Do you have anything worthy of my hands to steal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thinks again, it is unlikely is her. Adriani didn't have a magic item up and down, and apparently the material requirements were too weak. And it can be seen from her speech. She is closely related to the gods of darkness, and she is less likely to see the power of his natural goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing." The fat man smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also smiled a little, no longer pursued this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrienne is not the same as any woman Rogge has encountered in this life. She is like a gentle breeze, quietly passing by you. When you are windy, you will feel very comfortable. When there is no wind, you will often forget the existence of the wind. She is tolerant and gentle. But with the indifference to the world of all things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are thus silent, standing for a long time at the summit. at last. Adriani said: "Rogge, you have done things for Elysses, it is already well known in the devil world. So I will come to you this time, I hope you can help us. Because we have a common enemy, He is the general of the Devil's Land, Artest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Artest?" Rogge's pupil narrowed sharply, and he repeatedly recited the name. The past is like a flood of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of a generation of tyrannical extremes, even for the magic power far beyond the big magician's Elysses admired, the strong in the magic dragon family, the strength to catch up The Emperor was taken to the position of the general. A conspirators, by a scale, traped Elysses into a trap, which eventually turned her into a purgatory angel statue in the Holy Flame, and also cut off his dream of the Devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Rogge’s full impression of Artest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just an ordinary human magician, how strong is it. You must see it clearly. In the face of the existence of Artest, I even intervened. There is no room for it." Rogge faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne smiled and said: "The nature of your profiteers does not change, but also wants to bargain. But I don't like this. Artest It is our common enemy. He has been busy blocking the passage between the devil and this plane, so there is no time to find your troubles. My conditions are very simple. If you do your best to help me, I will become the most in the future. Trusted allies. If you don't want to be okay, I will challenge Artest with Miro. If you are alive or dead, listen to the arrangements of the Dark Gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only except the girl who yelled at your bastard? But she is really beautiful." Adrienne smiled and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiles and does not pre-answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of battle is difficult for me to intervene. To challenge Artest. You must find a way to talk about the two goddesses behind you. Although they are fierce, they are really good for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was silent for a while. Suddenly asked: "Listen to your tone, you and Miro go to challenge Artest is actually equivalent to suicide? Why do you still insist on challenging him?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne said faintly: "If you can't get through the space channel within a certain period of time, then my task will fail. The agent I mentioned will come to this plane personally. Fighting with Artest, but whether it is victory or defeat, both me and Miro will become slaves of it. I would rather die and not be a slave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After hearing her bottom line, Rogge suddenly felt itchy, and some wanted to rob the fire. Aide Renee's eyes are slightly bright, and the golden and blue colors are shining. I look at Rogge. "You better not think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat is surprised, This saves the opposite woman is not a weak character, it is a terrible witch who can easily destroy himself between hands raised. In this place where the four helpless places, it is still better to provoke her. Moreover, since he met with the wind and moon, his last contact with Fengyue was also interrupted. From then on, his call will no longer be passed to the ears of Fengyue, naturally he can't count on Fengyue to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly breathed a sigh of relief and said, "I will help you. You know that I can't promise anything, but I will try my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a deal." Adelene reached out and hit Roger with Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This high-five, Rogge realized that her palm is soft and boneless, that is, ice and greasy, and the moment is slightly swaying. He put his hand together, but he wanted to hold her hand, but Adelene acted as a light smoke, and gently pulled his hand out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled faintly: "Rogge, the beautiful woman around you is so much, will not even want me to look like this? You can be true Not picky eaters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be sure that Aldene's whole body up and down almost alone can be compared to any peerless beauty. Only her face, if it is a Chinese person, is a little reluctant. The benefits she said were only very atmospheric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and put away the sleek state. He said: "I still have some time, can you tell me about the devil? Tell me about Alice." Sith, and yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrianne gathered up some messy long hair in the wind. Light and elegant, slowly said: "The devil is very vast. The devil in your mouth is actually the general name of more than ten different planes. Each plane has its own lord, the most powerful of all the lords, will Will become the demon emperor, and inherit the power from the devil. Elysses and me, are the daughters of the current devil emperor. She said, she is a little bigger than me. But you do not think that the devil princess has a prominent position The devil world only looks at the strength. Whether you are a princess or a prince, if you don't have the power of extraordinary people, you will look down on it. Moreover, in the long life of the father, there are already more than 200 emperors and more than 100 princesses. Fortunately, the blood of the demon kings has always been a symbol of strength. With it, it is easy to have powerful power. Therefore, those emperors and princesses who want strength are weak. It is not easy, but no one has ever lost their face to the royal family. The devil world is a generation of generations. In those years, among all the demons under the age of five, Elysses, Miro and I were recognized geniuses, and our choice of power was different. Elysses is the most dazzling one, she almost gathers all the glory of the demon. The magical rumor quickly catches up with the elders of the devil. At that time she was very proud and would not have any The existence is in the eyes, and even the devil is not respected. I have lost 17 times in her hand more than a hundred years ago, but I have never wavered in the road of my choice, so I chose to enter the fog. Demon domain. When I came out of the magic field and prepared to beat her, I heard Artest’s betrayal and... her ending.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to get to this plane, what is the purpose? Is it to conquer?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrienne smiled a little bit and sighed: "No. It is a refuge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"When the timing is right, I will tell you. But now is not the time. Ok, now is not early. We should go back. When I find the whereabouts of Artest, I will inform you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless what Rogge said, Adeleney’s eyes flashed and the figure disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-hearted Rogge returned to the government and went to the study room. He suddenly found that Hughes was drinking snow in the garden. The fat man walked over and said nothing, poured a large glass of wine for himself and drank it. After a long time, he was satisfied with the spurt of alcohol. For the new hobby of Hughes, Rogge is welcome with his hands. He has no taste for tea. For the good or bad of wine, it is still divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elders of Shusi, do you say that I should help the Mozu?" Rogge suddenly asked such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sank and said: "Sometimes helping others also helps myself. Other times, helping others is harming yourself. This may be judged." A standard. As for other considerations, it is often unrealistic. For example, the Mozu, those who think they should kill them, most of them have faith in the gods of heaven. So your decision, It should not be influenced by these people, but only based on your own actual situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled a bit and said: "I don't know Helping the Mozu is good for me. But on the downside, it is very clear that I am looking for a very powerful enemy. But my feeling now is that I tend to help the Mozu. I have to admit, Ai De Renee is really very good at convincing people. Elder Chess, do you see any traces of spiritual charm in my heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes shook his head Road: "You can be called spiritual magic. Teacher. Since you can't detect the magic of the charm of the spirit, then I can't see it. But I have seen Adelaide, I prefer that she doesn't have any hands or feet for you. It can be said that she is too convincing. To put it bluntly, these demons can be said to be good guys besides the inherent shortcomings of race."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge sighed and drank a glass of spirits, his face was slightly drunk. He held his forehead. Sighed: "I don't know if my decision is right or wrong. But I have a feeling now, I must kill Artest. Hey, why do I have a lot of things I have to do now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: "That's because your status is different. We all know that the wind in the sky is very strong, but this kind of gale can only be the towering old trees. I feel that the low shrubs living under the shade of old trees have no way of knowing this taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighed: "But I have I really want to be a bush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can put down the many shrubs or grasses that shelter in your shade, there is nothing wrong with this. Yes.” The words of Xiusi sounded not to be comforting, but rather to be a threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is silent for a moment. I finally fell to the ground: "I certainly understand. But after agreeing with Adrienne, I have to find a way to convince the two guys..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will smile. Obviously, the troubles of Rogge are clear to the heart. But the old fox just said: "I am afraid there is no good way. Whoever makes you are too fierce in this category... No, it is tough... Is it right? Is it a talented woman? I want her to work together, I am afraid it is much more difficult than defeating them! I can't do anything good for the elderly, you can handle it slowly, haha, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the gloating Sis. The fat man was angry and his eyes were spurting out of the fire. He gnashed his teeth and said: "This is of course difficult, so you should be able to go with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course not!” Hughes immediately refused: “I have selected 20 Elf killers. It is expected that I will be able to reach the provinces of Layton and Duke of Duliak in three days. This is a big deal, I have to go see it myself. You don't want any damage to the elves? Well, yes, I heard that in the past year, the price of a young and martial woman in the slave market has risen three times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This immediately hit the fate of the fat man. He snorted. His face was iron and blue, and he couldn’t speak for a while. After half a day, he just bit his teeth: "You can only take care of one side, who is the other killer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man frowned: "Effie? How could she..." He immediately remembered, but wherever Effie went, there must be her teacher Constantine. There is such a cardinal in the back. She can indeed go around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fat man is worried: "Do you think that Constantine is reliable? He can't do anything else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The character of the Cardinal is still commendable. At least he should not have any color." Hughes broke the truth that Rogge really worried. It’s just that his guarantee sounds light and there is no weight at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Hughes, Rogge fell into a crazy job for the next few days. He is completely sleepless, and he handles complicated business in one piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, there will be dozens of urgent reports sent from the Ayre Principality. After Rogge reviews, they will be distributed to the corresponding hand for processing. At this time, all the troops in the Ayre Principality were mobilized, the fortress at the border was strengthened, and the defenders were reorganized. I am taking all the time to train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of weapons dedicated to defending orcs have been successfully trial-produced. And in small batches of trial production, even a small fortress has already got a new weapon. Under the enthusiasm of Auntie. The efficiency of the entire ARay public transport and transportation system is amazing. The Bauhinia Butterfly, based on the established plan, turned the focus of the entire Principality's defense. At this moment, the Ayre Principality is like a huge behemoth, and is slowly turning around, aiming the claws and teeth in the direction of the Central Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food is a big problem, but it cannot be solved. Rogge is well aware of the power of the Principality of Leighton and the Duke of Dolly. This selection of Elf killers have strong men sitting in the town, not their guards can defend. The fat man’s command to the elf killer is to sneak into the rest of the two people every night. No matter who they are, they will kill when they see people, and they will withdraw if they kill ten. The same was true the next day, until the two began to transport food to the Ayre Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man does not believe that their nerves can stand up for a few days in fear. At the same time, Rogge began secretly sending people to sell the gems that the elves had accumulated for years, through the open or underground market of the Empire, and acquired high-quality magic. raw material. Even if it is temporarily useless, he has to buy it and put it first. Who knows when these materials will come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his spare time, all of his time is spent on meditation or magic research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge refuses to give himself a little bit of space, because as soon as he is empty, he will involuntarily return to that dream. He is exhausted physically and mentally, and really does not want to experience this endless suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Rogge has given the Emperor a letter, affirming the orc's misfortune, and asking the Empire to send troops to support, but has not responded. Rogge privately tried to figure out the intention of the great emperor, and his heart was often uneasy. But the curse of the orc is no longer able to resist by the power of a duchy. It must be suppressed by the empire. This politically black and white thing is really not to be dealt with on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this evening, a flying horse came to the Rogge House to inform the Emperor to call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge was already in the small study of the Great. At this moment, Rogge felt that there was progress. When he stepped into the room, he realized that the entire study was enveloped by a huge and unstoppable force of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything in the room is dark. The dim, shaking magical lights reflected the expressionless face of the emperor. The boss is standing aside and looks lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dark red desk in front of the emperor, there are two identical boxes. The box is carved with precious fragrant wood and decorated with a gold-plated pattern. The lock on the lid is made of flame-patterned steel, and the whole body shines with a touch of red brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the two boxes, and the Emperor was watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward and slowly opened two boxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gorgeous scepter in the box on the left. It is made of magical silver with fine gold wire, and the head is crowned with two rows of huge rubies. The center of the scepter is a huge transparent crystal. It is pure and non-scaling, and it is very rare in both purity and volume. Rogge touched the crystal lightly and immediately knew that it could fill a lot of powerful magic, not just a decoration. On the handle of the scepter, engraved with the inscriptions of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
