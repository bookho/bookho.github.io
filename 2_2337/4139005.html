			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh Day Book Volume 6 Redemption (1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth Day Salvation<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a green world, quiet and harmonious, can't hear a little sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world seems to be immersed in the water, a touch of light, soft ripples, waves of waves, and gentle The light is refracted into a seven-color rainbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the water world, a small group of consciousness is taking shape. It is like a baby, and at the moment of gaining his own consciousness, he immediately opened his eyes with curiosity. Although this blue-washed world is a brand new experience for him, but since the consciousness has awakened, the memory has returned to his heart bit by bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he finally remembered everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central consciousness of Bibo began to expand at an incredible speed. However, the world is as vast as the endless, and the consciousness is expanding rapidly, but it cannot accommodate the whole world. . I don't know how long it has been expanded. Consciousness finally touched the limit of this space. After repeated contests, consciousness has solved all the mysteries of this space, so it has expanded and broke through the invisible space restrictions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy of the moment, like a dead bird reborn from the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is room outside the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, consciousness itself is unconstrained, and its only limitation lies in the intangible imprint of past experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this wonderful world, I don’t know if there is time to flow. The infinitely expanded consciousness finally touched on an invisible restriction. It shook with excitement and began to try to deconstruct this new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakthrough, unknown. Expansion, exploration, mastery, breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like never ending. In this seemingly endless cycle, consciousness has no idea how much space has been broken and how many limits. I don't know how much space is explored. The beginning of the blue wave world, at this moment, has become a tiny existence that is completely indistinguishable in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the ceiling blankly. For a long time, it seems that it is faintly heard two very weak calls, it seems to be from the nine days of cloud. Until then, he recovered from the wonderful, attractive, yet very dangerous memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s eyes gradually became angry, but at the moment he was in a very strange state, and everything had to be re-learned. This includes directing your body and even turning your eyes. And he also misses the experience just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intuitively knows that it is not a dream or an illusion, but a real experience. Some of Rogge wants to go back to the dream, return to the illusion, and continue to experience endless exploration and breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up! Don't sleep anymore!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Rogge was removed I heard the content of the wandering in the sky. However, the voice of the call is erratic, and it still sounds very difficult. At the same time, he felt a strong stimulating feeling on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is awake. He has already remembered that this feeling is called pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, there is finally a glimpse of his double eyes. In his ear, there was a cheer, and there was a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is already awake, are you..." The voice is cold and feminine. It sounds very familiar, and it seems that there is a glimmer of concern in the cold voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! Be sure to wake him up completely!" The same sweet voice. But there is something faint behind the firm voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he can't control his body for the time being, he will not take the pain of ** as one thing. However, the pain from the face is like a sharp needle, and it directly penetrates his soul. Is this what humans can bear? However, this pain is also a bit strange, just a pain, completely harmless to his land and spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge snorted and finally recovered a little wisdom and woke up. In front of his eyes, the face that smiles evil is naturally Nafi. And it’s cold and ice. It’s a little windy month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to support the body, but every move. It’s all very difficult. In the end, Feng Yue quietly helped him, and he was able to sit up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is...where?" Rogge’s thoughts were still extremely slow, and he didn’t react to what he was in for a long time. It seems that the faster the consciousness expands in the recent alienation, the slower his thinking will become. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the sanctuary!" Nafi Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough... is the sanctuary..." After a long time, Rogge muttered. He slowly removed his body from the bed, and his movements were stiffer than a newly formed zombie. However, compared with the previous one, this has been a huge improvement.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and tried it several times under the support of Nephie. Stand by yourself. Until now, his consciousness has initially returned to normal, and memories of the past have begun to slowly come to mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked out of the window, but it was still early in the morning, and you can see the bright temple in the distance from the window. In the morning light, the Great Light Temple was covered with a light gold coat. He stared at the Great Light Temple and said for a moment: "How can I be here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefy shrugged: "How do I know this? Where have you been?" I haven't told us anyway! Anyway, a few days ago the Pope sent you back, and when you sent it, you fell asleep until today. We only woke you up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at Nafi for a long time, then he smiled a bit and shook his head. Naifei greeted Rogge's gaze straight, and did not back down, but the eyes of the green eyes were a little more embarrassing. The fat man knows that the pain that has just been so painful but has no harm to him is necessarily the ghost of Nephi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is in retaliation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the wind again. He didn't know how long he had slept, because the wind and moon seemed to grow a little longer, and the color was nowhere. Seeing Rogge, she lowered her head slightly and avoided Rogge's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sighed and turned his head to the bright temple outside the window, slowly stretching his body. Finally, he took a sigh of relief, and the invisible force field in his body suddenly burst into a sudden, and instantly flashed more than ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of it, it seems that there is a loud bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge ice crystal floating in the center of the deserted palace in the windy month suddenly flashed a strong ray of light, and then the sacred konjac in the middle of the ice crystal slowly panned It took a layer of gray and turned into a very fine gray powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church, Nafi also took a breath and said: "Now, you are finally back."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, I am back." Rogge smiled. He habitually reached out and wanted to pat Naifie’s head, but the little girl in his memory has now grown into a pavilion. The girl, when standing up straight, is a little higher than Rogge. So the fat man's hand reached a halfway and felt a little weird, and received it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Fengyue again, only to realize that the little windy month had grown up at this time, actually higher than Naifei. It’s just that she has always floated in the air, but she can’t show her high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the two of them, and the heart was filled with joy for a while. However, there was a faint sorrow and float, and the joy was diluted and overwhelmed. He sighed and said: "I am going to a bright temple, you are here to wait for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go!" Nafi Road . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! You stay here to accompany the wind." Rogge immediately said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
