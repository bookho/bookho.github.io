			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, we have no intention of offending you, please come back with us. You are drinking the head of the Holy Knights, Augustus The holy water that the adults personally prepared: the tears of angels. Or give up." The soft voice sounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Elysses are dark, and in the darkness, she can feel the presence of the three groups of light. She stopped struggling and barely stood up. Even with the pain of burning flames, she stood proudly in front of the three lower angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat from the whole body has burnt her black robe into ashes. From her, perfect body, almost the flames are burning inside. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three sacred knights in white cloaks walked into the little courtyard of Elysses, encircling her in the middle. The cross on the cloak decorated with blood is the mark of the Last Judiciary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses seems to have forgotten the physical pain, she does not want to ask why Gina is going to harm herself, and now she can't speak. She is even a little afraid to know the truth of the matter, knowing why the holy knights and the lower angels of the three final jury will appear here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can feel two hot eyes swimming around her body. "Sure enough, they are the lowest-level angels! So soon they are assimilated by the human body and become low-level slaves." If it was not the calculation, how could she put these useless things as a demon princess? In the eyes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low voice sounded again: "His Royal Highness, you still don’t want to play other ideas anymore. We choose the time you just came out, because this time You must not bring those magical equipment to you? When I put this 'lonely bracelet' on you, you can help you extinguish the holy fire in your body. We are also ordered to act, and do not intend to offend you. So don't be embarrassed, etc.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses floated a sneer at the corner of her mouth, she raised her hands, and with this movement, the two breaths were noticeable It became heavy. Only the angel Dess, who died in the palm of his hand, was completely unmoved by the scenes in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma stepped forward and took out a pair of exquisite gold handkerchiefs engraved with sacred spells, hesitating a pair of gloves that extended to her Go up. His hand was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel Karajan hurried forward and smiled: "His Royal Highness, your hand is still not high enough! Let me, Karajan, come for you Let's help! Let's make a difference early, you can also get rid of the burning of the flames soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be helping Elysses to raise his arm However, the hand stretched out and slanted, and went straight to the soft chest of her chest. Karajan stared at her incomparably beautiful lines, and the flame in her eyes almost lit up the holy inflammation in her body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karajan suddenly had a little bit of a bad back on her back. He walked around and looked at the blood that almost scared the whole body almost back into the heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of Elysses’ face is a closed-eyed face, and the mouth is smacking a spell, but there is no sound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a curse!" Karajan screamed. The three holy knights changed their minds and immediately fled outwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colors of the world suddenly faded and became a world of black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy knights in the escape are now fixed in their own actions, although their consciousness can not be bound by the magical power, but with the power of the lowest order angel They are not enough to fight against the power of this horrible magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine levels of magic, time is still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses began to meditate on a new spell, and the face behind her was also mourning at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tulip of black flames appeared in front of her. The tiny flame on the petals is still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell on her back that face mourning is also finished. A flash of light flashed through the air, and a crack in space appeared in front of her. Elysses walked into the space crack, and finally finally could not support it, and planted it into the space crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karajan suddenly groaned, and a cold breath behind him kept chasing him. He looked back and saw a black tulip flying towards him. In shock, he changed his direction in a few moments, but he could never get rid of the bones behind him. He looked around, and Dess and Chrisma had already escaped far away in an instant, and it was too late to save themselves. In desperation, he squandered the sacred vindictiveness, and if the real white shield appeared in his hand, he greeted the little tulip with a black flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karala! Quickly open! Don't touch that soul-eater!" Dess yelled far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karajan’s heart was shocked, but it’s too late. The black tulip sees the holy shield as nothing, fluttering through the holy shield and sticking it on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karajan fell silently and silently. A black flame suddenly spurted out of his body and set off a height! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset is full of red, and the day's sunset is painted in dark red. In the sunset, Rogge was carefully painting the armor "reincarnation". After painting the last piece, he could no longer suppress the troubles in his heart and threw the oil paint pen on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting sun is like blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery outside the window makes Rogge very uncomfortable, his eyelids are constantly jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge untied the "reincarnation", slowly and very carefully draped it on his body, and tied each strap. He has to practice this one time every day. If one day, he had to flee in the middle of the night, the proficiency of every action of the armor may affect his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the reincarnation armor is worn, he once again carefully understands where each magic reel is placed. Then he carefully took it off and put it neatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a slight fluctuation in the nearby space, and then a sound of heavy objects fell into the bedroom. The fat man jumped in his heart, and he took a chair and rushed to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he arrived at the door, he suddenly stopped and threw the chair out, but the man waited. Seeing that he didn't wait for the expected attack, Roger's eyes turned, his body force, and he smashed the wall and rushed into the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful body that almost suffocated Rogge on his big bed. The bed has already been split up, and it seems that this little beauty is very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squatted on the ground, and Rogge stared at the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame suddenly emerged from the quilt, the flame was so fierce, and the body was swallowed in the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was shocked, grabbed it and took her out. Then Rog snorted and threw the woman on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two faint white flames are burning on the hands of Rogge, and there is a great spread. In just a short effort, Rogge was so painful that he had a big sweat. This white flame is clearly the holy flame made up of the purest holy force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating against the divine power Rogge is the most effective means of dealing with the flame that this general power cannot extinguish. It is spiritual power. His eyes turned silver, and the flames of his hands beat twice, slowly extinguishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge breathes a sigh of relief, pure mental power seems to be able to fight against any force! Unfortunately, I have not made much progress in exploring the use of the Fa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman on the ground turned over. Rogge greedily looked at the tip of his toes, looking up all the way, staring at the small, lush grass and two pretty hills, and finally breathed her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses! Roger was surprised and stepped back, and he sat down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could it be her! What is the flame of her body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the power gap between the two sides is too large, Rogge can't see the identity of the devil of Elysses. But the dark magic attribute he still can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was poured down by a basin of ice water, and there was a blank in his head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do! What to do!" He subconsciously whispered, and there was already a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge trembled and lifted Elysses. As soon as his hand touched the body of Elysses, the holy flame touched the lamp oil like a fire, and suddenly spread to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teaching Court! Must be a church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart is twitching, flame The pain of burning has no longer been felt. The Holy Flame greedily swallowed Rogge’s death energy, and it grew stronger. A bright white flame completely wrapped the two in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep pain from the depths of the soul awakened Rogge, his mental power suddenly surged like a raging anger, and the holy flame that invaded the body rushed. In a twinkling of an eye, a thin mental shield shields the flames from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly realized that although the magical power of his death system is against the divine power, it is like using firewood to deal with the flame, but the ethereal spirit is at least not afraid of the sacred Power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred flame in the body of Elysses burned even more fiercely. Rogge took a deep breath, and the enormous and unparalleled spirit penetrated into the group and directly wrapped the flame. The muscles of Rogge's body are twisting, which is equivalent to grilling his soul directly on the flame! Rogge had to faint a few times, and he had to bite off his tongue and stiffened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cautiously cut off the connection between the flames of the group and the flames of Elysses. Without the support of this flame, the tiny flames in the body of Elyss were extinguished one by one. The flame of the group was compressed smaller and smaller, and Rogge began to move it a little bit outward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little white light is slowly rising in the body of Elysses. Finally, she had a small mouth and a small group of flames jumped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the body of Elysses, the flames quickly dimmed, and finally turned into a small liquid of small finger size, milky white, in the air Quietly floating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times, the pain of Rogge’s heartbreaking lungs disappeared, and only the coolness passed from the floating angel’s heart to Rogge’s Body. The fat man stared at the tears of this small group of angels. I really couldn't believe that the raging flame that burned the two people was from this small white liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears of the angels are pure milky white, slowly swirling in the air with the help of Rogge's mental power. Rogge didn't dare to touch this thing at will. He took out a small jade box and carefully took the tears of the angel into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently picked up Elysses, and it was such a gentle movement that made her brow in her coma. Rogge probed her injury little by little, and the anger on her face grew more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"**The ancestors of your church!" He couldn't help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the body of Elyss is almost scorched by the high temperature of the flame! Rogge didn't know how she drank the tears of this angel, but apart from being cheated, there should be no second possibility. Let such a senior demon drink the holy water, it is an extremely effective way to poison! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is at a loss as to the injury to Elysses. If this injury is placed on humans, it may have been dead many times. However, as a demon princess, in addition to the magical power of the innate power, Elysses is not weaker than the human warrior. Of course, Rogge did not know her true identity in the Mozu, but now she only knows that she is also a Mozu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flames went out, Elysses woke up. She wanted to sleep deeply, but the strong sense of crisis forced her to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before coma, I seem to have made a space transfer. It was so busy and chaotic that it seemed to have only found a familiar place. Now, where is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly opened her eyes, a familiar fat face appeared in front of her eyes. "It turned out to be him! It seems to be safer!" She struggled to sit up, but it was a huge pain that made her look black. Rogge hurriedly held it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are helping me?" Elysses sounded cold like ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the opportunity to have a chance for you to miss you suddenly suddenly stopped. He is really helping, but the hand is not a big place, right Just holding her soft little meat mound. Rogge himself did not know whether it was intentional or unintentional.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses light She took the hand of Rogge, who was stunned, and stood up. The huge pain made her stun again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held the wall and eased her breath Clothes come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, now, it seems... there is no clothes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elysses was furious, and she blinked, but almost all the things that could be burned in this room had already burned out. Even Rogge, despite his mental protection, is also a piece of East Jiao on the clothes, and a piece of West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, you wait, I will go buy you clothes and come back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Elysses shook his head and said softly: "It’s too late, I have to leave... the clothes are off! It's you, dead fat, where to look!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge bitterly, took off his coat, and watched Elysses cover the spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses spoke out a spit out of a very ingenious magic scroll, and she slowly unfolded the magic scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elysses!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stunned, this is still Rogge first Boldly called her name. She turned and said softly: "Is there something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you ask," Rogge paused, calmly saying: "Who is?" What did you start with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses looked at Rogge’s eyes, where there was now a burning flame burning. She is very familiar with this flame, she has seen this flame in the eyes of many powerful people in the devil world. The name of the flame is: ferocious and. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled a bit and gently said: "Small Rogge, those people are too strong, you can't afford them. Don't want to avenge me." , okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smirked and raised the scrolls of the magic scrolls that could take me to the Lord of the Devils, Artest. With Artest, there are many holy knights in the church that will not be useful! Moreover, I am the daughter of the emperor emperor, the blood of the devil in the body! When I am hurt this time, I have to let the old things of the Pope know my history! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Devil Princess? "Rog thought in his heart, only that he felt very sad." "It’s a big man, how can you climb like a little man like you, a paladin! what are you? Nine level magician? what! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firrock adults?" Rogge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses’s face dimmed, low said: It’s a sacred knight, and refuses to follow me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am willing! Roger yells in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses gently I took a picture of Rogge’s face and said softly: "You have a lot of future here, be careful! I can't take you there. The devil is not the right place for you humans. If... If I don't come back, remember that you promised me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alices suddenly smiles, I will still account for you with my cheap account!" Said, she picked up the magic scroll and began to curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A storm of stunned light burst, exploding Elysses out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little magic scroll has drawn a curve that falls in the hands of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karajan’s feminine voice sounded: “Miss Elysses, you still have to calculate my account first! Since you have not burned me, For a while, I will take your advantage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small building slammed into the wall of the street silently, and it was turned into a flying sand and the wind blows without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A welcoming Karajan slowly rises and stands in front of Rogge and Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five sacred knights decorated with blood-stained crosses followed Karajan to the second floor. These people leaped one by one slowly, calmly and seemingly strenuous, like a big mountain leaping, seeing Rogge's heart can not sink. His spirits swept over, and there are still more than a dozen holy knights outside the building. The holy power is cold and cold, and obviously these people are all the way to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not recognize Kara Yang, this middle-aged sacred knight with a green face and a footstep is obviously hurt. It seems that the current strength is not as good as behind him. A few follow-up classes. But don't say that these five or six followers are the holy knights who are guarding the outside of the building. With the true ability to fight alone, Rogge can't say that he can get the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses stood up from the wall, a stream of blood spilled from the corner of his mouth, and the deep purple blood line slowly climbed through her frozen skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She regained the coldness of an iceberg and stared at Karajan. Karajan didn't dare to look straight into her eyes, as if the snow-like beauty could stab his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly became angry and angry, but it was a low-lying demon who was seriously injured! I even made myself fearful! If it is your heyday, the power of the Mozu princess is Karajan, Dess, and Chris, and the three giants of the Judiciary will not be able to win. But what are you now? Drink the tears of angels, even if not burned to ash, at least burn half of your blood and all the magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are I afraid of!" Kara Yang shouted out subconsciously, and then reacted again, his face flushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple blood line climbed over the face of Elysses, dripping drop on her high-rise pectoral muscles, splashing small Small purple flowers. She can stand by leaning against the wall, but her body is tall and straight like a glaciers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lowest level of the nine-level angels, even if you work hard, it is not easy to install a big man!" Elysian's cold voice is full of Disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang gasped a spurt of blood, he hated the weakness of the body, this weak body can not afford his strength! However, he forgot that as the devil's princess whose strength is far better than his, the limit of Elysses' ability is actually greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being rescued by Dess and Chrisma, the strength of Karajan has gone 70%. However, Elysses was burned by the tears of angels. Many times, it is not easy to turn into fly ash. Even if the level of magic ‘immediate movement’ is moved, it will definitely not run far. The three men negotiated, each with a team of law enforcers and holy knights, searched in three directions. Kara Yang is now ecstatic at the time of Elysses, not only can this credit be monopolized, but also enough time for him to report the soul of the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in front of her, she will fall down at any time, why is she so afraid of her in her heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set his mind and decided to still have a good look at the two people. This fat man, at first glance, is an ordinary low-level magician, not enough. A good show for a while, multiple audiences will be more exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karajan’s eyes began to look at Elysses, and a sly smile appeared on his face. "My dear Miss Elysses, although it is only the lowest-level ninth-order angel, and you have the most precious blood of the devil world. But now, we are going to experience some human talents in this human body. Experience a unique experience! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this mean?" Elliss asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"meaning? meaning is this can make me happy! Yes, happy! What a wonderful word, must admit that human beings still have some talent in language "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what you mean, then I know." Elysses closed her eyes like an ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang’s mouth is dry, he only feels that the Holy Power is fluctuating all over the body. He repeatedly told himself that she had stopped standing even in the station, went on, went up and tore her clothes! Look at a dried princess, is it still so noble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does this mean?" This voice kept echoing in his heart. He vaguely felt that there was something in this sentence that he had always wanted to know but did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gaze of the people behind them is so stinging, the glamorous Karamay on the surface, the sweat has been heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the first step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy call filled the room. Kara Yang finally stood in front of Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses opened his eyes and looked at Kara Yang quietly. Her gaze passed through the man in front of her, through countless time and space, looking at the war-torn country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge firmly grasped the small scroll in his hand, and the nails were already in the flesh. He is shouting in his heart, why can't you think of me! I can also start this reel! However, Elysses seems to have completely forgotten him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karajan raised his hand to provoke Elysian's chin. His hand was shaking, as if holding a piece of black iron with a weight of tens of pounds in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... Karajan, can you... wait a little." This voice is not the time, but Karajan has grown In his tone, he turned his head and saw that the fat man, who was almost ignored by everyone, was trying to hold his chest and attract attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that all the holy knights are looking at themselves, Rogge raised his hand and said, "This scroll in my hand is from this Miss Elysses." It was said that it was able to send all the people present to the treasures of the Devil General Artest! Adults, should you think about it again? How can we let go of both of us? Go to Artest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karajan's pupil shrinks and asks, "What are you talking about, the generals of Artest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled or not, go see it and see it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A holy knight came over and whispered in Karajan’s ear: "If he is telling the truth, adults, we still have to be careful." . The magic general Artest... is that Augustus is an adult, I see..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nonsense! This is still used by you! With the power of the devil Artest, it is not much time to clean up our three giants! Your waste is not going to die much! "Karala's heart is dark. But on the surface he has regained a very graceful attitude, watching Rogge said: "This gentleman... seems to be familiar! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very interesting sacred knight and Kara Yang whispered a whisper. Kara Yang's face appeared a reserved smile, faintly said to Rogge: "It turned out to be the guardian knight, Mr. Rogge, are you still the big boss of the god of war? It’s really rare, little age! Since the same believer is the Lord, then Mr. Rogge, give me the things in your hand! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Kara Yang reached out. Rogge took a step back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A holy knight saw it and said loudly: "This is the Karajan adult who is one of the three giants of the Last Judiciary of the Law Enforcement Force!" It is the Bishop of Burke who has seen it and must be careful to receive it. Are you a little guardian knight, dare to be so rude? "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> Waving his hand, blocking the holy knight, not letting him continue. He secretly felt annoyed at the stupidity of his men, and they set out the attitude of coordinating, that is, not taking these people seriously, but also taking it at the moment. The status of pressing people is really the idiot!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Rogge gave me that thing. In the name of the Last Judiciary, I will recommend you as the head of the Holy Knights of the entire Bavarian Principality. The sequence of the church is only half a step lower than the Archbishop of Burke. How? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only a big jump in the heart of Rogge. The importance of the position of the head of the Holy Knights of the Grand Diocese sometimes even passes the Cardinal. Not to mention Will master the three thousand sacred knights that the church has set aside, and all the Guardian Knights in the parish will be subject to its jurisdiction. This huge force is in the hands. For Rogge, there are a few hand-held powers in the country. The big man, it’s a step in the sky!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
