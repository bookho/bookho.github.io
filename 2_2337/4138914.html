			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight Twelve Movements Chapter 12 Breaking the Law<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage is not ill Driving, the crisp hooves and the sound of rolling wheels echoed on the broad and empty street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, ordinary people have already fallen asleep. The lead clouds in the sky pile up and it looks like it will be a heavy snow tomorrow. This winter, the accidental cold of Richelieu, before the New Year, there are signs of freezing in the river in the city. There are many hot springs in the underground of Richelieu, and the atmosphere is extremely warm, so the rivers in the city will only be frozen in the coldest days every year. In the past few decades, the weather in the north has warmed year by year, but this year it has become cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the silver saints have begun to decline, but the family base accumulated for hundreds of years is still strong, the Ice and Snow Temple is still one of the most magnificent buildings in the capital. There are more than ten magic fountains surrounded by a 50-meter-high main hall. However, the fountain is not sprayed with water, but it is a chill of the white light. Under the reflection of the magical fountain, the Great Hall of Ice and Snow is bathed in white light and stands out under the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly stretched his hand, and the claws on his fingertips were silently inserted into the extremely hard snow-forming rock. As soon as he worked hard, his body floated up one meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the vocals came, Rogge looked down, and a team of patrolling snow and ice warriors were passing underneath. However, none of these samurai glanced at the top of the big temple of ice and snow that was illuminated. If you look at it, it is very likely that you will find Rogge who has not used invisibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and continued to climb upwards, and soon climbed to the top of the temple of the Ice and Snow Temple, and then disappeared into the bell tower. The bell tower door is locked. And there are a few very clever magic traps on the door, that is, the experienced magic thieves are not necessarily able to unravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge chose to enter his own ideas. He put his hand on the ground and began to work hard, and his hands gradually fell into the granite floor. For a moment, Rogge had dug a big hole in the ground and jumped to the spiral ladder on the next floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved silently in the Great Snow Temple. At this time, most of the priests and mages have left the temple and went back to rest. Only occasionally there are a few devout and late returning priests walking around the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not familiar with the structure of the Great Snow Temple. But in the pair of silver eyes, there is a bright lighthouse that is guiding the direction of his progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog felt the corridor in front of it. Two ice and snow mage are coming by themselves. A stop behind the statue of a goddess of ice and snow next to him converges to the full body. At this moment, his figure is looming, but the atmosphere has completely dissolved into the surrounding environment. Even if people see it, it is likely to be mistaken for a relief on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ice and snow mage whispered along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Laila became a senior mage for three days, and she was arrogant! I just asked her what the goddess of ice goddess this time, she actually said That's the top secret. Can't reveal! Hey, what! Isn't the magic higher than me?" The female mage complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! She might have thought of herself as a god servant designated by the goddess of ice, cold like ice. Besides, her magic is stronger. But look at the figure of a flat piece, where can you compare with you?" The voice of the male mage showed a little yin 亵. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her face is not bad, are you looking at her?" The female mage is somewhat jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible? Or you have more flavor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just happened to be from Luo In front of the grid, they did not find the fat man standing next to the corridor. The male mage's attention seems to be all on the hand that is touching the female mage's ass. Look at the past from Rogge's point of view. This female mage is tall, with long legs and round hips, and the body is really hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess has recently shown miracles frequently, and has already lowered the gods twice. Even I feel that the control of ice and snow magic is much easier now, I see yours. The magic will soon improve." The male wizard comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the goddess of ice actually lowered the gods twice? That note is not correct!" Rogge frowned. He flashed from the image of the god and continued to move toward the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's lighthouse is located in the back of the temple, in the magical library of the Silver Religion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The library is brightly lit. There are a lot of magic books on the rows of bookshelves. The various magical scent radiated from the book mixed together and floated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller is carefully studying the magic notes in front of him after sitting at the gorgeous yellow pear wood desk. The great magician who wrote this note is a friend of his youth and talented. He always believes that studying the goddess itself is more important than studying ice and snow magic. Therefore, although his magic is not comparable to Rockefeller, his insights in many fields are much more profound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the notes are in front of them, but the people have passed away, so that Rockefeller is embarrassed. What he didn't know was that this note was a relic of the old man and a beacon of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when the library suddenly floated a piece of snow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller looked up. I saw that the figure of Rogge in the heavy snow is emerging from nothingness. The fat man holds the dagger. It is no more than ten meters away from Rockefeller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Rogge was terrified. Just staring at Rockefeller's body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a statue of a five-meter-high goddess of ice and snow standing behind the big magister. At this moment, the statue illuminates the white glare in both eyes, and the whole body reveals a chilly atmosphere. In an instant, the goddess of this goddess is like a life, is condescending, looking coldly at Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Rogge suddenly felt that he was just on the endless ice sheet, and the sky was full of snow, and the glaciers were thousands of miles away. Between the heavens and the earth, there are a pair of cold eyes hanging high, which is a pair of high-pitched, non-dusty eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge began to tremble, he wanted to kneel, want to squat, express his humility and surrender. His body began to numb, not only because of the temperature in the falling of the extreme drama, but also because of the majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. majesty! Filled with the majesty between heaven and earth! Only belongs to the majesty of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge already knows that he sees the eyes of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the common standing in front of the true God? How many people will choose to stand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge swayed and finally fell to the ground, then fell down and swayed toward the eyes of God in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being bullied by Rogge, Rockefeller had already died. However, when the snow fluttered, Rogge stood still in place. Then he swayed and slammed. He suddenly turned back, and looked at the Statue of Ice and Snow with amazement and joy, and he was tearful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A miracle! How many years have he waited for so many years, and how many years of faith he has persisted in the darkness before he waits for the goddess of ice to reappear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller trembled and squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two wizards in the library who are studying ice and snow magic, and they all fall to the ground. Screaming under the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly looked up, and the silver eyes in his eyes instantly pierced the heavy snow and the ice! He screamed, struggling to flutter, and then waved, the dagger in his hand whistling out, from Rockefeller's left shoulder, and flew out from the right rib! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess is obviously angry at the ridiculous offense. Her lips are slightly open, and she exhales a hurricane of extreme cold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the ice has passed. The existence of all activities has lost power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has been solidified in the flying position, rolling over until the Rockefeller's luxurious desk is broken! He doesn't feel the chill at all, only numb! The numbness felt a rapid spread, and it was a moment between Rogge’s chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Rogge was ready to make the final blow of the power of the soul, the natural goddess in his body always swayed and suddenly turned sharply. The bright, full of life-like green moments have been extended to Rogge. Throughout the body, the icy gods are wrapped in layers. The encircled chilling power suddenly vibrates sharply, but the bright green is like a sponge like water, but it slowly and firmly invades the inside of the icy god, and completely dyes it from the inside out to the green! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the moment before the ice cold power was completely turned into green, Rogge seemed to hear a screaming scream. Like a creature that was last whipped before being swallowed by natural enemies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye. Although Rogge still can't move, the ice cold that invaded his body has been completely swallowed up by the goddess of nature. The green brushed a few times. As if still on the tour, there are no other prey. After the unsuccessful search, it swept back like a low tide, crouching in the depths of Rogge's soul, seemingly full of sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly felt a little creepy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statue of Ice Goddess is very surprised and angry at Roger’s sorcerer who is still not dead. She slowly lowered her head and confronted Rogge. Open your lips again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a cry, a huge velvet blanket suddenly fell on the ceiling, covering the entire statue, and the statue was blown on the carpet. The scarlet velvet quickly faded all the colors and then slammed into a ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air, a large bucket of sticky paint was poured down, the goddess was completely immersed in the upper body, and the gaze of God disappeared. The snow in the library has become sparse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately found himself regaining his mobility. He retired in an instant, but instead of running away, he grabbed the ice and snow mage who was still on the ground and threw him to the head of the goddess statue! The fat man didn't look at the results at all. He appeared like another ghost and snowman behind him. He kicked her on the hips and kicked her to the head of the goddess! Rogge found that as long as the eyes of the goddess were blocked, the goddess of the goddess of ice could not be issued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that his movements are slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black demon emerges from behind the goddess, and Wella grabs the throat of the god with her right hand, and puts her left elbow against the back of the statue, then suddenly exerts an invisible The shock wave swept the entire library at an unspeakable speed. In the face of a heavy blow in the chest, Rogge was involuntarily washed away and flew backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, the head of the goddess was broken by Weina and rolled to the ground! Wella then raised her hands and the dragon soul gun emerged between her hands. She sighed and slammed the dragon soul gun into the body of the lost goddess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint gray shadow on the roof of the church. It turned out to be Hughes. He did not say a word, took out the fine sword, and the sword light criss-crossed, and instantly cut the head of the goddess on the ground into dozens of small pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go!" Hughes snorted and reached for a finger, but the finger was on one side of the library wall. Rogge knew that the wall was the outer wall of the Great Temple, so he said nothing. A silver ripple was condensed in the palm of your hand, striding over the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger rushed to the wall. Hold your hands against the wall and scream, and the palm of your hand will emit a strong silver light! In the sound of the boom, the outer wall made up of two meters thick and huge rock was actually made a big hole by his life! Rogge then tightened his heart and was picked up by Hughes, as if he was flying outside the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Rogge suddenly remembered that the wind and moon remained in the Great Snow Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes seems to know what he is thinking, just saying: "Feng Yue adults can run much faster than you! Do not believe you!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked up. Sure enough, I saw the demon lotus flash in the distance, and then disappeared into the night sky. At this time, the repairer's hand was loose, and Rogge was placed on the ground, so the two old foxes fled to Rogge as the meteor flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" The two stopped at almost the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soul of the dagger remains in the temple!" Rogge was so sad that the dagger could barely be placed under the ranks of artifacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked back and looked at the big snow and ice temple under the night sky, and they all sighed. The goddess of ice and snow has already shown the miracles of living and returning to the place where the power of faith in the Great Snow Temple is condensed, and it is tantamount to finding death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a goddess of ice and snow that has been silent for decades. Why did it suddenly become so active? Rogge only felt that his heart began to be gloomy. The original silver sacred religion is crumbling, and Rogge only considers how to destroy it without causing trouble for himself. But now everything is different. Although Rockefeller is dead, the goddess of an event is enough to meet several big magisters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when Rogge returned to the government, he saw the team’s ready-to-wear warriors, and the whole body was covered with magical equipment and the waist was still ten. The rest of the magic scroll of Froya. The heart is warm, and all the troubles are left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Rogge put away the grooming and entered the palace to see the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, all the ministers of the empire have arrived. First of all, it is natural that the great emperor commends Rogge’s unemployed military power. However, the Rogge official has already reached the end, and the territory is as large as the entire Principality. There is really nothing to be rewarded. Therefore, the Great Emperor made an exception to allow Rogge to add a dragon pattern to his coat of arms, so that the fat coat represents the dragon of the royal family. The lion pattern is all over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the glory of supremacy, when the reward is promulgated. Rogge looked wrong. Baiguan is also in vain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the fat man is pretending to be a flattering, grateful, and ugly look, but he doesn’t really agree. Rogge is completely uninterested in whether or not future generations can enjoy the richness of the Astrophy Empire. In this turbulent era. Even if it is as strong as Astrafik, I don't know if I can survive in the world for a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In troubled times, Rogge is only interested in two things, one is the army and the other is the gold coin. It is a pity that these two emperors did not give him the same, nor did they know that the emperor really loved him and decided to share the glory of the royal family with him. It was too savvy, and he would only gently slap Rogge’s reward with something slick. Hit the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge had already had the guidance before seeing the emperor, so he asked the emperor to consider the free city of Hailar to complete the unsuccessful achievements of Haikou. . Rogge also suggested that the expedition should be inevitable. Considering that the imperial Xi'an dwarf empire has been badly wounded, the surviving dwarves are less than the ten in the heyday, so there is no need to stay in that army. The glaciers are completely indispensable. It can be transferred to the southeast front, and the striker has the command of Pompeii. The Chinese army has the great emperor and Alexander. The imperial army can not only attack Hailar, but even completely occupy the west coast of the Longines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rogge said something, Alexander’s face looked better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Imperial Army can successfully occupy the Aegean Sea, then there is only a hundred kilometers wide between the striker and the border of the Dro Empire, one of the three great empires. The original forest is gone. Rogge also offered, in the winter, dry and dry, when the time to put a big fire. It takes up to a month to burn a passage from the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor was full of red light, although he did not make a decision on the spot, but he smiled very happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is that the silver saints reported that the Ice and Snow Temple was attacked last night, and Master Rockefeller was stabbed to death. Apparel Feuerbach apparently did not know the news, and the words were extremely angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller's blizzard magic is a powerful force in conjunction with the Empire, especially the Poseidon. Seen from the role played on the battlefield alone. He even played a bigger role than the three great magisters. At the moment when the Imperial Army is about to march south, Rockefeller is suddenly violent. How does this make the emperor not angry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred sect of silver stands on the court of the priest Jima, and Rogge sneaked at her and found that her magical power had basically recovered. It seems that after the goddess of ice and snow resumed miracles, she was indeed a lot of light. The fat man thought that Ji Ma was already a waste, so he only set the target on Rockefeller, and he could not help but regret it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a brocade in the ice and snow mage. After the lid is opened, the floor is filled with a dagger that exudes a sense of irritability. It was Rogge who lost the land to beheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is?" The Emperor looked at the dagger. Ask inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A robed old man behind the Emperor walked up and whispered in the ear of the Great. Although Rogge had been mentally prepared, he still had some dim sum, while keeping his humility and expression, while elongating his ears and eavesdropping. He heard that he was explaining the function and source of the food dagger. It seems that this is a learned mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few artifacts in the world. Although the soul of the dagger is not powerful, it is known for its evil ability. Among the empire, there are countless dragons and tigers. At least the master of the silver sacred Ji Ma knows that the soul of the dagger is in the hands of the endless ocean of the great Druid in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore there was a reasonable explanation for everything. The rebellious defeat of Druid was not willing to fail, and he came back to assassinate the Master of Rockefeller. Next, it is a matter of course to pass the Druids throughout the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation turned sharply and let Rogge also unexpectedly. The original prepared response plan was not a set and could not be used, and successfully achieved the most ideal purpose. But use an artifact to dagger to complete the Druid. He is still very sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the fat man himself feels that the ending is so coincidental, is there a big demon who has taken a fancy to him, or the god of darkness to give him care. But remembering the miraculous changes of the miracle of the goddess of ice and the wrath of the goddess of nature, he felt uneasily uneasy in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, a large number of officials began to vote for Rogge, hoping to visit the invincible Prince Rogge, occupying his precious few Minutes, listen to his teachings. Somewhat surprised Rogge is that there are many imperial ministers who have the power to do so. Many emperors also said. I want to visit with my daughter or a prostitute. It would be better if Rogge was willing to accept an invitation to a private party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the pile of invitations. Rogge couldn't help but snorted. However, these gatherings are also an important part of the party’s smuggling and cultivation of the existing forces. Which is more important in the struggle for secular power and the struggle for theocracy? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the imperial political arena, Alexander and Pompey hold almost all elite troops in the empire, and both strength and personal prestige are in full swing, naturally the most powerful one. power. The prime minister, Straw, was extremely conscious of the current affairs. Although the last political struggle failed, it still did not hurt the bones, and the power was still pressing. The emperor and the boss have been sitting on the inside and outside of the battle for many years, but they may be the ones who can control the overall situation of the empire. No matter which side of the three parties, they are better than Rogge. Roger is the most capitalist, but the goddess and many powerful people. Unfortunately, almost none of these people are willing to listen to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest supporters of the Silver Religion are from Alexander and Pompeii, and Straw and the Faith are quite enemies, and the movement of the Emperor Palace is unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of Straw, Rogge could not help but hate that the Kasinaras dagger was ruined by the wrath of the sky before he died. If this dagger is still there, he can give it a holy water every day. Although Casinaras is only a projection of the demon lord, but the power is extremely powerful, the space of tearing under anger may be very large. Moreover, even if he is not strong enough, Rogge can use this dagger to kill a few more people, and make a supplement to the projection of the demon lord. As long as the abyss demon appears in the Prime Minister's Office. That Straw is finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge couldn’t stop thinking about the imperial political situation in the study, and Robsky and Rose were busy, sorting out invitations for him. Rogge also admired the willpower of her, and she was able to work as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose suddenly looked up and immediately lowered his head to continue the work at hand. After a while, Robsky also looked up and said to Rogge: "Adult! Someone sneaked in! Is there such a thief in the emperor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Robsky is timid. Other abilities are excellent, and at this point it has reached the point where it can be secret. Also heard about the strong people behind Rogge. In his view, at this moment, Rogge is simply the abyss world. Even if the Star Sword Pross comes, most of them will come back. What kind of character is this thief, even he can perceive his whereabouts, actually dare to hide and hide all the way to the Rogge study? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief is equipped with rare powerful magic items, but the problem is here. He didn't know how to hide the breath of these equipment. In this strong, such as Yunge Rogge, he just wants to sneak in the dark, but his body is full of torches, it is more eye-catching. However, even if he does not use magic equipment, his strange breath will make him a beacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while. The window of Rogge’s study quietly opened, and a sly figure jumped in and smirked: “Rogge! You are surrounded by a strong person like a cloud, but the defense at home is not so good!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice has not fallen, and suddenly found that everyone in the room is looking at her, the face is weird. It’s hard to endure laughter. And Rogge was sitting on the sofa with two cups of hot tea in front of him, apparently for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guys...you already know?" The girl’s face suddenly turned red, so beautiful as a hibiscus, and the frustration made her Some of the eyes are red, and the grievances are pleasing. She didn't say a word, went to the front of Rogge and sat down, grabbed the teacup and drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "Miss Serena, how is it so good today, will you think of me here?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another sneak. Su. It’s far less fortunate than Serena. She has already known the pattern of Rogge's first, and even the layout of the sewers is clearly remembered. She sneaked in with Serena. Instead of trying to protect this sister, I want to use her to attract attention, to see if I can find out some secrets from Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she just sneaked into the back garden and suddenly stopped. Not far from the front, there is an elegant elf old man who is drinking tea while reading the lights at night. Su Ruran, she could not feel the breath of this old man! If he does not light, it is very likely that Su will hit him and find his presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su quietly came out with a cold sweat, and he slowly retired very slowly. Fortunately, the old man was completely immersed in the world of books, and did not find her. However, a burst of boots suddenly sounded without warning from behind her, knocking on the nerves of Su, almost scared her out. Su could not dodge, saw a big tree beside the garden path, and quickly flashed past the ghostly body, close to the trunk, completely dissolved into the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A handsome and handsome demon swordsman walked past Su, less than one meter away from her. The swordsman suddenly looked up to the sky, looked at the lead clouds in the sky, reached out to help the tree, and sighed again, it seems that there is endless desolation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su is completely desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian’s hand is the chest of her, although she has a corset, but the touch and bark are still different. But the swordsman seems to be just immersed in his own emotions, patted his own trunk, shook his head, and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su stunned and decided to evacuate immediately. However, it is easy to go out and sneak out. At this time, the only safe way to retreat is to sneak through the shadows under a row of windows. With the fingertips and the toes of the toes, Su moved silently like a dragonfly. Sneak through this row of windows, the front is the outer wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the overhead window suddenly opens, and Su immediately stops all actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very sweet voice sighed and sighed: "Oh, it failed!" Then, with a bang, a pot of water with a strong pungent smell poured out Underneath, I was soaked in a head, and then the window slammed and closed tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su wants to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This turned out to be a magic potion, extremely powerful, containing countless negative effects such as weakness, curse, fatigue, paralysis, confusion, madness, etc. Pharmacy, what should be successful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su can’t move, but her willpower is extremely firm, and she has survived the effects of chaos and madness, and then waits for the paralysis effect to fail. Only to cover his whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several cursed Su-bites that lasted for the last leg, quietly leaping and trying to jump out of the wall. But the beautiful demon she suddenly appeared at her foot.
