			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich black clouds first accumulated in the sky above the city of the gods. In the winter in the north, the sky is often covered with dark clouds of lead color, but thick and heavy like this, almost to the dark clouds of the treetops of the elves, it is reasonable to say that this season should not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the dark clouds should not appear, lightning and thunder are not what this season should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder of the thunder shook the whole valley and shook! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick, curved lightning falls from the clouds and hits the city of the gods. The lightning was divided into seven colors, staggered to the beautiful Elven City below the clouds. Everything in the heavens and the earth is constantly changing color with the brilliance of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is so glamorous and weird, just like an incomparably huge palette is overturned; and as if you are in a dream of a spirited man Among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the lightning was blocked by a layer of pale green reticle. But the thin mask can't completely block all the lightning. Occasionally, a lightning bolt escaped the interception of the mask and fell into the city of the gods! A group of flames will be mixed in the smoke, rising high, and the screams of the elves will ring out a few miles away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a hillside ten miles away from the city of the gods, stands a huge and luxurious marching tent, a military camp around the tents on the hillside on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the camp, more than a dozen leading figures were stunned at the city of the gods. Hell seems to be only one step away from them, although this magic is their movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Lapas Magi, your magic is amazing! This power, this spectacular scene, this continuous time, you are simply Can be compared with the top ten wizards! You are the magic god of the world! Ah!" A thin and cumbersome man really does not know how to express the surprise and admiration of the heart, as long as the choice is almost screaming Express your own adoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old magician in the team stared at the hell on the earth ten miles away. Even though it is a harsh winter, the sweat of the beans is still unstoppable. He came out on his forehead. He was shaking all over the body, and he couldn’t tell if he was afraid or excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician’s surroundings are empty, and all the people, except the man who is screaming in the bottom of his mouth, subconsciously avoid the old Magician. The power of magic is inherently frightening. The magic of the great magician Lapas has such a terrifying power, which really scares these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such power, it seems that it will not take long for the city of the gods to be turned into ruins under the magic of Lapas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight with a gorgeous armor came over and stopped when he was a few meters away from the old magician. His voice is also a little trembling: "The distinguished master of Lapas, we... we all saw the great power of your magic. But we are here to capture the elves, if they all die under your magic, Are we not empty-handed? Can you stop the magic? The elves have nothing to do with it. Master? Master??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cavaliers screamed twice, and the great magician Lapas suddenly recovered from the shock. "Hmm, well... what? Let me stop the magic? There are still many elf warriors in the city. If we stop the magic now, we will damage many warriors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers did not agree with the old wizard. He looked at the eyes of the city of God and filled his heartache: "It doesn't matter, we have nearly 20,000 soldiers! You have broken the city defense of the city of the gods. Now just let them rush! You can kill more than 10,000 people in this city! But if you catch an elf, you can pay the pension of one hundred soldiers! The next thing will be handed over to us!" Rb /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapas slowly said: "Dear Duke of Annas, the world of magic is so vast and magical, so massive magic, you want me to stop Going down? To know that once the Thunderbolt Cloud is moving, if you want to stop it, you will only transfer it to the position where the magic array is located. You also know that the magic array is in the central big account..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas immediately did not say anything, although the elves Worthless, but his little life is more valuable. In any case, he is not willing to use his body to experience this terrible ‘Thunderbolt.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the mountain, 20,000 troops lined up neatly, looking at the elf city struggling with thunder and electric fires in awe. The city of the gods is too beautiful, and it appears so weak in the face of rough lightning. But the elf warriors in the city walls and the towers are still firmly guarding their posts, and even if the lightning falls down, they are completely unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of indescribable pleasures kept stirring in Lapas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know why the Thunderbolt Cloud, which should only have a few hundred meters, will cover a few kilometers, and the power is a hundred times more. Can it be said that he was really fancy by the gods and became a spokesperson in the world, so the magic rose? How have you not felt before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this hand ‘Thunder Prison Cloud’, this small place of the Holy League has not been able to accommodate the great magician Lapas! He is already able to get a distinguished seat in the Asrofic Empire, and the kings of the three empire will sing the wine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds in the sky began to slowly turn, gradually forming a huge vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All creatures, whether they are elves or Terran warriors, hold their breath at this moment, waiting for the trial of fate...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge incomparable electric fire fell from the center of the vortex! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a horrible thunderstorm with a few meters of thickness, light black, full of despair and evil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderfire silently landed on the city of the gods, the pale green mask was broken at the touch, and it was completely unable to withstand the half of the thunderfire...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people, including Lapas, never dreamed of such a terrible thunder. Watching the thunder fire fall into the city of the gods, everyone is waiting for the moment when the earth shakes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this is almost equivalent to God The power of the trace, the fragile heart of Lapas can no longer bear the ecstasy of the heart, and finally blackened and fainted. But no one noticed the old magician who suddenly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is waiting....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but nothing is born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Thunderfire falls into the city of the gods, it is completely silent, just like disappearing out of thin air...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of the City of God made the temple a few lightning bolts, which was already ruined. The elf guards in the temple fell to the ground, dead or wounded. The thunder and lightning of the sky seemed to be the same as the god that made the temple impossible. Half of the falling lightning was concentrated near the temple. Even the neighboring temples and the elders' homes followed the mold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark thunder fire is falling right in the temple of God. All the elf guards suddenly passed a burst of chills in their hearts, and this sinister wind directly hit their souls. In the face of this incomparably powerful evil, the soul of the Elf Warrior is like a small fire candle in a storm, and there is a possibility of extinction at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder fire completely disappeared into the temple of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warriors felt that the soul had returned to the body, as if walking in the underworld. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless blacks lingering in the temple of God, and there are countless grievances in the wind...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, all the elves heard the heavy heartbeat of God in the temple, as if a loud drum was ringing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden loud noise in the temple, and the entire temple was blown up into the sky, and then a dark fire column rushed into the clouds of heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the dark column, slowly walked a figure, a figure that all elves are very familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a moment, the elves' exclamations come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is God who makes adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God! God raised the grown up! To inform the elders and temples!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was in a good mood. He stood on the temple of God who had become a rubble, and smiled long. The huge laughter is not like the population, just like a few dragons together to sing the neck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty one finger day, he screamed: "Hai Yin Li Xi!! You old bastard, chasing Laozi for so long, not in the trap of Laozi Slowly find the way back in countless spaces! Ah hahahaha! Losing you is also one of the seven kings, the brain is still so incomprehensible! No wonder the ghost knight can not get on the counter! Ah ha ha ha ha!!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the fat man was so dripping and it was a big bang. After the smashing, this was a smug look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of elves stood around him, stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge held his hand and stood proudly: Ge, the messenger of Hilo, came back after a long battle with the evil nerves! "The fat man has mastered this arrogant and arrogant elf grammar, and he likes it more and more. If he used to be cool, he would only come to this sentence: "My Rogge is back!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the seven-color lightning, the elves can't accept the fact that Rogge died and still live there.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, someone reacted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Roger came a cough, Frey’s magnetic low voice sounded: I said, brother... you are finally back...but how about wearing clothes first? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stunned, looking down, he was not in a position, the majestic lower body was still standing tall, still maintaining the state before death. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s eyes sweeping, now all the elves are staring at their lower body, completely staying.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly laughed, and a black fog that almost disappeared invisibly shrouded the audience. The fog could not stop the sound of Ziz. In the twinkling of an eye, the black fog gathered back to Rogge. More and more concentrated, and finally condensed into a gorgeous black robes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog scatters, the elves immediately screamed, the original effort was just a blink of an eye, The black fog has already eroded their clothes, and there are several female elves who are full of spring, leaving only a few fluttering strips, which is completely helpless.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good-hearted elf untied the cloak to wrap these female elves, which is a solution to this problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nowadays, Rogge is gorgeous, and the elves around him, including the elders, are all ragged, like a beggar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty laughs, you don’t respect God's end! Let me give you a little lesson to say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the fat man is still stunned. He suddenly felt a sense of disgust, cruelty and fear from the depths of his soul. This feeling is so strong that almost all of him is drowned out. Now Rogge already knows that this is a strong enemy on the side, his powerful soul instinctive reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge searches for the city of the gods, and finally there is a holy and powerful creature in the air that is now hovering. Rogge can clearly feel the holy power like a raging wave! It hovered back and forth along the place where the Ninth Knight Heinrich disappeared, and he reluctantly gave up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately gathered all of his breath, only inspiring the terrible creatures above the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It circled again, observed the battlefield below, and swooped down quickly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Rogge, only the elders of Hughes suddenly felt what was on the scene, and his face showed a nervous expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimpse of pure white flames descended from the sky and landed on the positions of the human army. Several soldiers who were infected with this flame screamed. Not coming out, it was burned into a small group of ashes in a blink of an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful, huge body was drilled out of the cloud. It is tens of meters long, and its slender neck and stretched wings have unspeakable elegance and pride. Its shiny silvery skin is extremely soft and supple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge looked at the silver dragon, which represents the purest and most powerful sacred power, and his heart filled with fear. The holy silver dragon is the natural enemy of all evil creatures, and their horrible power has always been the object of the most hatred and fear in the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves have always had a good relationship with the silver dragon, but the degree of perfection is not enough to make the incomparable silver dragons regard the elves as friends. At most, when the elves are in crisis, for example, when they are in a good mood, they can help two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge blessed himself and added a big step to the wall. The elder elders hurriedly followed, and they were so awe-inspiring. The elves who were known for their agility could not catch up with Rogge after the rebirth, watching his fat figure go away, and then fluttered to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves’ elders trembled in their hearts, and God made the resurrection completely more than their understanding. The rehearsal of this resurrection was so grand, like the resurrection of the abyss. general! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gods can actually fight the evil existence of other planes! This is simply the power of the demigod! The elders were in a state of turmoil. It seems that after Hilo abandoned the Elf for a thousand years, he finally re-visited these abandoned people! With such a powerful god to guide, the elves do not say that they want to survive, that is, to reproduce the glory of the millennium, nor is it impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crisp crackle sounds in the Temple of the Elves, but no one will notice this in the city of the gods where the flames rise and the voices are full of enthusiasm Insignificant sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the tallest window in the temple, Zhao Wei was standing in front of the window and shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her clear eyes full of fear and despair, she reflects the back of Rogge. But this back is shrouded in a black mist, in the fog, there are white bones into the forest, blood pool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood in the city, completely unaware that Zhao Wei was watching him from afar. This most critical city gate was stationed by ‘the dark side of the moon’. Rumsfeld stood in the head of the city. He was completely draped, and half of his face was bloody. He saw Rogge go to the city and squatted on the spot, but he immediately reacted and gave Rogge a ritual and observed the movement of the human army. Rogge knows that the war is urgent, and now is not asking why the ‘the dark side of the moon’ will be all transferred back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attention has been drawn to the past by a hellish scene. But this time, the Terran army fell into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the graceful figure of the silver dragon gliding in the air, a large piece of pure white flame descended from the sky, like a fire! The temperature of this flame is extremely high, far from the magical black flame that Rogge can manipulate. The Terran soldiers who got a little bit will be turned into ashes immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special flame of Yinlong has a surprisingly sticky, burning time is particularly long, where it gets, where it will become the hell of fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neat camp of the Terran army immediately became incomparably chaotic. The silver dragon flew high in the sky and spit freely. It doesn't look at the long arrows shot by human archers. How can these weak arrows get their hard scales? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy silver dragon sprayed several more fires and burned hundreds of human soldiers, finally feeling a little tired. In its proud heart, it has helped the elves to be big enough. Then it screamed and fluttered eastward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon’s long sound immediately shocked Rogge’s eyes, and his dark power and death force suddenly slammed and almost could not hold back. The fat throat is a sweet, oozing a little purple blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the disappearance of Yinlong’s figure, a large piece of white flame is still burning on the ground, forming a large chunk of open space in the human army camp. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge screamed, and his hoof was thundering. His ‘Longma’ heard the owner’s call and broke free from the reins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To mobilize all the adult elves who can go on battle, bring weapons at the gates! The other faces don't need defense. Rumsfeld, Within five minutes, I want to see all the 'dark side of the moon' waiting for me at the gate of the city! After I enter the enemy plane with the dark side of the moon, you will lead the rest of the elves to attack! Let all move The elves, including the older children, form the third wave of offensives, and give them something to be a weapon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge glanced at Rumsfeld coldly, and with a glance, the elf's most elite warrior cooled from the head to the foot. Rumsfeld only felt a bit of chills, and his heart was hollow, as if there was an extremely powerful demon who was licking his own soul! He resisted hard and tried to get rid of Rogge's gaze, but he couldn't move at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes lit up with silver, and the light was like a bottomless deep pool, completely immersing Rumsfeld. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaving the elf with a heavy sigh, he immediately felt extremely tired, just like the most difficult battle he had just experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the sacred Guardian spirit has made Rogge have to admire, now that the war is in front, he does not want to spend too much mental power in Rams Field. What's more, his spirit is so strong that most of it is attributed to Rogge's ‘cultivation’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rumsfeld! Wait until I finish playing, I will find you again! Go and do your business now!" Rogge screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld took a privilege and silently accepted the fact that Rogge took back the command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the city of the gods, although the flame of the silver dragon is gradually extinguished, the chaos of the Terran army has not been calmed down. More than half of this coalition is an adventurer from all over the world. They have always respected individual heroism, and discipline is almost equal to zero. The command of the highest commander, Annas, is also limited to their authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate of the City of God suddenly opened, and a black cloud spurted out of the gate, and the air suddenly filled with the cry of the Wraith! All the people are faintly seeing the forest bones walking in the dark clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Lapas! What is going on? How come so many dead spirits in the Elf city?" Annas asked anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old magician was just stunned before he woke up, and his mind was still confused. He glanced at him with a stern look: "It seems that the power of the thunderbolt is too big, and the elf city has become a dead city. These must be the resentment of the unwilling elf. But don't worry The power of the Necromancer is limited, especially this new dead spirit. We have dealt with it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas settled down, the army below is even more It's chaotic. The soldiers clearly saw that it was a terrible world in the dark clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black ground is covered with blood pools of big and small, and the blood in the blood pool is not rolling, spitting out countless bubbles. At a glance, the shackles of the end are struggling and are coming out of the dark clouds. The flash of their eyes is full of coldness and greed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark world, the sky is also burning red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very tall gate suddenly appeared in the sky! The door slowly opened, and there was a head inside, a huge demon head! The demon sneered at the Terran soldiers underneath, desperately trying to squeeze out the huge body from the door. One hundred feet of giant claws tried to stretch forward, and one wanted to catch a few people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God! That's the door to hell!" A well-informed adventurer suddenly yelled! He dropped his weapons and companions and turned around and ran backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first one, there is the second, the third...the ectopic face of the demon, just look at the head, it is not the front More than 10,000 people are enough against the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Terran army was completely confused, and all the people were rushing to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapas’s mouth is stunned, and he finally understands why the power of the Thunderbolt is so big. It is not the magic that he casts. The magic he puts is actually over. The Thunderclouds over the city of the gods are accumulating because the devil wants to open the passage between the planes and come to the world! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Lapas suddenly missed the silver dragon that had just caused heavy casualties in the Terran army. The holy silver dragon has always been the natural enemy of evil creatures. If it is still there, it will surely have a fight with the demons that are struggling out of the gap in space! Lapas magic says that the high is not high, that the low is not low, in the Holy Alliance can be mixed with respect, but to fight this ectopic demon, he will only suspect that he is not running fast enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, there is still poison on the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog slowly progressed, and a burst of arrow rain poured out from the black fog. In each round, nearly 100 Terran soldiers fell. The adventurers have already begun a large number of retreats, but Annas’s men have obviously been trained and have not received the order to retreat, still sticking to the line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously a regular army. At the forefront of the position are thousands of heavy infantry. They are wearing heavy armor, holding shields and counting arrows. Don't want them. But Annas did not have the courage to let them attack the undead army in the black fog. The regular army that he commanded was only 4,000, and the other 10,000 were mostly private soldiers of the nobility, mercenaries, thieves, slave traders and adventurers gathered for the sake of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of four thousand people is like a boulder in the rapids, and has been shaken by the adventurers who have escaped. Annas was so angry that he was even more reluctant to retreat. If the retreat turned into a rout, how many people could escape to this mountainous area would be hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Annas would never use his elite hand to cover the adventurers to escape. He quickly ordered several orders, and the melodious horn sent his orders to the frontline commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The array of four thousand people immediately moved, it slowly rotated, slowly retreating to the side, very skillfully chasing the channel of the adventurer’s squadron The legion gave it up. Now Annas only hopes that the leader of the Undead Legion is smart enough to go after the adventurers who are obviously better packed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark fog, the 'dark side of the moon' is coming and going, pouring a profit arrow to the adventurer’s head and shooting them. Ghost crying wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s black mist haunts, a greenish flame can’t stop pouring from him, rising high, then turning into a big group Black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain such a large illusion, even Rogge is extremely difficult. Fortunately, Heinrich took a circle in this world, leaving a lot of death, and Rogge now casts Necromancer to do more with less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dark side of the moon, Rumsfeld has led thousands of elf warriors. All the elves face such an evil, horrible and powerful illusion, showing obvious fear and uneasiness, even if this illusion is their god's display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the tight lineup of the Anath forces allowed Rogge to be afraid. The commander of this army is obviously a veteran of the battle. Now the scale of the illusion has reached the limit that Rogge can bear. The time drags on it for a long time. If he sees the flaws and throws the troops to kill, then it is not easy to clean up. It is now that this unit is behind the heavy infantry temple, covering the archer slowly retreating, and the arrow rain that flies in the sky makes the ‘the dark side of the moon’ fall down a dozen elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rumsfeld! You shoot a few infantry soldiers behind the temple to try!" Rogge ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld took the exquisite magical longbow behind him, his sharp eyes looked at the armor of the heavy infantry in the distance, and then five arrows Such as Ray as electric shot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long arrow that shines green light crosses 100 meters in front of the eye, and the hole wears five heavy infantry helmets! The forces of Annas suddenly became confused, but they quickly returned to normal under the command of the commander. After shooting five arrows, Rumsfeld’s face was white and had to pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge waved and let Rumsfeld stop. His heart is very angry, this time to attack the city of the gods is not only an adventurer, this unit in front of the eyes is clearly the elite of the regular army elite! This scene in front of him is exactly what he is most afraid of. Therefore, Rogge would rather consume the magical power of the elves and the illusion of the entire valley. In order to avoid being confronted with the army of the human state, how much effort he spent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all his efforts have been lost...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why This is the case with the soldiers! ? Rogge understands that there must be something happening, and there must be a major change in the Ayre Principality. Otherwise, no formal elite army will appear under the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by. The flame of the silver dragon has been extinguished, and the demon king in the air has never been able to struggle out of the gates of hell. The chaos of the human coalition was slowly stabilized. Although the arrows in the black fog were densely rained, causing heavy casualties to the adventurers and the aristocratic miscellaneous soldiers, the troops of Annas had stopped retreating, and the arrows that had returned were already It became orderly and began to cover the ground in the black fog piece by piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
