			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a vast forest, there are vaguely strange screams echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The figure is hidden in the forest, each time it flashes, it will span a distance of tens of meters. The bone dragon is completely turned into a virtual shadow, dragging a long blue-black light belt, whizzing through the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Gregory is much faster than ***. But it did its best, but it barely caught up with the looming figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly stopped, she leaned back to the sky, and the twilight double eyebrows wrinkled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has an emergency stop, the volley floats behind the back, the two pairs of translucent thin wings are slowly waving, the front pair is The crystal blue, the latter pair is dark black like ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon is surprisingly quiet, it floats quietly in the air, watching nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sudden indescribable smell in the sky of the outer world. It seems that every drop of water is a little heavy. All the undead creatures have disappeared, and the clouds in the sky are smashing with strange details. They are already dead. I don’t know how many years of trees seem to be unbearable for this gloomy atmosphere. In the screaming, the small dead branches begin to fall. The ground breaks and falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind suddenly stopped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The wings suddenly opened, and the sudden increase in gravity caused the surrounding space to be distorted in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen ghosts have appeared in shape, and they have been attracted to the ground. When there are more than ten meters, the strongest ghosts are* The breath of ** was twisted into a clear smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear these eyeliners, *** backhand pulls a feather from the wing, a finger flicks, feathers break through the sky with lightning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second half of the flight, the feathers began to emit a faint white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of holiness is getting brighter and brighter. Later, a small feather is like a shining meteor, burning and breaking the sky outside the world. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meditation in the forest suddenly began to lean forward, and finally floated horizontally in the air, her silver eyes staring in the direction perpendicular to the feather track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon's look is tense, and its body is also bowed. The two pairs of thin wings are shaking in anxiously, and the blue and black colors gradually become apparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden wave of volatility in the sky, a huge magical array flashed, and the endless horror of breath fell from the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few huge black shadows have come out of the magic circle, roaring, can't wait to catch up in the direction of feather flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The wings suddenly suddenly received, slamming and slamming, the figure disappeared and disappeared! The brilliance of the bone dragon also jerked brightly, and chased down in the direction pointed out by the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, the master and the servant are already hundreds of kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry spirits of the kings are intertwined in the air, they have been deceived, the six huge black shadows are folded back, the opposite of flying feathers The direction is chasing away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forefront is a huge rot dragon, its fluttering sound is clearly audible even on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the kings swept through the place where the feathers were thrown out of the air, the distant *** also turned at the same time, turning around The feathers flew in the direction of the flight...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stepping into the door of the Elf Temple's own room, Rogge stopped. He jerked a few times and his face became white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajiani greeted her, she held Rogge and asked: "Rog, are you okay?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully felt the silver line leading to the distant world in the depths of the soul, but there was no abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog opened his eyes, smiled slightly, and patted Ajani’s little face, nothing happened. I am very dirty now, you take a shower with me, then pack up, we set off for Dresden. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni's pretty face suddenly stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Fengdie The cold voice sounded around Rogge: "Master, you are back! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the beautiful butterfly, and stroked her ears and washed it together!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly’s face suddenly became red, but she was still calm and whispered: People. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The habits that elves like to enjoy are vividly expressed in this bedroom in Zhaoyi. The large bathroom is enough to accommodate more than a dozen people. The walls are decorated with complicated Patterns, mostly telling the story of Hilo's miracles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge squinted in a hot bath, his eyes closed slightly, his body relaxed It’s down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni and Fengdie each have a large bath towel around them, Ajani gives Rogge a leg, and the wind butterfly massages Rogge. The head and shoulders.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two elf women are soft and delicate, but the martial arts are brilliant, and the force on the fingers can directly penetrate the bones. They also understand the human body structure. Jade refers everywhere, so that Rogge is a little comfortable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge’s mind is coming to the end, and he is desperately calculating the order of things to do. Time required, success possible, and remedies, alternatives, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of the Three Sacrifices The object that must be disposed of quickly, but for three sacrifices that have at least four levels of magic, Rogge really loves and hates, and is reluctant to kill.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but The sacrifices of Hilo's natural blind obedience are naturally resilience to erosion. Even for Rumsfeld, Rogge is dangerously and dangerously at the last moment to really disturb his calm state and crush his will. Only then has the appearance of a near-perfect shadow knight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the trick of the stubborn rituals can be used. The spirit of erosion The power is surprisingly huge. Just sifting up a Rumsfeld will let Rogge completely exhaust all the mental power, and it will definitely not work against Zhao Zhao’s erosion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge suddenly faced a new problem: the lack of mental strength to support his continued erosion!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, mental power or magical shock At that time, Rogge’s enormous mental power was almost inexhaustible and he’s also inexhaustible. I didn't think that there would be a day when the mental energy was overwhelmed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge didn't know how to increase his mental strength. Just when meditation enhances the magic, the spirit There will be a slight increase in force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't help but come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why, there is always a faint uneasiness in Rogge’s mind, and it seems that something very important has been ignored. But the situation at the moment is too complicated. He really can't calm down and think carefully about where the problem lies. Only clean up the mess left by the temple as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is by no means a person who is so selflessly considered for the elves, but the elf of the city of the gods is the greatest force he has ever mastered. As early as a little punk, Rogge understood the importance of the group. In order to thoroughly grasp this power, he must play this well-behaved God who does not know whether it is true or false, and arrange the future of the elves' destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was so much for the elves, Rogge never regretted. If the elves are not at the juncture of life and death, how can they get a human being to gesticulate and order? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no free lunch in the world, and Rogge has long understood this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaped from the hot pool water and shocked the two stunning Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a bath towel and wiped his body and said to the two stunned elves: "I have a good rest! Clean up the things, we immediately go out to Dre Stan! Tell Frei, let him come as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak is essential at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge already knew all the passing of the day, and also knew that the Amy and Death Class who had assassinated themselves were from the Northern Druid League. Frey is the only son of the wrath of the sky in the Great Druid of the North. He is there, no matter what, the other side has to vote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it’s critical, Frey will be a good shield and hostage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, brother! But, I must live now!" Rogge thought coldly as he wore his armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not too many, the two Elf women are also ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at Ajani and asked: "Is the two long-swords of the sacred attributes I brought from the Central Mountains still there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani said: "Yes, Lord Rogge. Your things are all collected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge loomed silver awns, looked up and down Ajini several times, Shen Shen said: "You are too bad now this sword. Go for the sword marked with clouds, it is more suitable for you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for you!" Rogge looked at the wind butterfly, took off the huge wheel saw on her back, and said coldly: "This is me." Teach you the first lesson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Rogge took out a small leather bag and poured a few drops of purple-black liquid from it. Above the wheel saw. The green brilliance on the wheel saw immediately darkened, and gradually, a faint purple light came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a toxin that is condensed by human resentment and fear. It has great toxicity and madness. Your wheel saw is now called It’s a terrible weapon. Although it doesn’t taste very good, it’s just a few days.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smell a person on the wheel saw The smell, the wind butterfly almost fainted. She barely carried the wheel saw on her back, her face was pale, and she almost fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ignored the wind butterfly and hurried down the stairs. Ajani and Fengdie rushed to keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a chaos downstairs. The soldiers of the dark side of the moon received an urgent order and were coming from the temples of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, only the remaining 400-year-old dark-faced warriors gathered in front of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the most elite Elf warriors with one hand, and the brutal battles of months brought their beautiful faces murderous look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge doesn’t say anything, just wave his hand, when the first horses go to Dresden, Ajani and the wind butterfly follow, After the soldiers of the dark side of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, the upper level of the elders’ home, Hughes, is looking at the elf warriors who rushed out of the gate like a tidal wave, and smugly sipped a drink: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really motivated! It’s really young, oh! Hey! It seems that my old man has to work harder! Move instantly... okay The guy has to deal with just the group moving instantly. Mom! It will really give me a problem! Oh! Interfering with the ten-level magic, is this not my life? The secret of this fat boy is quite wise, so the elderly are so wise. See how long you can still win me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dresden was very calm these days, but there was a wave of uneasiness in the calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civilians couldn’t know what the secrets of the great aristocracy and the court were, but they smelled something from the abnormal behavior of the nobles. These days, there are always big nobles who have moved their family property out of Dresden, many of which are still secret. Many small and medium-sized bureaucrats have no smiles on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Annas and his hunting squad escaped from the Central Mountain Range a few days ago. It is said that the beautiful and rich elves did not know when they had become a dead city. Countless soldiers and adventurers saw the devil. The horror scene that is resurrecting! The sky blood cloud clearly shows the world of death where the devil comes from blood and bones. It also kills the lives of thousands of soldiers and adventurers with the magical magic of incomparable evil and horror! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Hilley repeatedly thought about what Rogge had said about suppressing the demons with the blood of the elves, so tired that his head was white again. less. The old fox, who has been rolling in the power for many years, knows the depth and horror of this new court magister. He instinctively felt that such a character would never die so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillley suddenly remembered an old story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ancient wise emperor, in order to test his loyalty, deliberately pretend to be seriously ill. So the princes who usually care about the two princes jumped out. After they performed almost the same, the emperor suddenly recovered his health and wiped out the restless people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case Rogge is not dead? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silee scared a cold sweat! It’s really easy for a big magician to pretend to die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand trembled, grabbed a glass of ice water and drank it. The cold water calmed his fear a little. With many years of experience in political struggle, Hille knows that if Rogge is not dead, he is afraid of being a bloody hurricane in Dresden, in his capacity as a court magician and Princess Adele. It is. A small country like the Ayre Principality is the power of the country, and it is not necessarily the opponent of a horrible magician like Rogge. All kinds of intelligence in the hands of Hille showed that the troops led by the Duke of Annas had caused great losses to the elves. Although they were defeated, it was not surprising that they were defeated in the hands of the devil. Moreover, more than two hundred elf prisoners will still let Annas get rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great feud, Rogge is bound to retaliate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sileley calmed down, and he couldn’t help but hate Carlos’ weakness. After Rogge’s bizarre death, he was scared by the three kingdoms behind the Duke of Annas, and he slammed the elf’s hands. No matter whether the devil will be resurrected, but if Rogge is only pretending to be dead, then by his means, the terrible will not be much less than the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Hiles thought, it became more and more likely that Rogge would not die. This intuition of political danger is an important reason why he has not fallen for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps back and decided to make more preparations. Compared to the weak Carlos, he decided to put more chips on the heart of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old state affairs book pulled the bell, and told the incoming housekeeper: "Go to a clever person, please ask the palace general manager to come to me anyway today." Come here once, I have something to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtmaster of the courthouse sneaked out of the back door of Hilley’s brother. There was an all-mark, ordinary caravan waiting there. The general manager jumped into the carriage and went all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage disappeared at the end of Long Street, Hilley felt that a big stone in his heart fell to the ground and covered the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilay feels that he can finally sleep well tonight. He turned and smiled and stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know when there were three more people behind him, one of them was a deadly long-time Rogge! Rogge stood behind and left an elf. Hilary recognized the huge wheel saw and couldn't help but scare a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at Shire with a smile: "Very good! Hilley, I really didn't misread you! Your political vision and sense of smell." I am fully happy to be in the status of you. I am really happy to be with people like you. Now, are we talking to your room? I really like your home wine!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is of course! Master Rogge, please come with me!" Hilley first led the way. His clothes had already been soaked in cold sweat, and he couldn't help but secretly renew his instinct for danger to save his family again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the small porcelain bottle in front of her eyes, Hilley’s eyelids jumped a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hillary," Rogge opened his mouth and threw a sigh of hope in the meditation. "Now, I want to get all the information of Mr. Clark, who is the nobleman who is playing with my beloved Princess Adele. I want his information, the more the better! I can touch My nephew's bed, I hope this kid is not a guy with no background. No, no, I don't need to rest, I will wait here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night sky did not know when it was covered with dark clouds, and a piece of snow fell quietly. The whole of Dresden fell into a warm silence. Most people will shrink into a warm bed at this time and have a good dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house of Rogge is now completely devoid of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! A loud noise pierced the silence of the night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy oak door in the bedroom was kicked openly, and the dark interior sounded an exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the glimmer of the entrance, you can see a man and a woman sitting on the big bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is so bold! Give me a name, see if I can't cut your head!" Because of anger, Adele's voice became Sharp and profitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dare to come in like this, you are so courageous!" This low voice belongs to Clark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud laugh at the door: "I have to apologize for disturbing the two good dreams! But I am a nobleman, I will not be casual." Into someone else's home, I am just returning to my bedroom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright magical flame illuminates the entire room, letting Clark and A Muir is so faint. When they saw the door, they turned out to be Rogge. They were all scared at the moment. Adele ate and said, "Rogue! Are you not dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge took off the cloak and handed it to Ajani standing behind him, then smiled and went to the big bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adele saw that Rogge was a living person, and he was a lot more courageous: "Rogge! Losing you is also a nobleman! How so rude! I And Clark's business, I will explain it to you in the future! Now, you and your men go out first, I have to change clothes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark also recovered Calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Rogge does not intend to act in accordance with the customary tacit agreement between the nobility. He opened the big quilt and screamed, Clark and Adele's body was immediately exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge!! You dare to be so rude!" Adele was busy covering his body and shouting. Clark looked at Rogge and looked at the heavily armed Ajani and the wind butterfly behind him. He said with a smile: "Roger! Your performance today." It’s not like a gentleman! I will remember this thing!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped out of bed and walked to the clothes scattered on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani stepped forward and stepped on his clothes. The sword tip of Jinyun had already reached Clark’s throat and forced him back step by step. Bed. The wind butterfly moved over a chair and let Rogge sit comfortably in front of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Count Clark, I know that you and Princess Adele have had a long time of friendship, according to the etiquette of the upper class, since you have no plans Taking away Miss Adele and not affecting my life, then I have no right to interfere with your love with Adele. I also know that your father is the brother of Grand Marshal Elafus of the Kingdom of Leighton, and he I also mastered the army and territory. The court magician of a small duchy like me, although the count, is not in the same position as you." Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark covered his lower body with his hands, his face was frozen and white, and he said: "You know everything! I dare to do this to me? I was still ready to help." Ayre's Principality, but now you don't want to count on anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled low and said: "I know more than that, I also know that your true father is King Romont of the Kingdom of Leighton! You are very talented and ambitious. Compared with your eleven brothers and twenty-two sisters, you are synonymous with genius. Your Father, I mean the nominal one, and your uncle is very supportive of you at the right time to get what you originally belong to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adele looked at Clark with amazement and forgot the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't panic, Clarke Ronmon. I am not a person who doesn't know etiquette. On the contrary, I am a true aristocrat. I am still a magician. Teacher, the magician is not interested in the power of the world, and I am no exception. All I want is to let the poor elf following me have a place to live, so I will use it for the Principality of Aray in exchange for respect. The Grand Duke of Crick allowed the elves to legally live in Aray. You know now, I don’t really want much. But now some people have to destroy my small desires, so I am coming back this time. I am here to ask for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark snorted and put some shelves on it, only faintly said: "You mean that behind the Duke of Annas, it is called ice and snow. Three raptors in the highlands of the Three Kingdoms? What do you want? Want us to let the Layton Kingdom come forward to let them retreat? This is not difficult, do you have any other requirements?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge smiled: "Retiring is not difficult, but surrender It is difficult. I want to join the League of Layton and erase the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands from the list of the Holy Alliance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark was shocked: "You want to be sacred Is there a war in the alliance? The Three Kingdoms in the Highlands are not so good to deal with!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the eyes of the most powerful Layton Kingdom in the Holy Alliance, ice and snow The three raptors are just three snow pheasants. I will soon let Mr. Annas, who is in danger, take a look at whether the elves under my command are so easy to grasp. Our two countries have joined forces, and within a month, the highlands of the Three Principalities will No longer exist. Don't you be interested? Is there anything better than warfare to enhance your prestige? And prestige is the cornerstone of your supreme power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark sank: "The words are correct, but what can the Kingdom of Layton get from it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two largest Principalities in the Three Principalities of the Highlands will become Ray The province of the kingdom. And, my elf warriors will be your forever friends. I have the best killer in my hand. If any of your brothers offended you in the morning, as long as you like, then he will become a dead body before the sun rises the next day. You know, the reputation of the elves has always been the highest. I can rest assured on behalf of the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark is so excited. He is not an incompetent generation. He knows the cruelty in the process of seizing power. If a big magician and a group of terrorist killers help each other, the winning position will be much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is still not at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your suggestion, will Carlos agree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roghaha smiled, Waving a trick, Adele suddenly screamed into his arms. As he touched Adele's smooth belly, he smiled and said: "It is not important for Carlos to agree to disagree. As long as Adele has agreed, it will be fine. At that time, her little life in her stomach. It is the natural heir of the Principality of Aray."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adele is again exclaimed, but she is a woman with great power desire, soon The face is bright. Clark also thought about it. The conditions that Rogge opened were really tempting, and he knew what the children in the belly of Adele were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger" Clarke hesitated and asked: "So is your harvest too little?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only one purpose of my request: to give the Elf people equal rights throughout the Holy Alliance, to declare the Elf slave trade illegal, and to violate the criminal punishment. It is not difficult to understand that I am pursuing the infinite power and wealth of magic. Hearing, the secular power has no meaning to me at all. In fact, this is also good for the Holy Alliance. You must have heard about the elf city. The demon Amorro almost succeeded in resurrection. If it broke through the seal, it would be finished. Wouldn’t it be just the Principality of Aray? This reason is enough to convince other countries of the Holy Alliance to support us in crusade against the Three Kingdoms of the Highlands.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark stared at Rogge and asked : "You are not afraid that I have promised you now, and then repent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge faintly replies: "You are not a stupid person. This transaction is right. You only have the benefit and no harm, why should you refuse? ? If you have betrayed me, I would have been born in the tragedy of your brothers who, maybe your body will be born in the "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Rogke waved his hand, and the wind butterfly stepped forward. The dark green boots gently stepped on the ground. Clark's used fine sword suddenly jumped from the ground. After the purple light flashed, the fine sword was cut into thin in the air. Two thin pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge waved again, the fragments of the fine sword were melted into an iron ball by the black demon flame, and the local land fell on the ground and burned the gorgeous carpet. A big hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sneered: "Compared with the seal of Amorro, killing an individual in the kingdom of the Principality of Layton is not a difficult thing."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark's face is completely blue. He stared at the iron ball on the ground for a long time, finally gave a sigh of relief and I underestimated you, I apologize! Our agreement was established! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog stood up and took a shot on Adele's mellow slogan and smiled: "I really didn't look at the wrong person!" I hope that after two weeks, the coalition forces of our two countries will be able to assemble on the border. There is still a long time from dawn, I will not bother both. You see, I am a real aristocrat! Haha! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long laugh, Rogge left with Ajani and the wind butterfly. The heavy oak door slowly closed, and the bedroom was again It’s a darkness...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge went to the end of the corridor and walked out through the window. The fat figure was quick and inextricably, and it appeared throughout the blink of an eye. In the tallest clock tower in the government, the figure of Wind Butterfly and Ajani appeared behind him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down to the sleeping Dresden, Rogge couldn't help but sigh gently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani asked: "What are you thinking about? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge replied with some despair: "I was thinking of a terrible reloading Knights, the Golden Lion Knights." They should not exist now? Unfortunately, because of the physical limitations, the elf can never train such a terrible reloading knight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani and the wind butterfly are both confused, they have never heard of this Knights. However, the Knights who can make Rogge so respected, I think the fighting power is very good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly asked: "Master, are you ready to let the two people just let go?" Adele is your wife. Does the man not insult you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "The lover is a very ordinary game in the nobility." They are also very useful, and there is no need to misunderstand our big things for this little thing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So how are you going to pack them? Are you prepared to violate the promise made in the name of the elves? "The wind butterfly is chasing after it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiles at the butterfly, you want to learn how to deal with this situation will tell you, but you are very It’s hard to learn. I’m sure I won’t let Clark’s go, dare to put the dog’s paw on my head. How can I make him have a good life? However, I will not violate my promise. His ambition is not small, identity. Special and talented. In the past few years, there have been a lot of things in the dark. Why should we use such a knife to kill such a person? A secret letter is enough to make him annihilate!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly thought for a long time, suddenly remembered something, trembled and asked: "You said that my sacrifice of the day is very stupid. Since you are so obedient, then what is Rumsfeld now? What? I know that you will never let us go, but...but you will not violate your promise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue faintly authentic : "Wind butterfly, are you not ready to think about the answer to this question yourself? Ready to let go of pride Ask me directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly only feels that the body is getting colder and colder, and the concern for Rumsfeld finally let her put down her arrogance: "Yes, I want to know the answer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Templar Rumsfeld is no longer there. All that exists is the Shadow Knight Raphael."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow Knight! I have not promised me. If I sign a contract, will I leave him a life?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge’s voice is as cold as it has just blown from the snow peak: “I promised you to leave him a life, so he left him, but erased his soul; the same, I promised him to give you The soul is free, and I have obeyed my promise, just to have your body. So, it is foolish to sacrifice each other. Moreover, you think that with the consciousness of your own sacrifice, you can be worthy of yours. Negligence, peace of mind to ask for the rescue of the other party? The life of the hundred soldiers, how cheap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
