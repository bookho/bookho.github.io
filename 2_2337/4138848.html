			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the heavens under the fifteenth abyss in hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man looked back The Death Class, and turned to look at Androni, there is a difficult face: "You two seem to be together, do you want to go together? I have no hatred with you, that is, there is hatred, and there is very little hatred. Can't forgive. What's more, the two sacred strongs have joined hands to deal with me. Isn't this an unfaithful act?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class smiled and said "The battle between me and you has nothing to do with her. The things between her and you have nothing to do with me. I want to kill you, do you still need to face several enemies at the same time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni said: "It’s a reputation to take a girl who is not as good as yours to go back to trial. Who can guarantee that you are fair and honorable? Why don’t you take the pope? Grab the first trial, don't tell me that he has no original sin. The real reason is that you dare not? Less nonsense with me, I tell you, the old opposite I don't know. I only care about this one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man has been indulging for a long time and said: "I understand, you still have to go together. I The name is Constantine, the devout cultivator. How do you call it? Maybe in the matter of this confused soul, we can discuss it. I am not malicious, but the will of the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class and Androni quietly glanced at each other, and the Death Class coughed a sigh: "Strauch." Androni said: "Alexander. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man is obviously stunned and said to himself: "Strao? Is it the same name as the Imperial? Isn’t it, isn’t Alexander more than fifty? How could it be a young girl?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was distracted, a starless sword and a blue sky of blue sky have already He stabbed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin was shocked. A long hair suddenly floated! He raised his hands and slammed the chains and danced, entangled the stars. The golden light shines on the chain, and the blue light of the blue sky is stirring. The two were deadlocked together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin once again screamed, the whole body has completely become transparent, radiating dazzling blindness from the inside and outside of the body. The slashing sword of the Death Class passed through his body like a snake, and it was very viciously twisted a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin, who has become a light man, has a cry, and a random portal has suddenly appeared at his feet. He immediately rushed in. In the process of running away, he smashed a sword in the death class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The random portal slowly closed. Inside, there was Constantine’s intermittent voice: “I will definitely come back... take away the confused soul!... Redemption...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I finished, I was interrupted by a violent cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After repelling Constantine, both the Death Class and Androni were not happy. Constantine's holy power is very strong, he can deceive him once, and certainly can't fool the second time. If you fight seriously, this will be a very difficult opponent. Is the tentacles of the bright church once again reaching out to the North? This is by no means a trivial matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni raised the wind butterfly that was almost collapsed and held her in her arms. Then said: "Ban Daren, have you sensed where the dead fat man is? He suddenly disappeared in my sense of the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death class frowned: "I also lost my sense of him. But the place where he finally disappeared was Straw's Prime Minister's Office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was caught by Straw. Going?” Androni was surprised and said: “Is there any powerful person in Straw House? Let’s take the dead fat man back!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Death Class shook his head and sighed: "There may be people I know well in Straw House. I just protect Rogge from Nicholas. I don't want to intervene."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni stared fiercely at the Death Class for a long time, and he angered: "Good! If you don't go, then I will go!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class jumped in front of Androni and said: "The Straw House has opened a deep red field. If you go alone, there is only one dead road. ! "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;The Death Brothers sighed: "What good is it that you are sent to death? The alliance between the city of Clouds and Straw is not very close. I was strictly a guest in the city of Yunxiao. So I only know The Terrayao Prime Minister’s Office is guarded by the deep red field, and is completely afraid of the sanctuary. I don’t know the specific secrets. So let’s go back. The wind butterfly doesn’t seem to support it. As you both go to the Prime Minister’s House to grab people, you will have much more confidence. As for me, I will follow Constantine to see which side he represents.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni thinks carefully, knowing that the Death Class is justified. However, she still felt that it was difficult to accept the standing watch of the Death Class. Therefore, she glared at the Death Class and held the wind butterfly. Of course, she flew to Pompei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fell directly from the air into Pompei. In a flash, the magic or vindictiveness of several probes swept past her. Then there is no movement. Androni ignored the actions of these probes. Directly holding the wind butterfly through the window, fell into the room of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pompei, although it does not have the mysterious protection of the deep red field like the Straws. However, he and Alexander took the soldiers for many years, and the two legions of the corps were hiding in the dragon. These people have a very rich experience in combat and cooperation. Although individuals are outside the sanctuary, it is Androni who is against them and never dare to care. Moreover, with the arrival of Rogge, at least three or five Sanctuary strongmen wander around Pompei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if it is a sanctuary, if you dare to come to explore Pompei, it is doomed to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni gently placed the butterfly on Rogge’s bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly has fallen into a semi-conscious state at the moment, his cheeks are like fire, and his body is very hot. Androni had some doubts. She untied the armor of the butterfly and found no scars. After detecting the temper, she did not find serious damage in her body. It seems that just as Constantine enveloped the body of the butterfly with the light, but only washed the blood on her body. Did not cause any substantial harm to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni knows that under the double curse of darkness and bloodthirsty, the physique of the wind butterfly has completely turned into a dark attribute, the power of any divine attribute. Will cause harm to her. But Constantine's bloody stains on the Swallow's butterfly with such a strong light did not cause any harm to her! Obviously, his manipulation of the divine power has become superb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not exaggerate, even if his strength is equal to Androni. Only by his deep understanding of strength can he kill Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Constantine really as he said. No malice at all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether he is malicious or not, he is not allowed to give him the wind butterfly! Androni thought with a bad heart. Proud of her at the moment is very uncomfortable, people who dare to despise her strength, there has only been a windy month. Although her strength is still far away from those long-established Sanctuary powerhouses, but as she is so young, she enters the sanctuary, and how many can there be on the mainland? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fiery hand suddenly held Androni’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly has woke up, but her mind clearly did not recover. The beautiful eyes burned with a blazing flame. Her other hand slid to Androni's neck, and the half-naked body was tightly attached to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was shocked and immediately remembered that this was probably the result of a double curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the butterfly became a dark essence, she was so confusing and a little wild. This point does not damage her face, but adds to her charm. Looking at the beautiful butterfly, how can Androni control himself? What's more, there is also a hallmark for helping the wind butterfly to solve the curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and looked at the light lips that the butterfly sent, and kissed it heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni waved a blue-blue grudge. Seal the door firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is full of spring, and the blood outside the house is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a more person in the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gray-robed silver-haired woman is the windy moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her. Gregory, who is just a meter long, is proudly floating in the air. It is busy setting the classic posture of the legendary dragon legends and trying to show his perfect new body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although at this height, people who are slightly inferior on the ground will only think that the sacred dragon Gregory is a flying bat. This is still under the premise of careful identification. At this moment, there is a bloody emperor everywhere, and who will be bored to look at the sky? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy moon stretches out the snowy right hand and gently touches the void in front of him. Before her fifties, a dark red glow slowly emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon touched this dark red glow, concentrating on its ground force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the city of Richelieu, Hughes and the incarnation of Serafi’s Wella began chasing again. Their speed is still incredible. It’s just that the spiritual fluctuations that come and go in the air make people laugh and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina Master! Rogge is entering the abyss of Barto! You are not going to save him. Just look after me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can the Bata Abyss have direct exports in this world? There is at most a projection of a crack in the abyss! Old things are dead. You still want Lie to me! Do you think that I am an idiot who doesn't understand the multi-faceted space?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Look, Fengyue is also here! If she looks By the time you stand by, you will be angry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is studying the deep red field, she didn't pay attention to this side. Hey, Fengyue this guy... let her slow Let's go slowly! Anyway, Rogge's life and death have nothing to do with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes flashed a few swords that Weina waved in succession and shouted: " Master Wella, you killed me and will soon face despair again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina smiled softly and said: "That's what it is." Since despair is inevitable, it is better to solve the problem at hand! This world is not a word, it is called when you have alcohol and you are drunk first. If you do not solve it, I am always upset, maybe you are behind the scenes. The biggest black hand!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sullenly said: “How do you want to let me go?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me cut a sword first, then stay in my field for half an hour!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina suddenly flies Stopped and looked at the direction of the wind and the moon. Hughes also felt. I also looked at the Prime Minister's Office. However, he did not stop, but the speed was accelerated, and he escaped without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is not too angry! She looked at the direction in which Xiusi left, and looked at the sky in the wind, and struggled for a long time in her heart. Finally she paused and flew to the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right fist of Fengyue shines a little light. This light is getting brighter and brighter. In a twinkling of an eye, it became a dazzling ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like a sudden rise in the night sky, the radiance of the wind and the right fist has already illuminated the entire neighborhood! She suddenly uttered a clear whistle that resounded throughout the emperor. A boxing in front of the crimson light curtain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sounds of heaven and earth disappeared at this moment...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a huge, The hemispherical red mask that shrouded the entire prime minister's house suddenly appeared, and the dark red light wave undulated and gradually darkened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground around the Prime Minister’s Office, a soil wave suddenly appeared! This wave has spread more than 20 meters before it gradually disappears. Then there was a slamming sound, and all the buildings where the earth and waves hit the place collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue petite figure has been thrown into the sky, her silver eyes have an instant loss. The blink of an eye has returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the dark red mask that looked like nothing change, and her frowns wrinkled. A little bit of good looks began to appear on her right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue looked at Wei Na, and the light on his right hand was still getting brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to crack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the use of the cracked red field? The following is a projection of the Barto abyss. You don't know the Bata abyss, how can you go in and save people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go in and say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina screamed: "We have the divine power, and there is not much power in the abyss. You are the one who believes in power and decides everything, where It may not be able to beat Rogge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue does not look at Wei Na, she waved her hand. A ball of light with enormous power once again flew to the deep red field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't go, then of course I am going." Feng Yue is faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep red field is full of four crawling electric fires, and Straw falls to the ground again in the shaking of the earth. His deputy, a giant sword, waved a glimpse of his crystal chandelier to one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stougher finally climbed up and asked: "What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy replied: "Someone is attacking the deep red field! But it seems that we are quite good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" Straw Double Eyebrow lock: "They actually have strong players who can attack the deep red field! Is it the death class and Andrea's hand? But they should not have this ability right! Is there another Sanctuary on their side? And Rockefeller. Isn't that four Sanctuary strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stroub took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy carefully asked: "Adult, if the deep red field is broken, what should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Strauch angered: "Is it foolish! If they can break through the deep red field, what else can we do? Of course it is surrendering! Do you think that such an enemy is something we can deal with?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy, but Nono, even claimed to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in addition to the two earth-shattering attacks, the deep red field did not suffer more attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, Wella looked helplessly at the windy moon and said: "Okay! I went to the abyss of Barto to bring him out, this can always Anyway, anyway, if you go there, you will die. It’s better to go. You honestly give me back to the abandoned land and do a good job of preparation. This process is by no means as easy as you think. Ok, you will be completely destroyed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she wanted to return to the world of death, Wella suddenly smiled: "Fengyue. Remember you owe me once!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger is not covered in this cloak, his robes have been broken into rags, and the upper body is completely red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the top of a high cliff and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only black and red colors in the world. The lava in the rift is surrounded by flames, and the wind is full of sulfur. On the black rocks of the lava, one figure is slowly moving. Due to the influence of rising fog, Rogge could not see the true appearance of these figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After counting the number of these figures, Rogge’s eyebrows are tightly locked together. He looked up again at the sky, the burning fire clouds in the sky, and the space door when he came was long gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still stood behind a pretty girl, Serena, who was kicked in by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damage to her clothes is far more than Rogge, almost almost the same as naked. She is exposed to a large amount of snowy white skin, but also traces of small scars and burns. Only the crimson giant sword is still on her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
