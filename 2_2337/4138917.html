			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of the silver sect of the sect of the mountain ended in disastrous defeat. There were no effective figures among the first believers, most of whom were near the village. People and townspeople, attacked by a team of blood, only a few warriors and travel mages did not help. In the face of the eye-catchers who have prepared for war and occupied the wisdom of the heavens, they once again replayed the scene of Zolamu City’s downswing and the attacking of the tiger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the narrow winding road, the bodies of the believers are stacked like mountains! The believers of the Eye of Wisdom even rushed out of the fortifications and concealed the downhill, and they were eager to eat the thousands of sects. Fortunately, a group of followers who arrived later were the samurai and snow sorcerers of the nearest silver sacred church in Auburn Hills. Their fighting power and ordinary believers are not allowed. Same day. The Ice and Snow Masters do their utmost to bless the faith and courage of the believers, and they are able to stabilize the impending break. Seeing that there is no cheaper in the eyes of wisdom, I will return to the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrior and Snow Master saw the terrain of Auburn Hills and decided to temporarily encircle the mountain and wait for the arrival of the support. In the next few days, believers in the silver sacred religions, such as Baichuan, entered the sea and gathered around Auburn Hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, the advance and retreat dispatch of the Eye of Wisdom has been undertaken by the mad believer and several Degaeus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the mountain, temporarily set up on the altar of the altar, the holy woman Mora has been here since the moment she went up the mountain, praying sincerely. Her appearance is holy and refined, as if the whole body has been integrated into the praise of the goddess. The milky white glow emerged from her chest and gradually spread to the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This miracle! The believers of the Eye of Wisdom cheered and thundered, and they called the name of the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, the radiance of the Virgin Mary is strong, and the radiant and beautiful radiance is not to be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Rogge and Sousse negotiated the final details, and said goodbye to Straw, and Androni, Fu Luo Ya and Xiusi quietly left Richelieu, and they met with the Darkton Warrior, who had already waited outside the city. Go all the way north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after Rogge’s departure, the Ice and Snow Temple suddenly burst into flames, and the melodious bells rang through Richelieu! An urgent message through the snow in the cold wind, spread the silver saints in the main church in the northern part of the empire. After a few moments, countless clergymen flew out of the church and scattered in all directions. Begin to call out the followers of the Holy Family from house to house and rush to tell them what they are. In the afternoon, a car full of believers drove out of the city. From all sides to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple of ice and snow, the wizard Jema kept making an order. She claims that these are the gods of the goddess of ice and snow. Although she does not explain the specific content of the gods, all the clergy have already felt the seriousness of the situation, because the core content of all the instructions of Jiema is only one point, requiring all Goddess believers must immediately drop everything and rush to the northern ice sheet. And remove all enemies that hinder the believers from advancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unprecedented convening order in the Faith! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of the sacred believers also alarmed the masters of secular power. Of course, the city defense army did not block the church from going out of the city, not to mention that many of them were also saints, and even those who were devout responded to the goddess of the goddess of ice and snow, took leave to leave their duties, and joined the ranks of the city's devotees. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the City Defense Forces timely reported the news to the Imperial Palace, and the generals who took on the reporting task were introduced in layers, and finally saw the general manager Sarah Wenger. The coveted old man sat on the bench with a leather-covered face outside the Great Emperor, squinted at the report and said nothing. Just waved and gestured to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge sand table in the center of the Great Emperor's study. The terrain of the entire empire and surrounding countries is concentrated on the sand table, and it is meticulous. The emperor stood by the sand table. Looking at the Longines Sea intently. At the opening of the study door, the boss slowly walked in. He coughed, and both Rogge and the saints left the emperor and went north. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Baha'i raised his head and some unexpectedly said: "They started the decisive battle so soon?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss is weak and powerful: "I heard that today, Rogge’s adult has just left, the goddess of ice and snow has gone down to the gods and summoned all believers to the north." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss always nodded: "It seems to be the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach is cold and cold: "The two goddesses are slowly fighting, the most It’s good to lose both. This plane does not need God!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical light in the Great Snow Temple is very strong, in the strong light, the old face of Ji Ma The shadow bucket of every wrinkle looks even deeper! Her mouth was almost vertical on her face, her eyes sharp as an eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that all the instructions were quickly and steadily delegated, Ji Ma went to the altar room of the statue of the goddess to the rear of the Great Shrine. It was listed as an absolute forbidden place from the early morning, and no one except her was allowed to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, almost all the cleaning staff in the ice and snow temples were beaten to mobilize believers. And Jima stood in the middle of the main hall, watching the temple that had become empty, and the murderousness suddenly disappeared, leaving only the years to bring old and desperate destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima suddenly coughed up, only to listen to her screaming and coughing, it’s as if it’s going to cough up, it’s worrying she’s watching It seems to have weakened the fire of life, and it will be extinguished in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she finally calmed down the cough, slowly moved to the altar of the altar, and took a brass key with a trembling hand and opened the lock. However, the two doors made of hard silver were extremely heavy. She almost reached the door with the strength of the whole body, and opened a gap that was just allowed to enter and exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima entered the hall and covered the door with remnant power. This action almost consumed the rest of Ji Ma's life, her face was wrinkled deeper, and her glutinous rice became more turbid. Ji Ma leaned against the door of the temple, and he was heavily breathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a singular scream in the hall, like a woman screaming. The source of the sound is actually a goddess of ice and snow goddess behind the altar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful face of the god is slightly distorted, slightly embarrassing and anxious. What is even more strange is that she has slowly shed a bloody red tear in her left eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima's hand trembles and reaches out to the image, already incoherent: why? The greatest goddess, what is your god? Tell me, tell Nicole to be the most devout believer! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Jima kept on praying, the goddess of ice and snow received was violent and boring, full of anger, hatred, panic and uneasiness. The emotions, like the undulating spirits between the waves and valleys, can not wash the soul of Jima, making her consciousness drifting. It seems that it is possible to leave the body at any time and turn into a blue smoke!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima is struggling to support, and some of the gray heads are slowly turning into white.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how is she going? Try to distinguish. It is like listening to a young child’s crying in a storm. She knows that the goddess of ice is talking, but she can’t hear what she is saying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy suddenly slammed the door. Two blood flowed out of her nose, and she fell softly on the ground. Her strength was exhausted, and the connection with the goddess of ice was finally completely cut off by the storm around the goddess. The sound call now sounds like a meaningless shout.<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima is no longer in contact with the goddess of the goddess of ice and snow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not because she is not pious enough, nor because of the goddess of ice and snow I am angry with her. All this is because the unnatural storm that accompanied the goddess of ice and snow has completely obscured the voice of the goddess of ice and snow!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of existence is there. Can we suppress the voice of the goddess?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jima has a chill in every fingertip. She has used the Ice and Snow Temple for many years. Accumulate the magic of the goddess of the goddess of ice and snow to the holy church in the northern part of the empire. Even if the goddess of ice and snow has a new god, there is no extra magic to spread the message to such a vast place.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the saints who received the message at this time must have embarked on the journey, even if there is a new god, they can't reach them.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while. Kima opened the door to the altar. She is full of red light, full of spirits, and her eyes are extremely sharp. Every time I step down, I will take the wind and thunder! A shrine warrior immediately greeted Master Ma, what do you have to tell? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare a carriage! I want to go to the north! "Jima shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Richelieu is cold in the field, all the rivers are frozen, and the wind is whistling. The street is cold and clear, no People are willing to go out in such weather.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rumble of the wheel, a carriage with the symbol of silver in the saints gallops through the empty streets. Flying to the north gate. There is a luxury hotel next to the avenue. In front of the window on the fourth floor, a handsome and handsome man looks at the carriage all the way until it disappears at the end of the long street. This sighs and will sigh. The aged red wine in the goblet is drunk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can we be like these people, we can fight for the same goal, regardless of life and death, That's good. He said with emotion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miro, you have been here for too short. The human race is united, and most of the time it is to kill each other more efficiently. "The tall warrior is like this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro smiled, his smile was full of sunshine, enough to fascinate countless young girls. "Maybe. However, the Terran can unite from the killing, and can unite to deal with foreign enemies. This can be different from us. I don’t even want to kill them when I think of certain races. I don’t want to cooperate at all. But these years I actually endured it, and I can do a few things together. It’s really strange to think about it now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the extraordinary thing of Miro. If you are just empty, you are not worthy of following me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is it? "Miro smiled a bit, "If this can be considered a superior, my family... that's really hopeless!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the samurai and smiled: "If my strength is not enough, even if there are more people, how dare to put the back Leave it to you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The samurai did not follow this already sensitive topic, the new inspiring singer swayed, she not only blinked, but also fell into eternity. In the fear. I managed to calm her down, but I don't know when her fear will be done again. What do you think about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miro indulged in a while, but the old guy behind him was still contemptuous. Let me take a look at her situation first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basement was as dark as ever, and there was a cry of hysteria from time to time. Miro took the stage and he slid out The faint radiance not only dispels the darkness in the room, but also keeps the moisture, suffocation and filth outside. It seems that even if it is based on the millennium rot, Miro can maintain its own noble and clean.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his left hand. An invisible force lifted the female mage on the ground and pressed it firmly against the wall. Miro opened the cloak of the female mage Look closely at her face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom half of the face is smooth and delicate. It is very seductive, but the upper part is like being burned by fire. It is terrible. Her face The muscles rolled over and could not stop squirming. It seems that the meat is regenerating. The carrion does not live and the blood drops, the new meat continues to grow, but the new meat will quickly rot as soon as it touches the air, so half a day passes, her face The injury turned out to be no better! The female wizard seemed to be afraid again. She still wanted Called, but under the pressure of Miro's power, I couldn't even open my mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro carefully reached over and the fingertips just touched her face. Carrion, the petal bud suddenly blasts out! A silver electric fire is thrown out of it, accurately falling on the finger of Miro's lightning retracted, and the harsh sound of the smashing sound is as evil as a small beast. Drill into the meat of Miropi!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro’s face changes, and it instantly snaps over ten. A small group of bright purple fog will sway the silver Wrapped in electric fire and thrown at the corner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electric fire suddenly exploded, and the basement was filled with silver awns instantly! The next moment. The basement turned dim, silver The electric fire has gone with the purple mist that wraps it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The samurai fell into the stone, and there was no sympathy for the female mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro’s face sank and coldly said: “I can cure her injury, but I can’t cure her stupidity! This is useless. It’s a shame for her tutor! It’s a shame for her tutor! You have dealt with her!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those, Miro Trail left, and that The samurai looked at the female mage in the corner of the house, squeaking the knuckles and making a low-pitched laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past thousands of years, the surrounding of Bluestone Mountain has always been a forbidden place for powerful Warcraft. It is the power of the tyrannical dragon that does not dare to haunt in this area. The Frost Spears of the Frost Giants will be the nightmare of every dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the bluestone mountain hidden in the clouds all year round has become a ghost town! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slightly stronger presence of power, as soon as you enter the vicinity of Bluestone Mountain, it will disappear without a trace. Those powerful World of Warcraft have a keen instinct. After several powerful companions have disappeared, they have left their territory, and the emperor fled away from the place where the Bluestone Mountain was away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Bluestone Mountain is the home of the Frost Giants, who are not willing to leave their homes to escape anyway. Moreover, even if they want to escape, there is absolutely no way to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when, no matter how sinister the sacred dragon is, the Frost Giants are no longer willing to leave the top of the camp. In just a few days, hundreds of adult warriors have already fallen in half, and the terrible existence of the horrible existence is still unfinished, still lingering around the Bluestone Mountain, waiting for the opportunity to capture the giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frosty giant collar has faintly felt the final destiny of the family. He was shocked and angry, and challenged the existence several times, but she did not care. All he knows now is that every time a giant is missing, her strength will be a strong point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the bluestone suddenly burst into a rumble, and the dust and the wind rushed. In the smoke, suddenly two giant warriors flew out. They shouted loudly, and the loud voice sounded through the entire bluestone mountain! They fly a hundred meters high, draw a curve, and fall to the bottom of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frost Giants saw the whole thing in the distance, and the heart sank, knowing that it could not be rescued anyway. Falling from this height, the two giants are already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more than a dozen frost giants have rushed out of the camp and rushed to the whereabouts of the two giants. The Frost Giants screamed and forced them to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his order was too late. In the vigorous dragon humming sound, the sacred dragon did not know where to drill, lightning caught a giant warrior, and then avoided all throwing spears with amazing degrees and agility. Flying high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden explosion of thunder in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon that wraps around the dark thunder is quietly emerging, and then pulls out a faint illusion, which has been around in the moment when the frost giant’s collar has not yet blinked. The two giants who have not fallen to the ground have flew for dozens of laps! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s silver snake flutters in the hand, and the dragon soul warrior has passed through the bodies of two giants for dozens of times. Every puncture will tear off part of their soul and strength. Through the baptism of the Dragon of the Silver Dragon, into the body of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina who finished the killing condensed in the air and closed her eyes. Let the bodies of two giants who are already inconspicuous fall heavily. After a while, she opened her eyes. The golden cross star indifferently looked at the frosty giant collar on the top of the bluestone. The demon lotus is now dark and clear, and between the light and the waves, from time to time, it will blow up a series of finely divided mines. Occasionally, a small group of thin silver fog is sprayed at the tip of the dragon soul gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frost Giants are extremely angry, but he knows that going downhill to challenge Wella will only add another strength to her. He suddenly screamed and raised a boulder, so that he could throw it at Weiner! It’s just that he and Weina are separated by a few kilometers at the moment. The boulder fell into the deep valley in less than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory's wings stretched and slowly landed behind Weina. It suddenly had a long mouth, hit a cockroach, and spewed a small group of pale white dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina spurted a white mist and smiled coldly at the Frost Giant. The giant warriors on the Bluestone Mountain have left little left, and they can't keep the defense line so long. And they are negligent. It will be the price of life. It won't be long before Weina can storm the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the giants of the entire Bluestone Mountain will become part of the power of Weina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks at the sky not too early, and at the end has already ate, ready to greet Gregory to leave. At this moment, Wella’s ear suddenly moved slightly, and Gregory turned his head and looked to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina master, *** master is calling us, but how do I feel that she is different from before?" The sacred dragon has some doubts ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She took another step on the road to becoming a true God, so of course you will feel different. It's nothing strange." Weina's tone is faint But Gregory was keenly caught a trace of nothing, as if it were a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at the lead-colored sky silently, suddenly smiled and thought: "But ***...Do you want to be God?" How can there be such a cheap thing! You wait, I will find a way to smash your cold and cold shell sooner or later!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vina Master! Na master?” Gregory screamed in a row, and Wella returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Frost Giants here..." Foreseeing that the war will come with the call of the master, Gregory will feel his ability to improve these days. Still insignificant, its wise eyes immediately turned greedily to the top of the big guys with good power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at the top of the Bluestone, a rare smile has converged, coldly: "No need to worry! We still have two days. Although this I can't do anything at the time, but at least the biggest guy can't run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the eyes of the Frost Giants, the anger and the sacred The figure of the dragon has gradually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the endless snowfields of the Northland, Rogge is leading more than a thousand subordinates. A few days later, the Osser Highway leading to the northernmost tip of the empire is now at its end. Further to the front is the endless icefield. The ice sheet stretches to the horizon and the faint blue mountains are visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the dark side of the moon is made up of the most powerful elves, although each elf wears a special winter suit, the cold wind still makes them look green. In comparison, the thick tycoon Tickton warrior is simply enjoying the wind of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open space, vision is the most deceptive thing. It seems that the mountain that can be reached in a blink of an eye is so far away. Rogge led the army for two days before arriving at the scheduled mountain pass. At this time, on the ice sheet behind them, there have been squadrons of silver saints, and even Rogge’s eyesight has been able to see the flags of the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain pass is actually a narrow valley, easy to defend and difficult to attack. According to the original plan, Rogge, Androni and Hughes will continue to go north, and Froya will lead all the troops to guard the mountain pass and block all believers of the silver saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the separation, Rogge suddenly stopped and slowly turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cold wind, Fu Luoya, who is attacked by pure white, stands on the ice sheet, just like a delicate snow lotus, it seems that the gust of the Na is slightly stronger, Will blow her skin. The green eyes are faintly smeared with water and mist, if there are thousands of heartfelt complaints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she just stood there, didn't move, didn't talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a silver world, there is only a little bit of lips, so red is so beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly strode back! He opened his arms. A touch of smudge on the cheeks of Fu Luoya, she throws all the restraints, if a flying feather, suddenly into his arms! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya tried to hold Rogge's waist and buried his head in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Live alive!" Rogge whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
