			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ups and downs of the night made Rogge excited, tired, and a little funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything comes too fast and too suddenly, he has not had time to think well. But in fact, he simply didn't have time to think about how to deal with things between Androni and Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the early morning, Rogge was sitting behind his big red oak, which had been in existence for more than 500 years, and waited until the hills were piled up. The file is already near dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sunset outside the French window, Rogge licked the sun, stretched out and walked out of the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is curling up on the sand at the door, watching the book intently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture of Lacaras’s "Angels Come on" is hanging on the wall behind her. Of course, this is a copy, but the standard of the imitation is already Called the master. The slightly dark red sun in the golden color falls on the oil painting, the satin wall, and the windy butterfly, which constitutes a serene and beautiful picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the misty sunshine, the long gold that flutters in the wind butterfly is slightly shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked so concentrated, so that with the keen sense of her elf, Rogge had been watching her for a long time, and was not seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge didn’t want to break this rare serene beauty, he stood there and quietly admired it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly turned over another page, finally closed the book, took a deep breath, stretched the body, stretched out. She saw Rogge standing in front of her and immediately stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What book are you looking at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly hesitated and finally handed it The book was handed over, and Rogge smiled. As soon as he saw the cover, his smile immediately solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and slowly opened the book "The tribute to the power," and looked at it with a hand, he confirmed, this is It is the "Power Minister Biography" that he can recite in one word! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly, where did you find this book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am at When I saw this book in the library of the Grand Duke, I took it out and turned it over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at the beautiful and pure face of the butterfly. The heart slowly passed a shadow, and he gently asked: "Wind butterfly, I mean, there are so many books in the library, why did you choose this one?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butterfly has a glimmer of glory in the dark blue eyes: "Isn’t you ever been reading this book before? I want to know more about you, but you are so busy, have no time to follow. I speak, so I think the best way is to check out the books you like to read."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you think of this book?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very interesting! There are a lot of things I didn't think of before! I think I can learn a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger sighs Gas Chen Chuan "back into the hands of the wind butterfly butterfly, Adjani believe you have seen, your second way is a dead end. You are a genius in the elves. If you want to take revenge, there will be some hope in taking the first road. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the wind butterfly faded down: "Ajani... She is right, I am a genius in the elf, but my arrogance takes me Pushed to the point of today. Rogge, until I saw the letter of Ajani, I was still subconsciously underestimating you. I will never do this in the future, I even began to worship you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened quietly, without interjecting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge smiled twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly turned lightly and slowly, and fell to the Rogge in the air: "But you won't kill me. I am always at your side." You will keep a vigilant heart! Please wait for the day when the wind butterfly falls into purgatory with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Laugh at the problem, I am waiting! "Well, let go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Pride, really my favorite character! Rogge thought happily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a break, Rogge returned to his own chamber and met with the Principality in the hands of the judiciary, finance, and military. After the minister of the garrison, it was already at the beginning of the Hua Deng. Before leaving the Principality of Alle, he had to give all the aftermath to work, lest he could not take the overall situation, and then take it for the enemy.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie once again surprised Rogge. From the report of Hilley, in just a few days, she has several defects in the public system, although There is no fundamental improvement in public service, but considering that her contact time is still short, it is very difficult. The two low-level officers who are newly prepared for promotion are from civilians. They all rely on the accumulation of military merits on the battlefield to climb. The position of the officer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision is also invulnerable. It seems that the Tick Creek family has an unexpected talent.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillary’s report slowly burned in front of Rogge’s eyes Ashes, his mind has already flown back to the Central Mountain Range and flew back to the city of the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly thought about every word that Hughes said. Especially with regard to erosion. He suddenly moved in the heart. Heinrich came to the world with himself, and then he was tricked into the space maze, and the death of a lot of death has long since disappeared. Clean, then, why didn't the silver dragon go, but instead made a nest not far from the city of the gods?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really searches for What? Is it that it faintly feels that it has erosion, so can't you go? Rogge suddenly has a cold sweat!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will have stereotyped The plan once again repeatedly scrutinizes from beginning to end, looking for even a little flaw in the flaws.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderous murder will take Rogge from contemplation Wake up, Androni is standing in front of him with a cold face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looked at her eyes full of anger, calmly asked: "Annie, how so much anger? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will never allow..." Androni squeezed out of silver teeth in one word: "I will never allow you to move again." Froya has a finger! Otherwise I killed you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge changed his position and made himself sit more comfortable. A small, but very beautiful magic scroll sneaked out of his sleeve. Sliding into his palm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, can't you blame me? Last night she was active. Look at your appearance, your persuasion last night did not play any role! So you will come over and scare me, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni's momentum immediately weakened a few points: "She is very stubborn!" But she doesn't love you, and you don't love her! Your marriage can never be happy! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and asked: "Do we need love in our marriage?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni spoke in a moment, but then said again: "But she... she is no longer a princess!" Her country is about to perish, and her family will lose its status and power. In a word, she has no use value. Do you need this kind of marriage? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a good magician, and smart enough to be poisonous. I need help, she is the same. This marriage, you regard it as an alliance between us. Moreover, she is still a beautiful woman, I have nothing to complain about. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni held his hand on Rogge's desk, leaned forward and stared at Rogge and said: "But she will never be happy!" You can't give her happiness! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brush! The blue sky has been placed on Rogge's neck, and Androni's voice almost cried: "Even if I beg you! Let her go! You don't know, from small to big, she saw it from her loved ones." Only betrayal and greed for her beauty! You don't know how bitter she is in her heart, don't hurt her anymore, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog gently dials Falling over the stars: "War with a sword on the neck, this is a person who begg lives or rebels... Are you not one of them? Anyway, her proposal is very close to my heart, so I have no reason not to agree. Anne I am not interested in the love between you and love. If you want me to change my mind, I have to ask for more tempting conditions! Don't forget, if you kill me, do you want to see it again? That skull dragon? The person you are looking for, I am afraid I will never find it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was hit by the key, for a moment stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog stood up and prepared to go out. A number of important goods have been shipped from the Principality of Layton to Dresden, and he needs to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Andrewoni was around, he said faintly: "Annie, you suddenly rushed in and took Furoya last night, interrupting my good deeds. This time, even if it is. But in the future, I don't want this kind of thing to be regenerated once. You should know that blocking is useless. You can't block it for a second time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Androni grabbed Rogge, bit his teeth, and said lowly: "You have been there last night... I haven’t succeeded for a long time... ...you should know that she and I are the same people! Do you know what she has become like after I took her away? You are tortured by her!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled a little: "But for me, this is a rare enjoyment! Besides, if you try a few more times, you will always succeed. People are a wonderful creature, nothing is overcome. No. Princess Froya is a city of allure, I said, it is cheaper than other men, not cheaper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;安Ronnie bit her lower lip, her face pale, suddenly said: "If you want only a good helper and a beautiful woman who can go to bed, then change me! Don't touch her! I am not bad in any way. Don't let you look down on your eyes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge indulged, patted Androni's face gently, watching her bitter Physical discomfort kills me directly. It is not much simpler to understand. You are afraid that if you kill me, you will never see your sweetheart again. So you would rather endure being my woman. Great sacrifice, it’s strange, is the magic of love so big? "Andrroy raised his head and stared at Rogge. "Why are you going to leave everything for the demon princess and flee to the north?" ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it was Ronald’s turn to be white.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a while , said: "I will give you some time, you can try to persuade her! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at Rogge's back in a complicated mood and suddenly called out: "Thank you!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road to the city of the gods, an elf knight is madly galloping, and does not care for the life and death of the horse. After a whole day Mercedes-Benz, he finally stepped into the room of Elder's elders before sunset. After handing Rogge's secret letter to Hughes, he completely collapsed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After reading the letter from Rogge, Hughes thought for a long time, and finally smiled and said to himself: "This Rogge, I will retaliate against me so soon." This incident, this incident only came to my old man to go and run! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housse took a look, the secret letter immediately turned into ashes. He returned to time, took out a very old ordinary suitcase, gently rubbed For a moment, I sighed again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes went out of the room and told the Elf guard at the door: "I have to go out for a few days. If God brings the adult back, let him wait for me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge has handed over the government of Ayre Principality to Hilley and Auntie, with the most elite 50-month dark face. The Cavaliers, as well as Androni and Froya, are on their way back to the city of the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the queue, there is a very conspicuous heavy carriage, There are countless magic marks on the carriage, and the magician can see at a glance that the engravings are all magical arrays of seals.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the council hall on the top floor of the elders' home, all elder elders are listening to Rogge's plan intensively. Except for the helplessness of the repairs, all the elders can't reveal their shocked look! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t believe that this time Rogge used the power of the elves to raise the knives, and the knives turned out to be the allies of the elves since ancient times:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred Silver Dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central conference table is painted with a magical array. Above the magic array is a phantom of a very steep mountain. There is a huge hole at the waist, which is the choice of Yinlong for yourself. With a little adjustment of this magical array, you can clearly display the internal terrain of the Silver Dragon Cave according to Rogge's ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approx has explained in detail the terrain of the entire Yinlong Cave, the surrounding environment, and the habit of the Silver Dragon. He even explained the rock composition and groundwater source that make up the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Hughes’s face is pale and he has to cough a few words. Obviously, the trip to Silver Dragon Cave is not easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog looked at the elder elders and finally said: "Elders, the plan is like this! Now Yinlong has just given birth to a dragon egg, its The power is greatly weakened. This is a golden opportunity! It is the gift of Hilo to us! If you have no objections, then we will do our best for the next two days, and the next morning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The elders face each other, this impact is too big. But now that Rogge has the power, he can actually ignore the opinions of these people. The reason why such a meeting is held is that one respects respect, and the other is among the six elder elders present, three of whom are magicians. In Rogge's plan, the magician is the most important part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is a god, and the words must be called Hilo, and the elders can't speak. His plan is crazy and bold, and it seems that there is a possibility of success. However, what is the benefit of such a raid attack on Silver Dragon, Rogge would not say more than one sentence. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cold morning breeze and the fallen leaves of the old elves, Rogge led the elves of the Dragon Slayer to step out of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team is not big, only a hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with this kind of powerful creature of Yinlong, the elf is good, the Terran army is good, and the ordinary soldiers go to kill more. So Rogge brought in this time is the strongest of the elves, among which only Androni and Froya are two humans. Originally, Frey would be a good helper, but with Druid to kill the Silver Dragon, it is very likely that he will be in the face. The elves are different. Although the silver dragons are their traditional allies, the alliance is not solid, and Rogge is a god. In contrast, it is clear that the will of Hilo is more important to the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a day and night march, the team finally came to the snow peak where Yinlong lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked up at the steep snow peak and lowered his voice and asked Hughes: "Old things, are you sure it is time to sleep now?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes also whispered: "Young people should be a little polite! Yinlong sleeps for five or six days. My old man is already clear. Now it should be that it sleeps. The deepest time! Even if you are awakened, the alertness will not be too high for a while. This is the information that my old man has put in an old bone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge screamed something, less with me to this set! Will you fall off the snow peak? I deceived others, don't want to fool me! You have a good look at the hundreds of elves behind you, this is the elite of the whole family! If you are hurting your elves, it is best not to be stupid in a fight! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiu Siyi smiled: "Are you planning a plan for such a sinister injury, isn't it afraid that the elf will hurt a lot?" Now the elves are treated as private property by you. Your love is never in the hands of my old man, hehe! Yes, young man, what is in your big box? Even my old man could not see the seal outside. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked helplessly at the old fox, and said coldly: "You won't know it later?" To say that you don't know what is inside, I don't believe in killing me. Is the killer a high-level killer not a high-ranking thief? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
