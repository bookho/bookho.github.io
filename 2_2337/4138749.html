			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of morning light pierced the darkness of the horizon, and the dawn is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog opened the window and took a deep breath of the morning breeze, and suddenly felt more awake. Although he was so energetic and busy for a few days, he still felt very tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind him, suddenly a small unspeakable snoring sounded. Rogge looked back and saw the wind butterfly holding his arms tightly around his body, shaking. She is still, the elf is naturally cold, and this cold wind almost freezes her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed the window of the living room with his hand, and a few flames of the demon flame ignited around the body of the butterfly, and the heat of the black flame dispelled her. The cold around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s gaze walked up the body of Wind Butterfly, and the blush instantly caught the cheeks of the wind butterfly. Although she has already been prepared for humiliation, but when this moment really comes, there is still a shame and panic that can't be suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but cover her chest with one hand and blocked her lower body with one hand, slowly squatting down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge met, haha ​​smiled! Get up! Take a break today, and there will be no more relaxing days in the future! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said, he turned and went out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly looked at his back, Speaking in a slightly inaudible voice: man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up her own clothes, was about to put on, and suddenly saw standing in the doorway of the bedroom. Ajani. The wind butterfly shook and all the clothes fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two beautiful elf women have been looking at each other for a long time, and there are so many things in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ajani just heard it, and saw it?" Wind Butterfly asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani just looked at the wind butterfly, her face was full of grief, two lines of tears slowly slipped from her cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the expressions on the face of the wind butterfly disappeared. She wore clothes and said coldly: "Ajia Ni, it’s me who hurts me, it’s me. You are informed of the sacrifices to the temple. Today I have this kind of end and it is sinful, you don't have to sympathize with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani sighed: "We used to be More intimate sisters! Why is this so? Why must we go to this point? Wind butterfly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly interrupted her faintly:" From today, the previous wind butterfly is dead. In fact, from the time I made up my mind to report it to the temple, the former butterfly has died and Rumsfeld was once the best friend. It will be the same in the future. But Rogge appeared. You fell in love with Rogge, I fell in love with Rumsfeld, but Rogge was determined to put Rumsfeld to death! He couldn’t fight Rogge, so I will end up today. But if Roger fights him, he will let you and Rogge live quietly and happily in the distance. . The "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Adjani silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly paused and sighed: "The difference is that he is never the reason for Rogge's opponent! But I don't regret to follow him." I will never regret it! Why can't the elves maintain their own traditions, why must they change? In order to survive? From what time, the elves have been so afraid of sacrifice, in order to survive, would rather give up their faith and tradition?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly turned to look at Ajani coldly and gently said: "Miss Ajani, what do you want for me. As long as you With the consent of the owner, I will do everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind butterfly is really sad..." Ajani really didn't know what to say, What should I say? She has vaguely felt what Rogge will do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one side is her best friend, and on the other hand is her beloved one, Ajani really does not know what to do. What's more, now that Fengdie has signed the contract, she wants to stop Rogge from being late. She only hopes that Rogge can fulfill these two poor elves, although she knows how embarrassing this hope will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complexity of the magical array written by Rogge is far beyond the knowledge of Wind Butterfly, and magic is not her strength. But the butterfly's eyesight is not bad. As far as she knows, no magician can paint such a high-order magic array, let alone draw the magic array on the magical white in such an incredible way. It is. In fact, she does not understand very normal, this magical array of soul contract is Rogge learning the black crystal left by Elysses, the demon has always been the master of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Rogge’s second choice, she didn’t think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani returned to the bedroom and sat on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly and Ajani are like this, one sitting in the room, one practicing in the living room, until the sky is bright...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the dungeon under the temple, Rogge is sitting comfortably at the table, looking at Rumsfeld standing in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian of the Church has been given a neat dress, and the clear springs in the dungeons have also washed away the filth left by his crazy night. His standing posture is elegant and calm, and there is no feeling of imprisonment at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the elves for so long, Rogge was the first to carefully observe Rumsfeld. He is a rare and beautiful man of the elves, and he combines exquisite and resolute characters. Rogge can't help but admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly thought that if Frey saw Rumsfeld, I don’t know what it would be like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld and the temperament of the butterfly are the most outstanding of the elf men and women, and they are all talented and talented, and they have already become the guardians of the Elven Church. The ranks are indeed a pair of heavenly creations. The two grow up together, but if they don’t have a long life, they are strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately Rogge is not a person who will be beautiful. He has too many accounts to calculate with the pair of elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "Rumsfeld, you are a personal talent, but unfortunately you have chosen the wrong way. If you follow me with one heart and one mind, why fall to the end? This step?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld calmly said: "God makes the adults, I admire your talents. You have too many incredible places, it is here. Now, I still don't understand how this is your calculation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue hehe smiled, I got some unexpected results, won You have nothing to shine with. However, even without this unexpected gain, your end is the same, just a little trouble. In fact, you already know that there will be such a day, why not give up your faith and follow me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsfeld showed a bit of sarcasm, he said faintly: "God makes an adult, you see through my character at a glance, knowing that I will never And you are all the way. So, you want to put me to death from the beginning, no waste of time and energy to convince me, isn't it? Now I admit defeat, you don't have to worry about me anymore. I can give up any resistance, as long as you can let go of the wind butterfly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge indulged and slowly said: "The reason why the temple dared to be so stupid against me was because the butterfly disclosed the news. Sacrifices. More than two thousand elves have died, and the life of the dark-faced warrior of four hundred months is not light. Even if the wind butterfly is not the principal offender, it must at least be a co-sponsor. You said that her life can be saved? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld’s face finally got some anger, he stepped on it and shouted: "God makes adults!" Wind butterfly is still a child! She doesn't know what she has done, what the consequences are! You are too shameless, would you like to use her life to coerce me to give in? Then, please let us go together! You will see how strong the noble elf will be! I am able to die with the wind butterfly, I will be very satisfied! I think the wind butterfly will be the same! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles at Ms. Field, the failure of the elf is always connected with arrogance. Although you have failed, you are still looking at me. You think about it, what magic is it used when I repel the Terran coalition? Do you want me to give you some tips? Oh, it seems that you have already remembered it, or how could it look so ugly? Yes, I use One is one of my professions, the Necromancer. Let's think about it, what is the most good thing for the Necromancer? Is it to manipulate the soul! Do you think that the butterfly is executed, is everything over? On the contrary, for me, this game has just begun! What can be more lonely than a soul that accepts the fire of the fire, and the millennium will not be cruel? Or let it repeatedly become a warrior, and then slowly The pain of crushing is also good! Perhaps you are still questioning my magic, then 'Flesh and blood' is a few levels of magic, should you have heard of it? Yes, the seven levels of Necromancer, and I also cast Twice! How? Do you want it? A bet on it, bet my soul to take the wind butterfly nothing to do "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Rogge still smiled: "The only thing I can promise you is that I can only give one's soul a freedom. The soul of another person must be my guinea. This price is for your negligence. It’s too insignificant. You can think about it slowly, I have enough patience.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld has recovered calmly, he faintly said: "Thank you for giving me a chance. You don't have to wait, give the soul of the butterfly to freedom, I will be your experiment! I can see that you need me to open my own will, this experiment can be successful, isn't it? If you can swear with your god, then we will be dealt with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a genius! I have some people who can't bear to kill you and promise you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger stood up and solemnly said: Ge. Otta Rivers, swearing in the name of the seven oldest kings of the dead world, Russam Sfield dedicated his soul and me, I will protect the soul of the butterfly . If I swear by vows, I will be the enemy of the seven kings from now on, and will endure the strongest anger of the seven kings forever! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s voice just fell, a flame came out of him and disappeared. Rumsfeld recognized this as a fire of the oath. The corner of the mouth finally showed a gratifying smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at the damps four times! Let's get started! This dungeon is simple, but very Clean, just take a temporary magic lab!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clap his hands and call in an elf guard and tells: "I want to be a very An important magical experiment, informing the elders of Hughes to strengthen the guards of the temple. Nothing is disturbing to me if there is nothing particularly important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf guards are leading It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned back and looked at Rumsfeld, smiling: "Although my magic is not high. But you will soon be present, I It is a very brilliant Necromancer. I will never waste your every genius. You should be thankful that you will be the first elf to experience two erosions!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon has darkened and slowly raised a black sea...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea formed by the darkness and the death force gradually The waves started, and the little waves quickly gathered into a wave of waves! During the undulating waves, the thunder of the waves hitting the sea resounded to the heavens and the earth! A few huge tornadoes carry countless lightnings into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and waves on the sea suddenly separated from each other! Rogge in a black robe is coming from the sea and from the raging wind. Every step forward, his figure is a little bigger, and when his figure becomes clear, he is even taller than the huge waves around him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumsfeld stood on the sea of ​​death and endured the squally showers. He knows that all this is an illusion. However, the tearing pain of the soul made him know that this is not entirely illusory. But he has already died to death, that is, the pain from the deepest part of the soul is not enough to shake his iron-like will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rumsfeld! Open our hearts as we agreed! From then on, you will be reborn! You are still you, but Ram Sfield will no longer exist in any plane, any space! After my arms, you will be my sharpest sword! You will have the terrorist power of the Knight of Shadows; you will not be limited to the Shadow Knight The power! The proud elf! Show all the geniuses of the Guardian in front of me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's voice is huge, every sentence Words are accompanied by countless anger and thunder, and there are countless waves and ups and downs! In the last sentence, Rumsfeld’s eyes lit up, and all the huge waves, the lightning of the twists and the thunder of the sea of ​​death disappeared. In his eyes, only the huge figure of Rogge stepped closer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indescribable pain has come from the depths of Rumsfeld’s soul, and his handsome face has been twisted almost! However, he is still desperate to maintain the last line of clarity of the mind. This is actually useless, but the innate arrogance of the elf makes him try to fight for a little dignity at the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knights in the Dark! After the rebirth, Raphael will be anonymous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After Rogge’s words fell, the pain of Rumsfeld’s tears almost disappeared. It seems as if nothing has ever been born. But he knows that everything is over. In the next moment, his entire consciousness will be completely erased, and his soul will become a blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
