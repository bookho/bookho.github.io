			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welcome ceremony of the Sara people is grand and simple. Although there is no splendid decoration of the golden wall, the sincerity of the whole family, regardless of gender, young and old, is not replaced by any gorgeous ornaments or luxurious banquets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the enthusiasm and expectations of the elves' beautiful eyes, Rogge couldn’t help but be moved. He felt that some of these zealous eyes could not be associated with gold coins. However, the value of the elves is denominated in gold bricks, so the play still has to be played. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves have not changed much in the millennium, and they have not made progress. On the contrary, the Terran has continued to thrive in repeated wars and self-discipline. The art related to war, whether it is magic, strategy, combat technology or the study of large-scale war equipment, has made great progress. The territory of the human kingdom is also expanding. In this way, if the elves want to change their own destiny, apart from the comprehensive change, they will really only hide in the holy land that Hilo opened up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "While I lied to them, I helped them!" The fat man comforted himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a long time in the Church of Light, Rogge knows how to use faith - the best weapon to deal with believers. The elves are famous for the great elves of war - Hilo's fanaticism. In the war of the last millennium, the elves actually pinned the victory and defeat of the battle on Hilo to show miracles! Now, after thousands of years, Hilo has never shown any miracles. The elves' belief in him must have been shaken a lot. But even if it is shaken again, this belief is more pious than the beliefs of the Terran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take me to the temple of Hilo, I will bring his gods to you." Rogge looked holyly to the Sala The elder said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of the Sala elves, Rogge stepped into the Sala's Elven Temple and stood in front of the altar. He prayed for a moment and turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves in the temple whispered with a whisper, accompanied by whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Rogge faintly reveals the light of the face. A moment later, a white light descended from the top of the temple and shone on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The supreme Hilo says he will point the way to the return of all the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge raised his hand again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen the direction that Hilo pointed out, my feet are on this road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Land is at the end of the road! The glory of the elf is about to recover!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogever One movement is so elegant and harmonious, there are countless petals falling in the hands and feet, and when it is about to fall to the ground, it turns into light and slowly disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not be alone, I will lead you on the road to return!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Trust to me, will be redeemed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last sentence, Rogge’s voice was arrogant. The light of his face was dazzling, and the petals of the flowers around the temple fell into the temple, and a colorful carpet of flowers was added in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the voice of Hilo!" said the Sarah's elf female sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the affirmation of the sacrifice, the elves have no doubt. They burst into tears and fell to the ground, grateful to their gods after thousands of years, and recalled these forgotten people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple rituals are solemn and sacred. Rogge copied the set of the bright church and it looked good. After hundreds of years of tempering, the bright church's skill in creating a sacred atmosphere is unmatched. Rogge's indiscriminate bursts of powerful spiritual fluctuations shake the hearts of all the elves who are present. Of course, the most important thing is that Rogge magnifies the fluctuations in the horn. This was originally a precautionary move. I didn't expect the rituals of the elves to be recognized. This made Rogge secretly sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s smile was solemn and kind, and he was very satisfied with the current effect. It seems that no matter what, at least the more than 500 elves of the Sala family are in their hands. This is a great fortune! Let's see if we can lie to a few other tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is still a lot of doubts, and Rogge came to this conclusion from the reaction of the elf sacrifice. He is not prepared to abduct all the elves, as long as the one who believes in the most religious and prepared to follow him without question is enough. Rogge has the confidence to lead the elves to the glorious road of happy life, of course, the kind of happy life he understands. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ritual ceremony, it is a set of complicated welcome ceremonies and welcoming banquets. It seems that the Sarah people who have inherited the artistic tradition also set the ancient country of the millennium. Etiquette has also been reserved. It was not until Rogge was lying on the hard wooden bed that he was able to breathe a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These elves, really can't enjoy life." Rogge was dissatisfied with the room. The tree house is built entirely on old trees. The tables and the tables are almost always made of natural wisteria. The bed is still good, supplemented by a thick brocade mat, and I want to take care of the human race of God. The whole tree house is elegant and quiet, filled with the faint aroma of the vegetation, and has a natural taste. However, Rogge's favorite style has always been magnificent, extravagant and extravagant, typical tyrannical taste, which is not very appreciated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tree house was originally the residence of Sarah’s elders. Now it is specially given to God to let the adults out, and Rogge is also used to it. Fat people know that sometimes they are approachable, and sometimes the necessary arranging and shelves are still to be placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this hard bed, Rogge flipped over and over, it was difficult to sleep. He always felt that something was forgotten by himself. He simply sat up and went out with his clothes. An elf female warrior came up at the door and asked respectfully: "God makes the adults, are you resting badly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah no! Ok! I want to appreciate the night here, so I will go up and walk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me to lead the adults to visit." The soldier still respectfully said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a closer look and turned out to be Sarah’s daughter, Ferrena. Her figure is almost as high as Rogge, her color is pretty and pure, and there is a hint of fortitude in front of her eyebrows. Even in the elves who are known for their looks, Ferrena can be considered a beauty. No wonder it will be seen by Huron of the seven-color deer tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Freyna’s pretty face through the moonlight, Rogge suddenly realized what he had forgotten. That is, I am a human race! Although he has successfully pretended to be a sacred ambassador, the hatred of the elves and the human race for thousands of years is not so easy to resolve, let alone the elves are some extremely arrogant, arrogant guys. Look at Barang, I have tried my own skills. Other elves must have some thoughts like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the elves are born to love beautiful things. In the human man, he can only be regarded as the middle and lower. How can he compare with the elf? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a smile? Ferrena's face is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly had a punch to flatten her nose. It seems that it is necessary to stand up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Ferrena with a smile and looked up and down. Rogge’s smile and the sun are shining, but there is a cold ice in the bones. Ferrena instinctively felt a huge crisis, her pointed ears straight up, and her handsome face became pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not relax, the spirit of pressure hits her soul, and marks the mark of fear directly in the depths of her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump, Ferrena can no longer resist the pressure of Rogge, and fell to the ground. She hurriedly climbed up, but like a serious illness, her face was pale and she could not stand swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes adults, sorry for being rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at her deeply At a glance, faintly said: "What God has given is not just grace. I hope you don't forget this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood still and watched Ferrina faltered the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge smiled and turned his back to Androni's waist. "She looks good again, how can it compare with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled, and the blue sky starry lightning strikes the rib of Rogge Next, the fat man is sore and cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Rogge like a smile and forgot Ericis? In your heart, who are the two of us more important? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s face suddenly gloomy and sighed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andro Nicole apologized, and he asked him about it. He said: "Your knowledge in the magical array is very powerful. It is not a level with your magic. For the first time, I knew that there was a magical array that could store so much vindictiveness. And you can engrave such a complicated magical array on the little white jade horn. It’s really amazing that I didn’t kill you. It’s right. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a shot on Rogge's shoulder: "I will work for the Rocherio family in the future!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge barely cheered and looked at his white hand on his shoulder and replied: "Of course, you can do it. The condition is still that, you marry me." ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni bit his lower lip, and the palm of his hand reveals a starry temper, and suddenly Roger screams.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still think about taking advantage of me! If you are idle afterwards, give me more magic equipment! That horn is really good! It’s true that I’ve opened the equipment store”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles, Miss, what do you do with the things I do. Don’t feel relieved, actually Or your jade is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni shook his head and smiled: "No, you are still insidious, you said, our one Will traps be useful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be fooled. As long as the horn is blown, the god is strong, as long as it is not a paladin. It’s enough for him. Missy, then, I really didn’t see that your carvings would be so high.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day was carved by Androni The fake horn horn can be chaotic, and Rogge engraved the magical martial art from the black crystal on the horn. Finally, Androni injected a lot of starry temper, and the fat man engraved another layer of magic. , cover up the fluctuations of vindictiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camela was absent-minded, smothered and blew, and destroyed the second layer of magic. Her little mouth did not have any defense, and the starry sky on the spot was turned into a crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Rogge was able to talk to the elder Sarah for two days. Elder Sarah is nearly four hundred years old and will reach the limit of elf life. In addition to the wisdom, the deep, and the blackmail brought by the long years. For two days, in addition to talking to Rogge about the glorious history of the Elves and the greatness of Hilo, Elder Sarah did not mention anything about the ‘Seven Deer’ merger with the Sala. Rogge sneered under his heart, and on the surface it was natural. The old fox doesn't mention it, he is not in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge does not move, it does not mean that Androni does not move. After teasing two elf girls, she stared at Freina again. In the past few days, she and the little beauty of the elf are almost inseparable. The two stood together, and they were very romantic. The elf was so beautiful, Androni was a men's wear, and the color also suppressed Ferrena. How is this called the little girl to resist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the old fox was anxious. The message that God made the Sala people could not be concealed for a long time, or else it would be difficult for other tribes to be at the Presbyterian Church. The weak Sala people could not stand it. Felena was smashed by Androni's bold and almost shameless offensive. The elders had hinted to Rogge several times, and Rogge was just stupid. He didn't want to be stupid, he managed to manage Androni! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sala elders finally couldn’t help themselves. If the Sala people are finally merged by the seven-color deer, Ferrena’s marriage is a guarantee of the status of the Sala people after the merger! Of course, God made the adults look at Freina naturally, but the swordsman is only the sacred and the human race. How can he be worthy of the Sarah family with the oldest elves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day at dusk, the elders finally let go of all the restraints and went straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sneered in his heart. "Where would you be so cheap? You don't spit at all." He just smiled and looked at Sarah Elder, and he didn't answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salar elders grinded for a while, Rogge only had a holy face, and began to take Hilo to care for every elf and other officials to block. The fat man thinks in his heart: "You old things want to make the human race a fool, I have to look at it, who is stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is over For two days, it is already the sixth day that Sarah’s elders blocked the news of God’s adulthood. Rogge did not ask when he went to the Senate. The elder Sarah was already anxious like an ant on a hot pot. This day he once again had a secret conversation with Rogge. He has made up his mind that he will be willing to pay any price as long as he maintains the ancient cultural heritage of the elves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes the adults! The inheritance of the Sara family is only between you!" The elders were kneeling in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and helped him to elder! Hilo will care for his followers. I am only spreading the messenger of the gods. How can we control the fate of the Sala people? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults, as long as you are willing to say a few words to the Sala in the Presbyterian or even the Great Hall of the Elves, the Sala will never It was merged by the seven-color deer or other tribes! The cultural heritage of the elves for thousands of years will continue. God makes adults, if you can promise me this little request, the Sarah will become your most loyal subordinate! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you are not willing to merge for the seven-color deer, why are you willing to loyal to me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seven-color deer just want to increase their own power and population. If they are merged, after a hundred years, they will use the methods of education, marriage, etc. to completely erase the imprint of the existence of the Sarah. And adults are different, you are the messenger of Hilo, follow you, our Sara family will have a real exhibition space! What's more..." Sarah's voice became mysterious. "In my opinion, you also want to lead our elves to do something big, not just to return to the Holy Land!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shakes his heart, but his face is not moving. "Elders, Hilo is not a god." Similarly, as his messenger, I also have my own ideas. Although the noble elves have always regarded honor as their own life, I still have to ask, how can you believe me with your promise? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder Sarah was solemn and took the oath in the name of Hilo. When he said how he would go if he violated his vow, Rogge suddenly Intervene: "Elders, you still swear by the fate of the Sala family. Only such devout, Hilo can hear! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder's face suddenly became white, and he was completely stunned by Roger's sudden viciousness. If he swears by himself, for the future of the Sarahs." It’s a big deal, and you’re dead. However, it’s totally different from the fate of the Sala nationality.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but at this moment, it’s not too much for him. There is a lucky idea in his heart, and Hilo’s ambassador is not going to harm Hilo’s most faithful believers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara elders swear, Roger's attitude towards him is much more amiable. But the fat man who does not believe in the devil has always had doubts about the binding force of the oath. He has to find another opportunity to tie the Sala people to their chariots.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it was reported that the orcs of unprecedented scale were once again gathered outside the Sala Mountain Pass, and they could rush to the territory of the Sala people in just three days. Listen to the spies. After the report, Elder Sarah couldn’t help but frown. From the news of the return of the Griffin Archer, the orc assembled this time has passed. People, and are still gathering. What is even more terrifying is that the extremely fierce and dangerous race of the Cyclops is also present in the orcs!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyclops You can throw a pound of megaliths a hundred meters high, and the small weight will throw higher and farther. It is the nemesis of the gryphon knight. In the past, the Sala people have relied on the unstoppable airborne rain strikes of the gryphon knights. The land created by the ancient trees of the Elven War can resist the orcs for many years. Now that a Cyclops join the orc camp, the Griffin can only fly above a hundred meters, the arrows shot from such a high place, the rough skin The thick orc threat is much smaller.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is currently, and Sarah will no longer want to greet God to make adults, and hastily arranged for the enemy.<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two days of the Sarah’s intense preparations, Rogge was not idle. He looked around at the elves’ preparations and could help them. Ask the place where you know. God asked the adults to ask, all the elves are all right, words. In just two days, Rogge learned a lot about the elves' wars. He also pointed out the elves with the military knowledge learned from Orfirock, and let the Sala people once again. I have experienced the profoundness of God's adulthood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it takes less than two days to work, and a brand new small fortress will appear in the Sara Pass. It’s just that these magics are extremely magical. Every time a batch of saplings grows, Zhao Wei is sweaty and white, and has to go back to rest for a long time, waiting for the magic to recover. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the number of Rogge counts, the Sala people can get on the battlefield with only 150 people, how can they resist the orc army outside? He is now clear about the strength of the orc army, because Androni is the best scout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a large-scale invasion of the orcs this time, always paying attention to the seven-color deer tribe here will not let go. Rogge is waiting for them. If the seven-color deer failed to get a leg from him as he wished, then his god would only run away with the survivors of the Sala. Anyway, there is Androni, he is not worried about security issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two days, Elder Sarah summoned the magician, sacrifice, and Barang to open four or five meetings to discuss countermeasures against the enemy. Rogge also attended. But he has other plans, and he has the confidence to intervene in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the orcs were still a day away from Sarah Pass, another message that made Sara’s elders and Rogge surprised and happy came at the same time. . Under the leadership of Huron and the two elders, the "Seven-Color Deer" tribe has arrived in the territory of the Sarah tribe. Difficult to take the lead, Sarah no longer dared to reluctantly, only to meet the arrival of the 'seven-color deer' troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few elves sitting in the hall of the Sala tribe. At this moment, Elder Sarah has to introduce the gods to the two elders of the seven-color deer tribe and Huron. Make - Rogge. The faces of the seven-color deer tribes are naturally ugly. It is only tomorrow that the orc army will be killed in front of the door. It is not difficult at this time. Ask the Sarah tribe what is the intention of private possession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippine elders of the seven-color deer tribe are more and more annoyed. The Sala people first greeted the gods. Naturally, they wanted to please themselves, so that they could use the influence of the gods to prevent the fate of being swallowed by the seven-color deer. Now that the gods have not known how many days have been hidden by the Sarahs, it is hard to say what agreement has been reached. He became more and more annoyed, putting aside the issue of war on the spot, snarling and accusing the elder Sarah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is an elegant creature. Even if they are sarcasm, their manners and manners are very elegant and noble. The language used is also very elegant, the surface is full of flowers, and the machine front is hidden in the field. The real meaning inside is often carefully thought out to understand the viciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quarrel is throwing Rogge well, and he has opened his eyes. Because the fat man has to maintain the identity of God, he is always sitting in danger, an inscrutable look, without saying a word. But secretly, he is desperately trying to learn how the elves quarrel. This kind of quiet, full-smoke-free truss will be the most powerful weapon in the debates of the nobles in the House of Lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves at the meeting were noisy, but tomorrow’s embarrassment is inevitable. After the quarrel, they still have to get together seriously and study strategy and tactics. The elves' tactics are very simple. Since the orcs have always embraced them, they use the war trees of Sarah Pass to kill the orc pioneers as much as possible. Then they are led by the three-headed wetland dragon of the seven-color deer tribe. Huron leads the elf forest. The cavalry then rushed to defeat the orcs in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wetland dragon is more than ten meters long, with a huge body, thick and fleshy skin, and four flesh wings, which can fly in short distances. It is a powerful war giant. beast. They are completely afraid of the nymphs of the Cyclops and are hard to be hurt by ordinary orcs. This is where the seven-color deer tribe relies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened, but secretly sneered, maybe the former orcs were easy to deal with, but this time it will definitely be different. If you want to accept the arrogant race of the elves, you must first hurt them, knock them down, push them into a dead end, and listen to yourself at your own discretion. So Rogge will never give advice on their strategy and tactics, nor will they tell the elves what the dangers are. Wetland dragon? Although Rog has not seen it, he has already known the advantages and disadvantages of these war behemoths from the mouth of the Sala elves. It’s just three wet-water dragons that can’t pose any threat to Rogge’s plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting is coming to an end, and the Philippine elders of the Seven-Colored Deer Tribe are politely asking Rogge to give a look. Rogge thought about it for a moment, smiled a little, stood up, and glanced at the elves in a deep and unpredictable way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God said that all who believe in him will win." Rogge's magnetic voice echoed in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The contempt of God's prestige will be punished. The punishment will immediately appear in front of his eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Rogge turned out of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, a vine in the hall suddenly withered and turned into a dry vine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge drained the vitality of the vine by sucking the blood, which is not magic, and he erased all the magic on the vine with spiritual power. Fluctuation, this is not to see who the Elf will see his hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves are worth mentioning, people, for things they can't understand, always like to use miracles to explain. Especially what is related to the gods, is it not a miracle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were people who looked at each other and finally focused on the elder Sarah. God made the adults suddenly come to such a sentence, and showed the great power of Shenwei. It must be a cause. This is why, needless to say, naturally, the elder Sarah who dared to hide the gods. Do you want to explain how much God made such a big fire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder Sarah insisted on saying nothing under the fierce eyes of the two elders of the seven-color deer tribe. In fact, he has nothing to say. These days, he greeted God and feared it. If he was not afraid of being disrespectful to God, he would have to offer his beautiful women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves elders stalemate for a while, and finally broke up. As soon as everyone went out of the hall, Huron’s face changed immediately, and Sarah’s elders were also complaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the setting sun, Androni is like an angel who has fallen from the world, and has almost taken away all the brilliance around him. She stared at Ferrena, and she was coming in a private language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you! I dare to move my unmarried wife!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angry The extreme Huron sword was unsheathed, and the magical light of white danced on the blade was obviously not a product. He shouted, his wrists trembled, and the long sword in the air ** a shadow, forming a huge six-pointed star, flew to Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andro, a sneer, then a sneer in the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blue lightning suddenly exploded, and the dazzling light suddenly let the elves in the scene involuntarily closed their eyes. Huron's long sword flew to the sky with a ***, Androni lazily glared at Freena, and the stars were not squirted, so they rested on Huron's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you? Dare to do it for me?" Androni's beautiful big eyes stunned and fascinated. Rogge knew that this was the expression of the young lady’s killing. He hurried forward and shouted: "Retract the sword! Don't accidentally hurt the VIP of the seven-color deer tribe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is also staring at Luo with danger After looking at his eyes, he looked at his sword reluctantly, and said coldly: "The next time someone will dare to sword me first, I will be treated as an invitation to a duel!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferena has changed her face since she saw Huron, and wants to break free, but Androni’s arm is suddenly as strong as a stone, where can she push it? ? Because Huron has already announced that if he wins at the festival, he will marry Ferrena, according to the tradition of the elves, during which time Ferrena can't sing with anyone until the end of the festival. Androni didn't know that she had committed the taboo of the elves. Rogge also did not know that the elves had this habit, but they already felt that it was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huron was shaking all the time, staring at Androni’s background and trying to catch it, but knew that he was not an opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andre is my bodyguard.
