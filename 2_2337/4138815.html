			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, Rogge was ready to fight and finally rebelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make the best of the best, Rogge, who used to play more and less, mobilized 50,000 troops, almost assembled half of the country’s strength and all the elite, slow The ground is approaching the cliff town assembled by the Bauhinia Butterfly Force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of twenty times the enemy, the Bauhinia Butterfly is not panicked. It is a last resort. She can also retreat into the Central Mountains and rely on the deep mountains. Hide and seek with the superior enemy. In her opinion, Rogge’s use of soldiers is far worse than Charlie’s. If such a large army is pressed, who will be stupid enough to face the enemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the army of Rogge stopped inexplicably for a few days on the edge of the occupied area. The already-prepared Bauhinia butterfly is not busy retreating. She wants to see what Rogge is going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these few days, Rogge took the time to go to a Wright Fortress and met Du Lin. With him, there are all the relatives of Doolin that can be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original meaning of the fat man is to let Du Lin write a letter to her sister who has not seen for many years, and advise her not to fight against Rogge, and surrender honestly. Work together for the people of the Principality to do something practical. Of course, Rogge himself will not come out. He is persuading Du Lin to be Hoon who once loyal to the Kingdom of Latvia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin refuses to surrender, then every time he drags on, Horne will cut the head of the Dulin family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if Du Lin’s parents are willing to come out and persuade their son and daughter, the effect will be much better. However, this pair of old people would rather die than to die, and Rogge had no choice but to come up with this policy. However, the personality of the North people is strong and the effect is very difficult to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Du Lin only replied faintly to Horn, and there was never a coward who was afraid of death in the Doolin family. In the three days before Rogge arrived, Horn had threatened intimidation, but still could not let Du Lin yield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the Wright Fortress has been completely transformed into a large prison, where over 10,000 troops are stationed and watched more than 40,000 prisoners. The governor knew that the responsibility was great. He was sitting next to a volcano, so he was careful and careful not to neglect. He even ordered that only one-third of the rations be given to each prisoner, but he still has to do heavy work every day. He wants to exhaust the physical strength of these prisoners and avoid accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that can be said is that sick prisoners will receive careful care. In fact, this is deeply because Layton’s Kerry is not happy. The Wright Fortress is in Layton, so the warden is under tremendous pressure. But Rogge and Marshal Arams support his approach, which is hard to top out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is very afraid of the active volcano of Wright Fortress. His intention is to kill the 40,000 people. It is better to worry about the sun. This crazy plan is of course once again blocked by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raging servant Rogge went to the Wright Fortress and immediately met Du Lin alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who was held for a long time, is still full of energy and neatness. According to the tradition of the North, Wright Prison gave enough courtesy to the former top commander of the coalition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Doolin has seen Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he had heard of Rogge’s appearance, he still did not expect that the big conspirators who had easily ruined the Holy Alliance would be so amazing. A fat man. But he didn't know why, when he sat across from Rogge, he always felt very uncomfortable. It seemed that something in this fat man's eyes made him instinctively scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linyi sat down, Rogge asked: "General Doolin, which is more important to your personal life and the life of all your soldiers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin replied without hesitation: "Of course it is the life of my subordinates! Cherish the life of every soldier is the basic duty of any qualified commander."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge asks: "If compared with your personal honor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warrior's life More than everything!" Du Lin solemnly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Du Lin sneer a little confused? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge faintly said: "Kerry Dagong wants to kill all the captives in the Wright Fortress. If it weren't for me, you and your ministry would be early." It turned into a dead body. But the Wright Fortress is in Layton after all, and now I need a reason to stop Kerry from killing. Your personal honor is my reason, for your life under 40,000, surrender. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up and sat down. He never thought that Rogge would raise such a condition. He finally replied: "40,000 slaughter." Prisoners of war! I don't believe that Kerry can do this crazy thing! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned: "General Doolin, you are too young." Kings of all ages, have you done anything? Do you have to think about killing 40,000 people? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin's forehead blue-stranded bulge, he suddenly slammed the table, roaring: "The Latvian warriors will not surrender, nor will they yield!" You want to engage in massacres, I am afraid that it is not so easy! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards behind him saw him and tried to subdue Du Lin, but he was knocked down to the ground in a blink of an eye. Du Lin took out a guard. The long sword, I want to rush to Rogge. He knows that Rogge’s status is respected, and as long as he has subdued this fat man, he may be able to exchange the freedom of the fortress for 40,000 soldiers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rogge muttered something, Du Lin did not listen, but he did not care, maybe this fat man was scared to talk nonsense! He swung a sword, the heart expected that the sword will be stable The ground stopped at the neck of this fat man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly raised his hand and pointed at him, Du Lin was a numb, and could not move anymore.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paralysis! How can it be? "Du Lin remembered that Rogge was a great magician, but why didn't he see him cursing? Isn't the ambiguous words just a spell? This is too short!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog stood up and slammed his fist on Du Lin’s face and flew him out!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard, Du Lin just climbed up. His face was bloody and his nose was interrupted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Want to kill you four Ten thousand people are no longer easy. Rogge sneered, and sat down again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin wiped the blood on his nose and sat down in front of Rogge.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General Doolin, I did not think that you are such a selfish person, for the sake of personal honor, even tens of thousands of soldiers' life and death. Very good, we don't have to talk about it. From today, I will completely hand over the Wright Fortress to the Kingdom of Leighton. Tomorrow I will withdraw the 5,000 people stationed here. If you want to encourage riots, there is still a day to consider planning. Rogge said, he stood up and wanted to leave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute! Du Lin finally stopped Rogge and asked: Do you know if you are telling the truth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roghaha smiles, I just want to save The fate of your 40,000 prisoners, but I did not expect you to be so indecisive, and would not provide me with a reason to save your life! The Wright Fortress is completely isolated from inside and outside information, and you should understand what it means. We can make a bet, my troops will be withdrawn, and within a month, Kerry will kill you all! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Du Lin is still hesitating, Rogge said coldly: "If you can't wait for a month, then I will inform you all." Captive soldiers, you don’t surrender every day, I will draw a hundred soldiers to kill. 40,000 people can kill more than a year, so that most people can live longer. Doolin, you still don't understand, now you have no choice. Even if I am lying to you, you can only gamble! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat down, holding his head in his hands, whispering: "Give me some time, let me think about it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned and said: "You are also a general, who has taken the army, how is this mother-in-law?" Don't think about it, it's a pen and paper. Are you not a sister who hasn't seen you for many years? Write a letter to her, write everything in today, and it doesn't matter if you tell the truth. You told her that for the people of Latvia to consider, let her surrender quickly, and I did not end well with me. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The city of Yunxiao sent her back to organize the resistance. I will immediately lead the troops to rebel. If you have this letter, you may be able to protect her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin firmly pushed the pen and paper back and would not persuade her, I am proud of her! If she can die gloriously, it is also the duty of a warrior! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sneered: "How do you know that the city of the Clouds is cleaner than me?" It is totally different to die for the people and to die as a running dog. This is good, since you are not willing to persuade, the decisions and reasons for surrendering today are written down as they are, and it is a reference for her! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted and I could write. But if you thought she would surrender for my brother, it would be a big mistake, just like I decided. It won't surrender because of her life and death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "As long as her quality is as noble as you said, then absolutely escape Out of my palm. If you really want to do something good for your warrior and the people of Latvia, then work for me! The real warrior will not care about the worldly evaluation, let history review your merits! For the people, it is true that they can live a good life. It is not important for anyone to rule. You swear allegiance to the Latvian royal family, but if the people are better under my rule than in the past, then you said, you Is the loyalty right or wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slowly said: "Roger, although I am in prison, I have heard a little bit of summer. What did you do? What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: I have heard about this. When I settled the rebellion, I will investigate Xia Shang immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the rumor is true?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rangerson said: "If you are guilty, you will be punished. The last thing I fear is killing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded resolutely Road: "I can bear the stigma of the traitor, as long as you can honor the promise just made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha laughed! You will see that the people of Latvia lived much better than the royal family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days of rest, Rogge returned to the army and continued to move into the cliff. The Bauhinia Butterfly got the information for the first time and immediately mobilized the troops. , ready to withdraw into the Central Mountain Range.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a series of sudden changes disrupted her layout.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp First, the two rebel leaders who led to the split of the rebels suddenly announced that they would talk to Rogge and discuss the conditions of honesty for the happiness of the Latvian people and the early end of the war. They claimed that Rogge was a great king, only in When he was in the empire, he was blinded by his men. Now Rogge has promised that they will severely punish Xia Shang and his party, and promise to bring more affluent life to the people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp More viciously, they also accused the Bauhinia Butterfly of not surrendering for the sake of self-interest. She ignored the life and death of her men, colluded with the devil, and insisted on dragging the people into the flames. The only purpose is to Build a Bauhinia dynasty and become a To the first queen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for other rumors accusing the Bauhinia butterfly of being sloppy, it is full of flying, painting, and its rapid spread is simply amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a moonlit knight, full mastery of the situation is the most basic requirement. But even if she calms down and listens to a series of rumors that she used the temptation to demon I was also mad at the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are not big events, and a letter sent by Rogge to send her completely The dilemma.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter written by my brother Du Lin, except for explaining the passage and reasons for the surrender, there is nothing else. The Bauhinia Butterfly will give this letter to The three Druid consultants circulated it again. She clearly saw that although these high-level Druids were understandable, they obviously had contempt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia Butterfly sighs quietly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She understands her brother.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She understands that it takes courage to resolutely give up personal glory and bear the accusations of the people, subordinates, and even the comrades who have fought side by side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can history really give a fair evaluation? Even if they can, how do those historians know the real reason behind these difficult decisions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what made her embarrassed was a notice from Rogge that was publicly distributed to the entire occupied area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the notice is very simple: the townspeople of the cliff town colluded with the rebel army and treated it as a rebel army. No one is a sinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly can't help but tremble with the notice. The Druid consultants also looked at each other and angered: "This demon wants to kill the city! There is no humanity, but unfortunately, the devil is not removed earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia The butterfly completely ignored these useless nonsense, she was struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon these townspeople? These simple people have been supporting her with all their heart and soul! At this moment, they are left to wait for Rogge’s butcher’s knife. How can it be? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but with these townspeople fleeing together? That will inevitably be caught up by the army of Rogge, and finally the whole army will be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid consultants are looking at the Bauhinia butterfly, waiting for her decision. The time is tight at the moment, and it has been delayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lips of the Bauhinia Butterfly are pale and not a little bloody. Her hands are shaking and her heart is struggling. The right decision is there, very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how can she? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Cliffs is her hometown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the knocking sound rang softly, breaking the dead silence in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old mayor who has been in his early forties has come in. The old man’s pace is slow but firm, his old voice is with the free and easy appearance of the dust: “Children, we already know the announcement of the tyrant Rogge. I know that you must be very embarrassed now, there are more than 2,000 old people and women in the town. With the children, it is impossible for us to escape from the pursuit of Rogge. We all discussed it for a moment, and the strong young people who are able to eat hard and strong will follow you. We will stay behind. Anyway, I couldn’t escape to death. Why didn’t I die so hard? Just...the pity of the children.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old mayor sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia Butterfly slowly looked up, and the eyes of several Druid advisors consciously avoided, but they still can see their expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt aversion in her heart. Since the beginning of the war, these high-level Druids have to intervene in decision-making, but they are only half-baked about the military. Their reason is nothing more than participation in decision-making to better fight in combat. But how do you use the powerful Druid and the well-trained Icewind Warrior, how can you not know the Bauhinia Butterfly as a moonlit knight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when it comes to the real problem, no one of these Druids will stand up. This kind of decision will be blamed anyway. She suddenly suspected that if it was really necessary to decide on a deadly battle, would these Druids really depend on it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly sighs secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sin, let me take it alone...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded The sound is cold like the smog that is blown out in the ice purgatory: "It is so decided. If you can keep up with our pace, we will gather in the military camp tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This escape trip is not easy to go, in addition to the pursuit of Rogge elite troops, there will be locust-like hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the troops of the Bauhinia Butterfly were assembled outside the town. The townspeople who could not be evacuated came outside the town and quietly watched the opposing troops and relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No tears, no emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the wind is whistling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden hoof came, and several ice-cold warriors who came to the blood rushed to the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights shouted in the distance: "The army of Rogge is already a hundred miles away! We just had three elves with him." The soldiers handed over and killed more than 20 talents to force them back! These elves must be the dark side of the moon! The adults are quickly withdrawn, and it’s too late to come..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The voice did not fall, he suddenly planted Malay, no longer move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly gritted his teeth and finally issued an order to evacuate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the army is almost disappearing at the end of the road, the remaining townspeople are still standing still, watching the direction of their loved ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the road, a ride suddenly flies back and looks at the purple figure, it is the Bauhinia butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran all the way to the outside of the town, suddenly jumped off the horse, fell to the ground, fell to the townspeople of Cliff Town, cried a few times, Then fly on the horse and gallop away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At noon, Rogge’s army has surrounded the cliff town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rug of armored armor was slowly swaying under the crowd and came to the square in the center of the town. All the remaining townspeople have gathered there, waiting for the final verdict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took off his helmet, his eyes swept one by one from these townspeople, and finally fell on a beautiful little girl of five years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and the little girl flew to his own hands. The child's mother exclaimed, and then she covered her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at the little girl’s pure and innocent eyes, and the little girl looked back at him without fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge lifted the little girl up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes fell on his hand. What will happen next? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the sword to wear the heart, is it a heavy fall, or is it ashes in the flame of the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger looked around the audience and slowly said: "You have colluded with the rebels, and I have announced the punishment you deserve. Now you should stay with them. I know my own destiny. Although I can’t bear it, my dignity as a king is not tolerated, and my decision must be implemented.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Rogge glanced at it The girl in her hand suddenly screamed: "But only this young life is more important than my dignity! You are forgiven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plop, a soldier behind Rogge suddenly slammed down, and then the soldiers squatted one by one, black pressed a figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, it seems that the focus of the world is the little girl in the hands of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog gently put the little girl on the ground, took out the sabre, pointed to the direction of the Bauhinia butterfly, and said: "Do not catch the enchanting Bauhinia butterfly. This time, I will not return to the division!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron hoist rumbling, tens of thousands of troops rushed along with Rogge, but there was not a soldier left to watch This is full of rebellious cliff towns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Rogge’s tens of thousands of troops stopped at the foot of the Central Mountain Range. This time, the rushing army ordered Rogge to be quite satisfied. Tens of thousands of people rushed for half a day. Although the formation was loose, not many people left the team. Under the military order, camping and rest, everything is in order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit is not an invincible tiger wolf, but it can’t be underestimated. They are no longer the rookies who just got into the battlefield and will always be confused. The troops are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked up at the central mountain range, with no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original mountain forest is the world of Druid, but it is also the world of elves and Tickton warriors. As long as the Hughes, the class, and the *** can block Nicholas, the Bauhinia Butterfly and her Druids will never be able to compete with Rogge and his Moon Dark and Tickton Warriors in the virgin forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class and Rogge talked until midnight before leaving the big account. Instead of returning to his own camp, he went straight to the Central Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death class had just left, a silver figure rose in the moonlight and floated silently to Rogge’s big account in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only ten meters away from the big account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of silver is a slight meal, it seems to be adding, but suddenly it is in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, the elegant and mysterious demon lotus armor is slowly descending from the void. Behind the demon lotus, there is a huge, awkward, strange bone dragon, which is swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do you want to go?" Weina was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas turned slowly and replied faintly: "Since they are not both, then ***, it’s not bad to kill you first."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner ignored it, and the devil's mask had a faint golden gaze in his eyes, and he was observing Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon slammed, and the two wings smacked a few times toward Nicholas. However, of course, it does not dare to really rush to teach the silver miracle in the dragon, even if Nicholas is now only the elf body, it is absolutely not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Dragon is just picking the way: "Master, he dared to disrespect you! Kill him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina slammed two voices, still staring at Nicholas, just like idiots, just arbitrarily replied: "It can be wrong, it is really good, how could I not think of it before? Have to take a closer look ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the big account curtain glimpsed, Rogge laughed and walked out, how Guras adults are so good tonight, I want to squat Moonlight to visit the Central Mountains? Since you are here, it is impossible to say that you will not be able to entertain you for a scrambled egg. However, only one of these countless eggs is a special dragon egg. Can you eat your luck? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas looks cold and coldly: "I know that you are delaying the time, but I will not kill you for the time being, it is too cheap for you." I am here, just to cut off your legs and your roots, so that you can't be a man from now on! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smiles are a bit unnatural at first, and he gnashed his teeth: "Neros, you have completely fallen!" Are you afraid that Dragon God will punish your cruelty and absurdity? If you are so mad, you will be abandoned by the Dragon God! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty has now been involved in the game of struggle for profit, and all the spare time has to be used to enhance personal strength, otherwise *** The obvious test is really scaring him. However, his lustful nature has not changed at all. Now he is just an ordinary woman, and he has no time and energy in this regard.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casting, in fact, just poked the pain of Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a threat that a holy silver dragon should think of Nikola snorted and said that if you want to seduce me, then I will come. I will look at it, only one ** *, can you stop my blow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands slowly lifted, and a little silver starlighted on the fingers of the fingers. A sudden hurricane suddenly razed everything within a few tens of meters around the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge is serious, and he did not expect Nicholas to go all out as soon as he comes up. It seems that this will be a tough fight before Hughes and the class come back. The fat man bit his teeth and decided to fight. As long as the success has been delayed for a long time, Nicholas will be seriously injured this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really good, it's a perfect body!" Wella finally came back, she stared at Nicholas: "This body belongs to me! You can Going to find another sustenance for your soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas sneered, only when Wella was talking nonsense. His hands were hugged, and a silver ball of light that could not be described was formed in his palm. When the silver light ball began to burst out of the electric fire, Nicholas had already shivered because of the excessive force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willa lightly smile and win? It seems that you are still afraid of me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put her hands on her chest and then pulled them open on both sides, as if she was going to take something out. But even though she was dancing lightly, There is nothing in between, and there is nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina squinted, hands pulled again, still nothing!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the slow flying silver ball has crossed half the distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has felt something wrong, he refuses to attack Nicholas in the weak, the fat body turned into a virtual shadow, flew to Wei Na.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina clear, every golden on the demon The patterns were all lit up, and her hands were slowly pulled apart again, but the pair of hands were still nothing!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil suddenly trembled Then every piece of the nails has a sharp whistling sound, and the space inside the demon lotus has become a mess like a river. In this squally space In the storm, Wella's soul is supporting hard. She avoids numerous space cracks and tries to stabilize the origin of the god who suddenly becomes violent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why can't I control my power, has the space law of this world changed? ! "Werner can hardly believe her own inference. "I haven't been sleeping for a long time!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Rogge, *** is like being scared, and after doing two moves in silly, it will not move any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silvery light of the ball of light has now illumined the demon mask of the devil!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog The action was incredibly fast. He jumped up and grabbed the metal wings behind the demon lotus, and he took full advantage of it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Wei Na did not move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge clasps the devil's waist and succumbs to the side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina is still motionless !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue’s face changes. In the face of Nicholas’s full blow, all his magic will not work, if you want to save ** *, only hard and silver miracles competed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath, he blocked in front of Wella, the whole body bow Up, arms crossed to protect the head. In front of him, there was a side The silver light shield, which is condensed by mental power, is accompanied by the spirit of his madness, and the fine lines of the magic are spreading on the light shield.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing that the light ball wrapped around the electric fire is getting closer and closer, Rogge's eyes are closed, waiting quietly for the moment of the stone breaking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The filigree of the cyan and gold patterns suddenly appeared, grabbed Rogge's back collar and brought him behind him. The other slender hand stretched out and held the ball of light that embodies the power of Nicholas.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fiber contains the power that does not belong to this world!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ball of light is beating, not living with the devil Rubbing and piercing sounds. But finally, it can't resist the endless pressure from the hands of the hands, and finally burst into a terrible energy storm, destroying everything within a hundred meters.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge has been vomiting blood because of his excessive mental strength, and he is not awake.<br /><br />&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina throws Rogge on the ground and throws her hands again. This time, there are finally more than ten irregular black lines between her fingers. But look closely, those thin lines are not solid, they are black, because all the objects that have been unfortunately swept by them have been completely swallowed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at Nicholas and said coldly: "Since you are known as the Silver Miracle, you must have a good fighting art. Let me try your melee art. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas's pupils shrank and stared at the black lines that were fascinating between Weina's hands. He knows that these thin lines are actually a series of space cracks that can easily cut all the hardest materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of creating space cracks does not require much power, and the power of Nicholas can easily tear the space. But how can we use space cracks like the limited power that Wella shows at the moment? This is like a small child waving a red-hot steel knife to defend the enemy. The red steel knife is certainly amazingly killing, but it can also easily destroy the person who waved it. What's more, Wei Na is not just waving a red steel knife, she is waving more than a dozen at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a skill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas suddenly screamed in amazement, and the silver magic lines lit up again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina sneered a bit, and she wanted to see what Nicholas could do next. Although in terms of strength, Nicholas is still stronger than her at this moment, but Wella is a light angel born for the battle, her endless fighting art is enough to make up for this power gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Nicholas’s figure suddenly blurred. At a great distance, a little silver flashed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory can miss this opportunity and immediately scream: "Vina master, you are so great! Even the silver miracle is in you In the face of no war, there is still a dragon who dares to glory in front of you. The master’s master has just offended your majesty. He has caught your wings! You must have a good meal! But it looks like he It’s not a bad injury now. In order to punish him more than a few times in the future, you can see if he has healed him first.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Na glanced at Rogge, who was lying on the ground, and snorted, his hand waving slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invisible giant stick will soon fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wena is cold and cold: "He can't die anyway, I have to chase my body first. Do you want to escape? It's not that easy!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina's small mouth, squirting a pale gold star, a little star shines around the space. Under the brilliance of the golden light, a silver thread slowly emerged, and the curved track marked the trajectory of Nicholas' flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful figure of the demon lotus gradually disappeared into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead bone dragon is busy flying from the ground and chasing in the direction of the owner's departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, suddenly passed two shadows like light smoke, it was the Shusi and Death class that was killed. According to the plan, how can Rogge and *** drag Nicholas for a while, when the two old foxes came back and killed, just killing the silver miracle. Hughes has already noticed that Nicholas is nearby. Of course, if he can't stand it, the two old foxes are just running empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they saw, except for a vague back of Gregory, there was only Rogge who was still unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have seen at a glance that Rogge is overpowering, and that coma is also a kind of rest, so he is not in a hurry to wake Rogge. Only the two people have already sensed the battle here, and then calculate the time, can not help but face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever won?" The death class whispered, still seemingly unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s true." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Death Class became extremely ugly: "This... is not too fast... a little too fast..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xius comforted him: "You don't have to worry too much about the class. It seems that the power of the adult is not particularly strong, she can only use these forces to the extreme. At least from At present, *** adults are still very temperate, although you and she still have a lot of festivals, but as long as they are fully guarded, they will be attacked seriously by her, and death will not die, martial arts will not be damaged, you What are you afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the comfort of Xius, the face of the class is even more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he only sighed and said: "Hughes, it seems that I am really old, it is time to retire." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the endless night sky, a little silver starlight shimmers. One of the most dazzling stars is bright and dark, and every flash of this starlight will appear in another place that is far apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas fled and ridiculed himself. The elf's agility talent has been swayed to the extreme, but this skill is not used in combat, but most of the time to escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time, escape, but a word that does not appear in the Silver Miracle Dictionary at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight's *** gives him a wonderful feeling. Her strength has indeed increased, but it is limited. But I don't know why, in the face of ***, Nicholas felt that he had no confidence for the first time, so he did not dare to accept the challenge of her melee. You must know that melee is the strength of Yinlong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distant night sky, a dreamlike figure rises and stops Nicholas’s way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas suddenly stood in the air, frowning and looking at the woman in front of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recognition of breath, he knows that there is a *** that has been played several times. But who is chasing after him? The memory of the soul energy tells him that it is also ***. From the point of view of the strength of its own strength, the two *** are exactly the same, but the silver miracle clearly feels that the *** who just let him escape without fighting is chasing along the breath he left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How come there are two ***? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas didn't think it was funny. In fact, he couldn’t laugh at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really two ***. No matter which one, it is very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very weak. Run so fast, where do you want to go?" *** asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas snorted and is also a strong player in this world. Don’t you dare to wait for me to regain my strength and then fight with my fair and fair? What is your dignity and glory? ***, your behavior is not at all respected by me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The wings behind the wings are slowly stretching, and the force of sudden lifting causes the surrounding space to be slightly distorted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is cold and succinct: "The respect of the loser is worthless. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas sighed with a sigh of relief. This *** seems to have no conscious self-consciousness. It is impossible to tell her. Just with Weiner. The extremely short battle has already consumed a lot of his energy, and now he is fighting with the ***, it is fierce. Now he only wants to take a blow of the ***, and then find a chance to escape.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Wella, who is still far away, suddenly crossed the gap of time and space and appeared behind Nicholas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s not just Nicholas’s surprise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** of the gray robe is in opposition to the Wei Na hiding in the mysterious and elegant demon lotus armor. There seems to be an invisible energy storm whistling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas is in the middle of the two women, but their eyes crossed over his shoulders, just staring at each other .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the great silver miracle that was completely ignored for the first time in his life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "In such a vast world, why can you meet you in such a short time?" Weina chuckled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't stay long." ***Cold and cold answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you can support it for a long time, there will always be a day to go back?" I am ready to welcome you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The space around it suddenly produced countless thin ripples, and her clear voice was like countless pearls on the jade plate:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go back now and prepare!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
