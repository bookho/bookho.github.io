			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the two sins and punishments<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; total height nearly three kilometers The peak of the cloud, the part close to the ground is only a few tens of kilometers. In the endless wilderness, it is like a giant pillar, standing proudly between heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a pity that it’s arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground around Yunxiaofeng, there are more than ten large and tightly protected castles. Under the castle, 50,000 dwarf warriors are taking turns, and the tunnels leading to the Yunxiao Peak are excavated day and night. The top of Yunfeng Peak is hard rock, but it is not a problem for dwarves who are used to hollowing out a rock mountain. Within a few days, more than ten tunnels have been merged at the bottom of the Yunxiao Peak. Then, the number of feeder tunnels used to detect the topographic structure of the Yunxiao Peak began to extend in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50,000 dwarf slave warriors are all elites carefully selected by Alexander. At least half of them are engineering masters, and several of them have been designed throughout. Big engineer in the dwarf underground city. With the support of the Astrafik Empire, the tools used by the dwarves are even better than the Dwarf Empire. Now there are hundreds of magicians working together with the dwarfs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the mad plan to dig down the city from the ground, the progress was unexpectedly fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few days, the Druids on the city of Yunxiao, under the leadership of the elders, tried the sneak attack. But the only thing that greets them is the arrow rain, the spear, and the deadly axe. After dropping more than a hundred bodies, the Druids had to flee back to the city of Yunxiao. They didn't even know what was found by the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of the Clouds protects the magical sky. The wrath of the sky cannot penetrate the thick layers of soil and rocks, so there is no way to dwarf the dwarf underground. And Alexander's army is stationed outside the scope of the wrath of the sky. The troops used to protect the tunnels and monitor the peaks of the clouds are under the strict protection of the war priests. Even if the city of the Clouds lowers the wrath of the sky, it can only kill dozens of warriors. Compared with the magic power of this magic consumption, this victory is completely worth the loss. At the time of the collapse of the mountain, the city of the Clouds requires a lot of magic to keep the city intact and the safety of the soldiers in the city. Therefore, the Druids never attacked Alexander's army again, nor did they use the wrath of the sky, allowing the dwarves to dig at the bottom of the peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily morning. Rogge and Alexander and Pompey will watch the city of clouds that are hidden in the clouds of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druids can never wait so quietly. This is what they all know, but they don't know what Druid is hiding in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days. They have more new troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days ago, the emperor was filled with anger and anger has been quickly delivered to the military camp under Yunxiaofeng. However, Pompey and Alexander turned a blind eye to this order, but on the one hand, they thought that they would stabilize the messenger, and on the other hand, they secretly stepped up the progress of excavating the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the first messenger's ass has not yet stabilized, and the second messenger has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the content of the order was even more stringent, and the attitude of the urging them to withdraw their troops was more determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the third day, another messenger rushed to the military camp. This time he brought the emperor’s personal handwriting instructions. Strictly ordered Pompey and Alexander to retreat immediately, or they must be severely punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander, Pompeii, and Rogge know that it takes at least twenty days to dig a peak like the Cloud City. The three were all hot and determined. After a discussion, the current secret sent a team of Qingqi to patrol the road to the emperor, in order to kill the subsequent imperial messengers together with a follower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the murderer, it is easier to blame the Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the three emissaries in the military camp, they were circled in a remote camp. Do not allow random access. Pompey and Alexander threatened to make a heavy bribe. These messengers have a life-threatening hand, and they are naturally scared and timid, and no longer dare to say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The emperor is urging us to hurry. He has waited impatiently." Alexander comforted Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just 20 days, the dwarves have completed the construction of Yunxiaofeng underground. They don't need to hollow out the entire cloud peak, as long as it can make it out of balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destruction is far easier than construction. In the eyes of the dwarf, simply downgrading such a mountain is much less difficult than building a dungeon in the mountainside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this long period of time, Rogge has a feeling of doing nothing. He goes to visit Androni every day. On the one hand, she cares about her recovery of her injuries, on the other hand, she is cheaper when she is weak in her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is busy preparing new magic potions every day, and occasionally very close relatives to Rogge. She can always easily cause the fat color and yu fire, and then find a way to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one time can’t escape. Seeing that Rogge is going to move really. She exclaimed: "Don't!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled: "Do you know regret now? It's too late!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stared at Rogge and lay down on the sky. The eyes are closed, the head sideways, cold and cold: "Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slightly forwarded, and Froya immediately fell into a Trembling. Although she has nothing to do on the surface, her right hand has five fingers, and she has quietly grasped the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the little goblins waited for a long time, and there was no other movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria blinked and saw that Rogge held his hand in his hand and was enjoying her beautiful face in a very close distance, just with a look A little joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you waiting for?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin, despite his skill, can’t help but pass a blush on his face and see Roger’s heart move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed Rogge, but she did not move. I have to say: "Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge certainly won't let it, just smile and ask: "How can you accompany me with willingness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin smiled and said: "This sentence is almost the same. Actually, I want to be willing to be very simple! Either you fall in love with me, or else you will find a way to let me Falling in love with you, you can take one of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, she finally struggled out from under Rogge and finished her clothes. Road: "Dead fat, don't always think about taking advantage of me! This kind of thing. Always want you to be willing to be happy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roghaha smiled and said: "This kind of thing, when you are reluctant, I might be happier!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria The body trembled, and then, like a frightened bunny, hurriedly escaped the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days have come. For some unknown reason, the mood of Wind Butterfly has become extremely unstable. The dark power in her body climbed day after day, and correspondingly, the original instinct of her body became extremely strong. Every night, she has to linger with Rogge before she can get into the deepest sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the wind and the butterfly, Rogge couldn’t help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping butterfly is still beautiful, but it is still. The simple elf who rode the white tiger that year has already died in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Northland Wilderness, no matter whether in the city or outside the city, all the people are waiting for the moment when the city of Yunxiao collapses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the scheduled decisive battle day approaching, the heartbeat of the 100,000-strong army surrounded by the clouds and peaks will quietly accelerate a little. Most warriors are unaware of this, and a few people who are alert are mostly attributed to tension. Only a handful of people, such as Rogge, have noticed that the surrounding space has begun to become abnormal. But no matter how they observe, think, discuss, and test, they can't find the cause of the abnormality, and even the possible consequences of this abnormality are not in the slightest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was always upset, but he knew he couldn't find out why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint fear, I finally waited for the moment of decisive battle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early morning of the Day of the Decline, Rogge looked at the distant city of Yunxiao, listening to the squadrons of the past, but there was some hope and relaxation in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the passage of the Alexander Command, there was a slight tremor in the earth. Then, the tremors became more and more obvious. There have been war horses humming low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows. This is the giant pillars that support the ground on the east side of Yunxiaofeng. They are being blown down one by one. When all the giant stone pillars were blown up, the ground that was hollowed out at that time would no longer be able to withstand the weight of the cloud peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bang of loud noise came from far away. On the east side of Yunxiaofeng, there is a large mountain that falls off the mountain peak, and countless megaliths slam into the ground in the smoke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time even ordinary soldiers can see the towering clouds peaking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, after a deafening roar, no more voices can be heard in the ears of more than 100,000 Imperial soldiers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant peak of the cloud slams silently to the east, the yellow smoke rises from the peak, and in a blink of an eye, the ground that spans dozens of kilometers . The boulder flutters in the dust, and the sandstone falls like a galaxy. The peak of the cloud in the middle of the slope was suddenly short, and then the huge peak was broken into three sections in the air, slowly falling to the ground. The huge wind pressure will spur the smoke out of the sky, and even the smallest gravel in the dust will become sharp like a knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of the vision of heaven and earth, the power of all the mighty is as small as an ant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 100,000 warriors who have experienced battles have been deeply shocked by the spectacular sights that have never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is going according to plan, and Yunfeng’s falling direction is exactly the same as what the Dwarf engineers expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Rogge suddenly exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ever-declining city of the Clouds has already emerged from the clouds, revealing the true colors of Cangxiong Qingqi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the entire air city is surrounded by a huge electric light, which is mysterious, majestic and imposing. But what surprised Rogge was that the city of Yunxiao slowly broke away from the mountain that was dumping in the east and turned to the west! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Yunxiao is actually a city of flight? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it took a long time to fly in the city of Yunxiao, it began to slant down to the ground. Look at its whereabouts, it should still be in the encirclement of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the main force of the Imperial Army was placed in the east of Yunxiaofeng, and the defense in the west was much weaker. However, tens of thousands of elite imperial warriors can at least block the Druids for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the West Force is a veteran veteran who observes the flight path of the Cloud City and estimates the distance. Command the army back to the camp and defend it with the defense facilities of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Yunxiao will fall in a place about one kilometer before the big camp. If the Druids are not killed, they will want to escape. Barriers to the Imperial Army Barracks. As long as the Western troops can hold on for a while, when the army of the Eastern Front returns, it is the end of Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pompey and Alexander each went all the way, bypassing the still-falling clouds and peaks from both sides, rushing to the place of the city of Yunxiao . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few hundred meters from the ground, the city of Yunxiao suddenly adjusted the angle, did not fall into the ground, but continued to fly forward The distance of flying is much farther than the expectations of the Emperor's generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the last place to go, it’s the camp of the emperor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire city left a deep ditch on the ground, slanting into the embassy camp, completely destroying the entire barracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
