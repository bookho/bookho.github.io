			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since returning to the city of Yunxiao, Frey has always been obsessed with Androni, and he has never had a soul all day. In particular, when I recalled that A. Rodriguez, who was in blue, smashed the sword like a ghost, he was excited and shivered. The tremor from the depths of the soul would rush from the end of each nerve and converge into a small The rivers and rivers, and finally the raging, rushing tides of all the embankments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all this can only be thought of. He knows that unless he betrays his father and betrayed the North Druid League, it is possible to be together. But he can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Druid League was killed by Androni in a dozen breaths, no one dared to hide this big thing. So when Frey returned to the city of the Clouds, it was reported to the Presbyterian Church in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the Northern Druid League are extremely angry with this, although it is the already-calculated person, Androni, who did not threaten her. Life and safety, she should not be such a heavy hand anyway. The Presbyterian immediately sent a magical messenger to the Rhine League, asking Pross to have a confession on the matter. Unsurprisingly, Pross smashed the magic messenger and said that the people of the North Druid League were killed by the self-sufficiency. Who would let them have nothing to provoke their apprentice? If you don't accept it, even if you come to plan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wrath of the sky and Pross is a complete break. It’s just that the distance between the North and the South is too far away. After the miracle, the situation in the south has become increasingly tense and has reached the edge of a touch. The North Druid League is really reluctant to be involved in this conflict. In the war between countries, the North Druid Alliance is stronger, and it is absolutely not daring to intervene. Moreover, the South is also where the strong people gather. And Prossis is in a chaotic situation, and he has no skills. Although he is arrogant, he will not be stupid enough to go to the old wrath of the sky to find things. Because of this, the two great powers did not make a good one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak is helpless in this ending, and he knows that he has no chance with the handsome blue swordsman. However, I thought of unintentionally breaking up Rogge's marriage, and harming people and not benefiting them. This made Frey more and more heart-rending and increasingly sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge led the intelligence of the Elf four tribes to the city of Yunxiao one by one. After hearing the news that Rogge built the city of the gods, Frei knew that Rogge was not optimistic. He finally decided to help Rogge a little, and comforted his conscience a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his life, it is rare to find Rogge as a confidant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Frey's intentions, Rogge couldn't help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak, although not stated, Rogge had already guessed that the damned Druid must have cracked his charm magic. Although he hates itching in his heart, but Frey's magic is strong, and brings a large number of high-ranking men, this time is using them! Retaliation, may wish to talk slowly. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge made up his mind now, if there is any good errand in the future, retreating from the temple, must be handed over to these Druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month without a moon, in a desolate house in the northwest corner of Dresden, the atmosphere is unspeakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty people wearing black robes are busy entering and exiting, placing various magical items in designated positions under the command of several collars. Location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a grand ritual ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of this house seems to be the appearance of an ordinary big family, but when you step into the door, when you walk in, you open it in the place that should be the wall. A tall, dark door, a staircase straight down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stairs are not long and lead to a very grand and spacious underground hall. The area of ​​this underground hall has passed the entire yard area. Looking out from the outside of the house alone, I will never think that there will be such a vast world below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large and complex magical array on the central floor of the underground hall. This magical array has obviously been some years old, and the purple-black magic symbol has been somewhat peeled off. But from the bloody suffocating air that always lingers in the room, these magical symbols seem to be all painted with blood! In the center of the magic array is an altar filled with purple and black blood. On the high platform in front of the altar, there is a statue of a demon that is more than two meters tall and horrible. Obviously, this statue is the object of worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young, healthy and beautiful girl, the skin is smooth and elastic like satin. Such a shy situation made her skin reveal a rose red, which is glamorous and beautiful. But the eyes of the believers are only fanatic, only the focus of the work in the opponent, as if the girl in front is a stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Karlon, the girl who sacrificed this time is more beautiful than any other, and the spirit is much stronger! You said, will we succeed this time? ?" asked a black robe magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the oldest magician sighed that their magic is really insufficient! This annual ritual of the great god of the Amorro has only successfully communicated with the great god twice in more than a decade. However, because the sacrifices found were too bad, the help of the great god could not be obtained. It’s hard to find such a good sacrifice now, but it’s less than Louis’s failure to succeed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's Louis, the brainless bastard! It is necessary to plan what to assassinate the magician Rogge. He also doesn't want to think that it is so easy to deal with the great magician who can seal some of the body of the Amorro adults? It doesn't matter if he died himself, but it hurts us to lack a magician at such a critical time! It’s so bad that if you have such a good sacrifice, if you lose a lot because of the lack of magic, it’s too bad! "Another magician hates to say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Since the 13-year-old president, Valle, has fortunately met the servant and got the eyes of the Americans, the branch of our Eye of Wisdom has been turned into sixteen by six! Moreover, the presidents of the two clubs successfully summoned the consciousness of the Amorous adults in the sacrifice, and thus got two mysterious and powerful magic! This time, if we have another magician, with the excellent posture of this girl, we will certainly be able to summon success and make wishes! At that time, Master Carmon, you will be able to sit in the elders' hall of the headquarters and really missed this opportunity, but I really don't know what year and month to find such a good sacrifice. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon sighs and mentions these things! Everything is the arrangement of fate! As long as we are pious, one day we will touch the great god of Amorro, Let's lower the gods! Ok, time is coming, call everyone in, ready to hold the ceremony!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty eyes of wisdom The believers walked into the underground summoning room and arranged a neat formation around the altar. The curse of the three magicians slowly sounded. Every believer took out a shackle and scratched his wrist, letting the blood fall into the huge magical array under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s spells are surprisingly lengthy, and there’s already a thin sweat on their foreheads, and Carmen’s body has faintly revealed the magic The light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the three magicians began to shine with various magical lights, and the magical array continued to have a magic symbol that began to light up. The blood on the ground of a beach is like the vitality, the songs are creeping and creeping, and a strip goes to the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl on the altar suddenly struggled with pain, as if something had torn her inside her body. But the mouth was filled with fragrant beads, she could only make a painful sob. The snoring is mixed in the curse, adding to the atmosphere of darkness, blood, madness and horror in the summoning hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the girl’s reaction, the three magicians couldn’t help but smile, their curse suddenly rose, and all the followers began to follow A spell. For a time, the fanatical, uniform spells echoed back and forth in the basement! There was a snoring of the girl’s pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl desperately writhed, seemingly incomparable pain, she opened her mouth and could not help but shed tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall demon statue suddenly moved, and two red lights in the eyes slowly lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the eyes of the believers of ecstasy, the curse became more hysterical, the blood madly gathered, squirming, desperately climbed the altar. The entire altar has turned into a bright red! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon pulled out a skeleton made of white bones, screaming and throwing the altar, will smash the heart of the girl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blood spurted high and splashed on the demon statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon madly recited the spell and couldn’t help but drag it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon statue suddenly trembled, and in the huge, harsh friction, it moved its joints and limbs one by one. It lowered its head, and two red-eyed eyes stared at the girl's body on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Success! Success!" The three magicians are so excited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fell on the ground and shouted: "Our God! Are you finally listening to your most humble believers?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha!" A huge mad laugh came out of the mouth of the demon statue. It opened its mouth and even stretched out a long, red-red tongue, sucking and splashing on it. Blood! "I haven’t tasted such a delicious taste for a long time! Hahahaha! This soul is also very good, I like it! No! Not only is it good, it is a perfect soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The believers of the Eye of Wisdom were shaken by the thunderous laughter of the demon god, but Carmon refused to roll to the ground and continued to scream: "My greatest God, you are satisfied with this." Sacrifice? Are you satisfied with the gifts your believers have prepared for you? If you are satisfied, try to take away all the sacrifices! Do you still need your servant to do something for you? You will know our piety right away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil like this turned his head and looked at the magicians on the ground, its low voice It sounds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! I need you! I can satisfy any of your wishes! But this soul is perfect, although her blood is sweet, but not enough! Not enough to help me come here from the distant Devil! I need more fresh Blood, more souls, more sacrifices! Go and do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear voice like Zhongming’s voice suddenly rang in the floor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think it's beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a black gas flashed over... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil looks incredibly as his huge body is slowly split into two halves, it waves helplessly, the red light in his eyes dims . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white, glaring barefoot flies out of thin air and kicks the demon statue out. Immediately there was a loud bang in the room! Smoke and dust! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dust and smoke, the stunned eyes of the wise man believe that a mysterious woman in gray robes, black and silver is quietly floating on the altar. Over the sky, look at the girl's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a big hole in the wall next to the basement. The original huge demon statue crossed the wall and it has become a pile of gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wave of air, suddenly a giant bone stalk was discovered! There are three large curved horns on the bone of the bone, and a huge blue spar is embedded in the forehead. The huge body of the bone dragon has also been laboriously drilled out of the outer world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its body is too big, it took up half of the entire basement. The believers were horrified to avoid the body that the bone dragon could not stretch, and the three black robe magicians could not stop. All this has already come out of their imagination, bone dragon, the legendary most powerful undead creatures appear here? The believers of the Eye of Wisdom have been deprived of their courage to resist or escape, and they only wait helplessly for the fate of judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone dragon huge mouth sucks, a group of red mist is sucked out from the pieces of the devil, then a sharp wave of consciousness washes the hearts of all believers Nerves:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is such a good chance, *** actually dare to grab in front of me! I am! What are you, you are so small The devil also came to grab things with Lao Tzu!? You are not too weak, can the body not come from the devil world? It doesn't matter, I will help you with the help of Laozi!" The bone dragon reprimanded the red fog in front of him. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon finally slowed down from the shock, he looked up and hurriedly asked, "The greatest dragon! Are you us?" The true God who believes in forgives our ignorance! We are actually... Is it true that we have gotten such a powerful dragon? Is it true that I have no dreams?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He I burst into excitement! Carmen studied summoning for nearly forty years and finally succeeded in the ancient years! And it is such a brilliant success! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Turned around and looked at the bone dragon quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon became more and more guilty, and it quickly lowered his head, tried to lie at the foot of the ***, and the tail swept to sweep away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a room full of gravel flying, hurricane bursting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** snorted and looked at the girl’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon is now, his own flattery seems to use the wrong object again. But is this woman like a crystal doll actually having the power to make the bones come true? He suddenly felt that the world of magic was so magical. He learned thirty years of magic, but it was getting more and more ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, what about this guy?" Gregorian asked with his front paws pointing at the red fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory screams, Zhangkou will be red The fog sucked into the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, this woman's soul energy is really pure! Finally we found the second coordinate to here, you see, is it? Make her a key?" The bone dragon who sat full of food looked at the girl on the altar. It is also somewhat amazed at the purity of the girl's soul. This is like an innocent jewel. Although it has no power in itself, it has the potential to make the best magical props. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Think about it and shake your head. She looked at Carmon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon saw for the first time the fascinating and beautiful face of the ***, when the brain screamed, the foot was soft, and fell to the ground! He didn't dare to look again, fell on the ground, and quickly climbed two steps forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My greatest master, what do you want to do? Want more sacrifices?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon turned back and said: "Come on the street and catch more people! How many are caught? Don't be afraid to alarm anyone! Go and catch me!" With such a powerful dragon as a backing, Carmen's enthusiasm is much better. What's more, this dreamy woman is obviously much more fierce than the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the people here are enough." *** faintly authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pointed her finger in the air, and all the believers who had broken their wrists screamed, and blood rushed out of their wrists like a spring. The tip gathers and goes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array is once again insanely running, and in the twinkling of an eye, all the believers have become corpses. A huge blood tumbling at the fingertips of the ***, slowly condensed into a statue of a headless angel with a height of more than a ruby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three magicians almost fainted and waited until they were not included in the list of sacrifices, which made a long sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Slightly wave your right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl on the altar suddenly sat up, and the golden cockroach jumped out of her chest, and the horrible wound on her chest began to heal with the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The fingertip of the right hand suddenly broke a small wound, and a drop of golden blood dripped onto the girl's forehead. In a twinkling of an eye, the girl's whole body began to glow with golden luster, and countless magic lines appeared on her, forming a beautiful and mysterious magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is so mad! This is a drop of blood from the owner's right hand! The owner's right hand is not even cut off by the artifacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl slowly opened her eyes, her eyes were amazed in the blue eyes, and then turned to Qingming. She stood up and stood up, and swelled in front of her, gently kissing the barefoot like a snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My master, I am your humblest and most loyal servant. Please tell me what should I do?" The girl's voice was pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You," *** pointed to three magicians, and Carmon and others immediately climbed a few steps. "Mora is the saint of the Church of Wisdom, and you are responsible for bringing her to the headquarters. She will guide my servants in the future. Keep the eyes of Amuro, I will retrieve it. And you Calmon, will be ranked among all my servants. If my believers have a belief that is not strong enough, Mora, calling my name, I will let his soul suffer the eternal burning in the fire of purgatory. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon and others are extremely fearful, but almost happy to faint. They did not expect to summon such a powerful god! And God also appointed Carmon as the president of the Eye of Wisdom! What a glory this is! He struggled for more than a decade, but nothing more than a position in the conference room at the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmon remembered again and carefully asked: "Great God, are you the servant of the great Amoro?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amorro is almost the same as the servant of the owner!" Bone Dragon immediately seized a chance to flatter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment a loud bang, the two doors in the basement flew up, and Rogge’s loud laughter came out of the door:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you are hiding here and do not do good things! The rabbits who dare to slay the heirs of the Principality, hand over the eyes of the demon you are hiding, maybe I will let you go!" I am a kindhearted person! Hahaha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man walked into the underground summoning room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long tortured the hiding place of the Eyes of Wisdom from the mouth of the magician who caught it, and learned that the church has a demon in the Amorro The secret of the eye. So Rogge had sent people to monitor it. The magician who was crushed by the spirit of Rogge was also unclear. There was also a very powerful alien servant guarding the eyes of the devil. However, he did not have time to explain that the devil's eye is not here, and he has been unable to withstand torture. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Rogge took the people in his hands and attacked them when they held the summoning ceremony. He is full of ambition and is determined to win the eye of the Amorro. Fat man knows how much value this kind of thing has! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the servant, Rogge looked behind him, there were Frey and his dozen warriors, plus the wind butterfly and the elf guardian warriors, as long as The opponent is not a dragon, what kind of monster is not hand-to-hand? Moreover, I still have this ace. As for the soldiers of more than one hundred Principality, it is only used to scare people. Of course, in the event of an enemy, these ordinary soldiers still have some use in the back of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As expected by the fat man, the underground summoning room is a scene of a cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of corpses, huge magical arrays, blood on the ground, bloody altars, and a few ugly magicians in black robes, and The girl... didn't find the wrong place! It is here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment of the door breaking, more than the sudden invasion, what Carmon fears is that the seemingly tender and incomparable *** actually set off a huge The bone dragon, throw it into the void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magicians couldn’t understand what they saw in front of them, and they were black and fainted. Calmon's nerves are extremely tough, but they haven't fainted yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, are there three magicians? It seems that we have to spend a few minutes!" Rogge smiled at Fred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rather honest Fry nodded and said seriously: "The three magicians are not low-grade, it takes a few minutes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked down the steps and walked into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly opened his mouth and looked at the gray-robed woman who was quietly floating in the air, as if it had been turned into a stone statue in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s that dreamy and beautiful woman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who has a silver pair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the woman who stepped into the sanctuary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is also stunned, and the memories of countless fears all rush from the depths of my mind. She only felt that the woman's silver eyes were like an endless sea, and the silvery sea was as mirror-like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Silver eyes squat on the wind butterfly, the wind butterfly is cold and sweaty, and it can't move completely. It’s hard, *** just look away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly screamed, she finally broke free from fear! But she can no longer control herself, she turned and ran! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf guardian warrior was also awakened by her scream, followed by the wind butterfly, and fled in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger and Frey were shocked. The heroic elf warrior escaped? Before the war, the Elf Warriors were scared away by the students! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked at each other and saw the fear in the other’s eyes. The fat man originally wanted to play the little demon, but he did not expect to encounter the devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors under the hands of Frey have been trained for a long time, and they are not afraid of death. At this moment, they are murderous and mad, and they can’t stand it anymore. I rushed up! Frey couldn't see his men die, he bit his teeth, the whole body flashed green, and the chain was rushed up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***With one hand, the heavy stone altar suddenly flew off the ground, and then broke into a myriad of stones. . She is like a blue flower, and then softly swings outwards, and the interior is full of rain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every little stone contains enormous energy that is hard to imagine! This stone rain hit the warriors and the Frey people, and the nose was green and swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shi Yu, if there is spirituality, will chase Frey and his warriors all the way, from the stairs all the way to the gate, and finally a sudden storm, will be more than ten The man played far away and fell heavily in the hospital. For a time, the warriors, together with Frey, could only be embarrassed, and they could no longer climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was passing by, and Rogge was not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is also completely unable to move, can only look at this beauty to the extreme, but also the horror to the extreme woman slowly drifting to the front of her less than one meter At the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver eyes are like laughing and laughing at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man only feels that his legs are getting softer and softer. He is eager to die, and this is barely standing and not sitting down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you afraid of me?" *** asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregg!" Fat teeth fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gegg!Gregg!" I want to say, "If I can escape, I have already escaped!" But the teeth really did not listen to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly smiled, Rogge immediately felt a flower! He rushed to the blood, and there was a roar in his head. He was faintly fascinated, and he did not know where he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that, then... roll it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty turned in place A circle, ** a strong force came, the whole person flew out of the underground summoning room like a cloud, falling in the samurai heap. His heavy body fainted on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karmon and other three magicians swayed out of the underground summoning room, passing through a group of Frey and walking outside the court. Mora followed them behind the ghost, holding the red statue in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the horse wheel sounded outside, and Carmon and others drove away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people actually escaped so arrogantly, and they directly hated Frey and so on! It is a pity that they have a terrible pain in their bodies. The soldiers of the Principality are very familiar with the affairs of the times and have already escaped. The only active Rogge was afraid to offend the gray robe woman, just lying on the ground and pretending to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the warriors in the yard continued to climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak is the first to stand up. He used Druid's special magic ‘war machine’ before the battle to increase his strength, agility and protection, which was not too much damage. However, in the rain of the sky, there was no bullet in his face, and now it has completely turned into a pig's head. As for the other warriors, as if the bones were all broken up, miraculously, no one suffered any fatal injury! The two most wounded warriors were Roger, who was flying in the sky, who broke several ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the underground summoning room opened, and there was no sound inside, just like a giant beast with a huge mouth waiting for the entrance of the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and Frey look at each other, and their hearts are raised with chill. No one wants to go any further and see if the horrible woman in the world has gone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty 捅捅Freak "You go see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak eyes turn, "Or you go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked back and saw the warriors all face the fear. He pretended to meditate and said: "I think she must have Escape, we didn't catch up with her! Is it like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone immediately echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge made a good decision! Since the evil believers and the gods they summoned have been defeated by us, everyone is very hard. Now go back and have a good drink and say, I treat you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd screamed! Squeezing out to the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly There was a crunchy chuckle!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the fat man was struck by lightning, he was so scared that he could not stand on the spot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Frei has already strode out of the door, looking back at the fat man still staying in the hospital, he was in a hurry, came back and grabbed the fat man, depressed the voice and said: "Not too fast! What do you stand stupid! Do you really want to go down and search! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vigorously pulled a few, and the fat man slowed down and immediately rushed away with Frey.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people's demeanor, the emperor, can not be overstated with a hug.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people fled back to Rogge’s house, under the housekeeper People looked at the noble people with high personal status and high strength. They suddenly became sore and swollen, and they were all shocked, but they did not dare to ask Dong to ask the West. They endured very hard. The old housekeeper was very knowledgeable and saw this. The injury is not like losing to the hands of a high-ranking person. It seems to have been violently smashed by the mantle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now no one is thinking about drinking, going back to the house The crushed and wounded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge cares about the escaped elves, until the butler says they have already returned to the government after they have returned to the government, and he puts the snacks straight. The room went. The wind butterfly seemed to be particularly afraid of the woman with the headless angel on her chest. There must be something in it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "Wind butterfly! Rogge didn't knock on the door, and pushed directly into the door, just to see the wind butterfly curled up in the corner of the bed and shivered. The sound of Rogge came in and she was screaming again! Rogge looked at her confused and helpless. The eyes, the pale, bloodless lips, the pity of the heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sat by the bed, gently holding the butterfly in his arms, Gently stroking her back and hips. Rogge is the master of the opportunity, now is the best time to break this stubborn and stubborn little beauty. The wind butterfly earned a few times, but the desire for warmth and safety has been completely overwhelmed. Her reason.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge tightly holding the wind butterfly, stroking her pale gold length, gently kissing her forehead, while whispering Consolation, while in the heart of the big music. Although the little beauty wakes up, they will refuse to be a thousand, but the road is always step by step! Now the only thing that is unsightly is Rumsfeld. With Frey these people help He is not guilty of killing him. He just wants to plan a plan so that the elves and Drew have always been handed over. They fight on a <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "small wind butterfly, do not be afraid! I am here, no one can hurt you! Rogge took advantage of it and whispered comfort. The panic of the wind butterfly settled a lot, and slowly no longer shook.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know why, finished After the words of the heroic dry cloud, Rogge suddenly remembered the chuckle of the ear, and suddenly there was a cold sweat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothing the wind butterfly, The fat man’s Yan Fu will stop here, and the wind butterfly is somewhat shy but firmly pushes the fat away. Rogge is very satisfied with the progress of today, and goes out to comfort Ajani and several other elf guardian warriors. The strange thing is The other elves are not as scared as the wind butterfly. Naturally, the fat man also takes the opportunity to make a lot of oil.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the situation at the time, I was blown out of the ground room by a strong blow, and ** is still high and swollen. But the fat man thought about it carefully, it should be that the woman flew up and kicked herself out. He remembered that the girl had a pair of snow-white bare feet, and it was dry and dry, and her heart leaped wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after the calm days, the Grand Duke of Ayre, Tick Creek, signed a decree that shocked the Holy Alliance: giving the Elf in the Principality Fully equal rights with nationals and prohibit trade in all elf slaves. Tikrick also announced that he would work to make the decree passed throughout the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the news that a large number of elves appeared in the Principality of Aray spread throughout the North. Although the countries of the Holy Alliance have expressed their respect for the decision of Grand Duke, and will discuss whether to implement the decree throughout the Union in the next year, this does not stop people's greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste of wealth is always maddening. The Ayre Principality is only a small country, and the soldiers are not strong and strong. The elves that emerged overnight made countless adventurers, desperados, and black marketers eager to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Rogge’s constant planning has allowed the Elf to have a legal and moral foundation in the Ayre Principality, and the biggest crisis has passed. At least the other countries of the Holy Alliance cannot now use the Alai Principality for the sake of the greed of the elves. The rules of the game in the aristocracy are the same. The natural rights of an aristocrat to the territory and the people, whether he is the Grand Duke or the smallest baron, are considered sacred and inviolable. If this unspoken rule is broken, all nobles will lose their sense of security. Rogge was well aware of this, so he managed to find a legal and moral foundation for the elf. As long as they are not faced with a huge war machine based on the state, the elves will not have no chance of survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time the fat man feels that morality is sometimes a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even without the invasion of a national scale, a large number of adventurers and desperados are not good to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally decided to see *** once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greedy hunter, the sinister political situation, and the mysterious woman who can’t compete at all have already made Rogge a little overwhelmed. Especially the dreamy girl, the ghost is gone, let Rogge deal with the strongest force of the strong and the flattering is not enough to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he crossed the space several times and could not find the location of the ***. Rogge knew that it was *** intentionally cut off contact with him. If there is no connection with this soul, perhaps for the rest of his life, Rogge can't find the place of the outside world. Even if he finds a different space for *** survival, in the vast and mysterious world, it is easy to find a ***. Looking at the endless, countless different spaces, Rogge had to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows, *** don't want to see him now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty let an elf warrior rush back to the city of the gods overnight, notifying that the magic of the old tree should not be scrutinized anyway, in any case, within half a month It is necessary to build all defense measures! All adult elves must be intensively trained, and the construction of weapons and equipment should be carried out as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ has already established a stronghold in the city of Say, and the castle has been restored. It was precisely during the slack season that all adult citizens began strict training under the guidance of the Elves. But at the beginning, the frontal battlefield was not the place to win. The most important thing is how to kill the adventurers and slave hunters who have swarmed in the Central Mountains forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, the fat man pondered over and thought about many drug plans, waiting for the offender to get hooked. Now the city of the gods will soon become a powerful war fortress, ready to destroy large slave hunters. Numerous lures and traps have been placed throughout the Central Mountain Range to round up small adventure groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of the gods with large war magic guards will give the slave hunters a good lesson. But after all the defense facilities were built, the magic of the three elves old trees was enough to support one and a half months. Before that, Rogge had to come up with a solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few days, the Elf messenger came back, and the news brought back made Rogge angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pharmacist of Rogge, the Alchemist House, told me that the poison has been studied successfully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
