			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of the North is vigorous and rugged. Even with Richreu, known for its historical and artistic atmosphere, the architectural style is still dominated by tall and majestic. However, the city of the gods, which is not known to the world, has the exquisiteness and beauty that is incompatible with the whole of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this summer season, the elves have no need to spend energy to regulate the temperature of the city of the gods, so the elves use the extra energy to add a lot of war facilities. After all, the current tranquility of the city of the gods is only the appearance, who knows how much undercurrent will there be under the calm sea? It’s just that the elves love the beauty of nature again, and they decorate these war facilities as works of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of the gods in the faint morning light is like a beautiful woman standing on the edge of the blue lake and the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this morning, the invisible wind is not the admirer of this beauty, but the death god who is ready to spread death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the solemn and singular Nicholas has come to the city of the gods, his feet are like a step of the wind, gradually getting higher, even so Step by step, step by step, the city of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure shook slightly in a strange way, just avoiding the eyes of all the elves. In fact, the spectators of the elves mostly subconsciously avoided the trajectory of his advancement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the city, Nicholas did not stop. The higher he went, the more he went to the center of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this time of the spy, Nicholas has been convinced that the elves in this city must be associated with the death of Kris Felena. Now the mysterious Hughes is no longer in the Elf City, and this good opportunity can no longer be lost once it is lost. So he is no longer ready to explore the real role of the elf in this matter, just want to start the massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it is related to the death of Kris Felena, he will be destroyed one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas suddenly slammed into the middle of the city of the gods in the air, and his fingertips also had a slight tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the square under the three old trees, a huge silver dragon is quietly lying there. She floated freely, and the faucet stretched out in the direction of the small lake. It seemed to be looking at the blue lake, and it seemed to enjoy the cool summer wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crisis...Ferrena..." Nicholas groaned involuntarily, his body was faltering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas almost exhausted the power of his life to stop himself from rushing over. He stared at him and saw more than a dozen elves busy around the huge body of Yinlong, who seemed to be cleaning up her body and scales. These elves work in a meticulous and serious manner, and the scales are carefully cleaned up, without any urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas quietly stands in the air, letting time pass, rising sun and sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena still quietly swaying, motionless, seems to fall into a deep sleep. In fact, she can't move either. She is just a statue, a huge, lifelike, and I don’t know how much the elf artist spent so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the afterglow of the setting sun was dimmed, these serious elves completed the cleanup work and returned happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the statue of Yinlong, there will always be some young elves gathered, they are looking at the beautiful giant silver dragon, listening to the years over and over again. The long elves tell stories and legends about the silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is drooping, and the beautiful city of the gods is gradually quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas slowly falls in front of Chris Ferrena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue of Yinlong is a masterpiece of the gods. Her gaze seemed to move slowly with Nicholas, and her eyes seemed to be sad, confidant, and happy. Nicholas suddenly stunned, almost thinking that Cris Ferrena was resurrected in front of herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long can you live with many powerful enemies? Nicholas didn't know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes, trembled and reached out, trying to touch the statue of Kris Felena, but in the end...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in the end, Nicholas still failed Courage. He would rather believe that he would rather believe that Cris Ferrena is sleeping in the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this sleep has no end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver ray rises into the sky, accompanied by Nicholas’s terrifying shout! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the elves and old trees are shuddering in the whistling sound, and the calm lake has also set off a huge wave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, all the sleeping elves are awakened, they don’t know why, they are in the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few drops of water falling in the sky, and the water drops gradually bloom with brilliant brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves suddenly had a illusion of the line, and they saw that in the shadow of the seven-color brilliance, Kris Felena had a life. She seems to look up at the direction of silver light, reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two figures appeared in one window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He finally left..." The voice of the Death Class was much older than before. After Ai Luoote stepped into the blue water, he was suddenly old. Same as a teenager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes..." Hughes looked at the place where the silver light disappeared, and his face had no smug expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the statue? Is it going to cost a lot of magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of silence, Hughes slowly said: "Keep it so good. If everything is over, if he can survive, there will be a place to be trusted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are blazing flames everywhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an ordinary flame, but a magical power that is great enough to bind all souls! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flames, countless souls are crying, screaming, and struggling. They desperately fled back and forth in the flames, but in any case they could not escape the shackles of the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flames are gradually extinguished, these desperate souls are gradually dragged into the ground by the flames. Their pain does not diminish as the flames go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blazing flame, standing is a stunning girl. Her gorgeous long skirt was ruptured in many places, and the exposed skin had scratches and blocks of bruising. Although she is still young, she is completely a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul in the flame is not struggling, the smile of her mouth is more and more obvious, more and more charming. In the end, she laughed happily, and the green eyes reflected the blazing flame and countless suffering souls! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was a whirlwind...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya woke up, her head still hurts It’s amazing. It was hard to see that Roger was in front of him, and he still could not shake himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat, you always figured it out! Going all day and night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Nodded: "Fortunately, everything went well. Frosty 匕 also found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where? Let me see!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "You can't see it now. It's in the body of Amorro, this is the most important part of the seal. Can you take it out now? Moro will be able to resume his activities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stood up and saw a team of soldiers under the command of the elf engineering staff to dig the passage . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they doing?" The goblin is still a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead fat man, don't you just put it alone? You said, how many things have you hidden in the end? Didn't tell me?" The little demon slammed the meat on the waist of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Receiving?" Rogge laughed and said: "I didn't accept it. We just negotiated the conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half of the surviving soldiers are digging in the tunnel and half are cleaning up the exit. Half a day has passed, the passage has not been dug up, and the exit has been cleaned up first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned in the middle of the corpse in the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these bodies have begun to rot, they still can see the terrible bites and scratches on them. The scent of the wind made the wind butterfly boring, but she still insisted on following Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the enemies?" She opened her mouth and smothered her body and completely interrupted her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge bent down, regardless of the dirty smell, torn open a corpse of clothes, looking at the rotten wound. He stood up for a long time, and naturally it was inevitably exuding a thick scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and walked outside the military camp, saying: "The wounded are not ordinary beasts, only Druid can summon And the beast that controls so many variations. It seems that the one who is preparing to ambush us outside the stone palace must be Druid. As for him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge Frowning, slowly said: "He is already dead. This time is not an ordinary Druid, at least one of them is an elder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind butterfly His face was pale and he gnawed his teeth: "So... what about Druid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They may be dead, maybe ran." Rogge suddenly flashed in his head. After *** the right hand wrapped around the light smoke, said: "It should all die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is silent, just follow Rogge Behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the corpse is everywhere, the goblin is determined not to enter. She looked at Rogge on the way, and immediately covered her nose and shouted: "Leave me away! Wash it again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog With a faint smile, while walking to Fu Luoya, the body could not keep a black flame, and finally the flame of the devil burned his clothes cleanly, and the nasty odor disappeared naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin was reddish on his face, throwing a robes to Rogge who had only one silver dragon arm left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s eyes slowly swept through the ruined stone palace, the surrounding forest, and his face became more and more gloomy. He is not sure whether Druid is still hidden in the forest. It’s just that since the outside person said that she came to deal with it, then there should be no more enemies around the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid’s attacks on these times are very hot and effective. If it’s not a long time without news, then this stone palace will be the third. The grave of more than a thousand people. Even if Rogge is likely to escape, others will not be spared, and the frost will fall into the hands of Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, those captives are asking to leave, you see?" The officer's request pulled Rogge's thoughts back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked over and saw that the more than a dozen of the restless Druids were gathering together and looking at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't let them go!" The cold voice of Wind Butterfly gave Rogge a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and saw the eyes of the wind butterfly staring at the Druid warrior with hate, her hand holding the wheel saw tightly, not Live and tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge grabbed the wind butterfly that was about to rush out and frowned. "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill these Druids!" Wind butterfly gnashed his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: "They are only the lowest-ranking warriors, and it’s useless to kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
