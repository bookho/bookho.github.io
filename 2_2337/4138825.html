Shoes and jewelry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Miss Androni ransacked the entire clothing and jewelry store in Cullen City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is rare and not impatient, just waiting silently. For her, the complexity and difficulty of dressing and jewellery is even more than a struggle with Weina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni chose to go and finally picked up a suit for the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Androni waved and the thick blanket on the mirror opened at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a white classical chiffon dress in the mirror, the wrinkles on the skirt are like rolling waves, in the water pattern skirt, in gold Silk piping, only showing luxury and not showing glitz. The long skirt inherits the luxurious and extravagant style of the ancient times. Not only the entire shoulders are exposed, but also a large white chest muscle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of pearl necklaces in the neck of the mirror, under the ice muscles, is emitting a soft glow. Her skirt is still barefoot, but there is also a string of pearl anklets on her right foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue looked at a dozen different angles of the mirror, it seems a bit confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired woman, really... is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly turned around in the air for a week, and the people in the mirror also turned at different angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost seen the slumbering Androni finally came back, said: "Fengyue. Don't always face, laugh! Let me know The smiling woman is the most beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue mouth moved, did not laugh, after a while, but sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She once again looked deep into the mirror and took a deep look. Then the hands slowly lifted up, and a storm like a blade rose in the house. I smashed the mirror, the clothes, the accessories, and everything she wore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred flames poured out from her, burning everything in the wind into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the flames, the plain gray robes decorated with headless angels are created on the windy moon. At this moment, the wind and the moon have restored the coldness of the iceberg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni had a sigh of regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have been waiting for the news." Fengyue is faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni opened the door and was seeing Mazzone rushing to the top floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the old news two days ago, I hope I can use it for you.” Mazzoni respectfully said: “A private house in Cullen City two days ago. Among them, one of my men saw silver singular elves coming in and out. The private house was owned by a foreign businessman. But according to my observation, it is more like a secret organization contact point. They also accidentally saw it. A costume singularly magician walked out of it. According to his description, that person is probably a Druid. You know, other magicians rarely bring so many leaf decorations on their bodies. But when I got the news this morning, someone in the private house had gone to the building."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni frowned and was about to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mazzoni was shocked and said: "Andre, I also heard a message about Druid. In the mountains of Cullen City North. It is said that Druid has recently established a camp, and the scale is not small. I have been working hard on these two days and I already know the general orientation of the camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni took the map. After carefully watching it for a while, I said: "What are you doing very well! Your training is also good. I will go to this place now. If I can find the Druid camp, I will not treat you badly. If you have any troubles in the future, you can go to Rogge of the Principality of Aray. If you report my name, he will not leave the place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mazzoni was overjoyed after listening. If he can dominate the small role of a city underground world, if he can pull Rogge into a backing, then the future expansion of power will not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Feng Yue and Androni have quietly floated over the Druid camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of the Druid camp is not small. The radius is one kilometer. There are many wooden houses in the camp. Next to the camp, there is a stone high platform. It seems to be new soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the commanding heights of the various dangerous areas around the camp, there are hidden and clever Druid fighters stationed. But no matter how they hide, they can't get through the eyes of Windy and Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the camp is brightly lit, and many magicians and craftsmen are busy going back and forth, as if they were building a super-large magical array. Judging from the piles of goods on the side, this magical array is expensive, but it is still only a prototype, and it does not seem to have any function. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month has risen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly passed a huge shadow, completely covering the moon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow circled twice over the camp and then swooped down. As it moved, there was a gust of wind in the camp immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the camp seem to have become accustomed to this and have rushed to their respective positions. Each of them has a special department, and everything that is small or easy to fly They are all tightly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow has already rushed down, and its huge wings stretched out, and a layer of silver brilliance appeared on the whole body, slowly falling on the stone platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a huge, mighty silver dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at it for a while and couldn’t surely whispered: "It seems...this is not Nicholas? How come another silver dragon?" Is it also trouble to find the dead fat man? He can do it. He can offend so many enemies who are hard to find."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is indeed not Nicholas." The wind is calm and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This silver dragon is huge, even bigger than the silver dragon form of Nicholas. It is not as elegant and calm as Nicholas, but more arrogant and majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It glanced at the camp. Just roaring, the long dragonfly echoed in the mountains: "How long does it take for us to wait for this magical array?! Why is it so slow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp An elderly Druid stepped forward and said: "Please tell the Cranio adults that we have done our best. But the mining of Ice Valley Crystal is very difficult. In these three days, we already have ten Several soldiers fell under the mine! It is no longer fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong roared again: "But this place is so close to the Terran city, and then procrastinating It is very likely that it will be discovered. With the humble and ugly nature of the ugly people, maybe you will find the anomalies here and destroy our plans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The old Druid was obviously irritated by the rude attitude of the Yinlong commentary. He retorted unceremoniously: "Our work is flawless! Instead, you roar like this loudly, making this camp more discoverable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Yinlong was furious, and his amber eyes were like a spurt of flames, and they gasped with breath. Every time you breathe, there will be a small strand of silver flame ejected from the corner of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humble people! How dare you talk to me so rudely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Druid said quietly: "I understand the anxieties of Cranio, but we have done our best. If you are not satisfied with the progress of the project, you can go to the sky anger adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old Druid and the Silver Dragon were still arguing, the wind and moon in the air suddenly trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni immediately felt her abnormality and asked: "What is wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue sighed with a sigh, whispered: "I should go back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned cold and said: "Go back Before, let the following people kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni slowly pulled out the stars. Smiled: "Then you will come back next time, you must come to see me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said that she was uplifting, she wanted to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue suddenly caught Androni, put a thing in her palm, faintly said: "Maybe... no next time. I am very Like it. Just put it here! After that... you have to remember what I told you to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni opened his hand and saw it in his hand It was actually the string of beads that was just in the neck of the wind, and the ice and ice on it was as cold as the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she was lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing flame has wrapped up the windy month, and she screams like a dazzling meteor, throwing it at the silver dragon that is on the stone platform! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni also swayed the stars, with a blue brilliance, rushing from the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This silver dragon has agility that is not commensurate with the huge size. It has a double wings show. If you are flying horizontally, you will slip back hundreds of meters. Candid has let the wind and moon fall from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of the wind are unfolding, and the whole person is very surprised to change direction. Sticking to the silver dragon rush to go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Druid shouted: "There are enemies!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side launched a The magic ring, his body shape is rapidly becoming bigger, the skin is turned into cyan, and a horrible steel shovel will be formed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint, stunning blue brilliance flashed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Germany Ruiya has not changed completely, the semi-steel and half-human giant suddenly flew from the body and left the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp, the blue light of a group is hidden. Androni is holding a starry sky, and the action is like a ghost. It is all irregular. It is like the tactics that she used when she first encountered the windy month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni uses the power of the sanctuary to transport artifacts to the stars, no one can block his front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only old Druid in the entire camp that can resist her has been killed by her sneak attack, she is one hit away, the next time it is already in another A position, so the Druids can not be encircled, almost let her slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid quickly discovered that the situation was unfavorable, and the shouts began to gather together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the faint blue light of the blue sky, Androni’s charming face is so cold at the moment. She has made up her mind to fight with these Druids. Since she has been eyeing her, even if she does not kill this time, she will secretly seek to kill one by one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, these people don’t want to escape this forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also has some unclear where her strong murder comes from, perhaps, because the phrase "all kills the light"; or, more because of the wind Unexplained. She suddenly did not dare to think about the meaning of Fengyue. Only hope to end this battle as soon as possible, so I can ask the wind and moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the battle between the wind and the silver dragon is short, but it is fierce. In a twinkling of an eye, both sides have been hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon almost gave up defense and dodge. It’s just a bit of a fight with the silver dragon. When only a few hits hit the silver dragon, her mouth begins. Unable to flow out of the golden blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
