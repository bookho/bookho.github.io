			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream volume chapter 13 is like a dream<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chapter 13 is like a dream< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s hand gently and gently put Androni’s body down. Her face was serene, and her mouth even solidified with a smile, and it looked like she was doing a sweet dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other hand touched the wound on the chest of Androni. A little gray, like life, quickly caught Rogge's fingers. But no matter how it struggles, it can only stay at Rogge's fingertips and never get in. Rogge looked dignified, put the fingertips that had been grayeded into his mouth, and slowly groaned, as if he was tasting the gray taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, he stood up and looked at the direction when Androni flew, his eyes have turned into silver! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the furnishings in the room are trembling and groaning, they are slightly twisted, and the surface begins to appear in small pieces of cracks, the air in the room is like Under the exposure of the sun, transpiration can be seen. Only Androni was sleeping in the shade of the summer, and was not invaded by the undercurrents in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger leaned over and slowly pulled Androni's long fingers and took the starry sky she had been holding. This artifact, which accompanied Androni for ten years, was dim at this moment, only occasionally, only a few stars were released. The fat man gently rubbed the tip of the starry sky with his tongue. The sharp edge of the sword immediately broke his tongue and ooze a little fine blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand that holds the starry sky is too strong and the blue veins are raised, and the knuckles are white. Just from the tip of the starry sky, he tasted a familiar taste, which is the taste of the Rocherio family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge strode out from the broken floor to ceiling window. Then he stood up and slightly recognized the direction in the air. The figure flashed and disappeared into the sky in the southwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment before his acceleration, the powerful murder that erupted in an instant awakened the sleepy O'Siyah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning breeze blows through the broken floor-to-ceiling windows, gently stroking the sleeping Androni. Her half is still beautiful and unpredictable, and the faint ambiguity has become blurred. Under the wind blowing, a piece of debris like a star sand is stirred up. Then gradually dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is very soft and seems to be unable to climb the face on her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky doesn’t know when it’s overcast. The wind is also big. The wind that swept through with tiny sand and graves constantly smashed the face of the pedestrian. There is a lot of dampness and a little chill in the wind, it seems that this summer, a storm is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the southwestern border of the Dro Empire, David, Franco and Catherine are racing wildly. Because Catherine is not riding, she and David share a ride. A few dozen kilometers ahead, there will be a small military fortress of the Shenghui League. Now they are in the middle of the two fronts. Burnt villages and bodies that were buried in the ground and were not buried were found everywhere along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have carried more than a dozen fast horses, all the way without stopping, the horses fall down one another, and then change one, in the shortest time Escaped to the territory of the Shenghui League. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, all the way to the horse, all the horses are close to the limit, and the speed of the transfer horses is getting faster and faster. After finally mourning, the last two horses fell on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David turned Catherine on his back. Jumping up and rushing forward, the speed is even faster than the running horse. He has been retaining gas power for the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress is finally in sight. David shouted, and the officer stationed at the fortress immediately recognized the leader of the Knights of the Moon, and hurriedly opened the gate of the fortress. David kept his feet. The thick gate of the fortress had just opened the gap that allowed one person to enter and exit, and he flashed in. A few minutes later, the trio ran with more than a dozen horses from the other side of the fortress and rushed to another small fortress dozens of kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress has just been built, the area is small, and the capacity is not enough. A tall tower is erected in the center, and the view can cover all directions of the fortress. The commander of the small fortress watched David and his party go, and then re-boarded the tower. Although the fortress is not big, but the location is important, this commander is also a figure from the Church of the Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know that he can make the head of the Knights of the Moon Wow so desperate to escape. However, at the thought of the scope of the control of the Shenghui Alliance, David still continued to flee to the depths of the territory without stopping, and he did not want to know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer just happened at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the horizon, there was a gust of wind, and in the dust of the sky, a figure was slowly moving forward toward the fortress. On the tower, the commander's pupil shrinks. At this distance, he can't see the person's appearance. Only the long sword that blooms with a dazzling blue light touches his nerves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such distance, you can still see such brilliance, it seems that the power of this long sword must have reached the level of artifact. In the impression of the commander of the fortress, there is indeed a very famous artifact that is very similar to this sword, except that he can't remember the name of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarm bell in the fortress was long, and a large number of soldiers rushed out of the house and rushed to the city head according to the warning. On the wall, a piece of hard bow has been pulled open, but the arrowhead to be sent is shaking. The two masters stationed in the fortress began to recite the spells. However, these spells, which are not mistakes in their dreams, are now interrupted and missed. The frenzied magical energy accumulates and spreads around the two mages, spreading and gathering, and no magic can be cast successfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole fortress is shivering, it is the man who came from the sand. He walked slowly as if walking, but every time he fell, the distance from the fortress would be nearly 100 meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally set up and looked up at the fortress 100 meters away. The horseshoe print on the ground and the breathless atmosphere in the air are all shown. The members of the Roscio family who left a trace on the tip of the starry sky have just escaped into the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咻! There was a smashing arrow on the head of the city, but the head was really bad. It was inserted far behind the ground of Rogge, and the body of the fat man was more than ten meters away. The quality of this arrow and the Shenghui League elite warrior is a little far worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chubby fat man seems to be awakened by this arrow, his mouth floats with a strange smile, and then the blue sky slanted to the ground, and sent to the fortress city go with! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's throw the arrow! Let's throw the arrow!" screamed hysterically along the wall. Hundreds of profit-seeing arrows poured into Rogge like rain. It’s just that when these arrows enter Rogge’s range of weeks, they will be slightly biased. Passing over with the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred meters away, Rogge only crossed three steps, then hit a shoulder on the thick gate of the fortress! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land is gently shuddering! Then there is the deafening roar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar, the fortress’s already-changing door suddenly flew out of the city, and as the gate was hit, more than a dozen arrived. Warrior behind the gate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress city could not withstand this sudden impact and swayed a few times. Then it collapsed and the boulder fell down with dozens of fighters, burying Rogge below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a roar, the boulder and the limbs are flying, the fat man is smiling and coming out. He only stepped forward and appeared in the group of fortress warriors more than ten meters away. The fat man pulled the wrong warrior in front of him in front of him, and the noses of both of them almost met together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young warrior opened his mouth but couldn’t call it out. His panicked eyes quickly dimmed and turned to a strange blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already piercing the belly of his belly and then stirring it up before he pulled out his body. Rogge's left hand tore off the warrior's right arm holding the long knife, and the backhand throws, the sharp knife has fallen into the chest of another soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge walked forward and traced the traces along the air. All the way to the back of the fortress to kill. There are hundreds of soldiers around him, and every moment there are countless sharp swords stabbing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well punches, elbows, knees, and tears, this time the fat man abandoned all magic and martial arts, completely with the original instinct and the league soldiers close combat! The blue sky is swaying, stabbing, cutting, and even the hilt has broken three heads! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge suddenly turned back. I took a look at the two mages. The amber-colored dragon's eye is shining softly under the sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden pain in the bodies of the two mages, and the full magic of their bodies burned uncontrollably. In an instant, it has turned into a raging flame, and the two mages are ignited into two bright magic torches! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked up again and looked at the commander of the fortress who was commanding on the tower. At the moment when the eyes of the two met, the commander suddenly discovered that Rogge’s eyes were silver! He was a little confused. When his eyesight became so good, he could see the color of his eyes at this distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately discovered that his eyesight was not improved, but that Rogge was standing in front of him. The fat man's left hand is gently picking up his helmet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander was shocked. He wanted to pull out the sword at the waist and wanted to launch a vindictive resistance. However, he was forced to move to the 14th level. The vindictiveness is like a pool of stagnant water, that is, it does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander’s eyes flashed desperately, and he looked helplessly at the blue sword in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cold in the throat, and he suddenly remembered that the name of the sword was called the starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's left hand and five fingers continued to stretch, broke into the commander's head and began to forcibly extract his memory. Rogge's gaze then crossed the high wall of the fortress and landed in the direction of the three Davids who fled. Under his silvery eyes, a row of hoof prints on the vast land leads to the far side, disappearing at the end of the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Rogge’s figure has disappeared from the tower, and the soldiers of the Alliance below are still in a mess, looking for the terrible disappearance from them. enemy. They did not find that the towers around them were crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bangsheng. The tower suddenly collapsed, and countless boulders fell with gale, and these soldiers were buried underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s figure flashed and disappeared into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time can be long or short. From the time he hit the fortress gate to the sleeves, it was only a minute before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wave of volatility in the sky, Adrienne and Miro quietly appeared. Look at the dead and wounded fortress below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that this guy is so horrible! Be careful when you tease him later." Adrianne muttered. She suddenly turned to Miro and smiled. Laughter is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miro, you also saw his terrible? How, are you still planning to grab his woman? Do you want to reconsider?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro’s face was blue and green, and he snorted heavily, but did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on the face of the fat man is getting more and more happy, and the starry sword in the hand is still shining brightly, and there is no blood mark left. Only the broken bones and brains stained on the hilt showed that the artifact had just been bloody and brutally killed. The white robes on Rogge’s body have now turned into dark red. The top is covered with pieces of meat and viscera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, he has swept through two fortresses and a small town like a wind, and cut the heads of the five churches by himself, igniting ten The body of two magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is going to laugh out loud. Because he finally caught up with the people who have been fleeing ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, a huge fortress is on the horizon. The people who had been chased by Rogge had just entered the fortress, and even the gates of the fortress were not fully closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this fortress is several times larger than the two fortresses that Rogge passed through. Rogge’s information on the fortress is very clear. This is an important transit point for the southwest front of the Shenghui Alliance, even in peacetime. There will always be 10,000 soldiers and more than a dozen magicians stationed. And in this size of the fortress, he will inevitably encounter a number of Templars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and took a big step and started to run. He knows that his time is running out. He was so rampant in the front line of the Shenghui Alliance. At this moment, the warning must have spread throughout the Shenghui League. The strongmen of the alliance should be gathering here. More delays for a while. I am afraid that the fat man will never return to Oshnia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Rogge are clear, but he just doesn't think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handle of the starry sky is still warm, it seems to have the body temperature of Androni. In the pulsating starry sky, how much is her breath? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Benz is like the wind, the pace is thunderous, every big step. It is a hundred meters away. In a blink of an eye. He has appeared in front of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the gate of the fortress has just been closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped up. Pounce on the fortress head of tens of meters high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress has been full of heavy armored warriors on the head of the city, and more than a dozen warriors shine with sacred anger. Then the magic glory came one after another, more than ten attacking magic with a long trail, scratching the sky, flying toward Rogge leaping in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the attack magic like a storm, Rogge completely turned a blind eye, just constantly accelerating in the air, rushing to the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the attacking magic turned into an invisible range around him, and suddenly turned around, bypassing Rogge’s body before continuing along the original trajectory Flying in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the magicians were shocked, Rogge’s figure flashed and then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful! Protect the Master!" He screamed at the head of the city, but it was a bit late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three magicians fell to the ground in pain, and they were convulsive. When they even have a mouth, they will spurt a big flame. Two other magicians suddenly revealed more than ten lines of Chan Blu-ray, and then they made a dozen pieces of pieces and slowly scattered to the ground. Since the wounds were all sealed by blue crystals, when the heads of the two magicians landed, they could still look at the murder of a corpse in the ground, and even a mouth was still unbroken. What to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man snorted and his shoulder was already in the middle of a sacred warrior with a heavy chain. The attachment on the chain is sixteen levels of fighting. Even though he is physically strong, he feels extremely sad. Just as a compensation for this blow, Rogge has already plunged into the arms of the church, and the blue sky has been indirectly linked to his chest and abdomen for more than a dozen!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; Rogge Shields the body of this sacred church, rushing to the inner wall of the city, the blue sky and the blue sky with the blue sky and the blue sky, the jingle sounded like this. Rogge doesn't have to look back. It is known to cut off more than a dozen weapons and several bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has to cross the city. In his induction, the murderer had just rushed through the fortress's landlord building and fled to the rear. At least he has to look at it. Which one of the Roscio family can be so heartbroken and kiss this poisonous hand on his own blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is suddenly set in the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of a gun was trembled violently, making a screaming scream, screaming at Rogge's throat at an unimaginable speed! The gunman is a middle-aged man with a majestic face. His eyes were as electric, and the hands of the gun were steady and the body was covered with a khaki armor that was condensed by the vindictive spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat body is calming up. In any case, an opponent in a sanctuary is contemptuous. At the moment, behind him, several templars are leading the 100 most elite heavy warriors to kill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man suddenly opened his mouth and blew a hot airflow to meet the middle-aged man’s gun. The airflow touched the gun. The irresistible high temperature immediately melted the tip of the gun into scrap. And the man's vindictive armor also blasted several sets of silver flames at the same time. These flames were extremely sticky, and they were attached to the vindictive armor and burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man sipped and suffocated, extinguishing the flame. He does not move forward. Instead, it took two steps back. At this moment, the party has an absolute advantage, so the man has taken a steady and steady strategy, and it is necessary to leave Rogge here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Rogge has this gap, and he’s not going backwards, but how fast is his speed faster than that of the middle-aged man? Although there were several hits in the back, Rogge's muscles at this moment were like steel. Whether it was a sword or an axe, it was only a few centimeters. After knocking down a Templar and several heavy warriors, he finally rushed into the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent, a long blade condensed by dark red shadows stretched out from Rog's left fingertip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the blade of Molke, the magic blade that can cut almost all armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat hands suddenly burst into the air! In an instant, a blue-colored, dark-red line of flowers blooms in the city. The petals of the petals are beautiful and tender, and it seems to be ecstatic, welcoming the fragmented limbs and the bloody rain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rain is harvested, within ten meters, no one stands except Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge clings to the starry sky, staring at the middle-aged man in front of him, panting. At this time, the fat man suddenly raised a sense of alert, his hair even fluttered slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower in the distance, a magician dressed in a bright church costume has just completed the spell, a light that lingers in the faint sings descends from the sky, toward the head of Rogge Falling. With this attack, you can see that this unknown Master of Magic is enough to match the big magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air seemed to sigh softly, and a magic shield appeared quietly on the top of Rogge, blocking this holy glow. The magic shield and Sheng Hui held together for a moment, and then doubled in a violent explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another hand in the void, and the slender five fingers couldn’t keep moving, and the magical winds softly blew toward the bright mage standing in the tower. . But the Magic tactics of the Master of Light are somewhat dull, but the basic skills are very solid. He launched the protective magic with one glance, and in the blink of an eye, all the magical winds that were blown were blocked. Adrienne has a slight glimpse, this opponent has always been her most hated type. Although they are far less powerful than her, they are almost impossible to defeat them in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man on the head of the city who was fighting the gun sipped and stepped forward and forced him to Rogge. Several templars surviving around have also re-enclosed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles coldly and raises the stars again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a sudden gale winded around Rogge for a few moments. A few sacred blood around the robe of Rogge, flying backwards. And those heavy infantry can't even spurt the blood, just softly slammed on the ground. The gale then blew it to the middle-aged man. The figure of Miro is faintly visible in the wind. He holds a giant hammer and is a mess to the middle-aged man who is holding the gun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the Mi Luo weapons is too big, and the strength is far more than the man, so the two weapons have just contacted. The man’s gun was immediately deformed and completely destroyed. He saw Miro's hammer as a mountain. It’s impossible to think about it, but I jumped directly from the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro's giant hammer received, snorted, and turned back to Rogge: "The useless guy, not coming with me! The person you want to kill is Where? Let's move faster, quick fix!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned a deaf ear to Milo. Just looking at the sky in the distance, the complexion is getting more and more dignified, and it seems to be struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro frowned and said: "Dear Lord Rogge, what are you doing? If you want to be in a daze, wait..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro’s words were not finished, and Rogge suddenly regained his gaze. He stared coldly at Miro and snorted. Road: "You are not ready to escape? I have to take a step!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for Miro's answer, Rogge suddenly rises and rises to Oshi Niya’s direction flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro's face is already a piece of iron. He bit his teeth and turned his head to look at the sky Rogge had just stared, his face suddenly changing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blue sky, I don’t know when a tall middle-aged warrior appeared. His face has long been engraved with traces of years, his face is majestic and not sharp, and there is an obvious Sichuan word between his eyebrows. It seems that in the past time, he often locked his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Rogge, who was flying in the distance, his brows were slightly wrinkled, and he looked at Milo again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of eye contact between the two sides, Miro was struck by lightning, and snorted, almost fell to the ground! He suddenly understood why Rogge had to escape immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
