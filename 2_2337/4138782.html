			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern country is already spring blossoming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a happy season, and people in Rhineland are finally upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why they are so depressed is the 150,000 Bavarian army stationed outside the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people think that it is only a matter of time before the city breaks. The only thing that would have comforted the people in Rhine City was that there were two great magisters in the city. However, Rothschild’s fiasco made everyone lose confidence. After all, if the big Rhine in the city at the moment is not a temporary new one, the regular defender has only 20,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the Bourbon dynasty is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the military camp outside the city, Bavaria was just sitting in the account and reading the letter Catherine wrote to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you read this letter, you must be under the city of Rhine To make the final plan for ending this battle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with our 150,000 army, Rhine City can be said to be an undefended city. There are only 20,000 regular troops there, and more than 100,000 new ones who are temporarily on the front line will not be in your eyes. But we still have a very big trouble, that is, Jero and Lhasa.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have carefully seen your great victory in Rothschild. The constant power of the two magisters is continually attacked, relying on strong personal strength to eliminate Lhasa. The big warlock's alien demon, finally concentrated all efforts, broke the city gate in one fell swoop... All tactics were executed so perfectly. Only one point, we let the two great magisters successfully escaped to the Rhine.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear, I know how difficult it is to trap two great magisters. But this time In Rhineland, we can no longer let them succeed in escaping.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack of the Rhine city means the demise of the Bourbon dynasty. Originally, the kingdom of Louis, He will always bring the two great magisters around to protect his safety. But after the Bourbon dynasty, the situation is completely different. How terrible the two great magisters who have restored their freedom, I think, dear You are more clear than me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the Grand Duchy of Lille City, and may not be able to withstand a little magic baptism of the two great magisters. You Although the strength has approached the strong man like Mr. Prossis, but I am just an ordinary woman who does not have a bit of martial arts and magic at all. And I don't think that our blood is crystallized, it will be resistant in the next decade or so. The power of magic. The most important point is that even with your strength, you may not be able to escape under the most horrible magic of the Magister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See here The Bavarian Grand Duke smiled a little bit. He certainly knows the true meaning of Catherine's letter. Whether facing Jero or Lhasa, he did not have any chance of surviving after the two great magisters tried their best to cast spells. Dagong set the god and continued to read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear, during this time, I stayed up all night for this incident. For this I specifically visited the distinguished Augustus and many others. The samurai and the war mage in the church, I am gratified that these efforts have not been in vain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scroll that was sent to you along with this letter is the whole The key to the plan is that the horror magic scrolls such as the meteor fire can actually be bought, which is not to be said to be the luck of the entire Principality. In contrast, the price of five million gold coins is too negligible.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roschel’s battle shows that you are fully capable of dragging the two great magicians and have the ability to determine their approximate position. Then the next thing to do is in two The magic of the meteor fire is detonated around the big magister. Whether it is in terms of power or scope, this magic is the pinnacle of magical art. The only thing that makes you embarrassed is that those who are destined to escape magic Principality of the Principality of the sphere of influence. Perhaps 5,000 people Maybe more. But in the same range, there will be a considerable number of enemy soldiers. In the capacity of the two great magisters, it is not an embarrassing thing to have 10,000 soldiers to bury.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Jero is known for manipulating flames, lightning, and other attacking magic. This meteor fire is just within his expertise. Although as far as I know, Master Yero’s The magic is still unable to cast such a terrible magic, but there is not much to know about this person. The life of this 10,000 warrior can be attributed to his head. Fortunately, the reputation of the master of Yero is not very good on weekdays. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the pioneer of the dynasty, you need to pay attention to your majesty and perfect image. Although my proposal is destined to be known only to a small group of people, you are still not suitable for this proposal. In my opinion, David Rosello is the most suitable person. He is young, ambitious, and has a thorny temperament. As for how to let him come forward to propose this plan, this is not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteor fire does not guarantee that the two great magisters will be killed, but the next attack by the high-level magician is not necessarily that they can afford it. Lived. The generous Pope gives you two Templars and four War Mage, and at this critical moment, it is time to use them. The two great magisters who are seriously injured will have a hard time escaping their pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, please pay attention to and reuse the lion's knight's collar Kate. He is a smart snake. If the two great magisters may still have a chance, then I believe that this line of life will be killed by Kate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said so much, you must have been bothered? For another month, it is time for the crystallization of our blood to come to life. At that time, you must have finished all the wars to meet his birth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Grandfather closed the letter, a golden flame ignited in his palm, turning the letter into ashes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the table Putting on the beautiful little box reveals a magic scroll inside. Numerous flashing lights, tiny and hard-to-see magic symbols are flying around the scroll, showing how terrible the magic of this scroll seal is.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke sighed and closed the lid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dark night dancer...but this kind of thing can I bought them, and now I still need them. When I wait for the dynasty to be settled in the future, it is time to cut them. "Da Gong thought coldly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clap his hands and called in a follower and said: "Go and ask Marshal Rosherio to come over and say me." There are important things to do business. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is something that can stop a desperate battle, it is a disaster between heaven and earth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds in the sky are constantly spinning, so low that they are scary, just as the pillars of the heavens have collapsed. The center of the vortex is less than a hundred meters from the ground. Looking up at this time, people will feel these heavy The clouds can fall down anytime, anywhere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world has reached the end, the entire cloud is burning and rolling. The sky over the Rhine, Such as a pot of boiling hot metal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless meteorites are wrapped in flames, and they are whistling from the center of the whirlpool of burning clouds. On the Rhine City, another flood of fire and smoke was stirred up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a radius of a kilometer, it has completely turned into a hell of fire. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hell, only the flying stones, the fire, the lava and the van Gogh, the original majestic walls, Countless houses in the city and thousands of warriors who have just died in the fight have disappeared, just as they have never existed before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is constantly There are meteors falling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the city of the Rhine, a total of nearly 200,000 troops and millions of citizens in the Rhine city are now standing in the same place, watching this sudden The scourge of the disaster. A few people still pray to the gods in their hearts. Most people’s hearts are already blank and numb.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bavarian Grand Duke and Marshal Rocherio Station In the heights outside the city, watching the flames of hell not far away, they are expressionless and completely unmoved by this scene.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to be in hell The surviving ones are the most sturdy existence, or the most daring existence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stunning sword flashes, falling from the sky A fire meteor suddenly split into two halves and flew obliquely to one side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore’s handsome At the moment is the black one, the red one, painted with soot. Looked away two still stubbornly stood in the faint light of the photosphere, bitterly endless. As soon as he gritted his teeth and swung his sword, he rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kuma adults! But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need to bring them to the dead. This ghost place! Without you, all four of us will die here. "The man named Cooma is cold and authentic." His mood does not seem to fluctuate completely with the hellish environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore looked at the three colleagues who fell to the ground and did not wake up, slightly hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You kill all four of us, you can kill the two great wizards. Of course, the premise of all this is Fior What you can do is to get the understanding of His Majesty the Pope. What's more, I am blunt to say that although the two great magisters are close to the magic exhaustion, but with the strength of your newly joined church, the front is attacked and the success is grasped. It’s only 30%.” Kumar did not leave any feelings for Fiore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore is extremely angry, he stares at Kumar, and the hand holding the sword is shaking: "You guys who are self-righteous! Your own strength is nothing." The church is held by the bastards of your military studies! Mom! Almost will be successful!" The always elegant Fiore is also swearing, apparently already angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuma faintly said: "The problem of the church structure, you can go back to the Augustus adults. My goal is to maintain every member of the church. The life, we have done our best, but we still can't kill the two great magisters. Now I think our actions have failed, and it has already reached the time when the dead are dispatched." He said, stunned the three on the ground. The Templars of the Templars carried one on their backs, one by one and the other, and ran to the flames of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiore is very angry and can’t help but scream! He knows that with the temperament of the Kumar thirteenth level, the distance of 400 meters in this area is enough for him to die three or four times. With a long sword, he jumped to the side of Kumar with lightning, and Jianguang flashed continuously, smashing several pieces of fire meteors into dozens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six members of the Church Church who secretly follow the Dagong’s expedition. Except Fiore is a warrior specializing in martial arts, the other four are fourteen. The level of the battle mage, and the actions of these six people, are commanded by Kumar, who studies the military. Just the magic scroll that started the meteor fire, it exhausted the full magic of a battle mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the start of the meteor fire, the remaining five members of the church rushed into the flames of hell. However, these sacred members of the church have truly experienced the terrorist strength of the great magister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was seriously injured in the first wave of the most powerful meteor shower, but after a thrilling magical war, Jero and Lhasa will still be three The Templars of the Templars are not awake. If Fiore and Kumar were not guarded, the three war mage had long been cursed by the shadow killer of Lhasa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the five members of the sacred church, nearly a hundred figures are coming face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the rain, these people do not want to reduce the degree although they dodge. They are like life is not their own, rushed to the two conspicuous magical lights in hell. Just halfway through the journey, one-third of the soldiers were forever turned into ashes in the flames of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a group of madmen! Fiore's hateful scorn. He subconsciously lowered his voice, seemingly unwilling to let them hear. Although the strength is far stronger than the lion tooth knight, he still does not want to provoke these deaths that only know fighting and killing. The light of the magic flashed again, and the sound of the explosion was completely covered by the whistling of the meteor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yello old friend, how are you? "Lhasa has already been ruined, and several burnt wounds are still faintly clearing the smoke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yero is no better than Lhasa, relying on a magic The rod can support him without standing: "Rheinhardt is really awkward! Even in spite of the life of my own warrior, the meteor fire and rain have just these people, I have some can not go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the bodies of dozens of lion-toothed knights piled up like a hill ten meters away, Lhasa also sighed. "Old friends, we still Can you escape? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yero smiled bitterly: "I still have a random transmission of magic, but unfortunately we are like this, can it be quite difficult to say the transfer process, the distance is also Not too far. But..." The following words, although he did not say, Lhasa also understands. If the transmission is not far away, it means that it is difficult to get rid of Prossi's pursuit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange bloody suffocation suddenly spread. This bloody atmosphere is very weird on the battlefield filled with smoke and sulfur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lhasa’s words suddenly stopped, and he looked incredulously at the sharp point of the gun. He looked up hard and saw a blood hole in Jero's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two masters, it seems that you have no chance to take revenge. Ten thousand soldiers have been buried with the two masters, it is already very beautiful." Kate softly said in the blood cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luo pointed to Kate, blood could not stop from his mouth, the following words can not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used the body of four comrades as a shield to escape your deadly magical attack." Kate faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate jumped up in a lightning bolt, picking up the guns and picking up the bodies of six lion-toothed knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate looked at a big hole that the meteor smashed and jumped in. The six bodies flying in the air fell into the pit and covered his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another horrible wave of water swept through the ground, turning everything on the ground into ashes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Unlike the Rhine City, which trembles in blood and fire, the Grand Duchy of Lille City is a scene of singing and dancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that the Bavarian Principality has completely surrounded the Rhine City has long since passed back. Everyone knows that the demise of the Rhine League is not far off. Mrs. Dagong’s due date is at the end of next month. At that time, the Principality will have a grand celebration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles are thinking about something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the capture of the Rhine city, plus the Ron Principality can almost be regarded as the land of the Principality, then, the Bavarian Grand Duke is on the throne sooner or later. The great aristocracy attached to the Bourbon dynasty has collapsed, and now is a good time to divide their territory and property. With the territory, their titles will be promoted in a logical way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine is sitting on the sand, her brows are slightly wrinkled, and she flips through a book in front of her. Her high belly is no longer covered with clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the ground in front of her, Franco was kneeling on the ground with trepidation, waiting quietly for the lady who was known for her noble and perfect drop. Since she presided over the Principality, the nationals of the Bavarian Principality have fully appreciated her wise and fair. The high-ranking aristocrats are completely guilty of her savvy, hot and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than half a year, the Grand Duke of Bavaria has been fighting everywhere, and she presided over the big government of the Principality. During this time, the aristocratic ministers who were sent to the guillotine added more than the past ten years. Catherine’s famous saying is: “The confession does not necessarily evade the guillotine, but the destination of deception is only the guillotine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Ville Franco, I looked rough Look, it seems that what you told me is the truth. Since you were responsible for a large part of the supply of military supplies, you have corrupted 300,000 gold coins from the treasury of the Principality. This is not a small amount, it is even enough to send you More than ten guillotines. But you handed this book to me, which really makes me very difficult, you said, how should I dispose of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Premier, I will hand this book to you because of my inner uneasiness. I have forsaken your trust, please punish you at will!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Catherine closed the book and smiled at Lange, you are a very intelligent person. My intention to do this is clear. When small animals express loyalty, they will expose their weakest places. But I am a moody woman, you are not afraid that I will do things according to the law, really send you to the guillotine? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco fell to the ground, could not see Catherine's face, listened to her tone, it was very peaceful, very gentle, slightly with a rejection of a thousand miles The arrogance outside is the perfect tone of the big aristocratic woman. But somehow, listening to these words, Franco only felt that there was an indescribable chill in his body, and he could not help but tremble slightly. He could not help but regret himself. Is it too clever, in order to save the life of this trick, will it be self-defeating?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
