			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a glimpse of Xius, and then couldn’t help but smile, saying: “The great elves who were able to force the gods were not able to get from the book of Hilo. I was relieved, I really didn't think that you actually broke through the cycle of the seventh page with this method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie squats, While rummaging through the pile of magic materials beside his feet, he said: "My strength was so weak at that time. It was only a matter of time to recover from this deceptive book. But who wrote this book? I can feel the great Hilo's breath from above, but he certainly won't write a book like this. It's totally harmful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes had been silent for a long time before he sighed slowly and slowly: "Effie, the book of Hilo is not written by Hilo, but the book is a great existence that is not inferior to Hilo. He is one of the twelve main gods of the heavens, and he is born into a billionaire, a lie and a fraudulent Silro. The billionaire wrote this book, but it is not for us. The book of Hilo, as the name suggests, is specially prepared for the great Hilo, which records all the mysteries of the plane. At least, that is the mystery that the twelve gods of heaven can master at that time. The book of Hilo is the endless sea, so the message that we can read in the ordinary eyes is just a drop of small water droplets. However, this knowledge alone is enough to make the great elves of the time can be lifted, thus creating A miraculous elf empire. Many of the creations of that time, in the eyes of today, are the miraculous existence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie At one click, she had already pulled out a lot of magic material and piled it up on the red crystal table. This direct and beautiful elf is all good, just like to throw things at random, not at all like the neatness of other elves. Effie rubbed the sweat on her forehead and asked: "So, is this billionaire not helping Hilo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Si smiled a bit and said: "In a sense, this is indeed the case. The first six pages of the book of Hilo are the secrets of the gods, able to read the existence of six pages, even if there is no godhead, Willpower will not fall under the new gods. The last page of the book of Hilo is the essence of the book, which records the understanding of the space plane by the Lord God, which is completely power we can't imagine. Reading out the existence of the last page, the power gained in an instant is enough to exceed their original understanding. And the stronger the power of the ontology, the more power it will get, and the more it will think that everything is in its own hands. The more they use this power, the more power they will draw from the book of Hilo, and the power of the ontology will be stronger. This cycle will never stop."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a piece of blue crystal can't change in Effie's hands Finally, the formation of a crystal hammer. She waved a hammer and took a flame of gold, and knocked a shoulder after a few moments. She looked at her with her shoulders and looked at her. She was obviously very satisfied, so she threw it aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie seems to be very tired, she stretched her body and looked at Hughes, saying: "Why did you give the book of Hilo to He sees? The real power he mastered at that time is not low. You are not afraid that he is like the big elf kings, and he has entered the infinite loop of power since then, can he no longer extricate himself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: "He is not the same. In the era of the Elven Empire, the heavens did not pay attention to this plane. Hilo can still display miracles frequently, and often Before the major disaster, the elves will be given enough siblings and instructions to guide the elves to avoid the evil. When the Great Elf Kings began to read the book of Hilo, their own power is extremely powerful. So at that time, big The Elf Kings can't find enough opponents to match, and they can't wake up from the book of Hilo. But Rogge is different, he has to face the gods outside the plane, even if he read the seventh page, power Can be promoted, he will not be the opponent of the gods. So soon he will understand It’s not always under his control. It’s just that he needs to suffer some bitterness in this process.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aifeier’s crystal hammer rises and falls In a blink of an eye, the armor of the armor was close to completion. She looked at her work satisfactorily and then asked Xiusi: "But is the book of Hilo not what we see? How can it be fooled?" What is the great Hilo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Hughes’s palm turned over and there was already a teacup in his hand. He used to drink a bit of his name, only to wake up that there was only white water and no tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled bitterly and said: "The power of the gods is not what we can imagine. Hilo can read the book of Hilo through the eyes of his followers. We can only see a drop of water, and Hilo will see the whole sea! Although he is vast, but he can't resist the impact of all the knowledge of the twelve gods of heaven, Hilo's power has begun to rise, showing unprecedented After the miracle, Hilo disappeared. Since then, the elf empire has gradually begun to decline."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Hilo is immortal. I have been thinking for hundreds of years. I think that the reason for his disappearance is that he cannot control the power of too much horror, so he is trapped in a special plane that is close to static at a time, only in There, his strength will stop growing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking here, Hughes sighed and said: "Strength is to match wisdom, beyond The power that wisdom can control will always be a disaster, even Hilo is no exception."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Effie tapped the armor The last part, asks: "Is it true that the words recorded in the book of Hilo are real forces? Didn't you just say that Sillo is a lie and deceit?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Hughes is really helpless smile, said: "Because the biggest lies, it is true!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie this I thought about it seriously, then shook my head quickly, as if I wanted to take any poisonous thoughts from my thoughts. Go out the same, then said: "I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and said: "This is what you listen to, no need to understand. I Hundreds of years of idleness, nothing to do, this will always think of something useless. Hey, Effie, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child has already made a complete set of armor pieces, and took out a large piece of frost silver and began to knock it up. After a few hammers, the prototype of a long bow has already begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am making a set of hand-made equipment for myself! Otherwise, what do I take to fight when the trial arrives?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trial?" Hughes frowned and said: "If the trial really comes, then the war is hopeless, whether you are the same. You Why not leave this plane? Effie, it is not impossible to find a new survival plane with your current ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie Her forehead was full of large, glittering beads of sweat. She put down her work, rolled up her long blond hair, put a ponytail behind her head, and stared at Hughes, faintly said: Can you do it without hope? Isn’t the ritual you are holding now a little hope?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and said: “This is down Also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie is working hard again. She suddenly sighed softly. This elf girl, who has always been cheerful and optimistic, never knows what melancholy, has a little bit of sorrow: "He can't go anyway, what do you mean when I leave alone?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery of the secret world is endless, although it is beautiful, but it looks much more, and the heart will gradually become tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost no need to look out the window, Augustus knows that the outside must be red like a sunset. The night scene of the mystery is perfect, and no such pure and beautiful sunset can be seen anywhere in the mainland. However, any change in this scene has been installed in the heart of Augustus. He even knows that after a while, the sky will pass a bright yellow, and the half-day cloud will stretch into a thin veil. Then, under the Xingyang, the theme of purple, red and yellow is constantly changing. And tomorrow morning, there will be a faint cloud in the sky. When the sun rises, the wind will wash the clouds and give the secret a clear blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustus’s breathing was a little heavier. In an instant, he felt almost crazy! This endless repetition is actually such a terrible punishment! He deeply missed the scorpions who fought on the mainland. The mainland is incomplete, and nowhere can the scenery be more magnificent than the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the mainland is even more unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus can look at the rising moon with the expectation, watching the wind shake the tree, he can not predict the next moment of change. For the blood angel, every unknown change is so exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a suffocating bright yellow that looks like a memory. It can be so beautiful, in the eyes of Augustus, just like a sparkling star, enough to ignite all the anger in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus’s fist clenched unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is old, weak, and intermittent, but it is heard in the ear of the blood angel, but it is like a thunder! In the face of this thunder, the world is completely silent, and there is no sound in silence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel was shocked, and he was busy with the turmoil in his heart, respectfully and respectfully: "I don't know what is going on, recently, no patience." It's getting harder and harder to endure the endless repetition. But you can rest assured that I will overcome the emotional fluctuations. This body has already been conquered by me and will not cause any trouble for me in the future."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening color is gently scattered on the pope through the high floor-to-ceiling windows. He was almost half lying in the high back chair and looked languid. At this moment, it seems that the old man who is almost in charge of the supreme authority of the whole continent is no different from the old people in the southern seaside town who sit at the door in the evening and quietly admire the sunset and evening scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are as quiet as this, waiting calmly for the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beautiful things repeat more and are still beautiful. Augustus, your troubles are not because of your body, but your heart. I want to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deepest part of the soul of Augustus, there is a chill in the air, it is the cold of the bones! His voice is still calm, saying: "My dear Pope, I don't understand what you mean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope moved his body, it was such a simple movement It also makes his breathing heavy, so the words are also somewhat intermittent: "Augus, ah, from the day you reincarnate in this plane, your destiny is doomed. The difference is only a little earlier. A little later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus respectfully said: "Yes. Whether it is reincarnation or advent, we are all branded on this plane. Traces. Therefore, at the time of the judgment, we will be washed away, restore the original energy, and return to the glory of heaven. Angels are the servants of the gods. This is our fate and our glory." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glory..." The Pope sighed lowly and slowly said: "Every existence has a different understanding of glory. It seems that you are glory. The belief is changing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus once remained silent. There is a tremor at his fingertips, which is completely unimaginable for the powerful blood angels. However, the waves in his heart are too fierce. He has already crushed all his defenses, and where can he control the external body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus repeatedly asked himself, in his mind, the question quickly became a cry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is asking himself again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the answer is very obvious, the Pope who can use the big prophecy freely is the embodiment of the Lord God in the world. The glory of the angels comes from the gods. Once Augustus has started, the pope, who seems to be able to sleep at any time, may be slightly enchanted, and he can strip away all the glory of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like Ophroc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustus’s heart suddenly burst into a weakness, and he suddenly let go of the unwittingly clenched hand and calmly said: "Yes, My Majesty. My doubts, irritations and even fears are all because my philosophy of glory may have changed. I know that I am turning away from the gods, you punish me, I am willing to return to heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope smiled, and the laughter caused a sharp cough. When the gasps subsided a little, he said: "Punish? The trial is coming, punishment or reward, that is the gods." The right thing. What we can do is just choose and wait. Augustus, choice is right, but also courage. Go, now we don't need us to do anything more. You just have some time, you can think about it yourself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustus calmly promised and turned away from the Pope's prayer room. At the moment he opened the door, his hand paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus suddenly found that since coming to this plane, thinking, it turned out to be the least done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
