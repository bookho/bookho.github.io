			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory cherished this hard-won peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s great to follow the owner’s arbitrarily on the vast expanse of the world of death! After not worrying about the kings will catch up, Gregory is like a big stone in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that day, it was impulsive to follow the *** to meet the kings. The memory of that time, every minute and every second is so dark and oppressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now everything is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is still in front of the king’s army, even if there are individuals who are more powerful than it, they can’t stand the sorrows. A few attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you think about it, *** said to you, "You will become a king in the future," Gregory felt that the future was bright. Maybe one day, it can jump out of this gray, monotonous world of death, return to the devil world, and regain the dignity and scenery of the past as a dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gregory’s power in the past few days is no longer increasing. It has already raised this issue with sorrow. ***Thought for a long time, just told Gregory, that is why she copied the starry spirit is not complete. Bone Dragon also knows that the improvement of power can't rely solely on the transformation of ***, but it still depends on its own experience, but it has been used for a long time, and it has been used to being transformed. Moreover, the incompleteness of the starry sky has a lot of defects, which is not something that the bone dragon can make up for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there is no way for ***, Bone Dragon has no way to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about the problem of power, the vanity bone dragon becomes melancholy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lazily squats on the stone, boringly watching the ghost knights in the distance. Since Rogge successfully interfered with the immediate movement of Elgera, the kings never searched for it in this way. The master servant was still careful and annihilated all the reconnaissance troops he saw. Not long after, the detectives sent by the kings were reduced by a majority. Although the number of undead creatures can be said to be endless, but the high-level undead creatures of the Ghost Knight are still limited. The dozens of riders and dozens of riders are eliminated without interruption. This loss is absolutely unaffordable for the kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing the number of reconnaissance units, and trying to capture the whereabouts of the *** and the bone dragon, it is impossible to do it. The consequence of ignoring any king is destruction. Now the kings of the dead world are standing on the same line like never before. Who knows what new tactics they will come up with? *** The faint pressure in my heart has never been alleviated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon suddenly stood up and listened to the person! He summoned me! It’s not dangerous now, you see, we are going to the world again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** faintly said: "Go, go." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon screamed with excitement and jumped into the space fluctuations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The first thing that appears in front of the bone dragon is the fat face of the master's master. The bone dragon knows that the master's owner has a little opinion about himself recently, but being able to come to this colorful world once has overwhelmed everything. Although Rogge's powerful bone dragon is also very clear, but it is too far from being too fierce to tell you the truth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then the bone dragon saw the person who thought about it, the original owner of the starry air, Androni!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon screamed, I want to rush to please Androni, so that she can reveal some secrets about the starry spirit. But the first upload of a strong force on the spot to put the bone dragon in the right place, Rogge immediately furious with the spirit : "Gregory! Leave me alone and don't move! Do not allow the opening, nor let her know that you can understand her words! "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> ;Andnbsp;&nbsp;Andro, despite the strong martial arts, but still full of vigilance against the powerful undead creatures of the bone dragon. Gregory just made a temperament, and the fierceness was revealed, and she was shocked on the spot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at the bone dragon with some doubts. Although its appearance changed completely, she still knew by the keenness of the strong, this is the skull dragon that followed the *** that day. To her a bit of confusion, Gregory had a lot of emotions that she was very familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s heavy darkness makes Androni very uncomfortable, but she still resists the resentment of negative energy and tries to Gregory Gao Lidao: "Can you understand my order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon immediately shook his head. "I only listen to the master's orders!" Bone Dragon thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of the bone dragon made Androni extremely surprised! Rogge was furious, and the incessant spiritual fluctuations made the bone dragons honestly lie on the ground, no longer dare to look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, regardless of how Androni asked it, Gregory was on the ground and did not move, pretend to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni can't, I have to ask for help. Rogge asks me for help, is there any other magician... or something else? Can people call it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately said a lot of words to the bone dragon who could not understand. The clever Gregory was then casually Hearing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It says that there are many people who can summon it. "Rogue Road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Androni’s heartbeat suddenly became too fast to control. "Can anyone who can summon it, is there?" A female magician is a female warrior? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is another scream, but before it is finished, its figure is blurred and disappears.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge was also taken aback, it seems that *** will call Gregory back. He looked at the equally alarming Androni recently not enough magic Maintaining such a summoning time can't be too long. Finally, there are many women who call it. Anne, who are you looking for? Can you tell me carefully, so I can help you!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has already determined that Androni is looking for the wrong person, and Gregory’s appearance has changed so much, if not with him and the bones The dragon has a direct connection with the soul. He almost never recognizes the bone dragon. How can Androni recognize the same skull dragon twice? But she didn't care if she didn't admit her mistakes. She was so anxious to find this person. Rogge just happened to see if it was organic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sighed faintly. Let me talk when your magic is restored. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time it is late at night, a cold moon hangs over the horizon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe winter season, There are only a few vigorous green pines in the garden of the Grand Duke and a little green.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue yawned, he was a little tired.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go back first, I want to be alone. "Androni gently said. She was confused. After seeing Gregory, she knew that it was a step closer to the mysterious ***. Just to see the moment she saw, she could not suppress it." She can't stop beating. She doesn't know what she can do if she really sees ***.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗I went back to sleep, and if there was only Androni in the big garden, I sat quietly in the cold wind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t know how long she sat Finally, I sighed and stood up, ready to go back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind suddenly stopped.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Androni also stopped, and she suddenly turned around, behind her in the void, floating her thoughts <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are looking for me? ***The cold voice is still without a trace of affection.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dronie’s heart leaps, she bites her lower lip and looks at her* **.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Sword has quietly appeared in the hands of ***.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the stars fall on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***It’s a stay, she never expected that Androni would be bound. In her eyes, Androni is not weak, and she still has to work hard, especially without disturbing others. The gray robes behind her had been slightly raised, and now they have calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s beautiful eyes are staring at the ***, and the eyes are full of complex feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Receive the Death Scythe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take off your clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is slow, elegant but Un hesitant to untie the clothes. After a while, she was proud of the cold wind. The moonlight smeared her soft skin with a soft silver glow. Androni proudly raised her chest and looked at her, burning inexplicable flames in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Silver eyes are lit up, her eyes are as penetrating, and I look up and down Androni's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Slowly flew to the front of Androni, a pair of cold hands touched her skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold, indescribable feeling swept through Androni’s body from the hands of the ***, this cold cold as conscious and Like the vitality, she walked around and explored every corner of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked deeply at the silver plaque. In the silver, it is like a sea without a bottom, and a door that connects another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly opened her arms like a blue, hooked the neck of the ***, and then gently sealed the lips of the ***...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fiery fragrance has swept into a cold world like frost, and the shock that provoked in an instant almost shattered this iceberg! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni screamed, his body flew out and fell heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just got up, the huge death sickle rested on her delicate neck. *** The silver awns in the eyes are very strong, and her eyes are a bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** A cold cry, Androni’s brain immediately fainted. She saw that the sacred slasher had a slight slash, and then it was time to gently cut her throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni’s eyes closed, and the slender neck went forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of anger, the silver awns in the eyes of the *** are shaking slightly, and the tip of the slashing knife is also shaking, with a strange squeak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The death of the sickle suddenly waved, and a cold wind swept through her body. Androni shivered a little, and after a while, she was safe and sound, and immediately opened her eyes, and there was an irresistible ecstasy in her heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** has turned around and is preparing to go across the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***!" Androni snorted and the stars fell back into her hands. "If you just leave, I will die for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Indifferently, you will die. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer’s knives suddenly turned around in the small hands of the ***, and the window of a small building near the garden suddenly split, and the screams were straight. Straight out from the broken window.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The right hand is caught, the figure has not yet landed, it flies straight to her, no Resist the ground in the hand that seems to be a little bit of wind and frost.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Take the man up, for a moment, Androni sees Her face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Hand tight, Fulu Ya Qingli’s face was slightly painful, but the pain in her eyes was far more painful than her pain. Her usual smoke and smoke had already disappeared, leaving only the look of Androni’s eyes. The two lines of tears quietly fell, but she did not know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know when, *** has returned to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya suddenly wiped her tears and smiled charmingly. The money went up, picked up Androni’s clothes and gently placed it. In her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria said softly: "She is really beautiful and very powerful. I can't see her strength, and I have no ability to fight back. She I must have reached the sanctuary. I know, this does not blame you. If I were you, I would also choose her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly controlled Live, crying and crying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I really can't help it..." After saying this, Fu Luoya turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni stood there, stunned. After a cold wind hit, she felt the chill, and now she is holding her clothes, and she is still there. She quickly put on her clothes and wanted to leave the garden without knowing where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in the sky like this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Standing on the dangerous peak, looking into the distance, I don’t know what to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon slaps a slap in the back. "Master! You are so great, too wise! The two little girls have no resistance in your hands! You can even let them fight without even hands-on! Master, what is the starry spirit? Going, you figured out that there is no..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***I don’t know what I’m thinking, I’m only coming back, cold and cross-bone A look at the dragon. Bone Dragon immediately swallowed the idea of ​​inquiring about the stars and swallowed it back. It stunned to the other side of the mountain to observe the enemy. Despite the serious look of Gregory, the flames in the eyes are actually dim, and they are completely blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner is a bit strange! What did the woman with starry temper do to the owner? Let me think about it... like she didn't do anything! That strange action... What is it? Why can you let the owner think for so long? Is that a new flattering? If it works, then you can try it... No! My Gregory adult crown The keen instinct of the world of death tells me that it is not the flatter I can use..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly angered: "Gregory! You What do you think about?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master, I don't want to! Gregory was so scared that it had forgotten to restore the soul contract, and *** could know what it was thinking, although most of the time was to cut off this connection. The bone dragon is too arrogant. But this time Gregory thinks too much, and the spirit is too concentrated. It is almost equivalent to yelling at the ear of the owl. Why not anger?<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that *** didn’t further punish it, Gregory was relieved. When the crisis went, it couldn’t control his mind.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starry vindictiveness is good! It is a pity that the master's mind is not on that. What will it be on? On that little beauty? It’s very strange. Although the woman is good because of the standard of the noble dragon, it is also very good. But still a lot worse than the owner, at least she can not beat the owner. Of course, who can play the noble owner of Gregory! But why did the owner become so strange? The woman’s attack has no power at all. Why can’t the owner hide? Is she stupid? Hey! The owner is always right! How can it be stupid? It must have been this reincarnation in the world of death. I forgot some important things, so I just don't understand the key. By the way, the owner of the master often makes such strange attacks on other little beauty! I said how I feel very familiar! It seems that I have to go to the world often to see what is going on here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory, who wants to enter the gods, forgets to control himself. Spirit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory! "*** is almost roaring!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her anger directly shakes the soul of the bone dragon, almost blows it out!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People! There is a team of ghost knights over there! I will destroy them!" Gregory knew that the big things were not good! Under the spur of the road, it fluttered and slanted, and when it was slanting eastward, it was very fast and rushed to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
