			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the Grand Duchy, Rogge drank a bottle of spirits and drank the wine, which made the shock a little bit. He also couldn't tell why he was so afraid of the goddess O'Reilly. He has no way to measure the power of the goddess, because the ability of the gods has long been out of his understanding. In fact, it is those people in the sanctuary that the strength is not measured by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the fat personality of the fat man, even if it is an enemy of the deep sea-like pope, even if it was killed once by the death class, he did not let him These strong people are so scared in front of them. Is God really unspeakable? A little-known Ao Le Reich has made him afraid of this. If the supreme god comes, what will happen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the Pope and the Church of Light, Rogge never regretted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He himself is somewhat puzzling, why is he so afraid of Auger Reich? Rogge poured a glass of wine for himself, but his hand could not control the trembling, and the wine poured out a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man thinks carefully, this fear does not seem to stem from the huge gap in strength, it seems to be a fear of instinct, just like an animal sees Like his natural enemies. Moreover, this is not just a fear, but a feeling mixed with a lot of complicated things, some excitement, and some excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to summon the bone dragon again, and there was still a panic in the spirit fluctuations sent by Gregory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" Rogge asked, when he saw the score, *** and Bone Dragon should be forcibly returned to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The host said, the goddess is completely incomprehensible." After the bone dragon finished, there was no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a moment. Is *** also afraid of time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fixed his mind, went out of the Grand Duchy, and went straight to the State Council Shanglai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Hilley’s secret room, Rogge frowned at a thin account book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The booklet details the current main income and expenditure of the ADR. As Rogge expected, the national treasury of the Principality of the Principality has not bottomed out, but has begun to generate a large number of deficits. At present, there are still more than 60,000 gold coins in the treasury of the Principality, and the amount of money owed to businessmen everywhere has already exceeded 300,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed the book and frowned. "Is there so much money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hiller cautiously said: "This is normal for Rogge. Now count the new recruits. The Principality has already had an army of 100,000. The support, equipment, camp, training of these soldiers will cost anything. Even if you add the province of Recto, the Ayre Principality is also a small country. Where can you afford such a large army? According to the old minister’s estimate, if all the troops are fully trained and equipped, how can they have one or two more? Ten thousand gold coins are only available. We can't produce so much equipment at all, most of them must be purchased from the Kingdom of Layton and other Principalities. This amount is not arrears. Adults, the army is the most expensive! The old minister has tried to save Auntie Dagong is also very smart in using money, but this gap is too big, still can't make up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded. He knows that even if he takes out the treasures of the elves, it is absolutely difficult to sell them in a short time, and the price will be greatly reduced. However, if the equipment ordered from other countries does not pay, then people will not ship the goods at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been indulging for a long time and finally said: "Hillary, I have a batch of jewels that will arrive in a few days. You go to contact the countries and purchase a large number of ordnance equipment. The quality is better, the price is better, according to the market price, the price is 20% higher. If the profit is in front, they will not refuse to sell it to us. As for the settlement of the price, do not use the gold coin, and directly settle the valuation with the jewelry. The officials of the size of the affairs are doing a good job, as long as they are willing to value our jewelry at a fair price. We should not let them be embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog thought for a moment and said: "Tomorrow, you will withdraw 50,000 gold coins from the state treasury and send them to the Grand Duchy. This will be a secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hillley nodded and said it was recorded. He is very slippery, and since Rog didn't mention what the money is for, he naturally won't ask more. As for the unexplained deficit caused by this, he has his own way to let the people below shut up without mentioning a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Hilley did not say so, Rogge also understood what he meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indulged for a moment and said slowly: "This is also the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rogge took a circle in the house and asked, "Are we sent back to Astrafik's secret envoy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults arrive, The veteran ordered him to wait outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The secret of the secretary in his thirties looks quite loyal and simple. Rogge casually asked about the customs and customs of the Asrofic Empire. The important figures are now well-organized, and the narratives are concise and concise. They are personal talents. It seems that the eyes of Hilley are not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feuerbach Emperor of the Asrofik Empire has more than 50 this year, with more than a dozen emperors and more than 30 princesses. He spent his entire life fighting, and his main energy was to deal with the barbarian warriors in the Northern Wilderness, the Western Dwarf Empire Alliance, and the dark creatures in the dark forests of the East. Emperor Feuerbach is an iron fist. He has won several battles on three fronts and plundered a large amount of land and resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially the Alpine Dwarf Empire League, because of its rich resources, has been the main offensive target of Feuerbach’s emperor for many years, and has been beaten by the elite army of the Empire. Retreat, lost ground in a thousand miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Alliance and the Asrofik Empire in the South are also years of fighting. Although the Holy Alliance is always at a disadvantage, it has struggled for many years and is strong. Will continue to emerge, Kankan can also tie the Astrofic Empire. Although the Holy Alliance is not large, but backed by the Central Mountain Range, there is a lot of room for manoeuvre, and the soldiers are brave and warlike. If the Asrofik Empire forcibly conquers, the loss will be extremely heavy. The mind of Feuerbach has always been placed on the rich dwarf empire, and the interest in the sacred alliance is not great. Therefore, he simply set up a province in the area of ​​the Holy Alliance and handed over all military power to the Duke of Doriak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decade ago, the Asrofic Empire finally achieved a decisive victory for the Dwarf Empire, pushing the dwarves into the mountains. At this time, there was a gate to the abyss world in the empire. The arrogant Feuerbach was extremely excited and mobilized the army to prepare to conquer this mysterious abyssal world. However, the imperial army did not adapt to the battle environment in the depths of the earth. The evil and power of various creatures in the abyss were far from their estimates. This time, the Astrafik Empire ended in disastrous defeat. The 50,000 most elite troops in the empire's deep abyss world finally escaped less than 5,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferbaha the Great has no choice but to be completely sealed by the Imperial Masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war has caused the Astrafik Empire to be badly wounded, and the eyes of Feuerbach have fallen on the dark forests of the rare magical materials produced in the East. It will not have any big moves on the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge empire has always had factions and infighting, and the Asrofik Empire is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s interesting to note that the best fight in the Asrofic Empire is not the powers, but the two sects. One is the silver saint who serves the goddess of ice and the other, and the other is the northern Druid League that Rogge hates. The two sects have waged infighting struggles inside and outside the empire, but according to the messenger, the Northern Druid League’s struggle for rights and believers in the Asrofic Empire is only the last fifty years. In the last ten years, It has been able to resist the rituals of the silver sacred church in the past, and it can be seen that the city of Yunxiao has deep strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Frey's mouth, Rogge has learned a lot about the North Druid League. Druid, who originally believed in the god of nature, is obliged to maintain the balance of nature and will not compete in the rights of secular society. But with the help of the elemental Master of the Silver Religion, Asrovik’s army was almost invincible. Where the great army passes, the policies of the various aliens are not to be slaves or to be executed. This is a serious violation of the natural balance in the eyes of Druid. But the North Druid League is just a sect. How can it compete with the army of the three great empires? It was the Presbyterian Church of the Cloud City that changed its strategy and transferred the battlefield of the struggle to the courts and pilgrimage halls of the Asrofic Empire. It competed with the silver saints for the right to teach, the people’s beliefs and secular regimes. . If the sacred church that can overwhelm the silver becomes the state religion of the Asrofic Empire, the Druids can naturally restrain the code of conduct of the Imperial Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druids don’t care about this as long as they don’t break the balance of nature, how many places the Asrofik Empire conquered, and which nation or race they conquered. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger replied with respect: "Roger, so far, everything is going well. Those people have already agreed to our request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog Haha smiles very well! You have made great achievements, I will not treat you badly! Let's go to rest first, and there is an important task to go back. You need to go to the Astrofic Empire again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger quickly replied: "It is my glory to be able to work for Rogge." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refusal quits the room, and Rogge says: "Is there any movement at Frey?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillley replied: "According to the return of the veteran, there was no special person to contact Frey at this time." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger thought for a moment and asked: "Is the person you sent reliable?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xile said: "This adult can be assured. The old man has already seen it. He has no martial arts. He is only born with a keen sense of being able to accurately smell the taste of Druid and the natural warrior. He is also very clever. The veteran minister arranged him in the House of Frey, to be an inferior servant. He usually had no contact with Frey, and would not be easily seen. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is very satisfied that he should not stare too tightly. Would rather miss something, and don't let Frey appear."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilay praised: "The arrogant Rogge is really far-sighted and dripping! The splendid and you have a deep relationship with the city of Yunxiao, but the blood is thicker than water. The feelings of his father and son with the wrath of the sky are impossible to sever. We are defending a little. Although the old minister has lived for so many years, there is no way to think of such a long-term person as a big man who can make a big deal! The old minister is really惭愧,惭愧!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hylie’s flattering is used, but when Rogge hears that Frey has a deep relationship with him, he still can’t help but change his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillley tried again and asked: "Under what you said, this is what you want to do. The goal of our army is Levi. Is the kingdom, or the kingdom of Latvia? The old ministers plan to do a good job earlier, so that the ministers in the two countries should move around and drag the ministers to prepare for the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Rogge smiles mysteriously, you can rest assured that it will take a long time, this war will be fought. But for the time being, we don’t need to use our internals. As for how to fight specifically, you don't have to ask more. Now your main task is to assist Auntie and Charlie in trying to secretly arrange the first batch of troops on the battlefield within half a month. The number of people is not too much. The regular 7,000 people are stationed in the province of Recto, except for one thousand people. The newly trained troops can be as long as 10,000 people. Specific things, you coordinate with them! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilay's face is complex, half is confused, half is admire, and even flattered: "Adults are really as deep as the sea!" There are such wise masters as adults, and God really cares for the Principality of Aray! As long as you can do some chores for the adults before the horse, the old minister’s wish is enough! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog snorted and said no, but he couldn’t help but smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the dead of night, Hille personally sent Rogge out of the back door. On the deserted street, Rogge’s carriage from the city of the gods had already been there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillley stood still in the cold night, until the carriage disappeared into the corner of the street, he put away the smile on his face, whisper: knife killing, etc. The scheme, can you win me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rogue in the carriage also smiled, just thinking: "This old thing is still confused with me! The old fox Laozi can see more. If you dare to have two hearts, hehe, hehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning home, Rogge still has no rest, still in In the study, I meditate on the big map of the entire Holy Alliance. The war will be going on, everything is busy, and there are too many factors in all aspects. He wants to consider it carefully and avoid any surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heavy lessons have been enough. Far from the leader of the dragon and the beautiful mercenary with the ice and snow silver fox, and the dwarf kingdom battle, the near is led by the elves and the silver dragon battle, before the war he thought he was calculated and foolproof, but still there is too much he can not Predicted variables, the result of each battle is a heavy loss. Although he eventually won, he was almost completely annihilated. This made Rogge more cautious. In this upcoming war, he would leave enough post and retreat for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly was shocked and snorted and exclaimed. It was Fu Luoya to see it, and she decided to settle down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is wearing a deep purple cloak, and the underneath can be seen wearing a nightdress, her proud chest revealing a large piece. The goblin carries a tray with a cup of hot tea and some delicate snacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the wind butterfly wandering late at night, Fu Luoya is also a glimpse. "Wind butterfly? Your body has not recovered yet, so late, why not go to rest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly whisper: "Floria sister I can't sleep, I want to go outside and breathe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon is very thoughtful and clear, and already guessed the heart of the butterfly: "Don’t be afraid, have a sister to help you. Your body will be fine. You see, your recovery is far faster than usual? Silver Dragon's blood is not so easy to get. You can rest assured that your martial arts will only be better than before. The level is even higher. As for the matter, do it according to the way your sister told you, and forget all other thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind butterfly slightly lowered its head , whispered: "Froya sister, you treat me like this, I really don't know how to return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiles gently So kind, my sister will not help you, who will help you? Rogge is now in the study, and I originally prepared something for him. Since you can't sleep, it is up to you to send these teas to him. It is said that you are ready. I remember what my sister told you, except for that, everything else should be done according to what you think and think, and you should never say anything in front of him. He is too embarrassed, you can't beat him, so telling the truth is the best way. Ok, go now, and the tea will be cold for a while. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge left the city of the gods, and the elders of Xiusi immediately began to make major adjustments to the various facilities in the city. The city of the gods is The magical old tree's magic as a supporting city, it took less than ten days to build it. Now it is so fast that it is so fast. After a long half of the toss, all adjustments are finally made in Xiusi. Completed before the deadline.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current city of the gods does not seem to be much different from the usual, except that the barriers of all external illusions have been revoked. Let this beautiful elf city bare land be exposed to the mountains of the North.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the city beyond the city is formed by elf magic The forests are closed. Now these towering trees are rooted up, slowly receding deep into the forest, and letting out a road leading to the mountains.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the side of the lake of the gods, Hughes is standing in the small temple of the circle, The dragon egg and the silver dragon crystal are scattered with soft magical light. This small hall has been treated with magic, and now looks like an ordinary home from an elf, but it is a little bigger. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes turned around in the room, and finally put his heart on the tree where the dragon eggs were placed. A light green glow Sis poured out and poured into the trees. The trees seemed to live, the branches and leaves stretched, and the dragon eggs were all wrapped up. The silver dragon crystal floating in the air also fell to the trees and was wrapped up by the leaves. Finally, the whole The branches and leaves of the bushes are closed and become a spherical canopy, slowly sinking into the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole hall is now hollow, only shining The magical array is still running.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses has given a cry, and after a while, dozens of elves will put all the furnishings in his bedroom. Moved in. Hughes snorted and moved his bed to the center of the room. Place the dragon egg in the place, and put your usual coffee table and recliner on the bedside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before night, the crown of the three elves old trees is released With a soft light, according to the instructions of the Elf Presbyterian Church, all the elves sang the same spell, and the whole city of the gods shook a little.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hughes sat on the sidelines, looking at a hugely decorated ancient book, while tea. But his spirit has spread to the entire city of the gods. After the magical rituals before dusk, the eyes of every elf in the city of the gods are his eyes, and the ears of each elf are his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a snowy peak dozens of miles away, a pair of huge golden eyes are watching the city of the gods coldly. In the night, this splendid elf city is so beautiful and serene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being repulsed by Hughes, it was very worried about the safety of Moonlight Dragon City. Even if the Black Dragon King did not know that he left the Moonlight Dragon City, it is very doubtful that the three guys who will stop its revenge will not inform the Black Dragon family of this news. Although it believes that the meditation that has become a god should not be so mean, and walking in the outer world, the arrogant arrogance will not do such a thing, but the last killer is not a good thing. The Terran has always been known for its deception and jealousy, not to mention the killers who are accustomed to sneak attacks in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the goal is close at hand, and Nicholas can’t afford to worry about his wife and children. It finally decided to quietly dive to the place where Cris Ferrena was killed, and then went back to Moonlight Dragon City, regardless of the outcome. From the time point of view, it is impossible for the Black Dragons to capture the Moonlight Dragon City in such a short period of time. Then, after they rushed back, they just gave the Black Dragons a slap in the back and let them completely remember this lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas whispered a few times, a huge magical array emerged at its feet, his body began to slowly shrink, and finally became an elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changed Nicholas reached out and a big tree rose from the ground and flew to his feet. He cast a change technique and turned the big tree into a green elf robes and put it on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tall, strong, perfect elf, but the power of Nicholas itself is so powerful that the elf is always with a faint pressure. The length of the pale gold also reveals a silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas's figure flashed away, and then a little silver flashed hundreds of meters away. In the flash of silver, in the twinkling of an eye, Nicholas came to the gate of the city of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Gods looks very prosperous. Although it has already entered the night, it has not closed the gates, and there are still elves who keep coming in and out. Nicholas was in the flow of the elves and went to the city. With the knowledge of the elves hundreds of years ago, Nicholas casually talked with the elves around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are really an enterprising race, and everything is exactly the same as what Nicholas saw in the Elven City. From the mouth of the elf around him, Nicholas knows where the biggest pub in the city of the gods, 'Green Diamonds'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the experience of wandering around the world that year, Nicholas knows that the pub is the best place to inquire about the news, and the name 'green diamond' is also very good for its dragons. temperament. But what it doesn't know is that the city of the gods is different from any other elf city. It is almost a completely closed city. From the day it is built, it is ready for the battle all the time. It is in the city of the gods that there is no pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this ‘green diamond’ all existed in less than a day, and was specially prepared for Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 'green diamonds' spent the middle of the night, Nicholas has been very speculative with the surrounding elves, also understand the situation of the city of the gods A lot. The elf is an expert in winemaking, and the wine of 'Green Diamond' even carries a little magical energy, which makes Nicholas very intoxicated. After clarifying the main information of the city of the gods, the seemingly drunk Nicholas stepped out of the door of the 'green diamond'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, his figure was completely hidden in the night, searching for the entire city of the gods with an astonishing height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon and the elf's good deeds began in the glory days of the elves thousands of years ago, although the death of Cleef Ferrena and the elves are inseparable The relationship, but before figuring out the specific situation, Nicholas is still not willing to rush to kill the elves in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a few hundred kilometers in the location of the death of Kris Felena. Only the city of the gods, the elf city, naturally became the murderer of Nicholas. aims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than an hour, Nicholas has searched the city of the gods roughly, and even the heavy temples such as the Great Temple and the Presbyterian Church have not escaped from him. Search. Even after the deformation, Nicholas's strength is firmly standing within the sanctuary. Although the elf guards guarding these heavy grounds are elite, they are not in the eyes of Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one place where Nicholas did not dare to go in, that is the bedroom of Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas was too bold to dare to explore his bedroom in front of Hughes. He knew that even if he was a dragon, he would never be the opponent of Hughes in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He searched the entire city of the gods, and did not find a little bit of Kris Felena and his children. It seems that everything is as true as Hughes said, the murderers have already fled far away here, and the elves of the City of God seem to have little to do with this matter. It is not surprising that Hughes knows who the murderer is. The power of a god is unpredictable. It can be ordinary power or deep in the sea. Now the only clue to Nicholas' revenge is on Hughes, but if a god does not want to tell him the truth, then this clue is equal to no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas is a very stubborn dragon, he quietly lurked in the distance, patiently looking at the window of Hughes. He did not search the bedroom of Xiusi, he was not reconciled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Xiusi read the book with ease and looked like he was not ready to go to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an elf walked into the room of Sisters, and the elder Sarah told me to inform you that the new magic ring has been completed. Please Go pick one. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes reluctantly put down the book in his hand, Sarah, never look at the time! A magic ring is a big deal, forget it. We are going to go back quickly, and pick one at random."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the guidance of the elf, Hughes quickly walked to the Senate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas now knows the location layout of the Presbyterian Church. He calculated it silently and knew that he only had three minutes at most. Although not long, he was able to get three minutes in front of a god. He was already very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited patiently until Xiusi disappeared into the gates of the Presbyterian Church. His figure was like a light smoke. Into the room of Xius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedroom of Xius is very neat, simple and full of natural atmosphere. The only sign that identifies the owner of the room is the magical array that is all over the floor and still not working. Nicholas turned over the bedroom of Hughes in a lightning-fast manner, but it was nothing. There was no breath of Chris Ferrena or Dragon Egg. As for the magic array on the floor, he took some time to identify it. It can be seen that although this magic array is complicated, but the function is very simple, it is the purpose of gathering and conveying magic energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this really a residence for God?" Nicholas had some doubts, and the only explanation was on this magical array. It seems that this magical array must contain secrets that it does not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set up and began to study the mystery of the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time has passed without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicholas suddenly passed a trace of uneasiness in his heart, his figure disappeared from the room of the self-cultivation immediately, and appeared in the canopy of an elf old tree in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Hughes had just stepped out of the gates of the elders, and Nicholas had some cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it. Although there is a secret in the bedroom of Xius, it does not seem to have anything to do with Kris Felena.
