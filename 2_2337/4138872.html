			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime and punishment of the seven chapters of the red confession<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter eight red confuse<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Mrs. Catherine, now let’s take a look at this Dallov’s famous painting "Saints." An old man who has to be white and noble will carefully paint a painting. Put it on the shelf, then use a jasper thin rod to smack the picture and start to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked tired and yawned involuntarily. She has not rested for two days and two nights, but the master of Khrif, who explained the art for her, is one of the most famous big painters of today. It took her a lot of effort to come back, and there are not many opportunities to listen to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Saints" is a fan in itself, and its current appearance is not the intention of Dallov. It is still not completely conclusive. There is a saying Dallov made a manuscript for the painting, but the final composition and coloring was done by another person and falsified Dallov’s original intention. I personally prefer this statement. You see, even though this painting is Any details, even the inner style of the color, are almost identical to those of other Dallov's works, but if you carefully taste it, you will find that this painting has a bit more murderousness. This is nothing that Darlov has ever had. These differences are very subtle and need to be quite artistic in order to distinguish them. For example, the saints who are crouching around the saint, from his expressions, positions and movements, are more like a dying on the battlefield. Soldiers. How to interpret "Saints" is a major event in the art world of painting and a good topic for testing the artistic background of the viewers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clive continued to explain, By "saints" of knowledge about painting appreciation explain it bit by bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are looming bells coming from far away. The sky has begun to shine slightly. Unconsciously, Clive has already explained more than three hours. He saw that time had arrived and immediately bid farewell to Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine has been extremely tired, she called the maid, began to bathe and change clothes, and re-applied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Catherine regained her dazzling appearance. She stepped into the restaurant with the most moving gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time for her to have breakfast with MGM. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGM and Macbeth have lived in the Grand Residence for two days, and these two days are also two days of Catherine's sleeplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment MGM has already sat at the table. He has just arrived for a few days. I still don't know much about the etiquette of the Southern royal family, but the noble status, the extraordinary strength, and the attachment to the beauty make him stand out from the crowd. As a high-ranking angel, he can change his appearance according to his own mind. However, the new body has already made him very satisfied, so he only added a pair of finely-cut whiskers to himself, and with the faint smile, MGM exudes a heart-rending mature charm all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table is full of delicate mornings. Yesterday MGM had tried the famous early morning in the South under the introduction of Catherine. Today, on the table, they are all eaten in the name of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole breakfast time, Catherine not only made MGM taste the North style that is completely different from the previous day, but also some dishes that MGM likes very much. It also explains in detail the history of evolution, the craftsmanship and some legends related to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Catherine itself is the most perfect court etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For MGM, every time I live with Catherine. It is a wonderful experience that is hard to experience. He is more and more aware that this world, which has never been in his eyes, is so wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour and a half, the long breakfast was finally over. But MGM feels that time is really going too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as Catherine has the heart, any time with her. It will become the most wonderful piece of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of the maid, Catherine and MGM came to the private museum of the Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine led the MGM to the gallery on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Catherine's charming smile, MGM returned gracefully and said: "The world is beyond my imagination. I am very much looking forward to another piece of fun that you will reveal for me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine came to a painting before taking a fine jade from the maid, smiling: "Noble MGM, when it comes to painting, you can't help but mention Master Dallov, one of the greatest painters in history. This painting is his masterpiece "Saints." The "Saints" itself is a mystery. Is it now the face of Dallov's original intention? Completely conclusive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of Catherine, MGM is completely immersed in the world of painting art. That gentle voice and slender hands. The history of painting art on the mainland is slowly presented in front of MGM. He was fascinated by the elegance and perfection of Catherine and was amazed at her extensiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the only regret is that time really went too fast. But manipulating time, even for high-level angels like MGM, is a task that is completely incompetent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hurry to use lunch, Catherine came to the Armory’s weapons exhibition hall, waiting for Macbeth who had just visited the Prisonmen’s Training Camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe Yingwu’s face has no expression. As soon as he stepped into the weapons exhibition hall, he silently followed Catherine’s visit to the collection of the Bavarian Grand Duke. Occasionally see the weapons of interest, he will also pick up and wave slightly, and then put back to the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine accompanied him all the way, without a word. Weapons are different from art, and she will not be able to express her own opinions in this field. What's more, in the eyes of Macbeth, the collection of fine magical equipment in the Grand Palace is almost the same as that of children's toys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe only saw half of the exhibition hall, and lost interest. He turned to look at Catherine and asked: "Mrs. Catherine, I heard that there is a very famous Mr. Prociss in your country. I don't know if I can arrange for me to meet him?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Macbeth, Star Sword Saint Procis is following Marshal Rosio. Preparing for the war against the Dro Empire. This war is a big deal, I don't think he can Respond to your martial arts requirements. If you want to meet the world's strong people, I have another suggestion, but..." Catherine wants to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe's eyebrows are rising, cold and cold: "Mrs. Catherine, I appreciate your beauty and wisdom, and fully understand your piety. In front of me. You don't have to worry about anything, even if you say something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a guarantee from Macbeth. Catherine still hesitated for a while before she subconsciously lowered her voice. "I heard that two adults came to this world to hunt down a fallen angel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The white light in the eyes of Mike, an invisible force field immediately bound Catherine. Under great pressure, Catherine was pale. Looks terrified. She had a small mouth open, but she couldn't make any sound at all; she tried to struggle in vain, but she couldn't even move a small finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say! How do you know this?" Macbeth’s tone is still the same as usual, but Catherine knows that as long as one answer is wrong, I will immediately bring myself a murder. Through two days of contact, she knew that Macbeth was not as scrupulous as the Pope. He completely ignored the jihadist career of the Bavarian Grand Duke. Naturally, it will not consider whether Catherine’s life and death will affect the jihad of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was slightly relieved by the pressure of the ground, allowing her to speak reluctantly: "This is... the Pope told me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth frowned, smashed a few circles in the room, and then waved his hand and the pressure to bind Catherine disappeared immediately. Catherine sat down on the ground weakly, holding her hand. Can't stop coughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of Macbeth, it can be seen that the white skin and deep cleavage of her chest are undulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbe suddenly felt that the heartbeat was slightly faster, and there was an inexplicable movement. He groaned, his mind was slightly moved, and he pressed the abnormalities of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine looked at Macbeth, his eyes were full of panic, but there were other things hidden in the panic. Macbeth didn't know enough about the world, so he didn't see the true meaning hidden in Catherine's eyes. In fact, even if he has lived in this world for decades, there is not much chance to see through Catherine's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I ask. What is the name of the fallen angel to be pursued by the two adults?" Catherine's tone returned to calm, but the undetectable trembling revealed a little bit of her heart. It seems that she was frightened by the rudeness of Macbeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O'Reilly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine was silent for a long time before he gently said:" I... I heard about this name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, even Macbeth lost his calmness and indifference. He suddenly turned and asked: " What!? Where did you hear the name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a new church in the Asturic Empire in the north. I heard that The goddess they believe in is called O'Reilly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! She really pretends to be a god, stealing the power of faith. This is a big sin, she is sure to escape Can't fall..." Macbeth thought for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine continued: "I heard that when she showed miracles, every time it was a sacred song, accompanied by a dazzling light..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I can apply the divine power to this point, and dare to be self-sufficient. It seems that even if she is not O'Reilly, she must have something to do with her... "Thinking of this, Macbeth immediately interrupted Catherine and asked: "Where is the headquarters of the Eye of Wisdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Astrofic Empire Affiliated country, Dresden, the capital of Adelaide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth nodded and said, "Good! I will go over it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait!" cried Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macbeth is a little impatient, but still ready to hear what she wants to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Macbeth adults, as far as I know, in addition to showing miracles several times, the goddess of wisdom, O'Reilly, has never appeared. It seems that she is very embarrassed and knows how to hide her way. If you go straight to hunt her, I am afraid it will be empty!" Catherine said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macbeth frowned, but he just wanted to track down the whereabouts of O'Brien, once it was verified. He will immediately summon Achilles and MGM. At that time, he and MGM were present, and the arrogant Achilles did not dare to play tricks. It should be known that there is a reason for the fall of O'Reilly. If Achilles is also degraded, then Tiramis, who created them and has the responsibility of guiding, will also be convicted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the pursuit of the Light Angel O'Reilly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Macbeth is very proud, this Self-knowledge is always there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine walked to Macbeth's side, his upper body leaning forward slightly. Suppressed the voice: "I heard that the prince of the Asrofik Empire, the lord of the Ayre Principality, Rogge. The relationship with Audrey Reich is very, very close, the eye of wisdom is because of his support I was able to develop rapidly in the north. I heard that there are many powerful powerful people around Rogge. For example, an apprentice of Mr. Prossis has been working for him. Also, the information I sent back from the north. It is inferred that Rogge and O'Reilly are likely to have a leg..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperament of Catherine. The vulgar words of ‘one leg’ were spit out in a soft voice. The strong contrast between them made Macbeth feel thirsty in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "O'Reilly... Did you already fall to this point?" Macbeth thought for himself. In front of his eyes, the radiant, arrogant light angel in the heavens emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Macbeth’s heartbeat can’t slow down anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, Rogge..." Macbeth read the name several times, then sneered: "Very good! I will go to the north to see , can yin * Ao Lei Rei fallen. What kind of character would be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine immediately said: "I will prepare for you Astrofi Map of the Principality, and the portrait of Rogge..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, Macbeth's figure fluctuated and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stood in the room for a while before she left with a look of sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor. Carefully asked Catherine's personal maid: "Mrs. Catherine, you look so sad, what troubles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine sighed softly , said: "Hey, I am worried about Macbeth. He is so proud, but... I heard that there are many people in the north..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main The servant quickly crossed the cloister and entered the Catherine bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where they just passed, there was a wave of air, and Macbeth’s figure slowly emerged. He looked at the direction in which Catherine disappeared, revealing a rare smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately turned to the North. The figure disappeared again. However, Macbeth did not see it, and it was impossible to read the meaning of the smile on the side of Catherine's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark forest. The tremors of the earth have not stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame tyrant Donk Bakkara has crossed most of the dark forest, but his anger does not seem to have subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And several giant trees burned down in front of Don Kabakara. But his footsteps suddenly stopped and looked up to the sky, seemingly looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is hiding there! Do you think you can escape Donk Bakkara's eyes?" The flame tyrant suddenly roared, as he was hugely The sound waves, the dark red flame ripples spread out, and the forest within a few kilometers of the lake was immediately submerged in the raging fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an unnatural twist in the sky, a stunning figure in a black robe, and the bright red eyes stared blankly at the ground. The tyrant of the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangke Bakala was irritated by this apparent contempt, and he screamed again, and a group of almost colorless and transparent flames wrapped Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles lips slightly, and read something low. A bright red color quickly stained his cheeks, neck, and eventually spread to all exposed skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles quietly floated in midair, the bright red eyes fixedly watching the flame tyrant, letting the flames raging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His physique has been completely immune to fire after just being converted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangke Bakala is another roar, the right hand of the flame is completely caught by the flame, and a dark red, semi-melted state appears in the palm of his hand. Huge rock! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, this rock has already flown to Achilles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles's eyebrows wrinkled, obviously more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His white hand was dripping with his left hand in front of him, an invisible net that stopped the lava from the attack. Achilles's whole body was shocked, and it was actually slightly retreated by the huge momentum of the lava! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles faceless, his white right hand opens and slowly leans down. A bright red color flowed down from his palm and drifted to Donk Bakala. This red is not light, nor physical, seems to be completely absent from this plane. It does not change its shape, penetrates the obstacles on the road ahead, and floats to the top of Donk Bakala. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this strange red, the flame tyrant looks a bit nervous. His huge body was so low that he could not help but spurt a flame that was as thick as a viscous liquid. The spit of the fire tongue woven into a dark red curtain that blocked the falling red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red seems to be very unwilling, not living on the flame curtain, but there is no gap that can be penetrated, and finally reluctantly Dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles nodded, he no longer cares about the flame tyrant. The bright red eyes, at this moment, have long looked into the distance, looking at the beautiful figure that once had unlimited light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
