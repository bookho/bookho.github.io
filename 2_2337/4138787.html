			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unseen night has always been the favorite of the killers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie is in front of Rogge every time before and after the night, this time is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike came twice in front of him, and was scared once, and the second time he was secretly kissed by Androni. This is a big blow to Nicole, the killer who is smug and intends to be named. So for the third time, Nicole was prepared, she even spared the blood and used the expensive invisible powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unusually, Rogge’s study, although lit with lights, is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole carefully turned the window in, then stood still by the window, closed his eyes, and did not move. There are many ways to deceive the eyes, so as a professional killer, she relies on the sense of hearing and skin to determine if there is someone in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the occasional winds outside the window, there is no sound. The room was cold and cold, and there was no popularity at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that no one is there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole breathed a sigh of relief and slowly opened his eyes. The pupil suddenly enlarged in an instant and the body became stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge doesn’t know when he’s sitting at the table, reading the book intently!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seeing that Rogge did not seem to have her presence, Nicole slowly closed her eyes. In her feelings, the room was indeed empty. When she opened her eyes again, Rogge sat still reading a book. It’s just that he didn’t have a single voice when he flipped the pages, and he didn’t even have the sound of breathing, heartbeat or even blood flow. Rogge sitting there is like a phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie scared his heartbeat and almost stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I was careful enough to use invisible powder, it seems that he has not seen me yet!" Nicole comforted herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge put down the book in his hand and looked at Nicole: "How long do you have to stand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole’s mood is frustrating. Sneak is one of the most important skills of the killer, but Nicole can't figure out why his own singularity is always useless in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered the business, and settled her mind and came to Rogge: "Rogge, the night dancer has found a solution for you." The price is... one million gold coins. This is our solution. If you agree, please sign a word on this arrears." Then Nicole handed it to Rogge. paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge carefully read the solution provided by the night dancers. After thinking for a long time, he said: "This method is indeed feasible. But the difficulty is too much. If you are a little higher, is there no other way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nie can show the dilemma, but just tell me that another solution needs to use nine magic. This legendary level of magic requires at least six million gold coins, which is not something you can afford. In fact, one million gold coins are hard to pay for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the payment method? Rog asked as he looked at the arrears.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pay half first, then pay half after the other half." You can also use a variety of rare items to make a price. Our dark night dancers have always been very fair in their valuation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed dumbly. It seems that in doing business, the night dancer is almost the same as the hammer of the previous god of war! Of course, the hammer of the god of war is in The scale of business is still in the grade of goods, far less than the night dancers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge quickly signed the arrears and asked : "When can I get something? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The above is confessed, and the goods will be delivered to you at the latest night. "Hurrying to say, Nicole turned and wanted to go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she had completed a great business for her first debut, she was overjoyed, but Nicole is still not willing to stay in Rogge for a moment. I don't know how, she is very afraid to see the charming swordsman. As soon as she thinks of the swordsman, Nicole has a very bad premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole looked at Rogge strangely and said: "Even I know that there is nothing worse than the money owed to a lot of killers. Are you kidding?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this... Of course it’s a joke!” Rogge made a haha ​​and concealed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night after two days, Nicole really arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took out a delicate little box from her arms and carefully placed it in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge opened the box, powerful magical fluctuations immediately rushed to the surface, a delicate magic scroll is lying there quietly. Rogge gently grasped the magic scroll, closed his eyes, and carefully understood the powerful magical fluctuations contained in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Rogge opened his eyes and smiled: "This is it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nicole cheered and jumped up with joy. Even in the dark night dancers, this is a very big business, how can Nicole be upset? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she hasn’t been happy for a long time, and she snorted and slammed it. Then a sweet voice rang in her ear: "Little Nicole, what is so happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicole screamed and fled immediately. I don’t even dare to look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni smiled and looked at Nicole’s back. She is more and more fond of this little debut who just debuted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at Androni, his right hand and five fingers extended his sharp nails and stabbed her shoulders. Androni didn't evade, and with a bang, Rogge pulled out her coat a few holes, revealing a dark piece of leather inside. Rogge had a great grasp, and Androni shook, but the leather was still intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Black Dragon Leather is more solid than we originally expected!" Roger sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is! Lightweight, good defense, magic resistance is very high, can also resist mental magic, no wonder the killers like to wear black dragon skin A.” Androni also liked this leather armor very much. Black Dragon Leather can just make up for the most common disadvantages of the swordsman. No wonder she likes it. Although the black dragon leather is good, the raw materials are extremely difficult to get. If you want to kill the adult black dragon, how is it easy to talk about? After the black dragon goes to the scales, the place where the whole body can be made into leather is not really big. When a black dragon is full, it can only be a four or five pieces of leather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge knows the origins of this black dragon leather on Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of several battles between Black Dragon and Silver Dragon in Moonlight Dragon City was both defeated, and even Nicholas suffered a minor injury. With the Nicholas defense rushed back in time, the Black Dragons were unable to attack the Moonlight Dragon City and had to withdraw from the Prison Basin. The dead god class, which has a heart and a low price, has been ambushed halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luck of the Death Class is really good enough to successfully seduce a black dragon that has been seriously injured. This time, the class was ready, not only to borrow the dragon blade from Xius, but also to apply the dragon poison researched by Froya. The poisonous toxicity of dragon poison can not afford even the silver dragon that is poisonous and immune, let alone the poisonous resistance is not as good as the black dragon of the green dragon. Of course, even if it is a seriously injured black dragon, the class is not willing to face it alone. Therefore, in the squatting narrow valley, there are three masters of bow and arrow, each with two magic arrows that have a special killing effect on the black dragon. The class is also under the blood, and each of the six magic arrows is worth a million dollars. Even more terrible is to ask for a dragon poison to Fu Luoya, owe a little fairy to a big man. The value of this human condition is too much, and no one can tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how Hughes got a piece of fresh black dragon skin from the class, it wasn’t Rogge interested in knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni looked at the box on the table and she felt the intense magical fluctuations inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the box is opened, strong magical fluctuations flood the entire city. Although the average person is ignorant of this, it is not the sensible smell of Xiusi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened and Hughes walked in. As soon as he entered the door, his eyes were fixed on the box placed on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge said: "Elder Sisters, you are here. The most important thing has been obtained. The following thing is how to bring Nicholas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes closed his eyes and touched the magic scroll. After a while, he opened his eyes and said: "God makes the adults, this thing can be a bit difficult. After this magic is applied, the caster can hit Nicholas to take effect. You Is there any good way?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: “It’s easy to do this. I will apply this magic to you. If you guys play three In the middle of Nicholas, we can't do it. Then, what are we talking about fighting with him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes asked, "God makes the adults really magic." The genius, can this magic be applied to other people? It seems that my old man is really old, and even this does not know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles No! Just a joke. But I came up with a way to get a chance to hit Nicholas, we can try. If it becomes the best in nature, it doesn't matter if it doesn't. It’s better to die than to die!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes looked at Rogge, his expression was very strange.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rogge is endless and skinny, but after all, he is still a magician, and the rough martial arts are really invincible. In the battle with Nicholas, even Androni may not have the chance to hit the silver dragon. Then, Rogge said that there is a way to hit Nicholas?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes suddenly realized suddenly, smiling: "It seems that God made the adult finally determined to become a lich. You can rest assured that since you have a heart of death, then we can be awkward. At the moment he killed you, even if we couldn't kill Nicholas, it would always be possible to cut off one of his legs. This silver miracle is greatly damaged, and sooner or later we will die in our hands. You can feel your lich as peace of mind, your enemies will be able to report. What's more, after you become a lich, you can say that you live in another way, and you can't say that you are dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge couldn’t help but interrupted Hughes: "Old things, you can’t wait for me to die, will you count with me after the account, now you can help I see, is there any flaw in this method? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Rogge and Hughes kept on deliberating, and in the blink of an eye they discussed the early hours of the morning. Hughes finally said: "This method has some feasible, just God Although your magical control is far beyond the level of the great magician, the implementation of this program is still slightly insufficient. It is really more risky. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This one, I bet." Rogge calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes nodded and didn’t insist. He said again: "Then the next one is simpler, that is how to put Nicholas Give it. From the point of tracking magic, he has never been out of the 500-kilometer range, and should still lurk in the dark, waiting for the opportunity to start. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two thought that it was a very simple matter to lead Nicholas, and the results did not go smoothly at the beginning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The best way to lead a dragon out of the hole is to start with a weak hand. So Rogge intends to let the death class leave the city government and live a little further. In the degree of death class, this point The distance is just around the corner. But for Nicholas, the chance to have a single blow is enough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue now has a silver breastplate, not painted, painted The Dragon Slayer's Dragon Slayer is also at hand. According to Xius, Nicholas hits a maximum of only 60% of the chance to penetrate the Silver Dragon Breastplate. Of course, even if he does not wear the Silver Dragon, the violent shock is enough. Let Rogge be seriously injured. At that time, if the seriously injured Rogge can still move this magic scroll, it is necessary to test the real power of magic control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicholas's patience was unexpected, and Rogge and others waited for two days, and Nicholas was still missing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that the most powerful death class around us has a certain distance from it. How can Nicholas not grasp the opportunity? Is it already proficient in the assassination, ready to wait for everyone to guard against slack, and then kill and kill Rogge asks to Sius.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes believes that the arrogance and arrogance of the silver miracle is that it will not do the assassination of this shameful thing. The old fox also said that Nicholas hated Rogge, and since he said that he would slowly torture him to death, it would certainly not kill Rogge easily.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes the adults really wise, he is afraid of my old man!" Xiusi proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at Hughes and watched for a long time, the result is still the same as before, the killer of the 16th level, not many levels, a lot of level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rogge did not understand why the silver miracle would be afraid of a 16-level killer, he still took the initiative and said: "That's good, Elders, you will be tomorrow." Changed with the Death Class!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the exchange between Xius and the Death Class is the same, Nicholas is still hiding in the dark, saying nothing. . It’s embarrassing to get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when everyone was discouraged, there was a servant in the city government. It is not a big deal to have a servant missing, but the body of this servant should be said to be a relic, and it will be revealed in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This servant remains in the world, leaving only a black shadow. And this human figure is black and the end is printed on the gate of the city government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, Hughes, Death Class, etc. stood in front of the gate and looked very ugly. They all saw that this servant was directly turned into ashes by the silver dragon dragon flame. And leaving this shadow on the door, apparently Nicholas was demonstrating and exerting psychological pressure on Rogge. Nicholas was really wise, and when he first came out of the Dragon City, he was still unreasonable. Now, in a short time, he has learned to exert psychological pressure on everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong have a minimum of dignity, they generally do not bother to start a servant. Nicholas did this, apparently showing that he had begun to resort to revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was also prepared to take a step forward and prepare to lead him out in a way that combats the dignity of Nicholas. But Nicholas can kill even a servant who can't do martial arts. This seems to be useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes and Rogge frowned, sitting in the room, and being helpless in front of the dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;拍! Roger took a heavy shot of the table and said: "This silver miracle is really *** can bear!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes just sighed for revenge is already unscrupulous. This style of work and God make you look like an adult. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger angered: "Where is it?" Although Laozi’s bad things have done a lot, there are always things that are not for sale....”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Rogge suddenly remembered something and silenced Then, sinisterly: "Yes! Even people like me have an unbearable bottom line. I don't believe that Nicholas can bear anything! Silver Dragon Egg... Forget it, this thing is hard to come by, it can't be easily used. . Elder Chess, are there any silver dragon horns in your hand? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silver dragon horn that can be used in your dragons. How can I have more in my hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned: "Nothing? This is a bit difficult. Can the things that have been treated by the dust of history be restored?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes has some understanding of Rogge’s meaning, and sighed: "If the things that have been dealt with by the dust of history can be restored, then my old man is really a god." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the giant skull of the bone dragon was found out of the air. It has two sparkling silver dragon horns in his mouth, the two silver dragon horns that Cristian Ferrena used to ask for help, but were cut off by the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s mouth was loose, and two silver dragons were on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon looked at the two silver dragon horns with fascinating radiance, and sighed with sorrow and sighed back to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge played with two silver feet that were one-and-a-half-foot long and covered with fine silver threads, and smiled and said: "Elders of Xius, these days Everyone is too tired. We should relax and relax. What do you think of holding a barbecue party?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and said: "Okay Ok! I am afraid that when I have a dragon, I will be angry. You know, people who are crazy are not very good at dealing with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, a raging bonfire ignited in the back garden of the city's main house. A calf was slaughtered and washed, and the spices were applied and baked on a campfire. Numerous servant maids shuttled and placed a plate of food and a bottle of wine on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the city’s main government is already very lively. The calf that has been grilled for more than two hours is ready for consumption, just waiting for Rogge to announce the start of the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the invitation of Rogge, the wealthy bureaucrats in the city of Bora almost arrived. Although the spring nights in the North are still very cold, the open-air barbecue is not a good idea. However, Rogge’s status is respected and he has a heavy hand. He has the power to kill and kill these people. Therefore, no matter whether they are willing or not, no one can’t win the invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guests were still very thick, but still trembled in the cold wind. These people who do not have any martial arts and magic do not feel that their footsteps have been a little heavy since they stepped into the city government. They have a heart for this strange feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a belief that Rogge wants to take this advantage, and some think that Rogge is an arty, and some people think that Rogge wants to make a name and collect bribes. Prepared a gift that is inconspicuous and substantially expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, a pair of golden eyes are watching the lively bonfire dinner in the city hall. In these eyes, the entire city government was now shrouded in a mist of pale blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas sneered a little, "Bad enchantment? Is this simple trap also wanting me to be fooled? These sly creatures must be arranged separately. But you have to Through my eyes, it is a dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color in his pupil is not changing, every time it changes, it means that Nicholas at this moment will only receive certain magic. fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, in the eyes of Nicholas, there was a strangely dark green light in the distant capital of the city. These green light sources are from three green light balls floating above the city's main government. The three balls of light slowly follow each other along a complex trajectory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon Curse!?" Nicholas's eyes narrowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not to mention the treasure collected by the dragon, the dragon's body is just a treasure trove that can be moved. It is because since ancient times, countless human adventurers have tried to kill dragons so that they can get rich overnight. Although most of them became dragon food, there were only a handful of successful people. These stories inspire new adventurers to embark on the journey of the Dragon Slayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For thousands of years, greed has prompted people to carry out countless equipment and magic against the dragon's weaknesses. Xiusi's dragon blade is one of the most famous god soldiers, so it will make the death god Ban Gan take great risks and be the enemy of Silver Dragon Nicholas. The Dragon Curse is a very powerful magical array. Within the magical array, all the dragons will be strongly cursed, and each ability will have a certain degree of weakness. The degree of weakness depends on the magic resistance of different dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this is their real killer tonight. Nicholas thought coldly, and a glare flashed across his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humble creatures still don't know that he is completely immune to the dragon spell!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Nicholas Still not ready to shoot. These days, Nicholas has been calmly observing the performance of this humble microbe. When Hughes left Rogge, he really had some heartbeat, but he vowed to torture Rogge. It was so cheap to kill him. What's more, he always has scruples about Hughes, and he has to observe to see if Hughes can detect his own position. From these days, they know that they are lying nearby, but they don't know their specific location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s expensive to arrange a dragon spell. Nicholas wants to see how many times they can arrange this dragon spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Curse is specifically for dragons, and naturally it is necessary to find ways to overcome the dragon's perception. In fact, if Nicholas is still in the silver dragon form, he can't exist the dragon curse. But after changing to an elf, it is completely different. The natural night eye and keen sense of ability are the two most famous talents of the elves. Driven by the strength of Nicholas, these two abilities are greatly enhanced, and it is possible to observe the existence of all magical fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, Rogge wants to slip away under his nose, it is impossible. I want to play tricks and I can’t think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Selecting the elf as a transformational form doesn't seem too wasteful." Nicholas sometimes thinks this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final metamorphosis can be transformed into any known creature. Among the human races or elves, only the most powerful Druids can only cultivate this skill. After the ultimate deformation, Druid can be transformed into one of several extremely powerful creatures, and as the ability increases, the number of creatures that can be deformed increases. Judging from the past records, these legendary strengths of the Druid's first metamorphosis, the most selected is the dragon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the target creature is selected, Will be fixed from then on. If you want to become a other creature, you can only choose a new deformed creature if you wait for the next level. But these powerful forces are already extremely powerful. Would you like to go further and talk about it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to revenge, Nicholas chose to transform the elves and human races that are much more vulnerable than their silver dragons. This can be said to be a great sacrifice. But as a silver dragon, Nicholas's toughness is almost at the top of this world's creatures. It is almost impossible to find a biological species that is definitely stronger than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge has finished a lengthy speech, announces the beginning of the banquet, and the audience is thriving. The guests were cold and hungry and could not support it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are curious and fearful of this great magician who is in the rise of the Holy Alliance and who is both beautiful and hot. It is rumored that all the magicians are rich and enemies, and their character is weird. Rogge seems to be no exception. Other guests used the knife and fork to greet the servant's barbecue, and Rogge, like the barbarian, used a twisted, oddly shaped silver tip to insert meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rogge’s eating is very rude, it’s not a thing to look at the soft silver-colored cone in his hand. The guests only felt that the silver spikes were like invisible majesty, which made them afraid to look at them more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, a pair of golden eyes in the distance is intently watching the silver dragon horn in the hands of Rogge!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas floats in the air quietly, his face is like a cast iron, with no expression. However, the magic pattern of his body suddenly flickered, showing that his body's strength is undulating and in a state of extreme chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge swallowed a large piece of succulent roast pork in the blink of an eye, and still tried to pick up the silver dragon horn. Rogge's ears were extremely sharp, and he was only sneer at the deliberately depressed, contemptuous and disdainful arguments of the guests. With a fight, how many people can these people survive? When fighting between the strong, a small wind that spilled out was enough to kill them dozens of times. Even if they are lucky to survive, they can't escape Rogge's poisonous hands. He called so many guests this time to confuse the scene. As long as Nicholas missed a little bit of time in order to kill these ordinary people, Rogge had room to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these guests, they don’t know that they have become one of Nicholas’ goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a roast goose on the central table is inserted with another silver dragon horn. Many curious guests have tried this novel, unique and artistic feeding device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge inserted the silver dragon's horn into another larger roast beef, Nicholas on the fringe edge finally calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a jewel from his arms and said to the jewel: "Dear Cranio, forgive me for ignoring your advice. These humble creatures are the most thorough Insulted me, I can't stand the body of Kris Felena being treated like this. If I didn't come back, it should be that I fell in front of God. At that time, please pray for Dragon God for me. Make a ruling for the injustice I have encountered. But remember, don't avenge me before you get the dragon god's instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪The gem was crushed by Nicholas, and a small ball of light rose up to the north and disappeared into the sky in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Nicholas has appeared in the center of the campfire party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature dropped sharply, and even the raging bonfire flashed a few times and reluctantly went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
