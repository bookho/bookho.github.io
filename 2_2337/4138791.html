			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four dark blue scorpions rise to the sky, hovering over the Wright Fortress for a week, then flew northeast under the cover of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cockroaches fly very fast, very fierce, not easy to intercept, very suitable for transmitting a major military situation. It’s just that the cultivation of the barley is very difficult, and there are only a few dozens of Latvia and the Kingdom of Levi. This time, because of the very important information to be delivered, I sent four heads at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These groups will inform the coalition forces on the front line, and the army of Rogge will arrive in the plains of Kampas in the early morning three days later. Rogge also allowed the coalition forces to ensure the safety of the passage as much as possible, because Rogge also escorted the next batch of military food and military supplies from the coalition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood on the roof of the main building of the fortress and watched the four green scorpions disappear at the other end of the horizon, and then nodded with satisfaction. He looked down at the *** little, busy and busy Wright Fortress, with a slightly cruel sneer in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger has commanded an elf guardian warrior behind him: "To inform our troops, all the soldiers tonight must stay in the camp, no matter what happens, all Don't go out. If you have campers, you will kill them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Rogge told another guardian warrior: "Notify the elf shooter and magic The division is on standby, letting the killer of the dark side of the moon monitor the movements of all the fortress defensive forces, and immediately notify me when there is a change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge on the third guardian Bushido "You are going to grab General Horne now. If he resists or flees, he will kill it directly. Don't alarm other people. If someone sees you, you know what to do."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three guardian warriors took orders and jumped down from the top of the building, and their shadows disappeared into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, noisy vocals and music gradually drifted up the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the guests are all there, let's go, Charlie, we should go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The large conference room in the main building of the fortress was temporarily arranged into a banquet hall, which is enough for hundreds of people to eat at the same time. Rogge said that before going to the front line, he would be close to Latvia and the officers of the two countries, so he had such a kind of banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was a jealousy before the war, but the big aristocrats liked to enjoy, Rogge’s move was not too special. All the officers above the middle level of the Wright Fortress were invited. At the moment, in addition to the garrison troops, there are nearly two thousand heavy logistics units in the Wright Fortress. The commanders of these third-rate units also received an invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the officers who had to take turns, almost all the officers who received the invitation were present. What attracted them was not Rogge’s power, wealth or the mighty strength of the magician, but his mysterious and beautiful Elf Guard. The most valuable place for the Elf Guardian Warriors was the powerful martial arts and the loyalty and blind obedience to Rogge. The appearance is not important. But for a long time, those who have seen the appearance of the guardian warrior, the most profound impression left in the heart is that the face is as fine as a porcelain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled into the banquet hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snoring, it was indeed the mysterious and beautiful elves that followed Rogge into the banquet hall! The noisy banquet hall was quiet, these long The middle and lower-ranking officers who fought in the year were almost staring at the elves. At the same time, there are so many beautiful elves appearing. For these bloody men, the visual shock effect is really too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the number of elves is really a little more, there are more than a hundred, and the new elves are constantly pouring into the banquet hall. Finally, some people are not right now, and they screamed: "No! How are these elves fully armed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers immediately quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they feel that the eyes of these elf warriors are so familiar, the murderousness of Morihan fully illustrates how these elves are under the cover of beautiful appearance. Danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number of officers in the hall is close to two hundred, and each officer is a good warrior, compared with the dark side of the moon that was almost armed by Rogge, they are like a group of lambs stalked by wolves. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of heavily armed Spartan knights in the hall, in front of the knights wearing heavy armor, steel shields and swords If these officers resist, the only end will be the massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "You adults don't have to panic. I am a very tolerant person, at least your life will not be threatened, of course, the premise is that you I can cooperate with me. Now, I am going to take over the Wright Fortress! I am afraid I will be wronged for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呛啷数, fortress guard and his Several deputies took out their long swords. The guards lined up in the crowd and yelled: "At this time, your actions will not only bring destruction to the Latvian and Livi coalition forces, but also destroy your Ayre Principality. In fact, You are burying the entire Holy Alliance! If you insist on taking over the Wright Fortress, then as a soldier and a knight, I will fight against it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled If you laugh at this, you will not bury the Holy Alliance, or destroy the Ayre Principality. I am a tolerant person and will never stop you from becoming a hero of the kingdom. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of water-blue brilliance sprinkled from behind Rogge, gently passing over the officers who stood up in the sword.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dead silence, several officers began to reveal the blue light in their bodies, and quickly turned into a few vivid crystal carvings, and then burst into a day of stardust <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who else? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's cold eyes swept through the audience, and satisfactorily saw that all the officers had subconsciously avoided his gaze.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After controlling all the middle and upper-level officers, the work of taking over the fortress was very smooth. Even if there were occasional soldiers’ rebellious resistance, they were quickly suppressed.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning sun shines on the Wright Fortress, the fortress has been pressed by the owner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘹亮The sound of the squad sounded in the fortress, and the recruits of the Allied Principality who had been ordered to stay in the camp for a night came out of the camp, rushed to the designated location in the order of the officers and began to frantically strengthen the entire fortress.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ditches on both sides of the fortress were dug and dug, and the sharpened wooden stakes were placed inside. A frame of giant clams was removed from the warehouse and placed on the fortress. The city's new armor swords were also removed from the warehouse, and the shabby new recruits of the Ayre Principality were installed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Wright Fortress is the most important transit point connecting the rear of the coalition with the front line, the military supplies in the fortress are piled up like mountains. These things are taken for granted by Rogge. These Alai recruits in Wright’s fortress, talking about the excellent equipment, are chasing the most elite troops of the Holy Alliance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the main guard at the main building of the fortress In the office, Rogge leaned over his desk and was looking at the map with concentration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sly wind butterfly sits by the window and is bathing in In the morning sun, looking out the window, I don’t know what I’m thinking. Her dress is no longer the image of Yingwu, it seems to be full of her own beauty. Even this is decorated with a knife and a beast skull. The room was covered with a faint glow due to her presence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni sat casually, as she used to, a pair The long legs are high on the desk at Rogge. She stares at the sky. Plate, Rogge knows that at this moment Androni must be immersed in the world of swordsmanship and vindictiveness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door is wide open, General Horne Under the escorting of the two Elf Warriors, they entered the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Horn, my proposal for that day, how are you thinking about it? Asked Rogge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horne remained silent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge continued: Have you not thought about it yet? It doesn't matter. There is something I want to ask you for a favor. There are still two greens in the fortress. I want to ask you to help me with a war report. I said that the coalition forces and I have defeated the Astrofiks on the plains of Kampaas. We are continuing to pursue them. The battle report will be given to the king of Latvia four days later. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This has two advantages. One is to increase the credibility of this battle report, and the other is to help you make the next decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn looks Rogge said: "You are not afraid of me in the battle report, will you inform the coalition of your conspiracy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rughaha smile is a smart person, should Knowing that since I occupied the Wright Fortress, the 60,000 coalition on the plains of Kampaas is over. The time when Levi and the Kingdom of Latvia can still exist can already be counted. If you move your hands and feet, I will know immediately. At that time, you not only destroyed your life, but also your family was buried. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horse was silent for a moment and said: "You are crazy." You won't be long before. Moreover, although the coalition is a little less than the Astrofiks, the combat power is higher than that of the Duke of Dolyak. It is impossible for the Astrofiks to eat the coalition forces within a week. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "How can people like you become blind?" You see, because the supply is smooth, the coalition currently only carries five days of military food. And they expect that I will arrive with the military in two days, so it is impossible to limit the ration. After the coalition forces have figured out the situation, they are not likely to retreat in front of the Astrofiks, and then sway to attack the fortress. Therefore, the only thing they can count on now is that domestic reinforcements can take down the fortress and reopen the supply line. But what does the coalition rely on to defeat me? Rely on your 20,000 reserve soldiers? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Kingdom of Layton will not sit and watch you. The 50,000-strong army led by King Romon can attack the Wright Fortress. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Kingdom of Layton? Rogge smiled and didn't want to stick to the Wright Fortress. Eight days! I only need eight days to get enough. From the current situation, when the troops ready to attack the fortress are under the city, the coalition forces on the plains of Kampaas are finished. I didn't expect it to be so smooth, but the location of the Wright Fortress is really good, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughed a few times before continuing Road: "General Horn, the Holy Alliance is finished. Are you not going to seize this last chance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn lowered his head, after a while, Only slowly said: "Okay... I write."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Horne stepped out of the room, Rogge put away a confident smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the map and said to himself: "The kingdom of Layton...the kingdom of Layton..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly raised his head and cried, "Come, come and invite Charlie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie enters the room, Rogge says "Charlie, let those rookies give me their old life! We are probably only three or four days to strengthen the fortress. Tell them, if they want to survive in the battle, these days have to More sweating! Don't worry about the side of the Kampaas steppe, and strengthen the defense facilities facing the Holy Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie, ask Road: "We are to be prepared, is it the kingdom of Layton?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger frowned and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie hesitated a moment and asked: "But, is Miss Eckel, will the Layton Kingdom come to attack us?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is hard to say! Although Romon is older, but when he was young, he was a very powerful person. We should not expect to be able to be tied with an elf woman. It’s wonderful to live with his hands and feet. Also, tell Frey and Adele to let them shrink their respective forces into Recto and Dresden. If someone comes to attack, The neighboring cities have given them a good job. As long as we get to the coalition on the Kampaas prairie, it is a victory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is urgent, Charlie hastily arranged Defence facilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, an inconspicuous crystal on Rogge’s desk lit up, in the form of a halo, the image of an old magician wearing a white robe Formed on the crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger Master!" The old magician said, "Are you ready there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Eight days?” The old magician smiled lowly: “Oh, it’s already too much. In the name of the goddess of ice, let us be a faithful ally forever.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also laughed at the name of the world king of death, and we would always be a loyal ally. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rockefeller? Androni asked: "Is it the Rockefeller, the great magician known for the blizzard magic?" "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is this guy hooked up with the silver saints? Wait! The magic communication crystal has a distance limit, then the old guy will not be in the Holy Alliance, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled: "In fact, he has been in the Holy Alliance for a long time. After a few days, he will give the coalition a surprise." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni snorted! It's no wonder that my father and my brothers will value you so much. But this time you have done this very well, will The entire Holy Alliance was sold to the Astrofiks, are you not afraid that they will come back and eat you again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles, Proudly said: "I am not so easy to eat. People who want to eat me have been a lot, but there was no success in the past, of course, there will be no. Of course, I can safely deal with the Astrofiks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni played a yawning man, knowing the intrigue every day. You don't want to say, I am even more lazy to deal with your plots! I am going to practice vindictiveness, nothing to bother me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Rogge stopped her. "I know that you are eager to practice, but in a few days there may be a big fight. Don't practice." Too much fire, have to stay a little hard. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my own measure!" Androni mentioned the blue sky, silently passing by the wind butterfly, by the way The ear was heavily kissed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blush plunged on the cheeks of the wind butterfly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wind butterfly also Yingying station, if there is nothing, I go back to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Camp life is very hard, go to rest. In fact, you should not come here with me this time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly is not afraid of hard work. I want to follow you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the butterfly Like a beautiful face with a light smoke, Rogge sighed and reached out and stroked the ears of the butterfly. The wind butterfly closed his eyes slightly and enjoyed his touch quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly, you have not fallen in love with me, don't lie to yourself. You have to do this, it is totally different from what you want to do." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s voice is not big, but if the wind butterfly is struck by lightning, his face will be white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, if I am in danger with Rumsfeld, you can only save one. When you ask yourself to choose to save me, try again. Try the second road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly raised its head, and the clear eyes looked straight at Rogge, but I was not stupid. If you want to lie to me, please pay more attention. In our agreement, I did not say that my love for you must pass Rumsfeld. As long as I fall in love with you, this is enough. But I accept your advice, I will torture my heart in the most cruel way, whether it is really falling in love with you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an invisible pressure in the eyes of Wind Butterfly, which makes Roger subconsciously want to avoid it.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly slightly smiles, if you despise me, maybe you will regret it." After that, she kissed Rogge as if she was a little water, then turned out of the room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rogge had no thoughts and wind butterfly to play this game, he just nodded and meditated on the map of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge took out a crystal plate and thought about it. Write a word on it with a special pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring of the North, the afternoon is the warmest and most pleasant time of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Layton Palace, on the terrace of the main building, which is famous for its luxury and exquisiteness, is leaning against a beautiful figure of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikreel gently stroked the mirror, the mirror reflected her beautiful appearance, but her eyebrows were always Sadness that does not open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has told Ikerel through the mirror to briefly ask the current situation of the league, and informed her of her next plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try to stop Romon from fighting us and delay as much as possible." This is Rogge's request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Ikerel is very clear about the situation in the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a very intelligent elf. Although she hates politics and killing, she is always trying to learn political and military knowledge in order to play her role. In order to show her in front of her, the two sons of King Romon will always give her an analysis of the current situation, and they are prepared to develop a strong soil. These things have been heard much, and Ikerel has no more control over what he can learn. He quickly gained a clear grasp of the entire situation of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently stroked the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mirror is finely crafted and is decorated with gems of different colors. But because of the magical communication function, the true value of this mirror is much higher than the average jewelry. Ikerel even suspected that if he put himself in the slave market, the price of the sale would be worth the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the heart of King Romon, Ikerel is priceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But compared to the entire Layton Kingdom, is it a slap in the face? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes adults care too much about me! God knows where Romon is in his heart and puts me in a position. But this is a family. People's happiness! What should I do to get Romon to put down the sword pointing to the tribe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikrell looks at the city of the gods The direction, for a while, was a bit crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days spent in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is three days of innumerable undercurrents in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning three days later, the plains of the Plains of Kampaas were brighter than the past few days, but filled with low-pitched lead clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind suddenly rises, with a bitter chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astrofic’s camp was murdered, the soldiers had already been tidy, had eaten breakfast, and were waiting for orders in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the big Chinese army accounted for only three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the left is the blizzard magician Rockefeller who once passed the message with Rogge, the Duke of Duliak, who should have been in the central position, can only Sitting on the right. The Duke of Doliyak has passed fifty years. Although he is dressed neatly, his dim eyes and raised belly indicate that his life in recent years has been too comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the middle is a middle-aged man who looks very kind. If he is not wearing a magical silver armor decorated with an elegant blue pattern, he looks like a businessman more than a general. But the Duke of Dolyak’s attitude towards him was respectful and almost numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Dolyak pointed to the map and trained the adults. The coalition forces expected that the reinforcements they should arrive today would never come. They will present this fact in the afternoon. Now they have up to four days of food in the army, and we brought fifteen days of food. The 60,000 coalition has been completely finished. Of course, even if they have enough food, it is impossible to be the opponent of Master Pompey and Master Rockefeller. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolyak immediately said: "How is this possible! As long as I can follow Master Pompey, my private army will definitely be worth whatever it is. Please rest assured that I have mobilized every soldier I can find. After ten days, 50,000 people will arrive here and listen to your command. The other 50,000 newly recruited soldiers will attack Lieton in three days. Even if they are all dead, it doesn't matter. Anyway, there is a sword. Armor, soldiers can always get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pei smiled and said: "Very good! Dolly, everyone, everything you pay will be rewarded. The attack on Layton is important, which allows our little allies to support the end of the war, and his presence allows us to smoothly integrate the Holy Alliance into the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can rest assured that this thing! I will surely drag the 20,000 Leidens who want to attack us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Pompeii smiled and nodded, and said to Rockefeller: "Rockfield Master, is your magic ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockefeller closed his eyes and slowly said: "Three days have been very smooth. According to the current magic The degree of accumulation, by about 4 pm, the magic array will be full of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good! At that time, the coalition forces should have been aided and will never appear again." The exact news is the time when the military is in a state of sorrow. Let's attack at dusk and drive them to the Pancala Valley! Command the soldiers to dress up, and they have to succumb to them during this time, and now they don't need to act again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead cloud in the sky hangs even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the atmosphere in the coalition camp is as much as the clouds in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All senior generals are concentrated in the camp of the Allied Commander Charles, with a gloomy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already three o'clock in the afternoon, but the reinforcements and military needs scheduled to arrive in the early morning are still missing. Charles has sent more than a dozen reconnaissance cavalry, and now all the generals can do is wait for the results in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, this ghost weather is really uncomfortable, this season, is it going to snow again?" A full-faced general Cursing in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, his words made the atmosphere in the camp more depressing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles sat facelessly, but his fingers were subconsciously tapping the hilt, and getting faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the sudden hooves sounded outside the camp. A knight ran directly outside the big account and stopped in the long horse!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed by Charles, the first scout cavalry sent by Charles The camp, eagerly said: "Adult Charles, I boarded the highest hill in the south, but in the place where I saw it, there was no trace of any reinforcements!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What!" Charles yelled and stood up involuntarily!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general asked: "Have you seen any traces of fighting? Are there any Asropiks?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Charles slowly sat down, closed his eyes, and said: "Astrofic can't sneak up on the reinforcements from under our noses. If you can't see the reinforcements from the top of the southern hills." That is, there will be no more reinforcements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general still holds a little hope that it will not be the fall of Rogge adults? But..." He thought for himself, and the voice slowly lowered: "But the Wright Fortress is only a hundred and twenty kilometers away from here, more than two days! How should it be..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles opened his eyes and said slowly: "You, although I don't want to admit it, there will be no reinforcements coming." We... I’m afraid it has been sold by Rogge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dead in the camp.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles cheered up, we are not desperate! We There are only three days of food, so the time is very critical. We must immediately inform the Holy Alliance of the news of Rogge’s betrayal. Only by sending troops from the Allied direction to attack the Wright Fortress will we be saved. The Wright Fortress has been abandoned for a long time, Rogge The number of soldiers is large, but the vast majority are rookies that are useless. The army of the Layton Kingdom is only one day away from the Wright Fortress. They are fully capable of conquering the fortress within one day and arrive before we break the grain. Together we repel the Astrofic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles screamed: "Romon is old and confused, but he is still a hero, a real soldier! It is a matter of life and death, I believe he will make the right choice!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general is no longer making a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles continued: "The Astrofiks will definitely attack a lot these days. Our strength is at a disadvantage if the Astrofiks are not today. Attack, then we will withdraw into the Pancala Valley at night! The cavalry has little effect. If all the horses are killed, we can support it for a few more days!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...we have to withdraw, and the next few cities and countless villages have no one to protect. The Astrofiks once slaughtered the city."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles silence for a moment, said: "What we can do... only avenge them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a lot of shots The table takes the special green scorpion into the grid. You probably don't think we have a green scorpion that can fly directly to the hands of the king of Latvia. Also, tie the same letter of help to the four heads who will return to the fortress of Wright, and let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles looked around Bit, we are still not desperate! After intercepting our call for help, Rogge may have thought that his plot was not exposed! If you can be surprised, the Layton army will attack the Wright Fortress in half a day! We are now Just be prepared, and retreat when it is dark!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a faint horn in the distance, and the generals in the camp I felt the earth tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier rushed into the camp and hurriedly said: "Charles! The enemy attacked!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Charles looked gloomy, and he waved his hand and rushed to the watchtower with the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is a piece of white, a large piece of snow falls, the wind is whistling, and getting bigger and bigger. The biting cold wind caught the snow flakes and the ice, and the generals who stood on the lookout at the top of the head rushed to play, and they could barely open their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is still shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blizzard, the Asrofik soldiers came out one by one, and in a twinkling of an eye, a very strong lineup appeared in front of Charles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the center of the formation, a knight rushed to the front with a flag of the Duke of Doliya, decorated with olive branches and shields. But he immediately turned to the right and let the central position come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, next to the silver base, the blue triangle of the battle flag rises high in the Asrovic camp, holding the rider to the horse Before, Astrofic’s army suddenly sounded a shout!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles’ face was ugly, almost screaming: “How come... Even the Storm Masters have been dispatched! No wonder, there will be such a big snow today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other general whispered: "Is Rockefeller also coming? And we actually have civil strife at this time, it’s terrible!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astrofic’s central army suddenly separated from the left and right, a knight Like a thunder like a wind, flying high above his head, is a banner decorated with a cross gold trident!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astrofi The cheers of the soldiers were suddenly blasted!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind this fluttering battle flag, countless soldiers dressed in blue heavy armor rushed out like a frenzy !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an exclamation on the lookout!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poseidon!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God! It’s Pompei’s Poseidon Corps!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles’ deputy also said: “The Poseidon Corps Isn't it always at the gates of the abyss? How are they here?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
