			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is near spring, the land of the North is still a silver world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick lead-colored clouds often stretch over a thousand miles, and the over-sized snow still covers the endless plains, and the chilling winds that feel the whistling To a trace of warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this endless snowfield, only a few groups of snow deer and ice wolves are squatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is suddenly big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A looming shadow passed over the ground. The creatures on the snowfield instinctively raised their heads and looked up at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lead cloud, a little silver light is passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a surprisingly large creature, but it’s extremely fast and it’s flying too high. Looking up from the ground, you can only see the little ones. A little silver light. But even then, the animals that saw the silver light instinctively sensed the fear that could not be suppressed. Whether it was a wolf or a deer, they all clashed. Those who are weak and timid can only shake their feet in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver light flew day and night, passing through the virgin forests, countless rivers, ice fields and hills, and finally entered the endless central mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the mountains, the silver light seems to have sensed something, and its degree is getting faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the snow peak, the elders of Xiusi wore a light green robes, sprinkled with dust, but the body shape was very thin. He looked at the distant sky, and at the far end of the eye, it seemed that there was a flash of silver. He sighed and opened the old suitcase under his feet, took out a dull leather armor and slowly dressed it. He was slow-moving and completely dressed like an old dragon. He finally wore a set of leather armor. Xiusi pulled out one long and one short dragon blade from the scabbard behind the waist, and connected the knife to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade of the dragon blade grew longer and longer, and finally passed three meters and became a double-edged rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon gun swayed in the hands of Hughes, and there was a horrible scream, and then settled, as if it had never been moved. He gently stroked the dragon gun, his face was surprisingly serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes whispered, and the body began to appear looming green awns, this green is very light, almost transparent, but it is not scattered. The wind on his snow peaks and the wind is rolling up! In the blink of an eye, it turned into a dark tornado that went straight into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the tornado is getting darker and darker. Slowly, there is a flash of lightning that pops out of the tornado in the huge thunder. These lightnings are getting denser and denser, and occasionally they fall on the snowy peaks, and they will hit the ground with a big hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes stepped out of the tornado step by step, just like an invisible bridge in the air. His old leather is now lit up with countless tiny green magic symbols, a gray long flying in the cold wind, a cold face on his face, long ago there is no old smile on the weekdays . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon-gun’s blue brilliance was placed on the dragon’s gun, and the chill of the wind was scattered from the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little silver in the distant sky is getting brighter and brighter. In the twinkling of an eye, it flies to the front of Xius, a beautiful and elegant silver dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not huge, the 20-meter body is ordinary in the dragons. On its silver body, there are big groups from time to time. A faint spurt of gas. More than ten silver long horns stretched out from behind the neck. These silver horns are beautiful and slender, and look so delicate that people have the illusion that they can easily break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong quietly floated in the air, a pair of golden eyeballs looked up and down the Shusi, this humble elf who dared to stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon is open, its voice is very soft and sweet, very magnetic, much different from the ordinary dragon landslide tsunami-like dragon whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Nicholas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas said: "Yes. But this time I have to come out. These humble creatures have not tried the dragon flame of the silver dragon for too long, so that they dare to commit such a big crime. I will not They will kill the whole family and never return to the Dragon City! Elf, you are here waiting for me, what's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses sighs Russ, when you leave the Dragon City, if the Black Dragons take the opportunity to attack, the Silver Dragons may not be able to hold the Moonlight Dragon City! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas' golden pupil shrinks sharply, and its voice suddenly grows up: "Elves!" What is your name, why do you know the secrets of these dragons? The Black Dragons could not know that I had left the Moonlight Dragon City. It doesn't matter if they know it. Six hundred kilometers ahead is the place where Cris Ferrena was killed. I can't take revenge for her for two days! It’s time to go back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even I know that you left the Moonlight Dragon City. You said, can this news be a secret in the dragon world? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas stunned and immediately angered: "My child is still in the hands of those humble microbes, I must save it." If the Black Dragon Dare dares to attack the Moonlight Dragon City when I am away, then I will go to the Black Dragon King for a good theory. Elf, you are waiting here, there must be something, just say it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes asked: "Respected 'Silver Marvel', I want to ask, you mentioned your child, then do you know where it is?" ? Do you think that the murderers who killed your child and your wife will stay in the same place honestly? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas, a silver dragon family has its own way to catch the murderer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver The dragon couple can transfer the last scene before death to the lover by soul contact. Is this the way?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas was shocked, and it was alert: Elf, you know a lot of things, not as much as a lower creature. But I don't have much patience, tell me your purpose, are you blocking me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes sighed again, and the dragon gun was taken from behind, and his hands were flat: "Yes, I was asked by a friend, for the future of the Silver Dragon family, and the Moonlight Dragon City. Security, Nicholas, I won't let you go any further. You still go back to Moonlight Dragon City! I can tell you something that shouldn't be revealed. Black Dragon King should already be on his way to Moonlight Dragon City. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon reveals the expression of thinking, apparently weighing the stakes. But his eyes slammed slightly, staring at the dragon gun in the hands of Hughes, and his eyes were angry: "What is this? If I am not mistaken, this is a dragon gun! Elf, although you are the next Waiting for the strongman in the creature, and there are dragons and guns in hand, but do you want to stop me? As for the Black Dragon King... It wants to break through the Moonlight Dragon City, it is not so easy! When I rescued my child, I will calculate this account with it. Seeing that the elves and the silver dragon have been handed over for thousands of years, our source of strength comes from the power of the light. I will not kill you today. The gun is left, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and said: "Of course I am definitely not an opponent of silver miracle, but unfortunately I am proud of silver. The dragon is different, I still have a helper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space behind Nicholas is fluctuating, and the *** wearing the black demon is quietly appearing, with Xiusi Nicholas was sandwiched between the previous ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong looked at the ***, his eyes could no longer be separated from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very serious and serious: "The existence of the alien world, I saw contradictions in you, saw the struggle, and saw the harbinger of destruction! You It is a combination of life and death, a strange existence that wanders around the world. Do you want to stop me? How do you get entangled with those humble creatures? I don’t think they have any contract with enough power to Bind you and call you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***No answer, just ask: "Nicholas, who is your goal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas's eyes flashed in the blink of an eye, in front of it, like a sudden more mirror. In the mirror, Rogge, surrounded by seven magical light shields, bottomed up and flew slowly, and then the emotions in the mirror shook, all disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** is also silent, she rarely sighs Gulas, you go back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong finally got angry, his huge faucet from left to right, slowly swinging, first looked at ***, then looked at the repair Sri Lanka has been blocking me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overwhelming Longwei has been violent since Nicholas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly roared: "I am the silver miracle Nicholas! Are you both blocking me? Fight! Humble creatures, I have to look "You two can't leave today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Hughes called: "Master Nicholas, the person you saw is just the last hand. He is not the real murderer, nor is he the mastermind of Cris Ferrena. As far as I know, the elf and the Terran attacked the Silver Dragon. The main reason is to save an elf. We are blocking you. First, for the safety of Moonlight Dragon City, the other is also afraid that you will kill all the elves of that family. If I hand the elf to you, would you like to return to Moonlight Dragon City?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas's Longwei did not continue to improve, it whispered: "Who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** also slightly confused Looking at Xiusi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes face stunned, he reached for a circle, and the magic image in the circle showed a fairy girl lying on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out to be a butterfly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas slightly approached the magic mirror, sniffed a few times, and then roared in amazement: "Yes! She has Christie Fee Lenna's blood and bone taste! She used the blood of Kris Felena to wait for her body! I will let her pay the price she deserves for such a big crime, I will tear her apart little by little! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish," Hughes said: "This time tomorrow, I will bring her here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves, you are embarrassed, but I am not as stupid as you think!" Nicholas said coldly: "I will not only kill her, but also kill the last murderer! And I will not let go of this kind of elf! I don't care what you have, and no matter what conspiracy behind it, as long as all these humble creatures are killed, what kind of conspiracy will not work! Kris Felena is my wife, she must have enough funerary objects! All smashed her body The humble microbes are dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas did not move, but quietly turned around in the air, even Hughes could not see that it was What method is used to move in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You all retreat! I am in a hurry and don't want to waste time on you." Silver Dragon is cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes looked at the *** with a deep look, and *** nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes sighed again and shouted: "Old things! Come out, we promise you the conditions!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a snowy peak in the distance, a fierce murderous sky burst into the sky, a faint figure leaps into the air, then rushes to fly here, and in a twinkling of an eye, it comes to Yinlong Around, with Xiu Si, *** full of three, the silver dragon in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also an old leather armor, but at the moment the leather armor is lit up with a huge magic symbol. The fine thorns in his hand also flashed a faint white mist. It is a death class! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas looked at Hughes, looked at the ***, and looked at the Death Class, silent, but the momentum could not be enhanced! Numerous magical symbols flashing silver appear quietly on it, forming a number of silver bands of light, flying around its huge body, seemingly mysterious and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes said: "Master Nicholas, are you still willing to go back? You can now go with at most two of us. Or you can go back to the moonlight first. Dragon City, after the black dragon's attack is resolved, come and find a few companions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas roared: "I am a silver miracle! With you Are low-level creatures fighting, do you still need the help of the tribes? Prepare to fight, humble creatures! Although the three of you are powerful, you may not be able to defeat me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He suddenly screamed, and the large cloud of green clouds emerged from his body! The power of Hughes is soaring, it seems that there is no end! The momentary pressure caused the space around him to be distorted and deformed, and then collapsed, and a dark green space crack appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment between, a dark green sphere with a radius of tens of meters appeared around the Shusi, in addition to the figure of Xius in the ball of light, an empty piece, There is nothing, but the space in the ball of light reveals a strange dark green light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Field!" Nicholas screamed, his huge body could not help but tremble. "This is the field! Old things! Which servant is the Lord God? Or are you already a god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Hughes has completely changed. It has become indifferent and arrogant, and condescending, there is no emotion at all: "Humble silver dragon, your body is big, but it is not my field. How can you support me in my field? Your arrogance has already been destined for your demise. I will give you the last chance and return to Moonlight Dragon City immediately. As compensation, my servant and I will then pay attention to the Yinlong family. You will not have to fear the Black Dragon in the future. Intrusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas tried to keep calm, its arrogance and arrogance have all disappeared, but there is still unstoppable anger: "Why do you interfere with me?" Revenge? Why do you want to shelter those humble creatures? Can God do whatever they want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silence in the field for a moment, only faintly:" This is not what you can understand. Go back, or die, you choose a road. If you don't consider yourself, you should also consider the safety of Moonlight Dragon City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas suddenly and strangely Even if it is not your opponent, but God is not omnipotent. You want to stop my revenge, I am afraid it is not so easy. "Speaking, it suddenly grows a long sigh, and the sound is full of sound!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body of Yinlong is twisted, eagerly narrowed, and finally turned into A man. He is handsome and handsome, silver and silver eyebrows, only his eyes are shining with gold. His body is strong and beautiful, almost can be called perfect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hughes's face is like a stone sculpture, it seems to completely ignore the changes of Nicholas. The face of *** is hidden behind the mask, no change can be seen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Only the class is moving.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's breath in Nicholas has completely disappeared, and now floating in the air is a human.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver miracle laughs again, its face suddenly changes, it will become more beautiful, the ears will gradually grow longer, and the strong body will become slightly thinner. In a blink of an eye, Nicholas has become an authentic elf!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class sighed, hard He said: "The ultimate Transfiguration. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. God, although I am not your opponent, I am not willing to explore the characteristics and mysteries of your field, but if I want to escape, will you be able to catch up with me? Can you tell me from thousands of humans and elves? I am afraid it is not so easy to stop my revenge? Nicholas is cold and cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not easy, you don't know if you come to try it? "Hughes is cold and cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves of Nicholas's incarnation suddenly smiled and let me see your degree first!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, Nicholas's figure suddenly blurred, and in a blink of an eye, like a light smoke, dissipated in the wind. In the distance, the silver light flashed, and the trace of Nicholas was completely lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hius, class, and *** are still floating in the air, not moving, no one has to chase Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singular silence lasted for a while, or the class coughed and said: "The degree of Nicholas's transformation is amazing, even more than he is a silver dragon. The form is even faster. I can't catch up with him." He paused and looked at the smugly and said: "Why don't I want to be in the pursuit of Nicholas, I will be there again. Cut a note behind it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes looked at the Hughes, who had not yet dispersed in the field, and said: "Only you can catch up with Nicholas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ban also looked to Hughes, Slightly questioned: "You already have the power to seal the gods, but also have their own fields. Why do you watch Nicholas run away?" At this moment, the killer’s attitude is also very respectful. In this world, he has the power of the gods. It is an incredible thing. It is the death class that has entered the sanctuary for many years and never thought that one day someone will be able to seal God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden smile in the field, and the arrogance and indifference of the just-looking world suddenly disappeared and restored to the previous one. The high, but actually slippery Shuus. Cooperating with him, he still can't stop the faint, but unrivalled momentum, and he can't tell the weirdness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large, quaint ring on the left-handed tail of Xius’s tail suddenly illuminates a glare, and then slams into the strange eyes. The area around Xiusi has slowly disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body shape that Hughes had been swaying in the air suddenly fell down. He hurriedly sighed and screamed out, and the whole body was green and glory. This barely stabilized the crumbling body and floated again in the air. It’s just that this floating look is also very stubborn. In the high winds, the body of Xiusi swings to the left and seems to be blown to the ground at any time. Which class and *** are so calm and calm, can you stand still in the gale? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the class is very different, and the *** is obviously shocked by the changes in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said two..." Hughes shouted hard. "Can we go down first, then talk about it? The wind is too big, my old man." When you are old, your skills are limited and you can't support it for a long time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes seems to be really unable to support, not waiting for *** and class to answer, It swayed down to the nearest snow peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class and *** are falling on the snow peak with suspicion, but the two are still cautiously maintaining a certain distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under their gaze, Hughes took the initiative to say: "Good! You don't have to ask, my field is only once. I just had it." The magic ring can move once in the field, but it can only be used once. You have seen that the ring is completely broken. Without the ring, my old man can only keep up with one go. The power of the sanctuary, how can you talk to you in the middle of the air for a long time, I don’t know how to understand my old man. Oh, it’s not easy for me to scare Nicholas, let me chase He, isn't he going to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class and *** are completely speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the class said: "I didn't expect that there is such a thing in the world. But even if it can only be used once, it can create a ring in the field of God. It’s still far from the so-called artifacts. Why didn’t you just kill Nicholas when the field didn’t disappear? Isn’t that much simpler? Such a precious artifact is only used to scare Nicholas, it’s too wasteful. If you kill this silver dragon, you can barely say that it’s worth it? It’s a pity! Actually, you have to spend so much money, please come to me, tell you, don’t regret it, if it’s not for you. In good faith, I don’t want to... and hand!” He originally wanted to say that the madman’s gaze forced him back to his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes touched his beard and smiled and said: "It’s a pity! This ring is rare, but not precious. Just the field just looks Much like the realm of God, in fact, a special role is useless, just a look. If Nicholas really rushed over, it would be awful. Now scared him to scare, I think he will not dare to There is an idea of ​​fighting with us. Isn’t this much easier?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class asked again: “Elders of Shusi, with my message The channel doesn't know that Black Dragon King has already set off to attack Moonlight Dragon City. How do you know it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes mysteriously laughs at adults, you don't know this The news shows that your message channel is really effective! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Death Class immediately gloomy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the Black Dragon King should still be Enjoy the lava flame in the prison fire basin, huh, huh. "Shuss laughed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I just lied to Nicholas. Although he avenged his vengeance, but Yinlong loves the nature of the ethnic group, he can't care about the safety of the Moonlight Dragon City. So he will not find the murderer in a moment, he will definitely rush back. Moonlight Dragon City went to see it. This time, it was a lot of effort. We have seen Nicholas now, and we have an understanding of its strength, so we can arrange it with ease."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class nodded, thought for a moment, and said: "Since the Black Dragon King has not yet arrived in Moonlight Dragon City, then we will inform Nicholas of the news of the departure. I happen to have a news channel to pass this information to the Black Dragon family. Since the two covenant dragons have met, they have to play a game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Road: "This time can be calculated, it is best to let Nicholas go back and see, Moonlight Dragon City is safe and sound, but his forefoot leaves the Moonlight Dragon City, the Black Dragons will come to the back."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death class Road: "Good tricks! Without Nicholas, the strength of Moonlight Dragon City is very weak, it is likely to suffer heavy losses under the attack of Black Dragon. And Nicholas is not far away, Silver Dragons should have a way to inform it to rush back in time, let it again Turning back to the Black Dragons, a heavy blow. So the two dragons lost both sides, that is no better! The heavy loss of the Silver Dragon Moonlight Dragon City is weak after the defense, presumably Nicholas no longer dare to leave. Just in time to master the requirements very much High, let me think about it... I can't do it completely. After I plan to be careful, I must give this 'silver miracle' a little color to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes added: "After the black dragon attacked the Moonlight Dragon City, there must be several serious injuries. On the way back to the prison fire basin, there is a possibility that there will be a drop..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two eyes of the class are bright, very likely! A seriously injured black dragon is simply a moving treasure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes said: "Yes! The leather armor made of black dragon skin is completely no better than stainless steel. The whole body is poor, not to mention the magical protection..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death shift: "Light and not afraid of magic, it is indeed a good thing! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes said: "Black Dragon Leather is simply for our killers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The death class is excited to pick up the hand. This task is not so annoying. Maybe I should go to the Moonlight Dragon City to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;修Smiled: "A black dragon! You see, this is higher than the reward I gave you. If you don't have this task, you won't get such a good chance! When did our elves have ill friends? You should It was turned around near Moonlight Dragon City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death Class Shen Shen said: "But Black Dragon is not very good to deal with, even if it is a serious black dragon, I am afraid it will not be killed. It’s easy to think about it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: “The dragon is not a match, you may wish to bring more people. First find a place to ambush. Now, if the existing black dragon has lost the order, you will first smash it and then slap it into the ambush..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; Death class is a big heart, he sinks: "It makes sense. Black Dragon is proud of nature, certainly will not be willing to eat this loss, people who will certainly catch up can not bring too much ... Oh, to be careless If even a seriously injured black dragon can't cope, I also nicknamed the sanctuary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes finally said: "If there is no serious black dragon, then also Maybe the silver dragon that is seriously injured will appear in the vicinity of Moonlight Dragon City. In fact, it is the same..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death class thoughtfully, nodded The injured silver dragon that can find the order is also good. And in this way, Nicholas would not even dare to light away from the Moonlight Dragon City, and can successfully drag on for a month, this task is finished. It is not bad to be able to do this task. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the dragon gun in the hands of Hughes, and there was a rare radiance in his eyes. When you don’t talk, Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes, as a elder elder, how could you lie? Although the dragon gun is precious, it is also less important than the reputation of the elves for thousands of years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Class calmed down and immediately discussed with Xiuss how to kill the Silver Dragon or the Black Dragon.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
