			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book, the sixth day of salvation (five)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still in the early hours of the morning, sleeping The city of Lille was awakened by a thunderous horseshoe. The residents who were disturbed by the dreams and extremely dissatisfied opened the windows. Just wanted to drink a few screams, they suddenly found that if a blast hit the long street, it was a team of gold armor knights, and the waving flag, It is clearly the lion heart cross flag of Dagong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Bavarian Grand Duke who is fighting in the North Kingdom returning to the capital? Looking at the murderous look of these knights, there must be something big happening. No matter what, anyway, it will definitely not be a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents who wanted to drink a few times were scared on the spot and immediately closed the window firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the team, the knight who is always straight and straight, is indeed the lion heart of the Grand Rhein. Only at this moment, he did not return to the joy of all, and there was only a cold winter frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, the Grand Duke is already looking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong reached out to the Grand Palace, and the two riders immediately rushed out. The knight immediately exhaled, and picked up the heavy chain, and slammed it on the bronze door of the Grand Palace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar of the roar, the gate of the Grand Palace slowly fell inward, and it was destroyed by life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big public policy is like a horse, passing through the gates without stopping, going straight to the depths of the Grand Duke. The knights who followed him returned to the war horses outside the Grand Residence, and they were listed as neat teams. They did not say a word, but waited quietly. This silent squad is over, and there seems to be a terrible thunderstorm brewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the guards of the Grand Duke stayed on the spot for a while. I can't figure it out, what happened just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Catherine! Can you give me a persuasive explanation about the death of Krassu? Don't you know that he is the Lord of Heaven Blessed God of the Gods?!" The Grand Duke stepped into Catherine's study, and the face was full of frost, and the voice was filled with the chill. Anyone who knows him knows that at this moment Dagong has already murdered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine slowly stood up from the desk. Welcomed the eyes of Bavaria. In front of this raging lion, she was not afraid. It’s just cold and cold: “Because he is a god, I killed him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Grand Duke slowed down and stepped closer Catherine, his hand has subconsciously grasped the hilt, coldly: "Dear Catherine, I heard that during the time I was absent, you gave birth to a child. You have no lover." Even if I gave birth to a child too much, it is not a big deal. I don't care at all. But now things are obviously not as simple as I thought! Dear, I feel a different smell from you. Presumably you kill Krassu, is this child? Can you tell me who the child's father is, and where is this child now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine A faint smile. Dao: "Tell you nothing, anyway, you are doomed to be helpless. The father of the child is Rogge. As for this child, I have placed him in an absolute seal and pushed it into space. Going in the stream. So you don't have to bother to find this child to vent your anger. You must not find him. As for Rogge, I heard that he recently got the care of the main god Desmasen, you can take it now. How is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong vigorously holds the hilt tightly, and uses all the strength to force the sword sheath. He was afraid that if the sword was out of the sheath, he would not be able to control himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong took a deep breath and tried to calmly say: "I can tolerate these, but why do you want to kill Krassu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine said indifferently: "He is just a dog of the Lord of Heaven, killing it, and killing it, what's the big deal?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bang. The sharp edge of the sword finally popped out of the sheath. It was placed on the ice-like neck of Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong’s face is full of youthfulness, and he whispered: “Do you know what you have done?!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!..." The big public trembled, and the long sword in his hand trembled. At the junction of Jianfeng and Catherine's skin, a bright red blood line ran down slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this blood, Dagong finally calmed down, moved the sword forward, and then said: "It is glory to serve the Lord God! With my merits At the time of the heavens, I will become the supreme ruler of the entire plane after the pope! And, when the final judgment comes, I and you will be redeemed! Do you know what it means? It means immortality!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stared at the Grand Duke, sighing in a sigh of relief, saying: "Ruling a group of non-autonomous walking dead, really so accomplished Feeling? Dear, you have changed. When we met, you never said it, but I know that your dream is to unify the whole plane and expel everything that should not belong to this plane. Even if it is a high god in the land! But now? From what time, you are so valued for redemption? You are no longer yours, are those original dreams really forgotten?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;The Grand Duke has been silent for a long time, and said: "Catherine, I didn't know the power of the heavens at that time, and I didn't know the power of the Lord God. But I know now, so I know that no matter how hard we work, the end result will be It won't change. You think about it, is it worth it to give up an immortal opportunity for an unchangeable ending?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stares at the eyes of Dagong, slowly Shaking his head and slowly receding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said word by word: "I think it is worth it. I will not accept redemption by compassion and charity. I will not give up my thoughts. In salvation, I only know that the life of the Lord God is from. I don’t need many reasons to make such a decision. Just because I am proud, I am unique. I am Catherine! Even if the final result will not change. But I can still let the heavens Nothing is found in this plane, this is the way I live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hegong was shocked and immediately stepped forward and shouted: "Catherine, you want What are you doing? Don't be fooled!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he hasn’t waited for him to act, Catherine’s wrist has turned over, and there’s already a gleaming dagger in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiles lightly. With a wave of hand, the dagger broke the air at an incredible speed. Then she broke into her chest without any stagnation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened so quickly, Dagong only had time to go mad One! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, he couldn’t hold the sword in his hand anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to rush up, wants to hug Catherine, but somehow, his feet are as heavy as a thousand, no matter what step! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only watch. Looking at the blood flower in her chest, blooming, blooming, the bloody flower between the eyes opened the entire study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the room was silently condensed into a huge magical symbol, and quietly fell into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stood out, holding the dagger that had no handle, and slowly closed his eyes, with a smile on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning, her manners, her face. Her smiles are so beautiful, so perfect, not stained, not stained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, Catherine. Always the perfect embodiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the Bavarian Grand Duke is already decades old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The autumn wind gently swayed through the mountains of the Chichina Mountains, from the broad-leaved trees at the foot of the mountain to the snow-capped pines near the top of the mountain, all swaying in the wind. Together, Lin Tao’s pines are stepping up and it’s refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge walks through the mountains and enjoys the atmosphere of the mountains. He has not known how long it has been such a leisurely stroll, and now he has no time to rush, and there is nothing special to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked through the vast mountains of the Ketchi Mountains and enjoyed the mountain breeze. Listen to the insects and birds, and occasionally stop at the stream of the mountain stream. His figure is not very clear, and it has already appeared in kilometers between flashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was young, Rogge was still intoxicated between wine, woman and money, and when he grew up, he was immediately involved in the political vortex, and since then Struggling for survival. When he was in power, when he was on the side of Megatron, he would camp in the camp every day. Any decision would involve the lives and deaths of countless people, and he could have no time to appreciate the beauty around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, the fat man has become customary in the bones, when he would rather see the golden beauty, and will never appreciate the scenery of the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Rogge was standing in the foothills, staring at the quiet and solemn valley of the Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little stop, he jumped up from the top of the mountain, swept through the sky and landed in the Valley of the Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the floating temple still radiates a light and beautiful radiance, and every magic symbol has a genie who is meditating. Rogge stood on the edge of the valley, his eyes swept over the elves, thoughtfully. He already saw that the vitality of these elves was quickly lost, but even with his eyes at the moment, he could not see where the magical array was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Rogge doesn’t know, just a few days ago, the valley was still very prosperous, and the number of elves moving back and forth was much higher than it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One elf walks back and forth in an orderly manner, busy with his own business. They glanced at Rogge, who suddenly appeared in the valley, and then ignored it at all, just as he was originally a member of the Elven Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not care. He can see that the souls of these elves are holy and pure, and their entire body and mind have been invested in the grand magic ceremony that is being held. Among them, everything that is focused on the outside world is close to turning a blind eye and listening to it. Perhaps from another perspective, these elves are out of confidence. They are hospitable and gentle, but they are not afraid of confusion. In fact, there are many martial arts high-ranking warriors in the elves of the Elven Valley, and the great magicians are everywhere. Golems that shuttle back and forth in the valley are not just for moving things, they are also terrible opponents when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge knows that this is not the main reason why the elves are confident. The source of their confidence is now in a small building on the edge of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Elders of Hughes, it seems that you have not lived very well recently!" Rogge opened the door to the small building. Smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not so good, it’s awful!" Hughes smiled bitterly. His recent life is not very good, at least at this moment, the cup is only clear water. But for Rogge's sudden arrival, the old fox is not surprised at all. It seems that he has come to expect it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is still sitting on the table unceremoniously as before, holding the teacup in front of Xius. Just want to drink, suddenly found only clear water in the cup. Can not help but stunned. But even if it is clear water, he will drink it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes coughed and said: "The magical ritual outside is very expensive. I have limited savings. In order to complete this magical ritual, I have to save some. Tea is already unattainable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is a glimpse, and then can't help laughing. Road: "Elders of Xiusi, your magical ritual is indeed costly. I think it is impossible for the Asrofic Empire to collect so many rare materials, and it is impossible to have such a number of elves to contribute to its vitality. But This doesn't make you even drink tea? But then, I haven't figured out what the magic array is for now. It seems that it brings together the vitality of all the elves, it seems to be ready to break through. What obstacles are sent to a certain space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and said: "Rogue Master. You don't have to marry you now. The magic ritual was prepared to awaken the great Hilo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned: "But I feel that this magical array is not stable, that is, Your preparation does not seem to be very full."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed and said: "No way. I thought I could have at least a few hundred years. Prepare this magic array, but did not expect this plane to be so fast It caused the attention of the heavenly gods, so even though the material and the wizard wizard were not enough, I had to advance the ceremony. Now I can only do my best, as to whether I can succeed, oh..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
