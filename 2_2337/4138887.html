Every time during this harsh season, the sun will hide behind a thick lead cloud all day long, sipping the warm sun to the earth, and the cold atmosphere will easily pass through the tiles, felt, leather and Everything that keeps the cold invades people's bone marrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sea of ​​clouds, it is an endless mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory floating in the air can't stop searching below. In its eyes, there are no abnormalities in the mountains below, but I don't know why, it looks It just feels a little bit right. It does not know whether its own strength has improved, or whether it is a psychological effect. After all, the owner in front stopped here and was watching the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon suddenly changed into a posture, head and down, like a meteor swooping down a mountain, watching the castration, it is all about hitting the mountain Rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory was shocked, although it knew that the mountain was weak compared to the owner’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon disappeared into the mountain without a word, and disappeared. The peak of the desert was like nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory hardened his scalp, closed his eyes, and carefully fell to the mountain. Sure enough, it is reasonable to say that its four claws should have touched the field, but half a day has passed, it just keeps falling and what has not happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory quickly opened his eyes, only to find that the surrounding scene has been replaced by a vast expanse of black swamp! The previous mountain covered with vegetation has disappeared from the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique thorns of the swamps and the eastern branches of the mud trees are exposed on the surface of the Ze, like a skinny dying hand. Gregory is falling rapidly. Seeing that I had to rush into the mud of a large bubble, I suddenly heard a strong force on the tail! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in front of the sacred dragon is rapidly rolling. When it was difficult to suppress the vertigo, hovering in the air, it was discovered that he was already at an altitude of kilometers. The windy moon close to the swamp is left to the sky and still maintains a throwing posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dragon knows that his cockroaches have angered the master, and it immediately flies behind the wind and the most docile look. While quietly looking at the black marsh that suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This swamp is very vast and looks like it has a long history. A few islands are scattered among them, and there are dense forests on the island. A close look at the endless black mud reveals that it is not as calm as the surface, and the heavy black masks its very slow flow and undulations, as if the huge beasts are breathing in their sleep. Occasionally, a large bubble blasts from the depths of the black mud, expelling a large group of rich death scent, making people wonder if there will be any creatures emerging from the bottom of the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long ago, Gregory, a skull dragon, was very familiar with this environment. Here is the heaven of the dead, the paradise of the dead, and the breath of all life will be rejected by the dark death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the swamp, there is an imposing and undead castle. The bones and rot are used as pillars, and the undead and black fog are carved and floated on the mud. The most magnificent tall building in the castle seems to have been built by the bones of an unknown behemoth. The skull of the behemoth, which is more than ten meters in size, looks up to the sky, and the huge mouth of the giant mouth will always spurt a large group of thick black. fog. The fog condenses and does not scatter, and slowly rises to the sky. Mix into the dark gray clouds that never scatter in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory understands why it was ugly. This undead castle is constantly creating hypocritical fog, covering everything in the sacred marsh. The undead that built the phantom minaret and the fog that started the hypocrisy must be a big corpse witch, even a lich who is not weak in magic, because the fog of hypocrisy floating in the sky is very brilliant, and it can smash the eyes of the sacred dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking away, the walls and buildings of the Undead Castle are covered with large and small undead. Under the command of the corpse and the ghost, they are busy building a fortified castle. On the marshes around the castle, more than a dozen of the dead soul marsh monsters are moving back and forth. Their translucent body is wrapped in a piece of rot, and the rot is spit out on the edge of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bottomless black marsh, it is not known how many undead creatures are hidden. Just within a kilometer around the windy month, no undead creature dares to take the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon snorted coldly, one hand, and the slashing sword. Slowly drifting to the Undead Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is very confused about the master’s fighting stance. The owner has stood at the top of all undead creatures before he reached the world. Now, no matter what is hiding in the Undead Castle, don't say you want to use your master. The pressure generated by the master's strength alone is enough to crush the castle in front of you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dealing with these lower undead creatures, how can they still use the master? Gregory thought about it. It is now a sacred dragon, even if the strength is still similar to that of the bone dragon, but the suppression of the undead in the property can be much greater. Gregory has always followed his master, and he has dealt with very powerful existences. There are not many opportunities for such bullying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Gregory’s heart tickles and is eager to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it knows that the owner never does boring things. Thinking of this, Gregory immediately sang the magic of the dragon language, and blessed himself with the true vision he had just learned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final disguise of the Undead Castle finally appeared in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory suddenly took a breath, because it saw three very familiar and powerful atmospheres from the Undead Castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the breath of the king! How can the kings of the three dead worlds appear here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! Wait a minute! Don’t be a king in the undead castle? You...be careful! Although they can’t work with you at all Compared to strength, but they can have three! These sleazy guys will surely catch up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind faintly sighed, still not in a hurry Going forward. Gregory looked at her back. Suddenly, the back of the back was a numb, and there was no trepidation. In the back of Naina, I do not know what terrible power is there, and at this moment, these forces are being released one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swamp in the radius of the circle suddenly boils, and countless undead creatures gather like layers of moths, and one after another, the mud is swallowing. The various undead that were lurking in the deepest part of the mud have emerged from the mud, such as the beach after the tide. The wave is back! They are quietly piled together, posing the absolute position of the slain, but no one is afraid to approach the windy month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has stepped down, slightly raising the black hair, the silver scorpion jade, watching the death castle standing on the road ahead, the time is still, everything Looking up at this eternal dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She goes on. There is a long, colorful fireworks behind them, as if the queen is shaking hands. That is the smouldering smoke left by her too powerful power to tear the space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the smoke dissipates, the black marsh mud has become a hard field. A wide boulevard stretches out in the mud, one directly on the gates of the Undead Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious and majestic dragon screams behind her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, when the dragon screams, her body has a faint radiance! She danced to death knife and felt that this horrible weapon was a little more flexible than usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon's Blessing is one of the few magical spells in the Dragon language that can be blessed to creatures other than the Dragon. It can slightly increase the speed and strength of the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory, you finally got a little bit of use." Fengyue rarely praised the sacred dragon. Although her tone is still cold and cold, the great vanity, joy and unprecedented sense of accomplishment have made Gregory almost faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dragon in the sky makes up his mind, in any case, it must first study the auxiliary magic in the dragon magic, no matter how much they look difficult! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inferior creatures in the Undead Castle suddenly felt something at the same time. They immediately dropped the tools in their hands, such as the tide to the other side of the undead castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snoring, the door of the Undead Castle, which is ten meters high, slowly opens, and the three kings step out of it. Centered is the Lich Elgra, the Black Warrior Emperor and the Bone Emperor. Their demeanor is still solemn, but there are some flaws that cannot be concealed. In the eyes of the strong. The world is very small. Although the world is richer than the abandoned land, I don’t know how many times. However, since the world is in the same place, the kings must have to face the wind and the moon one day in the morning and evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they didn’t even think about it. This day will come so fast. The three kings were counted in their hearts, and they were so easily found by Fengyue, mostly because of the demon lotus leaf that the black warrior emperor refused to return. Although the Lich Elgra has used all the methods he can think of to seal the atmosphere of the demon, but the concept of foolproof is only meaningful within his ability. Judging from today's results, Fengyue must have a method that the kings cannot understand to sense the existence of the demon lotus leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just fighting together for so long, Elgar and Bone Emperor did not blame the Black Warrior Emperor, they knew that the Black Warrior Emperor must have his own reasons, although he Not willing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Fengyue looked at the three kings with some doubts. Is this still the king in her memory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory in the sky can't believe his eyes, it flies closer without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the three kings has been restored, the majesty is as it was, but... their appearance is not commensurate with their identity and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy moon has already seen that only the lich Liergra’s hand holds the staff in the first encounter, which can be called The lost sigh of the artifact. In addition, the three kings together, even a magical equipment that looks a little bit past! The locks on the bones of the bones have been slightly strengthened with magic, and the black warrior emperor? The black iron sword in his hand, the body armor draped in his body, is only thick enough and heavy, and there is no magic effect at all. This kind of low-grade goods is not even as standard as a heavy infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too shabby! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory finally found the right terrain adjective. It really can't be understood, how can the kings become poor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the three kings still have equipment in the abandoned land, they may be able to fight with the wind. But now, in the face of the three kings who are almost naked, Fengyue does not even need to use the demon and the death sickle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Fengyue, you are finally here." Elgara sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you come to this world?" Fengyue did not leave the three kings with a little bit of affection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings face each other. In the end, the bone emperor opened his mouth with difficulty: "Respect for the windy month, I have to admit. We did not abide by the promise of the day..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it turned out to be So, then, respect the kings, are you not keeping your promises at the moment?" Feng Yue asked faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon slowly mentioned the death sickle and said: "Let's do it, as compensation for me, we will fight again. I will be one-on-three. If you still lose Now, I will join my army from now on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings are really embarrassed this time. Recall that at the beginning, a few years ago, Fengyue had just become the eighth king of the world of death. However, a few years later, she had to present a duel to them on the condition of one enemy three! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few years, in the long life of the kings who have been running for thousands of years, it’s just a rush! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the three kings are almost completely out of gear. The strength is therefore greatly damaged, but if the three enemies can not win the wind, then the army that joined the wind month is not a shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the kings simply cannot measure the power of the wind and the moon. After all, they are still not familiar with the world, and they cannot fully grasp the use of death power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Elger and Bone Emperor are still weighing the considerations. The Emperor of the Black Warrior stepped forward and said: "I refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor of the Black Warrior firmly said: "The honorable wind, the dignity of the king is not tolerated. Your power overpowers me, but you cannot override my dignity. I will never join your army. If the duel fails, I will Choose to destroy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the cold are cold and authentic: "The destruction of your land cannot constitute compensation for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; She has some anger in her silver eyes, and the strength of the endless climb in the body not only distorts the surrounding space, but also forms a shimmering shroud. And there is always the power of spilling out. Occasionally, a glimpse of the overflowing force on the black warrior's armor, will leave a long cut on the dark black heavy armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the windy moon in anger. In the face of the coming storm, there is no trace of sorrow in the eyes of the Black Warrior Emperor. He raised his great sword in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even Gregory knows, don’t say that this black iron sword can be seen everywhere, that is, the black warrior’s own unprotected body, It is possible to be smashed by the protective field of the seven-color brilliance and the twisted space by the wind and the moon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aergra sighed heavily and said: "There has been too much war between the kings. Why do we struggle from the world of death to this world? We are convinced that you are overwhelmingly powerful and believe that you should be compensated. But it is hard to accept that you are permanently joined to your army. Can I ask if you need our strength to come here? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind was silent for a while and finally said: "Yes, I need the strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Bao Huangdao: "Respected Fengyue, you feel the difficulties with your strength, I am afraid we are also very difficult to give you much help. However, we can temporarily join your army as a compensation, What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, thirty days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings Spiritual fluctuations have been discussed for a while, saying: "Agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue looked at the Undead Castle The tone is softer and asks: "Respected kings, what about your powerful equipment? The fire of wisdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aergar sighed: " The great fire of wisdom comes at the cost of annihilation, and we are able to successfully come to this world. All our equipment, except this staff, is broken down into primitive magic to support the continuation of time and space drift." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the eyebrows are slightly wrinkled, saying: "Do you have something that can trigger the group to teleport..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same was broken down..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind sighed and said: "It turns out to be like this. Then, respected Elgar, you Would you like to explain to me the mystery of the Dark Dragon Altar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aelgra hesitated and finally said: "Although the Dark Dragon Altar has been destroyed, I am very I am willing to share with you the mystery of the magical array on the altar and use it as part of your compensation. The magic array is very complicated, and the explanation needs one. Time, you can just take a look at our simple castle. As for it..." The lich looked at the sacred dragon in the sky and said: "My servants can't bear the sacred breath of it, so, still Please wait for this servant outside the castle! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy nodded and followed the three kings into the Undead Castle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geli Of course, Gao Li does not dare to oppose the decision of Fengyue. It looks around, within the scope of vision, except for the rot, is the mud, can not see half of the living creatures or undead.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before the wind and the anger, the power was increased, and as a result, the supreme majesty forced all the undead creatures in the mud to the swamp. At this moment she converges the power, and these undead who never know what the fear is immediately Acting instinctively, desperately hiding in the bottom of the marsh.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory sighed and lowered his head. The most unbearable thing is loneliness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 500-kilometer Lake Logar is the largest inland lake in the North, where several famous rivers meet, so Lake Logar is also known as the Pearl of the Empire. Around this beautiful and fertile lake, I don’t know how many beautiful legends have been produced.<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
