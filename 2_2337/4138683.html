			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a meteor, Rogge pierced a thick, wet, lead-gray cloud, drawing a beautiful arc in the air, towards a small The mountain peaks are swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the peak is waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I have waited for countless years, as if she had been born from the heavens, she waited there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instant of the lightning fire, Rogge passed through the heavy fog and flew to the mountain, slowly falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Rogge felt like a dazzling look and saw a long flying figure, but when he stopped in front of the ***, it was She hasn't changed much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue now exists in a spiritual body, naturally can’t talk about anything’s self-deprecating smile, just ready to fly into the same world as before. In the core of ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An invisible energy hood suddenly formed on the body, and Rogge bounced back like a head hitting the wall. He only felt that the whole world was spinning and it took only half a day to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Reaching out, Rogge looked in the direction of her fingers, only to see three zombie lords with more than twenty zombie fighters standing far away. He smiled confidently, and this undead is still not coming. When the first mental impact hit the front, Rogge suddenly had some doubts. The attitude of these undead creatures is not so much a challenge, but what is it? correct! It is respectful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the horror in amazement, and these undead creatures are respectful to ***? ! Did she actually start to gang up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** At the fingertips, a zombie warrior came out and came to the front of the ***. *** Right hand to explore, easy to ** its chest, holding the energy core. The zombie warrior is as hard as a hardwood body. *** A hand slams in the mouth, and the zombie warrior burst into a corpse. Numerous golden energy lines stretched out from the skull of the ***, into the energy core of the zombie warrior, and then burst into numerous thin lines from the energy core, entwining every corpse on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entangled corpse quickly ignited the pale flame and was quickly burned out, leaving only the essence to be attached to the end of the spiritual line. ***Hands are collected, countless spirits are collected in the same tide, and a golden liquid of water droplet size is formed at her fingertips. The drop of liquid immediately melted into the fingertips of the *** and merged with the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead have no emotions of fear, joy, or surprise, and they have only obedience to their masters. Although the *** destroyed and absorbed a zombie, the other zombies were still quietly standing aside, waiting for the next order of ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple fog that represents the spirit of Rogge is rapidly surging: "Can mental power be used like this?! This is not to say, I can also be in this world." Do you have a body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mysterious new world unfolds in front of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple fog rolled up, a few fogs came out and searched along the ground, and a mist gradually infiltrated into the ground. Under the influence of fog, from time to time, one or two bones, stones or dead trunks will suddenly jump and then fall. Slowly, the operation of the fog began to become proficient. From time to time, new and finer mists were separated, and various objects on the ground were more and more frequent, and the amplitude was also increasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Holding a sickle, waiting quietly. She has been waiting for so long, don't care to wait a little longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little peaks can be called a group of magical dances at this moment! Numerous bones and all sorts of strange things are flying in the air, and the ground is constantly tumbling, as if hundreds of groundhogs are madly excavating underground. There are already hundreds of fine purple thin lines that extend from Rogge's spiritual body, constantly touching, exploring, and manipulating every contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, a hoe was condensed in the air, and the spirit body of Rogge was inhaled like a sponge, and the two purple fires were then lit in the eyelids of the hoe. Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is really new to his new body and is very dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hesitating for a moment, Rogge resolutely gave up the gimmick and once again tried to organize a body for himself. After countless attempts, he finally got his way out of the "Death Call" spell, and he summoned himself as a body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** led Rogge to a pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water in the outer boundary is a muddy, turbid gray syrup. The water in this pool is unexpectedly clear, although it is only a small two-foot square. More than a foot deep, but it seems to be incompatible with the surrounding environment. Rogge clearly sensed that a powerful force is protecting this clear water from the death force. This power is very familiar and should come from ***. He is a little confused. What is special about this ordinary water? Is it so painstaking to protect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge leaned over the water, and a fairly complete cockroach reflected in the water. Rogge smiled a bit, and now he should be the evil example of the Necromancer - the corpse. However, Rogge will open up his own solution. *** can constantly transform his body in the opposite world. As a master, he should be able to do it right. In the future, it will not be difficult to become a tall and handsome Master. In fact, he knew very well that he could not do what he could do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge spent some time adjusting to his new form of existence, and even successfully cast a curse! But just as fear does not work for undead, Rogge can't think of curses, diseases, and other helper spells that can be used in this world where there are almost no dead creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a powerful call from the ontological world, Rogge doesn’t know how long to explore in this new field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This call is tyrannical, overbearing, powerless, and extremely precise in locking his spirit. Rogge smiled a bit, but who can do this besides the devil of Elysses? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissipated. Not to say hello to ***, Rogge’s spiritual body was recalled to the original world by Elysses. While constantly flying high, I saw the body of the *** standing still, and Rogge suddenly had a thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's individual..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was immediately teased by his absurd thoughts, what about the Master and his pet? Although, although the *** seems to be a bit special, it is still only a mage pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, Rogge suddenly felt that he could not smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Elysses wandered in space, Rogge exhausted his efforts to maintain contact with her. When she wanted to find Rogge, this summoning was like a barbarian warrior to mention a chicken like a relaxed. This is the absolute gap between the understanding of space and the magic. This is now a blow to Rogge, but fortunately he has been following Ophroque and Elysses for a long time, and his face and nerves are extremely tough. This kind of blow is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a stun, Rogge returned to his own world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod and Elysses sat at the station and looked at him with concern. It was only a sigh of relief that Roger’s eyes turned into a clear one. The powerful magical fluctuations of Elysses gradually dissipated, and the black flames that were as solid as the past were sucked back into the body. The "Outside Call" that has just been cast seems to be a big burden on Elysses, and a few thin sweat beads are hanging on her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already at dusk, and the evening glow is gently scattered through the blinds, and it’s also golden in the face of Elysses. A few thin sweat beads shine golden glory under the eve of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has never seen Elysses so clearly. The black flame that used to burn all the time always makes her squat, like a layer of fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisis snorted and pulled Rogge’s soul back. "You are really timid! You have thought that you are a big magician after experiencing a little out of bounds space? Do you know how many different spaces exist and how many alien creatures you have not seen before? Drop your spiritual body? With your poor magic, which space magic can you move back? At first I thought you were just practicing some magic that locked your opponent's soul. I didn't expect you to transfer the entire spiritual body. Going to the different space!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Eni, since Rogge is all right, you can spare him once." Orpheek said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then said to Rogge: "You haven’t appeared in two days, so everyone is very anxious. Kate first showed you here, but you Always unconscious. If he can't solve it, he will come to us. Enni concludes your spiritual body. In other words, your soul has been released to the outside world, so the magic of 'outside call' is displayed. This only caught you back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and suddenly remembered something and asked: "'Outside Call"? This magic ...but it seems to be used to summon strange monsters? And I don’t know what is called beforehand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elysses嗤 'A smile of magic is originally used to summon the alien monsters, slightly changed, used to summon you is appropriate. Besides, what do I want to summon, and what must be slammed out, how can there be room for the summoning beast to choose? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was awkward and asked: "I have been in the opposite world for two days?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long do you think you stayed?" Elysses asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offik stared at Rogge for a moment, his eyes were as good as it was, and he saw Rogeri inside and outside.透透.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you have gained a lot during this time. The magic actually has progress, huh, huh, not bad. This "Parallel Space and Elementary Space Magic" is the handwriting of Cleveland, the Great Magi, 400 years ago, and is now my father's collection. Both I and Eni feel that this book is more suitable for your current situation, so by the way, you have to take care. Not counting the magic inside, the handwriting of the Great Magi is already very valuable! He smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence is in the middle of Rogge. With a born businessman like a fat man, how can you not know the handwriting of the great magician four hundred years ago? What is the value? Although he does not know who this Cleveland is, Rogge has taken two steps forward, shaking his hands and taking over this long-established sheepskin book, and his mood is stirring.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was easy to send away Ophrod and the Kate and others who came with him. Rogge couldn’t wait to come to the quiet room and start to meditate. He closed his mind and slowly sneaked into the spirit. In the body, experience and manipulate the magic around you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of magical energy in the air began to gather around Rogge, around He flew up. The red is the flame, the blue is the frost, the gray is the death energy, and there are many magical energy that Roggue can't distinguish, which together form a magnificent band of light. This band cannot be used. The naked eye can only be sensed by the spirit. The light can bring a small amount of magic energy. From time to time, he flew into Rogge, and he circled in his spiritual body and flew out. A little magical energy stayed in Rogge's body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the early morning, Rogge finally ended his meditation. He stood in front of the window and his body was full of magic. He is already a nine-level magician. Although he is not powerful, he is already a character that cannot be ignored at will! From the eight-level magician to the nine-level magician, he only used a few months, which is not surprising, but in the magical talent of Rogge, it is already dreaming. The progress has been made.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible fight with the fog and anger, let Rogge realize the skill of observing the world with spiritual power, and even make him Inadvertently seeing the power source that makes the whole world run. This makes him see his goal clearly for the first time, and knows where the power of his pursuit is. Whether it is vindictiveness or magic, it will ultimately be attributed to the origin of strength. The source of power is still the range that Rog can't understand, he just When I got there, I knew that it was my direction, but I didn't know what it was.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, knowing where the target is, you can choose a relatively correct road. Most of the time, power does not depend on the fact that one can run faster on the road than others, but on the moment when the road is chosen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with vindictiveness, the magic is closer to the origin of strength. Therefore, although Rogge is endless and has the unique talent to become a warrior, he still chooses to put all his time into the magic and spiritual power. Do not practice vindictiveness, nor study combat skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodriguez’s pre-deal teachings shattered the rules and regulations that existed in his mind so that he could step out in the process of reaching the goal. Your own way. This greatest necromancer has unparalleled wisdom. He knows that rules are the shortcut to all wisdom, but it is also the cage that binds wisdom the most. Rodriguez knows that while he has gained the wisdom and power, the rules of this world have been imprinted in the depths of his soul. He has been unable to jump out of this rule, but Rogge is different. He has just jumped on the pursuit of strength, he has enough potential, but has not been branded too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodriguez is looking forward to the day when Rogge can break through, instead of being a worm forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual connection with Elysses gave Rogge the first experience of the existence of a different space. The existence of *** also made his first experience of jumping into a different space with a soul not becoming a disaster. The unique experience of the incarnation of the corpse in the opposite world makes his grasp of the death energy more precise, and directly stimulates his magical growth based on death energy, and finally can go further in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-level magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge can’t stop the excitement in his heart, which means that he is no longer a small character that can be ignored! Although hidden in the dark, hurting people behind him is always his first choice, but with a powerful force, how broad the world will become! Think about it, with its precise magical control, the Nine-Level Master means that each scorpion can have at least four sword spiders to summon, as well as countless magic missiles, six or seven fireballs, fear, disease ,Etc., etc. These spells are enough to destroy a knight squad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is a little dizzy, but the harvest does not stop there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalls the crazy scene in the ‘Night Return’ hotel, especially the experience of pinching the spine. He tried to lift his mental power to the highest and then gathered on his right index finger. After a while, his whole fingers were hot. Rogge looked at his hand and his index finger had grown an inch. The nails turned into a sharp blade shape, and the thin flesh scales formed on the fingers, and the lavender metallic light shone in the sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger pointed out that the hardwood table in front of him was as easy as inserting a piece of freshly baked bread. Rogge smiled with satisfaction, and picked up an ordinary long sword, and used a demonic finger to play the blade, and there was a metal crash. Of course, this sword has no special features. He can't be stupid enough to use the weapon of the gods, such as the Tomahawk ‘Bound Soul’ to test the strength of his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put a shiny metal finger on his face and looked at it carefully before he said to himself: "This should be one of the powers of the Mozu. According to the records in the book, this must be. But who knows, maybe the guy who wrote the book himself has not seen the higher Mozu! Maybe you should grab the Mozu to ask, oh. Jingo..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned a few laps in the room and said: "This Jingo seems to look very ruined, and immediately It’s okay to do some business together.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has now calmed down from the initial excitement, although magic growth is a good thing, but it’s far Not all of the strength. There are countless things waiting for him to do it. The date of the appointment of slaves is coming, but a lot of preparations have not been completed. This time, the slaves have their own strengths to come out, but it is really uncomfortable to keep a dragon behind them. Just like a thorn in the flesh. However, after the dragon was injured, it immediately became a hamster. I didn't know where to dig a hole to hide myself. Such despicable and shameless enemies have always been the object that Rogge hates most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I went to the Ron bus to catch slaves, and the momentum was quite huge. It is not a small problem to enter the Ron Principality in the name of hundreds of armed men. There is no way in front of Rogge. He can only hope that both Stanic and Jinge will be able to find a perfect way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offico is a paladin, and the magical power of Elysses is also frightening. But only these two backers are always too thin. Moreover, the strength of the other side is not necessarily worse. Once the conflict arises, the first thing that is unfortunate is always these small scorpions. Rogge thought hard and searched all the forces one by one, suddenly his eyes lit up, the bright church! The brothers recently had a very good mix with the lord of Gennad Hart, and it was the opportunity to ask him to introduce himself to the Archbishop of Burke! If you take the church line, no matter who you are, you have to think about it before you want to move yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Rogge could not help but deeply regret that he did not invest early in the church. Although the Necromancer is a bit funny to join the Bright Church, but in the principle of having milk is a mother, Rogge can't take care of that much. Where are the positions and principles important to small lives? Then again, Orpheek is also the person of the Church of Light, and the Bavarian Principality is the only religious zone in the Rhine Union. If you do this yourself, you can’t be betrayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the dead Necromancer Rodriguez, Rogge can't help but feel awkward. However, this whisper disappeared, and he confidently thought: "You taught me to ignore the rules of all the world. Can this necromancer not be a member of the light church? Is it a rule? In the church, the new world of holy spirits created by the Necromancer is a little troublesome. It doesn't matter. If you can't bear it, Laozi seems to be able to use a mental power to make a small shield and keep the holy water out, just like the miracle. ***, how do I forget such a good way! This shield should be well practiced, not too thick, half a centimeter; still lasting, and can change with my body shape... seems to be very difficult? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
