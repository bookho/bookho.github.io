			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rolling team is all the way west. After four days, it is already 200 kilometers away from Lille. The ground began to become rugged, and the distant mountains were faintly visible, and the human smoke became increasingly scarce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has already begun to approach the borders of the Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the caravan came out of the city of Lille, a variety of magical creatures around the caravan, can not stop to snoop. However, Flora is not as easy to speak as Rogge. From time to time, the crows and sparrows fell from the tree inexplicably. A few hamsters and a few snakes rushed out of the soil and jumped a few feet high. When they fell to the ground, they all had belly and they were dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the next day, there are no magic creatures around to dare to snoop. When the team passed through the forest area, a slender but very flexible deer suddenly rushed from the forest to the team. It just ran a few steps on the grass outside the forest, and the blue fire spurted out of its body, and then ran a few steps and turned into a fire deer. The little deer screamed, his forehead burst open, and a huge eye burst out. Under the burning of the flame, the sorrow of the deer quickly ceased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Fire is extremely overbearing, burning the deer body without mercy. After the flame was extinguished, only a black deer was left on the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the team, Kate and Roger were slowly drifting through the grass to form a deer shape. Kate lowered his voice and asked Rogge: "You said, this deer is also a spy of the Mozu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also lowered his voice and said: "If I just saw it right. This deer should be the Warcraft three-eye foggy deer. It has very good eyesight and hearing. There are very few creatures in the forest to catch up with it. If necessary, it can also emit a irritating fog. Covering yourself to escape. It is a very good and very rare spy. The book says that even in the devil world, this deer is not a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Twelve magical creature spies died inexplicably. Today, this deer is counted, and only five are killed. But these five seem to be very advanced spies. You said that it was all her. Dry?” Kate mentioned, the voice was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge almost reached Kate’s ear, and whispered, “Who is there besides her? But this can’t be with Rums The big mouth said. If the annoyed her, we have no good fruit to eat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate looks at the forest on both sides of the road, only dare to use the corner of the eye The light glanced at the ten gorgeous carriages in the fleet and nodded very slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kate, her ten drivers, how many of you can you deal with?" Rogge asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a formal duel, I will win if I come up; if I come to two, I will lose. Of course, if you do not limit the rules, you will not be able to say anything." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and stopped talking. The two men lined up side by side, as the team slowly went west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the three-eyed misty deer was burnt into fly ash, the various demon creatures finally disappeared around the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are always a variety of creatures inexplicably squatting around the team, but the Clark Chamber of Commerce’s folks have experienced great winds and waves, it’s no stranger. It is. The fifty gold lion knights turned a blind eye, only the ordinary crow mice died; and the three hundred ‘dragon and beauty’ knights were panicked, but these desperate people were also old fritters. No matter who does it, in general, it is not that they have offended. Since Rogge is nothing, they will be invisible. But thinking of the horror of *** and Rogge's weekdays, many people in private have already set the target of doubt on Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the fat man’s life in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day of the team's departure, the Mozu spies disappeared, but the probes on both sides of the team changed into some ragged thieves. Seeing the large-scale escort team, these unskilled little bandits naturally dare not make any mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and others know the power and horror of Froya, and the subconscious always wants to stay away from her as far as possible. Only Rens was completely fascinated by the beauty of Froya, thinking about ways to get closer. If it weren't for Froya's entourage and the coachman, it wouldn't seem to be a good one. Maybe one night, Lens would get into Froya's carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since leaving the Sallesburg, several nobles have not had time to come back here. Fortunately, when a few people walked, they have already laid a good foundation, and everything is basically on the right track. In the past six months, various instructions have been given to Sellers. Every month, a detailed report on the territory was sent to several nobles. But when the outline of the Sallesburg was far from being revealed, several nobles could not restrain the excitement in their hearts, leaving the team and heading ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin peeped his head out of the carriage and looked at the backs of several aristocratic youths and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria also picked up the curtain of the window and glanced out, and told the driver: "Come up and see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged driver has a reins in his hand, six purebred Orleans, the horse-drawn princess’s carriage has been out of the team, chasing down the road with no less than a few noble youths. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge and others have already passed the afternoon when they arrive in Sellersburg. After more than half a year of construction, Sallesburg is not the same as that of the year. The castle has been completely refurbished except that a collapsed watchtower has not been repaired. Most of the windows in the main building of the castle have been fitted with blinds, and a banner of "Dragon and Beauty" flutters on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two new rows of wooden houses built on the main building of the castle. The early arrival of Robsky is assisting Doyle to direct the thieves to drill in the middle of the square. After two months of rigorous training, the original 300 thieves were only eliminated by Dow by more than a dozen. This made Robinsky very proud of his own knowledge. After all, these thieves are their own old men, and they are selected by themselves. It is now proven that, in terms of quality, the thieves that they have chosen are no worse than the elite units of the first-class mercenary group. In two months, Doyle added more than 30 mountain people to come in. It won't take long for these thieves and barbarians to become the main force of Rogge's Guardian Holy Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the castle is home to two large smelting workshops, and eight towering chimneys are spurting thick black smoke. The fine iron ore and coal of a car are transported into the belly of these two giant monsters, and the hot molten steel spits out from the mouth of the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smelting workshop is next to a simple warehouse with tarpaulin, and the blue-gloss ingots are neatly placed. The two guards were on the edge of the warehouse, quite lazy. It is no wonder that in this poor place, who will steal these steel ingots? Just want to steal, 50 kilograms of a steel ingot is not so easy to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a large open space outside the castle, with a fine iron ore as high as a hill. Next to the storage yard is the original camp. Now the camp is no longer the stinking garbage of the past, and the five rows of simple wooden houses have replaced the original shacks. The camp was very clean and a stream surrounded the camp. Several coolies are doing cleaning in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the aristocratic youth were not in the territory, the production of the mine and the smelting workshop was the responsibility of the gold dwarf apprentice. Toffler, who was taken over by Rogge, was responsible for managing the coolies and the purchase of an application, and was the nominal manager in the territory. Doyle is responsible for defense and training, but of course this is temporary. As soon as the thieves are trained, he will fly with Qi Wei. But Rogge doesn't plan to let him go, so talent is rare! However, there are many major things to do before the fate, and the fat man has no time to think about what method can be used to kill Doyle and nowhere to go. From then on, he can only rely on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there will always be a way, this Rogge is confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a turn in the territory, Rogge and other nobles are very satisfied with this thriving territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled at Franco: "This Toffler is a bad man and a housekeeper, though he is yin and bad and afraid of death." I used to think that his report always felt overstated. I didn’t expect that this old thing was not falsely reported, but it still reported a lot of things.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not because of you? You forced him to fall into the old guy of Ian, and now he has to trust us. Or else we will announce the facts, he is not cut by these sturdy mountain people?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember it, that’s Kate’s idea! Don't put everything on my head! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does more than one piece make a difference to you? "Franco said with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Princess Froya's car and the Clark Chamber of Commerce team arrived in Selesburg. Froya and Benjamin were very surprised by the prosperity of Selesburg. I don't know when, Froya has put on a tight-fitting safari and put on a red magic cloak. She had just come down from the carriage and immediately let the thieves who were training in the square next to the square look straight. Although they were repaired by Doyle for two months, they were still difficult to change. Some of them were daring and whistled at Froya. Doyle was so angry that he ordered the few people to be listed and ready to let them remember for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria, Benjamin and Rogge were arranged to rest in the main castle building. The captain of the Golden Lion Knight, Paulus and the five captains, as well as other important figures of the Chamber of Commerce, also lived in the main building. The caravans and the ‘Dragon and Beauty’ knights had to be wronged in the house of the original thief. After some fuss, I finally settled down everyone. Benjamin and Froya did not take a break and rode along with Rogge to visit the whole of Reyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you visited the smelting workshop and the mine, the sky was near dusk. Froya looked at the very busy camp, not far away, and suddenly became interested. "Where is it over there? Have we seen it in the past?" She leaned over to Rogge half-length and asked intimately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge hurriedly took a step back and said: "His Royal Highness, there is the hard-working camp of the Territory, the most despicable and filthy place. His Royal Highness Noble, it is not suitable to go to this place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s eyes are staring at Rogge, smiling with a smile: "You Why are you always hiding from me? I am so terrible? You let Elder Benjamin comment on the side of the camp. It seems very clean, go see! I decided." After that, she rushed to the camp. . Rogge couldn't stop it, but had to follow it up. Benjamin smirked and followed the two without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the coolies have returned from the mine, it is the time to eat dinner. On the open space in the middle of the camp, four large iron pots have been set up for a long time, and the hot soup in the pot rolled over, bursting with a tempting fragrance. More than two hundred coolies are lined up, carrying a variety of utensils, waiting for a few cooks to share the food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, fat man sipped a spoonful of food in a pot of hard work, screaming in a loud voice: "You guys These coolies! Being able to work in Saleres, being able to mine for Rogge adults is already a great blessing! You are here, not only to eat, but also to eat meat! Tonight, there is a whole The pig's hind legs are stewed in the soup! For some places, you don't want to know what the meat is like in this life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He puts a thin high The young boy pours all the food, while continuing his talk: "Now you can not only eat meat, but also sleep in a house that is not leaky or airtight! Little Peter, see you thin this Look, if you leave here, you can only sleep in the pig's nest, drink the pigs every day! If you work hard, there will be no whip! Even the doctor is sick! Doctor! You guys , has been better than many free people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "For you, here, Sallesburg! It is your paradise! But don't think that this is your eternal comfort zone! Which one does not work hard, which one is strong and will not be allowed to be Sold to the mines of the Principality of Ron! When you get there, you will know what regrets!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat chef shouted and snorted. Not at all, there are a few people who are looking at him not far away. Toffler, who was busy in the camp, suddenly appeared in the distance and sat quietly in the immediate Rogge and others. He hurried all over the road and rushed over and smiled and said: "The Rogge has this lady and the grown-up, how come you came to this place! It is too unsuitable for you!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria asks: "You are the steward of Sellers? What are you doing in the camp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Toffler looked up and saw the beautiful face of Froya. Although he was over fifty years old, his head was still dizzy. He replied ately: a noble lady... The villain is trusted by Rogge, managing the coolies and daily expenses in the castle. Every day, the villain goes to this camp of hard work to see if anyone is hurt and sick, something is not enough, and there is something to be done. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya asked strangely: "The coolies are very cheap. If there are not enough people, can you buy them?" "Trouble also stunned and replied: "This is what Rogge told me. The villain just did what Reggae told me." If the wisdom of an adult is like the bright moon in the sky, the villain is just a firefly. The villain only knows that what Rogge told him to do is always justified. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge replied reverently: "His Royal Highness Princess! The little man used to see these hardships too hard, thinking that we are all God's people, the villain hopes that the glory of God can bathe everyone in the territory, so command Toffler gave them a good meal and lived well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya had a good look at Roger straight hair. She snorted disdainfully, knowing that she couldn't tell the truth from Rogge's mouth, and she would no longer care about this fat man. Anyway, there is an opportunity to repair this annoying fat man. Finally, I got rid of the annoying nobles of the Principality and can freely go out and play. How can I not find more fun? Be sure to fix this fat man who has been disobedient! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toffler heard the words "His Royal Highness", the spirit was awkward, and the whole body trembled with excitement: "His Royal Highness! She is the Royal Highness Princess! She actually asked me The words! The Princess of the Royal Highness has asked the old Tofler the question of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin looked thoughtfully at the clean camp, camp Stacked neat raw ore, as well as cool face, expression, and movement. After a while, he said to Rogge: "Rogge, you have less than 200 people in this territory. The mine production has passed a large mine with five hundred coolies in the Principality of Ron. It seems that you are very unique. Here! I can come to Sellesborg this time, the harvest is not small, hey, the harvest is not small!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the coolies have noticed this A few big men came, all eyes were focused on Froya's figure for a moment. The little man riding on the chestnut purebred is like bringing a fresh breath to the entire camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cool force suddenly ran out of the team, and several guards were shocked, and it was too late to react, let him rush over. The hard work rushed straight to Furoa. Toffler was busy blocking the front, but he was pushed aside. Froya, Rogge and Benjamin are sitting still, to see who is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coolie rushed to Furo’s horse and slammed down. He looked up and said in a very sweet voice: "This noble lady, you must be a princess, Miss Marquis! No, you must be a princess! Your beauty is the moon, Mordes can not Miss noble lady, my kind lady, you must not bear to see your fanatical followers in the camp of hard work forever! You will save me, Kalme, a poor bard!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karme? A poet?" Fu Luoya was interested in watching this coolie, he was in his twenties, and his face was very handsome. The eyes are very charming blue-gray. From his face, the life of the camp is obviously not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, there is actually a poet in your hard work camp!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calme Kneeling turned to Rogge: "You are the great wisdom of Lord Rogge, thank you Lord, I finally met you, I am willing to contribute my wisdom and knowledge to you! As a great, wise, rich Visionary aristocrats, you must need me! You will now put Kalme in the camp of hard work will be a major loss of your property!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karme continues In his poetic language, he describes his talent, his knowledge, and his insults as an insult to his poet's identity. Froya has lost interest in him. She gracefully turned the horse's head and turned back to Rogge: "I am tired, I have to go back and change clothes. See you at dinner!" After all, this millennium disaster will go away, and there will be countless Kalmy. Songs such as "My Angel" and "My Goddess" are thrown behind me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Froya left, Rogge’s face was immediately covered with a layer of frost. He stared at the bard who was lying on the ground, coldly to Tofler: "Toffler! What is this inexplicable poet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Rogge, he is the second group of hard-earned people in the territory. When he first came, he was only working quietly, who knows what he said to be equal, free, and so on. The villain has already slammed him through a whip. You know, the villain has only played two hard-working whip, but he has completely obeyed the instructions of the adults to do their best to be honest and work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After snoring, Rogge asked Karme: "What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet was overjoyed and hurriedly said: "The villain has traveled through many countries and speaks four languages! The villain has been involved in poetry, art and even politics. The villain will definitely become the assistant of the adults!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Toffler! I have a lot of things in this matter!" Rogge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty horses circled around Kalme! Give this shit poet to me and slap him a whip! I will sell him to the slave market tomorrow! Remember to mark him as a poet and sell a price that matches his identity! "Thurd quickly called two thieves to guard, dragging the horrified, poached poet. Toffler's own ring is followed." Next to Rogge, I would like to ask Rogge for the way to deal with it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is very useful for this arrogance. He looks at it. Two thieves guarded the poet hanging on the flagpole in the center of the square and whipping. He patiently explained to Toffler: "My territory, what I want now is to mine as much as possible and produce steel. Therefore, what we want is the hard work of being willing to work hard! Whenever we work hard, let him eat and wear warm clothes and even treat him! Let him live a few times better than the hard work of other places! Those who are not honest, such as this poet, are going to fight. And we want everyone to see this difference! In this way, you can tell them clearly, how to do it to earn enough to eat, what behavior will be replaced by a whip! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciating the screams of a poet, Rogge said slowly: "I am missing a hand, but it is not this kind of will make myself A poet who has become a coolie, so I am not interested in listening to his story! Coolie is a coolie, as long as you have the strength, you will work. No need to be smart. If I let this poet out, it will be hard to save a cool painter and singer. In any case, working hard is the only standard for evaluating coolies in the future! The rules are the rules, absolutely can not be broken! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toffler was on the side of Nono. Rogge shouted again: "You have done a good job in the past six months!" In the future, the rules in the territory should be as simple as four, and they can't remember more. But the hard work of destroying the rules must not be soft! For those who will find a way to do their work well, encourage them. You have to remember that although the coolies are slaves, they are also human beings. They should be treated as **, and the names such as bones and bones should be removed as much as possible. Let them think of this as their home, so they will naturally find a way to do their work faster. You have to listen to their ideas, maybe there will be a good idea! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge arranged the work of the camp and went to the smelting workshop. Toffler stood respectfully until Rogge’s back disappeared. Turned around. He looked at the whipped poet in a disgusting manner, and gnashed his teeth: "Bad boy, it hurts me to see how many poems in your stomach!" Laozi is *** to give you out. He rushed forward, grabbed a guard's whip, and pumped his strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two days, a few The nobility was too busy. The Clark Chamber of Commerce transported much-needed tools, armor weapons, building materials and grain to the city of Saleres. Now it needs to ship steel ingots and raw ore. After two days of busyness, it was finally installed. The steel ingots of the car and the fine iron ore of more than 20 cars. Since this day, more than 100 tons of refined steel produced by the smelting workshop have been left by the Clark Chamber of Commerce. However, it takes a lot of time for the weapons workshop to be built. The future weapons craftsmen are now happily living in the mountains of the Principality of Ron. When these craftsmen come to their new living environment, there will be a large number of steels waiting for them.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic youth spent an unexpected amount of time on the defense of the Selesburg. Under the work of a lot of hard work, and the sweat of the thieves who often have a hard time, short The three-month time of the outer wall of the city of Sellersburg is basically repaired. Dawle has made considerable adjustments to the castle's defense system with his old-fashioned military vision, and its defensive power is not bad for this small castle that can't be smaller.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what makes the aristocratic youth dissatisfied is that this defense system is too much. How to say it, humanity and light are a little bigger. In the words of Rens, "What do you say to your enemy?" humane? The brain must be in the water, it is better to lick your own two knives! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a few aristocratic youths know nothing about how to defend the city. The time they can stay in Sellers is very limited, and they want to change for two days. There is no good idea, and this is the case for the time being. As for the thieves trained by Doyle, it is the result of Philippine. The harsh training of more than two months makes these thieves full of energy and strong. It seems that Everyone is thicker than the original, and the block is bigger. It seems that in time, these thieves will surely become the backbone of the Knights of the Guardian.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aristocratic youth privately let the thieves and the 'Dragon and Beauty' knights practice a few games, the more they surprised them. The physical strength and reaction of the thief is no worse than the oil of these veterans! At the crucial moment, the thieves will still fall under the various tricks of the veterans. If this is on the battlefield, it will be a small life. Of course, these tricks that are not fair and bright are not teaching. It’s only when the new recruits are mixed into the ranks of veterans in the future. Slow to learn "Dragon and beauty" Knight "sinister and ruthless ruthless, evil greedy lazy slip bad" mantra of the Cross <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;The more than 300 people brought by Jing Ge know that all of them are desperate, look dark and murderous. Three people particularly caught the attention of Rogge. One is a very thin middle-aged man who looks very dumb, but when he directs the crowd to camp, change dress, and arrange night patrols, the seemingly unruly slave warriors are immediately honest. The other two are tall, singular and blue. Another, like Jinge, is fat and strong, and looks like a smiling Mimi. Both of them are always with Jinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the two is no different from ordinary humans, but the purple fire of their soul center can not escape the feeling of Rogge. The two men are very strong, almost equal to the Golden Lion Knight squadron leader Paulus, that is, stronger than the aristocratic youth. What made Rogge unexpected was that the entire team of slave warriors was only the three demons. It turned out that he is still looking forward to more than half of the Mozu warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of Jing Ge’s several men caused Paulus’s vigilance. The powerful momentum of the fifty gold lion knights also gave the slave warriors a great threat. Although the two groups of people did not know each other, the instincts of the warriors' intuition and vindictiveness have made them unconsciously start to oppose each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden silence in the small square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Snatch Warrior and the Golden Lion Knight stood up and stared at each other quietly, and the situation was at a glance. The two sides clashed with each other, and there were several small tornadoes in the open space of the center! The "Dragon and Beauty" knights stand in the distance with a optimistic attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingo, Rogge and Benjamin are not far away to talk about the last few details of this ‘hunting’ event, and they immediately alerted them to the rushing weather. The fat man behind Jing Ge was arrogant, and a layer of green mist immediately shrouded the whole body. He fell like a light smoke to the center of the confrontation. The strength of this fat man is really strong, look at his body, and say that there are more than 200 kilograms, even the body is so light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell into the field and immediately touched the momentum of both sides. When several martial arts were weak, they could not control themselves and shot at him. After the loss of Paulus and the middle-aged warrior, the strength of the middle-aged warrior was far behind, and then he took the offensive. Only two of the Golden Lion Knights couldn’t control it, and the slave warriors had nearly 20 shots. The middle-aged warrior had only stopped seven or eight men under the hurdles, and the remaining warriors of more than a dozen warriors still greeted the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man screamed, the blue light skyrocketed, and the vindictiveness turned into a monster that looked at him. More than a dozen slave warriors touched his vindictiveness and flew back like a lightning strike. The fat man is also not good, after hard work for more than a dozen people, he has also retreated a dozen steps, seeing the blood in his mouth. Rogge and Jinge rushed over and bound their men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lion knights have always been less respectful to Rogge, and Paulus is not looking down on this strength as his own temporary boss. Although Orphey Roxe told him that he would not openly slam the Rogge, privately, Rogge’s orders were always inaudible. As the captain of the Golden Lion Knights, Paulus himself is the colonel, the Baron is the title. When it comes to status, it is even higher than Rogge. Moreover, under the leadership of Orpheek, the golden lion knights have never lost, which makes them look down on Rogge and the gangsters such as the ‘Dragon and Beauty’ knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge called Paulus aside, and then the two men fought fiercely, and gradually became louder and louder. Paulus did not think that he had done anything wrong. For those who have evil spirits, you can't be polite. He also stared at Rogge's teeth and spit out the words "evil breath." Rogge was furious, and if it wasn’t for the fat city to grow deeper and deeper in recent years, he immediately wanted to teach the arrogant Paulus. Although Paulus is a thirteenth sacred knight, the strength is far beyond Rogge, the necromancer. However, Rogge's strength is far more than the ones seen on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rouge equipped with "reincarnation" and Tomahawk "binding soul" is itself a bastion of activity, enough to make most of Paulus attack Go back. On the contrary, Rogge's magical Paulus can not be ignored. What's more, there is still one behind Rogge that will not lose to Paulus even if he is single-handedly fighting alone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge resisted the anger in his heart and said coldly: "Lord Paulus, as a knight who cherishes his honor, you have accepted Orpheus The command of the great man, I am fully assisting me to complete this 'hunting'! Your actions at the moment are not conducive to fulfilling your responsibilities, so I doubt your knight spirit!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say! You dare to insult my faith and honor, I demand a duel with you!" Paulus was furious and his hand had been pressed on the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
