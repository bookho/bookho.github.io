			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falborg is more than 700 miles from the city of Wangdu, which is a large city with a population of 200,000. Because of its strategic location, it is a second-line military town on the western border of the Rhine Union. It also has the effect of hindering the magical creatures in the Devil's Forest from rushing into the fertile Pas Plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a flat area around Farnborough, and the Pass River passes by. More than a hundred miles south is the Devil's Forest, so Falkburg has become the most important supply war for many adventurers and monster hunters. The area of ​​the Devil's Forest is almost equivalent to the entire Rhine Union. It reaches the Pyrenees in the west, the sea in the south, and the entire Red Rock Peninsula in the east, with a total area of ​​nearly one million square kilometers. Because there are few large-scale World of Warcraft activities on the edge of the forest, and many trade routes pass through this place, it has become a paradise for thieves and bandits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "God of War" weapons workshop has been open for a month. At the beginning, such a dwarf-like name was nothing more than the light of the innate craftsman dwarf, but now there is a dwarf artisan gold with his four apprentices working in the workshop. The Weapons Workshop occupies a three-story building in the most prosperous neighbourhood of Farr. The lower floor of the small building is a weapons storefront, the second floor is the adventurer's paradise, and the third floor is originally intended to be used as a laboratory, but it was rejected by everyone, and was used as a VIP room for some large customers. Put some fines made by Fiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small building not far from the "Knight of the God of War" is the place where Rogge is at sunset, and is where Fis's workshops and laboratories are located. The largest laboratory has more than 200 square meters. At this moment, the ground is full of huge and complex magic arrays, and the colorful halos are shining in the magic circle. In the middle of the magic array, a blue-and-white magical flame was sprayed out, and several pieces of steel knights, which were made by Kim, were burnt red in the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face carefully gripped a piece of nail with a pair of iron tongs and placed the magic symbol cast with magical silver in a specific position. A flash of fire flashed, and the magic symbol was firmly welded to the nail. Rogge was busy handing over a small bottle of blue liquid, which was the blood of an adult two-legged dragon. The two-legged dragon is fierce, quick, and has a good magical protection. It is hard to deal with in the middle-level Warcraft. Many parts of the body can be used as magical ingredients, and blood can increase magical protection to a small extent. Magic silver, because of its very good ductility and excellent absorption of magic, is an indispensable material for making magical instruments. However, because it is relatively rare, the price is not cheap. The price of general magic silver is about ten times that of the same weight of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue dragon's blood drops on the well-made nail piece, just like the sponge absorbs water, it is quickly absorbed into the whole piece. The piece of film also turned into a fluorescent light with a light blue color. Rogge took the piece and put it into the magical flame. After all the pieces were processed, Faith sang a spell against the magical flame, and a pair of light blue wings gradually formed and flew toward the magical flame. The wind wing turned around the magical flame, and the faster and faster, the sound of the flames soared, the white light flashed on the ceiling, and an enchantment blocked the storm of magical flames. The flame storm came quickly, and it went fast, and it disappeared in a blink of an eye. Leave a few blue pieces on the ground. After the fusion of this wind magic, the weight of the entire piece is reduced by 60% due to the support of the magical energy of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of Rogge, each piece of A piece was added with a little magic silver, and Fiss once again applied an illumination on it. This time, the whole piece of film began to appear translucent light blue, and the magic symbol formed by the magic silver was just the light of the blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this looks pretty much more, just looking for you. Making these pieces into a half-length knight is the most popular this year. The style of the Paladin A. The chain of the connecting part must be gold! There is also a gold pattern on the edge of the armor to call the boy of Franco. He has a set of works of art!!" Roger is full of joy call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf gold does not agree: "This can't be done! Chain armor should be wrapped with fine steel wire! The most important thing about armor is protection! Protection!! I don't want to Bad reputation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a layer of gold wire wrapped around the wire! This is always fine. All in all, the chain must be covered with gold. The most important thing about this armor is money! Add this layer of gold, you have ten years of ale! Tell Rens, pick a matching cloak of this armor, to be the best day after tomorrow. This piece is good!! I can't see the armor, you don't have any wine!! Yes, this piece is called the blue crystal armor. Of course, the name is not to be engraved first. What name does the guest think of, what do you engrave? Name! A word of ten gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold muttered down the stairs and went downstairs, finally choosing the latter between conscience and ale. What's in your mouth is: "The vampire!! The pig that eats people!! The miser! The old dragon of the human form!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, all the armor of Rogge pays great attention to the appearance decoration and some unrealistic gimmicks. For example, this blue crystal armor, the weight is extremely light, only equivalent to the weight of a heavy leather armor, physical defense and magic defense effect are good, is a fine in the magic armor. But that lighting, after the fusion is only to make this magic armor have a translucent crystal effect, the light is more soft and attractive, but there is no practical effect. As for the decorations designed by Franco, in addition to increasing the weight, it does not help the combat. However, Rogge said: "This one will know that the Paladins should wear it. Is it sold to the real paladin? Of course not. Which paladin will wear this? We want to sell those who want to Become the paladin's grand aristocrats, do you expect them to venture into dangerous caves? They will only wear to hunt! So style and taste are more important, let them be like a hero in front of the ignorant girl. The hammer of the god of war is not prepared to become a large arms dealer, but to become a noble brand like the purple angel jewelry, Shangri-La hot springs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people listened without words. From then on, the vampire Rogge's nickname went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "God of War" business is booming, and although it has only sold a knight sword, a knight, and a set The Cavaliers heavy armor, (this is the full capacity of Fiss), not only recovered the cost of the original investment of 10,000 gold coins, but also earned 3,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun in the afternoon lazily shines on the quietly flowing Pas River, and the wide river is coated with a layer of gold. A team of sharp-eyed axe gun knights are leisurely patrolling along the river, for the knight wearing a dark green breastplate, and the rest is the khaki-colored Falkirk Knights cavalry breastplate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight of the dark green armor is Kate, the piece is the black elf knight half body that made him proud for a long time, after being soaked in the blood of the black elf, Also made with the shield magic, the various defenses are excellent, especially for the dark spells. After Kate arrived in Fort Falcon, Lord Knighton, the head of the Knights, took care of him and led him to lead the guerrilla cavalry squad. A team of Falcon guerrilla cavalry has fifty to sixty cavalry, and as a captain of Kate, he can only lead twenty cavalry. The guerrilla cavalry is between the heavy cavalry and the light cavalry. It usually wears a half-breasted breastplate. The weapon selection is mostly a slashing axe, so it is often called the axe cavalry. The guerrilla cavalry usually cruises around three hundred miles around Fort Worth. Each time it is dispatched, it will survive in the wild for a week or so. When the patrol encounters the thieves of the squad and the World of Warcraft gathers, the enemy of the squad will return to the fort. However, Falkenburg has not been involved in war for decades, and guerrilla cavalry has become more of a training for cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the third time Kate has led the Ranger Squadron since it was in Fort Worth for two months. The sun is shining, there are a few fishing boats floating on the river, and there are always fishermen's songs coming. The riverside is a green field, and the magical forest in the distance is also quiet and detailed. Kate is very happy, this is simply a tourist. The only fly in the ointment is that the shadow of the thieves group has not seen one, and there is a scene of peace and prosperity everywhere. Kate had calculated it for five days. He waved his hand and shouted: "Brothers, the team is closed!" A team of axe gunmen turned around and swayed to Fort Falcon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Falcon Knights have a total of soldiers, as well as a servant. After all, it was a second-line army, and the days of peace were much better. The Knights of Lord Winnington’s fighting power was also flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge and others have already adapted to the life of Falkburg, that is, to find out the local joys and pubs. It is also rare to play several games with adventurers and mercenaries. In addition to the lord of Drizzt, the people of Winnington are not afraid to offend anyone. In the business, a few pieces of good magic equipment sold, especially after the blue crystal armor was bought by a duke's youngest son with 10,000 gold coins, the reputation of "Knight of the God of War" quickly started. Rogge saw that the dwarves were too leisurely, and even forced them to build some equipment that was not magically blessed. The craftsmanship of the dwarves is naturally a boutique, and every batch of goods comes out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the third floor of the "Knight of the God of War", Rogge is battling with a small group of adventurers. This team of adventurers has 9 people, the standard adventure team configuration, warrior, ranger, shooter, magician, priest, thieves have everything, that is, one or two. They have just returned from the Adventures of the Devil Forest, where they are now taking advantage of the adventure to get some equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoge’s eyes are a bag of magical silver with two pounds of weight, and some more rare metals and gems, such as an ore. In the dark, with a little sparkling Venus, Rogge recognized it as a high-grade star gold mine. This kind of gold is different from ordinary gold, but has a mysterious correspondence with the power of the stars in the sky. It is extremely rare and is an indispensable raw material for making weapons related to space magic. As for the crystal nucleus of Warcraft, the fur, although very precious, is far less than these metals. The flaming bird feathers worn by the female magician in the team caught Rogge's attention. With the mental power, Rogge now has a very sturdy but agile fire magic wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
