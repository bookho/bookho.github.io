			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve Chapters of Dusk Chapter 2 on the Pseudo-images<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter Two Pseudo-images<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers of the Chaoshan Legion have never been so overwhelmed today. No matter how powerful the enemy on the battlefield, they can't let them fear to retreat. The swords, arrows, spears and even nails are their weapons to defend their honor. However, now those brave hearts are shaking, not because of cowardice, but more of the instinctual awe of the unknown existence and the power of the peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge silver dragon hovered in the air, the huge scales reflected the fascinating and fascinating Huamang, almost more eye-catching than the rising sun, he I ignored the tides and heavy warriors who had shiny rifles underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a hundred meters of him, he was filled with sly dragons, and ordinary human warriors could not enter the range of Longwei. Therefore, in the center of the wide square in front of the Legion headquarters, the empty, densely loaded soldiers can only be crowded on the edge of the square. No mage gives them buffs to protect their fears, and they can't fight in Longwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the tidal corps is a soldier at the moment, but most of the senior officers are missing. In the case of losing command, since the silver dragon in the air does not see any signs of using force, then no one will be stupid to take the lead to charge the silver dragon. These days, under the yin of the fat man, the Chaoshan Legion is reviewing the rules of the emperor from top to bottom. Now even ordinary warriors know that it is a big sin to act without the command of the chief, and the style of the fat man is that the penalty for all crimes will go up with the upper limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, even if the soldiers are reloaded, the seven-meter lancet in their hands is not enough for the silver dragon in the air, even if it is an elite soldier who can throw a hundred meters. Before the huge gap between human and dragon power under the influence of gravity, even if it is enough for the silver dragon, it just tickles him. Unlike the Glacier Corps, the Chaoshan Legion never thought that one day it would go to the dragon, so there was no special weapon in the army that could deal with the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dragon that has been hovering in the higher air suddenly makes a long dragonfly, then gathers its wings and falls on the zenith terrace of the Chaoshan Legion headquarters. . The sacred dragon slowly rises to the sky. The dragons stretched and lingered. Like more than ten huge organ in the ensemble. The solemn prelude seems to lead the aria of the goddess of praise, the melody, the harmony, and the direct touch of the soul of all beings. When the gorgeous mysterious rhythm finally appears, the dragon's grace and majesty's dragon body can't keep shining with the brilliant magical light of milky white, orange red, blue, green, and the streamers and tassels surrounded by light. Dancing up and down, and finally welcoming the finale full of power and heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secular time is still, the goddess is slowly coming. We bowed to accept her tour, it is merciful and strict, the door of fate is closed and the reopening...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, everyone’s heart is flowing through hymns Not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the whole city of Sirde is awe-inspiring, and all the souls flock to the sacred dragons entrenched on the zenith terrace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred dragons are struggling, almost people stand up, and a particularly high-pitched dragon whistle is the perfect ending note for hymns. A light beam spurted out of its mouth and went straight to the Han! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no big cities in the city, and the people are on the ground in awe, and no one can dare to point the sharps of the rifle in the direction of the sacred dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Yinlong, it has been completely ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a zenith terrace with a sacred dragon. It is located just above the Temple of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the temple, the woman who had just sat down on the only throne lifted her head slightly, and the slightly curved silver eyes looked upwards, and the cold eyes were instantly worn. It has a thick floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made a fist in her right hand and waved up silently...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple seemed to sway . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, I don’t know how many people are watching the sacred dragon on the ground. People suddenly felt that the headquarters of the entire Chaoshan Legion suddenly showed a milky white light...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Long Hao sounded again. The extraordinarily clear is higher. The louder the louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people regained their vision, the sacred dragon that dared to lie on the top of the goddess on the zenith terrace had disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mortal beings don’t know the mystery. They are full of awe in everything that is in front of them, because, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so magnificent, so prestige, only miracles, no other! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman’s right fist finally fell, and the clenched five fingers were as open as the blue, gently falling on the arm of the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally vomited his chest for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head in a respectful manner, but his eyes quietly looked in the direction of the throne, but every time his eyes fell on the woman, he would face one The burning light of the group, in that moment, in addition to a vast white, Rogge can no longer see the other. After two times, Rogge’s eyes were a little red and he didn’t dare to try again. But when he sneaked around and found that other people’s eyes fell on the woman, it seemed that there was no difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s doubts are that only one person will hit the dazzling light, or is his eyes particularly vulnerable to others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the woman sitting on the throne can make Rogge see it all over the body, only the fibrillation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the temple, Macbeth is standing there, his face is cloudy. The wings behind him have disappeared, and they no longer improve their strength. Only he can't escape. If he rushes to fight, he will die. So he just stays in the same place and doesn't know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man secretly sympathizes with Macbeth, and is quite considerate of Macbeth's situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a silence, the woman on the throne lifted her left hand and pointed her finger at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger strode forward and said: "The great goddess, how do you need me to help you? Please tell me!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silvery eyes crossed the thick door of the temple and looked at the vast land far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a slightly open lips. The cold sounds linger, and then fall into the air: "I need... war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the roar, the heavy door of the temple slowly opens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge strode out of the temple! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went straight to Wallace and a group of generals, and brought Wallace over. Under the brute force of Rogge's horror, the sturdy and arrogant Wallace has no resistance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just said that you are going to mobilize 15,000 people to attack the city of Sorato?" Rogge almost put on Wallace's face, gnashing his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace only feels that this day is extremely strange. He only replied: "I did say this just now, but now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing!" Rogge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let go of Wallace. The pickpocket grabbed the march plan from the hands of a general, and shoveted the ground, sweeping his eyes up and down, and another one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty turned his head and glared at Wallace, saying: "General, this plan is good. But the number of 15,000 people needs to be changed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to military matters, Wallace immediately becomes extremely serious. He frowned. "This... Rogge. If the number is small, the plan will be difficult to implement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shakes his head immediately , said: "No, not to reduce the soldiers, but to increase, increase! General, we have a glorious history of the Chaoshan Legion ate a big loss under the city of Soratu, is it only an offensive? No! I don't Think! What I need is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals looked at each other and wondered why Rogge’s attitude suddenly changed so thoroughly. It seems that all the reasons are in the temple of light that closes the door. But for this reason, who dares to ask? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge can turn to Wallace regardless of the doubts of the generals. Commanded in an unquestionable tone: "Call all the generals! Immediately hold a military meeting! Within ten minutes, I will see all the generals appear in front of me! If it is less than the time, dispose of it according to the rules of the emperor! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace didn't say anything, the time limit was too short, and he immediately rushed to the call. After a few moments, dozens of generals gathered in the large conference room on the third floor, watching the fat hysterical, squirming and mobilizing before the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War! War! We have no choice but to war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military plan The figure hung behind Rogge. Rogge suddenly turned around, and the hands of the Emperor’s rules were heavily photographed on the map to represent a red dot in the city of Solatu. “We are one of the three major empire’s tidal corps! Those stupid Delaware pigs Let's eat a big loss. You can't just forget it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat face. Waving the Emperor’s rules in his hand, he said: “Every warrior we can mobilize is mobilized. Even the logistics and local guards are counted. Anyone who has received military training and is able to fight weapons Bring me on! One does not stay! This time, I don’t step on the Delaware emperor, we will never accept the soldiers! Long live the tidal tidal army!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Present The generals have all experienced battles, and many of them have always rushed to the front of the fierce, the blood of the avid war in their bones is finally slowly swayed by the fat! Even if there are a few generals who disapprove of the fat man, seeing the emperor's rules that are waving up and down in his hand, he will remember that he has absolute power to mobilize the army and wage war. The punishment for not complying with the military order is clearly written on the military regulations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the generals of the Chaoshan Legion still have people who are not afraid of power. An old general stood up and said coldly: "Gregor, Fernandez, who is stationed in the city of Sorato, is not a fool. You are so arrogant, what if he leads the light ride to take the virtual attack to the city?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger snorted, his right hand was behind him, and Rose immediately whispered. The fat man nodded and said to the old general: "You justified it. Since most of your past brilliant achievements are related to the defense, then this time you will be stationed in the city of Sild! I will leave you Two thousand warriors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old general was so angry that it was a military order and it was not defying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another middle-aged general stood up and said: "Master Rogge, according to your order, we will dispatch 70,000 troops, of course, of which It also includes your army. However, the plan behind you is based on the scale of the attack of 15,000 people, and the soldiers who are supposed to be transferred when planning are the most elite soldiers in the army. This... IMHO. We The size of the army has increased fivefold, and more than half of them are second-rate troops with poor combat effectiveness. Instead of investing in the nest, it is better to select only the most elite soldiers of 40,000 to attack Delaware. Of course, if you must insist on dispatching If the 70,000th army is the case, then we must redefine the battle plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge showed patience and listened, and said: "Okay. We are now Just redefine the plan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up a thick pen and drew two huge arrows on the military map. One arrow points to the city of Solatu from the city of Sild, and the other directly points to the Emperor of Delaware from the city of Solatu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge put down the pen, turned around, showed a satisfied smile, looked straight into the eyes of the middle-aged general, and said: "General, this It’s a new plan!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May is close to Rogge. In his ear, he said in a very low voice: "You are too excited," said Rogge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man snorted and took a deep breath. But still can't suppress the mad heart. He also knew that he was very rude, but he had just stood by the goddess for so long, and he had to bear the indescribable pressure at all times. That feeling is like a weak lamb standing in front of a lion! In Rogge's spiritual world, above the throne is not a goddess of unparalleled grace. It is a horrible energy storm, a storm that is enough to instantly level the entire headquarters of the Legion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge looked around the audience and said, with the most calm and powerful voice he could achieve: "It’s decided. Generals. You are going back to the army immediately. Tomorrow morning, I will lead the army to start. Which army? Delayed the time, dispose of according to the rules of the emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them know that Rogge is the last order, no doubt, so they have got up. These generals are brave, and although they are dissatisfied with Rogge’s random command, they can be beaten, and it is better to train their troops in the city of Sild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly remembered something. Road: "Please wait a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the fat man suddenly open the emperor rules, look at it page by page. The generals could not help but be at risk. God knows when he will inexplicably violate the military regulations and be caught by the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at this moment, Rogge simply turned a blind eye to the military regulations. He squinted his eyes in the military manual, but he wanted to cover up the silver awns that were diverging outward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly relaxed a bit of suppression of the goddess of nature. The goddess of nature is completely different from the power of the world. Although it is still very weak at the moment, the road of growth is still very long, but Rogge relaxes a little, and it immediately wakes up from the state of silence, and instantly encircles the spirit from Rogge. There was a gap in the force and a few tentacles were discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These invisible tentacles quickly swept through the entire conference hall to find targets that could be activated. Before they were about to reach some generals, they suddenly bypassed their bodies and rushed to the other generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, the natural goddess has been exploring the surrounding environment! They spread a few seeds, and then each tentacle begins to shine, and it looks like it is triggering a seed in a latent state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rogge’s spiritual strength disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contact between the tentacles and the outside world was completely cut off, and the seeds that had lost their divine power gradually withered and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog finally lifted his head from the military manual, and smiled at the generals who were unaware that they had turned around in front of the god of death, that The smiles are so happy that they make them feel chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is not bad, for the protection of believers, the goddess of nature will evade the devout believers. Therefore, in front of the fat man who is angry with the goddess of nature, all the goddess of nature goddess has nothing to lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty fingers connected, called eight generals to go out, and then let the rest of the generals go back to camp to prepare for tomorrow's expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately asked the follower to take a statue of the goddess of nature and placed it in front of the eight generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man walked around the eight generals and sneered and said: "Generals, you must know that Druid, who had long been ill-intentioned They finally launched a rebellion. Of course, in front of the invincible empire army, they have no room for chaos. Now the empire does not officially recognize the belief in the goddess of nature as a crime, but the Druids are representatives of the natural goddess. It’s hard to say that it’s not the natural goddess who instructed them to launch a rebellion.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Rogge’s mouth, the eight generals, though not speaking, were angry. But the fat man didn't care, he continued: "Everybody! Give up the faith in the goddess of nature, and beckoning to you! And the new faith, that is no less than the existence of the goddess of nature, is by our side! Of course, If you are not willing to give up your faith, what will be waiting for you, I think you are also very clear. I have always been very simple, that is, I don’t lie, and I don’t like to turn around. Now, the choice is already in your hands. Get out! Pull out your sword and cut down this statue! Prove your faith to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight generals have been silent for a long time, a hair The old general who had seen the pale suddenly took out the sword and went to the goddess of the natural goddess. He had to make a slap, screaming, and the sword with a sword suddenly changed direction in the air, slamming it to Rogge's chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Rogge to move, the beauty behind him has been blocked in front of the fat man. She flashed her hand and had already caught the wrist of the old general holding the sword. Then, the body of the rose suddenly appeared in the radiant brilliance. In the click, the elbow of the old general was broken, and the sword in the hand turned away and turned to his throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
