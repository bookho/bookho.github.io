			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge does not know that he has been involved in a new whirlpool. When he came out of the Essence elders room, the sky was already bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly returned to his room in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is originally a bedroom, decorated with elegance and not luxury. Even Rogge, a vulgar person who came in first, felt refreshed. Since the sacrifices have been broken into the eternal situation, Rogge immediately took up the house honestly and unkindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The settlement of the rituals and Rumsfeld, Rogge is in a good mood. Although the old Shu Xisi once again made him feel unfathomable, but what is the problem is the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty is in a hurry, acting as a ghost in the night, gently bypassing the two guards guarding the temple, then leaping, silent Standing on the window sill of my bedroom without interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big bed in the middle of the bedroom, Ajani and her clothes fell on the bed and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger, who has blessed the feathers and adds surgery, is really like a feather, and falls lightly into the room. He quietly came to the bed and looked at the elf woman who was sleeping asleep with pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After packing up the sacrifices, Rogge was busy with the aftermath, only telling people to release Ajani from the dungeon and returning himself in the middle of the room. I didn't expect to come back, it was already so late. I thought that for a reason, Ajani was kept in the dungeon for so many days, and Rogge couldn’t help but feel pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More that Rogge was moved, that day, Ajani was born to die of staleness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned down slightly and looked at the sleeping Ajani. These days are not seen, Ajia Ni's skin reveals a layer of gold, faintly has a non-human taste, more beautiful and more beautiful. She is also wrapped in a large bathrobe, and the skin that is exposed to the outside has a strange pale gold color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge gently opened her bathrobe and quietly watched a shocking big scar on her right back. Rogge’s hand couldn’t help but tremble. He couldn’t imagine what the day was, and he would leave such a scar of a scar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s temperament, hugged her up...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agauni in her sleep Instinctively, the elbow is vertical and hits the stomach of Rogge! Even if the fat body is too good, can not withstand such a blow, the face suddenly white! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But things are not over yet...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajiani’s head suddenly slammed Kneeling on the face of Rogge! The upper body of the fat man was picked up and splashed with a nosebleed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are not finished yet...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani seems to have inherited a lot of *** The horrible battle instinct, not fully awake, has instinctively locked Rogge's position, a pale golden long leg flies, and a terrible force to kick Rogge out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man did not react at all, and he flew out, and he was planted in the corner and fell into a smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani rolled up in the air and gently fell. She opened her eyes and saw who was being kicked out and lying in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisedly covered his mouth with a small hand "You are... Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Isn't there anyone else?" Rogge smiled bitterly, rubbing his face with a nosebleed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint shadow flashed, and before Rogge reacted, Ajani had already plunged into his arms and burst into tears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't look at Aka Ni's body is light and delicate, but now it's amazingly powerful. This pounce immediately slammed Rogge to the ground, causing him to be beaten everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani listened and cried even louder. She choked and said: "You are finally back! If... If you can't wake up, then I will not live!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog can't help but burst into a stir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When men and women are estrus, there are more words, and how many people can really die together? But what can you describe in your own agility and awkwardness? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Ajani Baby, I am God! How could it be so easy to die? You see, I am not good? Come. Come, baby! Let me stop the blood and say it, it will drop on your head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani just raised her eyes in tears Seeing the blood of Rogge's face, I couldn't help but exclaim. She immediately remembered that she couldn’t help but feel distressed and embarrassed. A pretty face has long been red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge...God makes adults, don't you want to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles I have been beaten like this with my own Warcraft-like physique. Although it is surprising, the power of Ajani is too horrible. Where is this like a fairy! Although it is still far from the strange power of Rogge, I am afraid it is not far from the orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni ran in and out like a wind, took a piece of wet wipes, and let Rogge wipe the blood off his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aga Ni," Rogge looked at her carefully. "How suddenly did your strength become so big? Also, your previous martial arts also Not so powerful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani just said Half of it was interrupted by Rogge's smile: "Don't call me God to make an adult, it's called Rogge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way, too I don't respect you......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do for me, what else can't you?" Rogge smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A touch of blush sneaked up on Ajani’s face, mixing the strange pale gold on her face, slowly revealing a strange beauty. She lowered her head, and a pair of small hands subconsciously stroked Rogge's arm and said, "God makes... God... in terms of... I don't want you to die... I was so scared that day!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she suddenly looked up and stared at Rogge’s face, and a hand trembled and touched Rogge’s face, muttering: “You are really back, yes Didn't I read it wrong, didn't dream, didn't I?" The words were not finished, and she screamed in Rogge's arms and burst into tears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was caught unprepared by her, and had to comfort herself in her arms, which made her cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Ajani is covered with a mysterious temptation, only a thin bathrobe to cover her skin. She was in the arms of Rogge, and she still sobbed low, her shoulders shrugged, and she could not rub the body of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a touch of brilliant pink in the room...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajia Ni also felt something, She stopped sobbing and her face slowly rose red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s hand slipped into her bathrobe with a restless smile, and laughed softly: “You’ve been a lot worse recently! It’s automatic when you sleep. Counterattack! But just like this, I just thought of a few very interesting high-profile poses recently. It’s rare for you to advance martial arts, just try to run! Haha, I see where you can go!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two figures quickly chased the interior, and Rogge chased for a long time and did not catch up with Ajani. Ajani looked back and saw Rogge panting all the way. She couldn't bear it, and her feet slowed down intentionally, and finally she was caught by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Rogge’s smile in his eyes, how can he still be half-tired? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani was ashamed, she was extremely flexible and twisted a bit, and it was incredibly removed from Rogge’s arms, hiding in lightning. Another corner of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani’s face was white, and she slowly turned and stood against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge came to her, and the tone suddenly became extremely embarrassing: "Hands slowly back to the back... that's it! The chest is tall, then High point..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani was shocked and ashamed, only wanted to escape again, but was afraid of really angering Rogge, for a while, simply It is self-confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Rogge can’t help it more than her. With a bang, Rogge suddenly tore her bathrobe in half! Looking at her beautiful body, Rogge couldn't stand it anymore, and rushed up...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crazy night made both of them tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajani fell asleep in Rogge’s arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s ear suddenly moved, although he remained asleep, and even the rhythm of the snoring did not change, but from his eyelids Under the faint silver light, I know that he is now in the most alert state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that a man of very martial arts is quietly and slowly coming to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are no elf warriors who are alarming and guarding, most of them are enemies and non-friends! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After one death, Rogge will never forget the horror memory of the fine sword into the throat. Since then, he has always been highly alert to the movements around him. The cycle between life and death also greatly increased his alertness to danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneaks up, silently landing, a few magical arrays flashing around him, Rogge has already given himself the power, blessings and magic Then, I applied another 'real vision' that can see the invisible on my own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people outside the door walked lightly and incomparably, suddenly stopped and stopped, all irregular, even let Rogge can not catch his rhythm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s hair is erected, and the guest outside is really terrible! Although in his mental stimulation, this person’s The soul energy is not particularly strong, even worse than Androni, but his unpredictable body is far better than he should! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, in addition to the Pope, Rogge has not seen a strong man who can conceal his soul power! He looked back at the sleeping Ajani, biting his teeth, and then gave himself a stone skin surgery, walked out of the bedroom and closed the door. Then quietly standing in the middle of the living room, staring at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The looming black flame flows under Rogge's skin and will appear at any time. Rogge did not dare to directly form the magical flame in vitro, for fear of alarming the mysterious people outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stood at the door for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment of work, Rogge has been sweating, as if after a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the mysterious man has an action, he turned out to be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently knocked door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge...God makes the adults?" Although the voice is inaudible, it is still clear that it does not seem to have a hint of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed, relieved, and the flames of the devil that came out of the way were also collected. He stepped forward and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is standing at the wind butterfly, her face is cloudy and uncertain, looking at Rogge, want to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s tight face loosened and piled up with a fascinating smile, whispering: “Aha! It’s our great beauty. Butterfly! Come in, so late, you still come to me quietly, oh, don't you worry about Rumsfeld knowing it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face of the wind butterfly flashed and disappeared, followed by sorrow and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lowered her head and walked into the room from Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cold hand is gently stroking the long, graceful neck of the wind butterfly, the low voice is ringing behind the wind butterfly, they are so close, the wind butterfly can even feel his slight breath blowing his own ear A few gold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Butterfly, I am really surprised! You didn't come with malicious intentions, and there is no alert. This is really not like your style!" Very good, sit down! Let me hear what you are saying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly sat down silently, Rogge moved a chair and sat comfortably In the opposite of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly appeared, I don’t know when a cold sweat came out, and the wet underwear was coldly attached to the body, very uncomfortable. With her strength as the guardian of the sanctuary, she was faced with face-to-face, and was ruined by Rogge, who did not know it! Although she is the soul of the house, she has been hesitant when she is outside the door, but her talent and instinct for fighting can be different, so she was defeated by Rogge without any resistance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly bowed for a long time, Rogge also silent, just waiting for her to speak quietly. The wind butterfly finally got the courage and looked up at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her first positive and serious observation of Rogge, she is surprised that Rogge’s eyes are so cold and clear, it is like a whole The cold world of no one's emotions! Suddenly she had a feeling. If there was any change in her own, the gentle touch of her neck would definitely crush her throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults..." The wind butterfly finally spoke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a matter of calling me Rogge." Rogge’s voice was easy, and even with some very pleasant pleasure. But Wind Butterfly knows that this is completely illusory. Just like when she first entered the door, Rogge’s fascinating look was completely fake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the past, when Rogge saw his own ugliness, how many times was it true? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the wind butterfly thinks, the more chilling it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was confident in the deal with Rogge tonight, until now, she suddenly appeared, she did not understand the gods in front, even though There is also a lot of time to follow him. Under his gentle and welcoming coat, it was a piece of ice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly once again looked at Rogge carefully, she looked so seriously, so that unconsciously, the upper body has slightly tilted forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge comfortably piled up in the big chair, calm and self-conscious, not at all arrogantly arrogant. It is not a difficult thing to be watched by a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly understood, and now he has nothing in the heart of Rogge! She couldn't help but feel a weakness, and inexplicably lost deeply. When Rogge used to wrap her around, she only felt sick and bored, but she was afraid of his power and could not defy Rogge's orders too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, when she understands that Rogge does not care about her life and death, the loss in her heart is so indescribable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally spoke, her voice full of embarrassment, no confidence in the past in front of Rogge: "Rogge, I am here..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge interrupted her and smiled and said: "Is it for Rumsfeld? Let’s just say it, according to his crime, it will definitely Execution. What are you going to do with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly was so shocked that he opened his mouth and couldn’t speak for a long time. She never thought that Rogge would be so calm and direct to express her intentions. This kind of transaction is a flash of thought in the heart of an elf who has always loved elegance, and it will be disgusting for a long time! She had wanted to conceal the condition with Rogge. I didn't expect it to be completely disrupted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge held his jaw with his hand and looked at the wind butterfly with interest. He could see her embarrassment and nowhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly opened his mouth several times, but he couldn’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge laughs, is it difficult to speak? Ok, let me start! Estimate what you can get, that is, your own body. There is a saying, in fact, I really don't want to say it. Now I am not interested in your body at all. So this condition, don't talk about it anymore. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge adults...but I... I don't look bad! And I.... or... still pure... How can there be no value at all?" The windy butterfly has been a bit sloppy. Now, she is like a gambler. In order to save her lover's life, she frantically flips all the pockets of her body and looks for chips that can be gambled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled more calmly, just looking at the butterfly. In the eyes of Rogge, the wind butterfly became more and more helpless. Finally, she cried out in a wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger adults...what do you want me to...how will I...as long as you are willing to let Rumsfeld..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge still doesn't talk, just watching the butterfly quietly. The wind butterfly cried for a while, finally vented some nervous emotions, and slowly put away tears. She raised her face from her own hands, which had been covered with tears and could not be said to be beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly," Rogge’s voice slowly cooled down, making the wind butterfly feel like a hail: "Ajani was rescued by aliens. How do you know the temple of living?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly face suddenly becomes pale, she does not dare to look at Rogge, can not help but shiver Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly, tell me everything you have done, some I know, some I don't know. I hope you don't have any Retain, if I have something to glare at me, then there is nothing to talk about between us. If you tell the truth, I will consider Rumsfeld." Now Rogge is completely paralyzed. Going to the warmth of the coat, completely revealing the essence of the iceberg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly has completely collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Rumsfeld, she had decided to pay all the price she could pay, but now her last pride and dignity are lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She once thought of using her own force to rob Rumsfeld, but then she dismissed the idea, because to rob people, they must pass through The temple of living. She really did not know how to rescue people from Rogge, not to mention that Elder Chess actually took care of Rumsfeld and the sacrificial people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly began to talk about it, with intermittent sobs in between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feelings of Wind Butterfly and Rumsfeld are very deep, and she is even willing to pay any price for him. When Rogge began to rectify Rumsfeld, and could not help but threaten her to yield, the wind butterfly in his heart fainted the idea of ​​overthrowing Rogge. Although she saw with her own eyes that the elves were aggressive under the leadership of Rogge, Rogge's darkness became her best excuse to comfort herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the heart of the butterfly, if the whole elf family's survival is to change to Rumsfeld, she will be willing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clever as a butterfly, the dark nature of what Rogge has done, and these have had a major impact on the elves' traditions. She immediately became keenly aware of the crux of the problem, lost the traditional elf, can she be called an elf? Wind Butterfly knows that the temple is most afraid of the emergence of a new Elf King Road, Chris, to introduce the Elf to the dark abyss. Therefore, Wind Butterfly recorded Rogge's actions on a secret letter and transmitted it to the Great Temple of the Elves using the secret method of the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind butterfly is very clever, she knows that the elders have completely fallen to the side of Rogge, only the Great Elves have sufficient authority and strength to suppress the elders And Rogge, and the sacrifices will never tolerate these things that Rogge did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was really right, the anger of the sacrifices, and the butterfly continued to approach Rogge, monitoring his every move. After Rogge sacrificed the Elf Melan in order to kill the Grand Duke, the temple was finally completely irritated! The sacrificial priests have already planned several sets of plans, gradually recovering the rights of the elders, and using their supremacy to obtain sufficient authority. Just as the temple was ready to take back the ‘the dark side of the moon’ in the hands of Rogge, Hilo blessed, and Rogge was assassinated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly suddenly felt that the sky in the north is also so clean and high...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the leadership of the temple, the situation of the elves suddenly became extremely sinister, even to the brink of extinction. Wind Butterfly faintly felt that he had done something wrong. Perhaps, it is only Rogge's unscrupulous practice that will bring opportunities for the elves to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Louis the Great, a great empire of mankind, said: "After I die, it will flood it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but fate opened with her A big joke, Rogge was resurrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of heaven and earth during his resurrection, the horror magic that was exerted after the resurrection, left a mark of immortality in the heart of the wind. Now in her heart, there is an instinctive fear of Rogge. Half of this fear comes from the fear of Rogge's unfathomable strength, and the other half is inexplicable. She also can't tell the fear of reason. This is the fear that comes from the deepest part of her soul, exactly the same as the fear of seeing ***. She used to feel this fear in Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current wind butterfly, facing Rogge, has completely lost the will to struggle and resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, what she doesn’t know is that the great change between heaven and earth is the ninth knight Heinrich, and the Heinrich that supports Rogge’s horror magic is also . Only after the poor Ninth Cavalier was deceived into this space, I don’t know what year and month to find the way back home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly finally finished talking, she lowered her head, shivering slightly, afraid to see Rogge. She only felt that she was facing a huge iceberg, and the chill that was constantly spreading almost frozen her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind Butterfly," Rogge finally spoke. "The little tricks you put behind me are not too big. I understand why you hate so much." I don't know if your luck is good or bad. I was assassinated at the most critical moment when the temple seized power. Now you also see what is the city of gods under the leadership of the temple. "Breakfast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly looked up, just wanted to talk, and was interrupted coldly by Rogge: "I know, you would rather sacrifice the entire elves Also, change back to your lover's survival and freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly was hit again, and the tears could not stop flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly said: "Look at what you didn't hide from me, I will talk to you! Rumsfeld is brave and brave The martial arts is high, and the belief in Hilo is incomparably firm. It is a rare talent. Unfortunately, his dedication to the glorious tradition of the elves is also the same. He is a model of the traditional elves. But because of this, from one At first, he is destined not to be used for me, and even become my biggest stumbling block. In my heart, your value is far less than that of Rumsfeld. He can't kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly suddenly stood up, she wanted to start, but under the cold and calm eyes of Rogge, all the courage was lost bit by bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind butterfly, don't mess around again! Your innocence and childishness have ruined the life of the soldier's life of four hundred 'months'! I just wanted to kill you!" Roger's leisurely appearance is in stark contrast to the coldness of his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, all the heart defenses of Wind Butterfly have collapsed. Suddenly, she seems to understand something, silently wiped her tears and went to Luo In front of the grid, Ying Ying stumbled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took care of a little messy pale gold, raised her pretty unparalleled face, said in a plain and sweet voice: "God made Adult, I have understood my destiny. You can freely ask for the conditions you want, I will satisfy you, as long as you can spare ramsfield life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the wind butterfly, smiled faintly: "Wind butterfly, you know that I am not interested in your body now. Go back, wait for Rumsfeld, the elders will be yours The betrayal made a ruling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly smiled and the whole room lit up at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God makes an adult, you are a lascivious person. And I, the wind butterfly, is the most beautiful elf woman in the entire green sea. Can't I compare?" Ajia Ni?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head: "Ajani sleeps beside me, I can have a peace of mind and a sweet dream. And you When I sleep next to me, I have to be wary in my sleep that I will have a thorn into my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly's face changed, she As soon as he gritted his teeth, he stood up and began to undress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every action of the wind butterfly is so elegant and so full of beauty. At this moment, undressing seems to have become a beautiful dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the wind butterfly is innocent and stands proudly in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parts of her body are so perfect, the skin is white and soft, there is a halo of light in the moonlight, it seems to have a touch of cloud I am lingering and rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly slowly lifts both sides of the body and slowly rises. Her left foot was also put away, only the toes of the right foot point to the ground. However, like a statue of the most mysterious and beautiful, she did not shake her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes the adults" the sound of the sound of the butterfly seems to come from the cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you are seeing is the most beautiful body in the elf, it has not been seen by other eyes. And this body is still an outstanding one. Warrior, one of the few sacred guardians of the elves. You have it, not only beautiful, but also a sharp sword. The tip of the sword will always point to what you pointed out. Direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge also had to admire the beautiful and brilliant martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still shook his head coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she quickly gained courage again and walked to the front of Rogge with the most beautiful gait, like a flower filled with petals , fell at the foot of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God makes adults, I can also give my wisdom for you. I can learn everything you specify for me and apply it to your designated place. You will find it hard to find a good student who is as smart and self-disciplined as I am. In addition, I will dedicate all my dignity to you. No matter what shame you make me do. I will be very happy to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reveals the expression of thinking, he gently strokes the pale gold of the butterfly, asks: " You have given so much, what have you reserved for yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the wind butterfly did not hesitate: "I left my last pride. There is love. I hope you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiles at the butterfly, do you remember the words I said to you? I only want you, don't want your heart! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly shuddered, still squatting on the ground, and replied: "So God makes the adults, are you promised?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice has a trembling joy, expectation, and sorrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what else do you need? These are all that I can come up with. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took out a magical white scorpion and thought about it, the silver light in his eyes slowly lit up.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind Butterfly immediately felt the endless magic gathered toward Rogge. She looked up in surprise, just to see the silver light in the eyes of Rogge, and suddenly remembered something in her heart, I couldn't help but shake my body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver light in Roger's eyes is getting brighter and brighter, and the magic of the gathering is as strong as the raging waves.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One magic symbol of each color illuminates in the air, driven by Rogge’s spiritual power, floats on the magical white scorpion, melts into the sea like a drop of water. An extremely complex magical array is beginning to be childlike. Then the air is condensed into rows of magical spells of silver, which are also integrated into the magical white.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge refers to a bomb, a blood red at his fingertips! This small group of blood fog floated to the center of the magic array, forming a blood red three戟.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gaze of the wind butterfly, a magic scroll is made in a way that she has never heard of! The wind butterfly suddenly feels that he has been unconscious for a long time. The ground underestimated this sleek, bloated god. Although countless people, including the temple's rituals, have proved their man's horror with their own end, but every time I see Rogge, the wind butterfly will always Involuntarily feel disgusted and contemptuous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
