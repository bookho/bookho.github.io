			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stepped out of the study and walked to a separate small courtyard in the depths of the courtyard. A few ancient branches and trees are sloping and horizontal, and this courtyard is covered and sullen, which is chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtyard is heavily guarded, and the brightly guarded guards are just furnishings, and there are several magic traps in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one small two-story building in the small courtyard. The outer wall of the bluestone is covered with dead vines, and the narrow windows look dark. The small building was surprisingly quiet, and all the sounds in the building were cut off by silent enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge pushed the door open and walked straight into a large room on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large bed in the middle of the room. Relo is naked and panting in bed. The lingering light in his eyes saw Rogge push the door in, and the muscles on his face twitched involuntarily. It’s just that he can now command, just his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relo's lower body was wrapped in thick gauze, still immersed in a large pool of blood. At the bedside, a thin and dry old woman is slowly picking up a tool with a different shape and exquisiteness with her dry hands. The room was filled with a thick smell and bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath comes from a strange World of Warcraft lying on the floor, looks like a tiger like a wolf, with a few fleshy edges on the back. World of Warcraft is dying, and the blood of the darkness of the beach is not expanding. Between its legs, there should be only one huge wound at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman danced with her hands and sang a spell in a hoarse voice. In the twinkling of an eye, the powerful healing magic driven by the pure divine power was applied to Relo's body one after another, and his pale face quickly became a blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Rogge came in, the old woman smiled a few times like a nightingale, and the body of this kid is so good that there is nothing to say! Those who are in the big mansion will definitely be crazy for him, and they don’t know which one will eventually get the soul contract. You must be sure to sell a good price! Ok, my things are all playing, you slowly entertain this kid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman put all the knives into a very heavy huge steel box, picked it up, trembled and went out, not to Luo Marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge did not care about her rudeness, but smiled: You are slow. You will have to worry about it in the future, don't let him die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry! You guys are good to me, I will not do anything about you. The husky voice of the old woman went down the stairs all the way, and then stopped abruptly, and there was a silent enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extremely unreasonable and eccentric old woman is one of the most powerful physicians in the Chaoshan Legion. When Rogge really promised to use all the money from the sale of the Delaware prisoners to the warriors, the old woman suddenly ran to him and said that she could find her in the future. Rogge had doubts about her skills, but her imaginary medical skills were undoubtedly in the torment of Relo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of eyesight is Rogge? It’s early to see that the length of this old woman’s castration of Relo is exactly the same every day, and the knife is extremely elegant, and every guarantee is guaranteed. Relo tasted the greatest pain. The operation of returning to Relo from World of Warcraft to transform him into a doll of a lady is also difficult for the dead spirits. But the old woman was slashing like a wind, and after a series of dazzling knives, everything was done. The next few sacred powerful healing magic effects are not worse than the high-level light master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog didn’t think that this old-fashioned woman with evil feelings would use the Holy Healing Magic. She used the darkness or the unrelenting healing magic. The fat man suddenly remembered Kate, who also used the sacred vindictiveness, which really convinced Macbeth's assertion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is power, and the attributes of power have nothing to do with good and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was sitting quietly on the bed, just looking at the pale and handsome face of Relo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man patted Relo’s face and smiled at Me: I will draw his soul for a while. Once the soul is taken out, I can't put it back. What do you have injected into my body on the day of the last chance? As soon as you said it, I will let you go. If you are afraid of being chased by Druid, I can also protect you. Even the wrath of the sky has been killed by me. Will I be afraid of other Druids? Although your Relo has been tortured, but after he has raised his wounds, you can have a very happy life, maybe in bed is definitely more powerful than before, haha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge nodded. You have voluntarily given up the last chance to save your lover. I really don't understand. Since I went to the north, I have never done anything to offend you Druid. Even the sky anger sent people to kill me once. I also thought about it. As a result, you came to me one after another. Do you think I am very bullied? Very good, you have followed me for a while, I will let you see how I manipulate and extract the soul! Maybe it will help you a little bit of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is already deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dark green coat in the rose from the small building, her pale gold short dance under the night sky, a time of glamorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she’s already in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the existence of silent enchantment, the guards outside the small building could not hear the sound that would only exist in hell in the building. But the rose was enough to listen to one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the departure of Rose, Rogge also walked out of the building. His expression is relaxed and happy, and the feeling of revenge has always been so beautiful. The fly in the ointment is that although Relo is a good man, and he holds the food in his hand, he knows very little, and it is incredible. Up to now, Rogge only knows that Relo is following the endless ocean of Druid in the South, nothing more. Even the endless ocean is neither male nor female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked back at the small building and sneered. If the Druids know the end of Relo, will they be so unscrupulous to find their own troubles? Falling into the hands of the fat man is not a matter of holding a mortal heart, because death is only the beginning of pain. For example, if the heart is gray, it must be that the rest of the pain of Relo is only the soul to accept the death flame burning. She will inevitably pretend to obey, and then wait for the opportunity to destroy the soul of Relo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled a bit. How can she make her so happy? The most effective way to torture a soul, besides pain, there is shame. Relo’s purgatory career has just begun to open the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge walked out of the courtyard, the butler was already standing in the cold wind waiting for him for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger, Master Rockefeller, said that during this period of time, he was not busy, and he did not invite Rogge to visit the Great Snow Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded. He knew that at the moment of the religious war, Rockefeller Ten would reject his request. It’s not too late for him to sink into the car. I’m going to the Holy Snow Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler is a well-behaved person, immediately said: Adult, are you going to be safe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s brow impatiently wrinkled, just commanded: Go to the car! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler did not dare to say more, and led his life. A moment later, a carriage with a Rogge coat of arms drove out of the Prince’s House and drove to the Ice and Snow Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the carriage disappeared into the corner of the street, the butler closed the gate. He was worried, repeated thinking and repeated, and finally decided to let Rogge go to the big temple of ice and snow to talk to others, at least to tell Rogge the most favored little sister brought back. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward believes that with the experience of the giants for decades, this beautiful woman with a pair of green eyes must have fascinated the princes. The prince is a big man, it’s useless to shoot him straight, and he has to seize the opportunity to be more loyal to the pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stumbled from a thick magic book. Her gold was quite messy, she had a lot of blood in her eyes, and she even had two eye bags on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before waiting for the housekeeper to finish, her eyes suddenly ignited two groups of fire, and grabbed his collar, roaring: What do you say? ! Did he run to the Great Snow Temple alone? Why don't you say it early! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler thinks that even though she is not refrained from being groomed and angry, every move is also flattering and tempting, and the heart is sure that the prince is destined to be This little goblin is fascinated by death, so he is very proud of his loyal loyalty to this watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goblin himself ran to Androni's room, forcibly dragging her out of the warm big bed, and then went to the Rouge's study in the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, everyone has gathered in the study. Froya asked about it in a circle, and no one knew why Rog would go to the Great Snow Temple. But at this time, he went to the base camp of the silver saints alone, and the danger is imaginable. Froya's eyes burned with flaming fire, she couldn't care so much, and slammed, and took a heavy shot of the table elders, please go to the Ice and Snow Temple to explore and see if he is still there. By the way, check the defense structure of the temple. Bauhinia Butterfly, you immediately mobilize all the troops that can be mobilized. Once we decide to rob people, you must lead the army to attack the Great Temple and contain those ice and snow mage and church warriors. Remember to set fire! I will give you some magical potions, and when they are put into the fire, they will produce a lot of smoke with a paralysis effect. Our warriors will not have to deal with my special pharmaceutical agents beforehand. Robsky, you immediately find out where the home of the high-ranking church members of the Silver Religion are, and then bring some people. Once we start, how many people can you grab, and then bring them to the Great Temple. . Don't catch women, catch more kids! Ok, if Rogge doesn't come back in two hours, let's go to the Great Snow Temple! Let's move now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a difficult way to repair the face: the big temple of ice and snow is very defensive, and my old man may not find anything...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froah's eyes flashed with the light of danger, staring at Hughes, unceremoniously: there is no more difficult to enter than Dragon! In a word, are you going to go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and shook his head, but he ventured out of the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Froya’s room fluctuated, and the black and silver *** sneaked out from the void. She looked around the messy room, looking at a magic book that was marked with a mark, and a thick note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***It seems to be a slight sigh, and a magic book and a ring slowly appear in the palm of your hand. Put these two things on the table of Froya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The eyebrows suddenly rose, and the body standing in the air slowly turned over. She looked up at the ceiling, the face was frosty, and the silver awns in her eyes gradually lit up. In the twinkling of an eye, there was nothing but a strong silver light in the whole room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of the emperor, this is a dark basement that was swallowed up by the raging silver rays! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, I can see clearly, only the cold silver plaque in the crystal ball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! In the long screams, the female mage suddenly grabbed her face with her sleeves! She seems to be extremely painful, and she fell to the ground and rolled over! Under the radiance of silver, her black robe began to appear green smoke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! I can't see it! My eyes, what happened to my eyes? ! Her voice screamed with endless fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the corner of the room suddenly flew an iron helmet and smashed the crystal ball on the altar. The silvery room full of room gradually faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you do in addition to the disaster? This time, the squeaky, unpleasant voice was less ironic, leaving all the anger and panic: I told you not to provoke him! It’s getting big trouble now! You haven't been a soul sorcerer for 30 years. I really don't understand how your mentor chooses things like you! It’s cheaper to burn your eyes. If it’s not that I’m moving fast, you’re burnt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to die, die on your own! Don't drag me down! The voice was still roaring, but the female wizard was completely in pain and fear of eternal darkness, just crying and crying. Br , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door opened and Froya rushed into the room like a gust of wind. She dragged a large box made of ice sea gold, chanting a spell, and the lid opened. There are many small squares in the box, and there are magic props of various sizes. Froya fluttered with both hands and began to arm herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni entered the room behind Fulia. She casually looked at Fu Luoya's magic book, and her eyes finally fell on a magic book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
