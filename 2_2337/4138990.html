			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book is the second day of the sky<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human! Do you think that I am What is the significance of the number in front of Istarazze?" Black Dragon snarl roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it makes sense!" The fat man waved his hand and the two holy churches standing on the mountain immediately shot two magic arrows. The magical arrows fly like electricity. When they are still in the air, one will make a sharp scream, while the other will make a strange khaki. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Istalaze has already seen the horror power contained in these two magical arrows, and can not help but growl and nervous. Only he has three faucets. After a rushing and chaotic dragon trio, the three dragon language magics are almost at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His huge dragon body enveloped a magic shield, and he added a speeding magic to himself, and finally the mouth of the black dragon faucet went to the temple on the mountain. The archer spurted a black glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment there are three priests guards around the two archers, who together support a magic shield. The top of the mountain suddenly illuminates. In the gorgeous flame, the magic shield is combined with the light of the three gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three sacred mages shook and their faces were pale. But they immediately recovered and began to mourn the spell. Prepare to deal with the next wave of attacks by the three dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the attack magic is invalid, Istarazze roared in anger. He did not think that these priests would be so powerful and skillful. The timing of the magic they cast together was quite good, and it was worthy of the title of the War Mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three dragons can cast spells separately. But he has only one body and only so much power. At the same time, the weakness of the spell is that the power of each magic is greatly weakened. However, Istaraz has three different faucet attributes, and the melee combat power is no less than the high-end dragon, plus three times the speed of casting, it can indeed arrogate the general high-end dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon suddenly swooped and rushed to the church on the mountain. Two shots of the magical arrows in the air turned a turn, and turned back to the three dragons. And two magic arrows flew in the face. The three faucets of Istarazze roared together and the speed suddenly increased. The four magic arrows were shackled behind them, and they rushed to the sanctuary on the mountain peaks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six blessed a variety of protective magical sacred warriors armed with giant shields, flying up and greeted the three dragons from the front! After a roar, six templars were hit by Istarazze, and a sacred church was shot by a dragon and a giant shield. The blood spurted from the sky. It was only blocked by six churches. The momentum of the dragon has finally slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Fengyue’s mouth is slightly open, and he blows out a chilly atmosphere. This cold wind has already crossed the distance of kilometers and boasted on Istaraz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is rushing, and the entire dragon body is sealed by a huge ice. Although the ice is almost formed while being blown up under the horror of the three dragons, how can this battle be a short burst of time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for Istaraze to escape and the figure of Fengyue has appeared above him. The death slashed into a black gas, and slammed into the back of the dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible power of the wind and moon has obviously not recovered. This knife does not even cut the tough, unimaginable body of the dragon, but just like a chisel Insert the dragon's torso deeply. The dragon fired a painful dragon, and the body twitched. The amber faucet in his center turned over and tried to give a little wind to the moon. Fengyue has already pulled out the slashing knife and disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four magical arrows flew in and fell into the dragon's tortoise, and four different damage forces left four horrible wounds on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two magic arrows fly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three evil dragons roared, and they blew a faint flame ripple around them, finally destroying the two magic arrows in the air, then he turned around and rushed It instantly appears in the distant sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least Fengyue has enough chance to smash his flesh, so that. Escape will eventually become a disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ista Laze has three faucets in the finished glyph. The five dragon eyes are all staring at the wind and the moon, and each of the three dragons is lit up! Each of the three groups of rays draws a thin light. In front of the leader of Istarazze, a large amount of light is synthesized, and it is silently hitting the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light column has an extremely powerful destructive power. When it crosses the sky, two magic arrows are still affected by power. It turned out to be a fly ash in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ista Laze has a pleasing color in the eyes. However, at this time, the reflection in his dragon's eye is no longer a misty landscape, but a night sky flashing with countless stars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon’s eyes flashed in doubtful colors. He clearly saw that the distant sky is still covered with thin clouds during the day, but his own number of weeks The range of meters is actually a deep night, and countless stars are floating around him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubts in the dragon's eye turned into fear in a blink of an eye. He was surprised to find that the huge death beam in front of him was becoming extremely violent and completely out of his control! And that wild magical power is still expanding, warming up, burning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ista Laze is clear, but the horrible power contained in the death beam in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of horrible fireballs with a diameter of 100 meters blasted in the sky, and the hot wind that followed was swept over several kilometers. Even the churches had to hold up magical protection to avoid being burnt by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball slowly dispersed, and Istaraze barely floated in the air, and there were dozens of large and small scars on his body. Three of his five dragon eyes are rushing out of the blood. The other one is tightly closed, but only one dragon eye can barely open. His giant mouth is also somewhat distorted, and his mouth is black and black, leaving only a few teeth falling. This once-infamous dragon is so embarrassing at this moment. His trauma is not really heavy, but the magic of the body has also been affected, and some of them burned. His internal organs were also seriously injured. This is the real blow to the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night and the stars have dissipated, and the sky has returned to the white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge figure slowly emerges. Appeared in front of Istarazze. Nafi sat on his shoulder, and a pair of green eyes stared at the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ista Laze, I feel that the taste of your soul is very sweet." Rogge smiled. He reached out and grabbed a large, disproportionate flame sword from the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Don't kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon God will punish you for arrogance! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the threat of life and death, Istaraz’s two faucets answered the opposite, while the central amber faucet remained silent. With only one remaining one, I watched the fat man quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you kill you?" The fat man asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's black dragon faucet immediately screamed: "As long as you are willing to let me go, you can get my territory, palace and all the treasures! And, 渎God, I can tell you a lot about the secret of the Dragon God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't do this!" The golden faucet roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! I have had enough of you!" The black dragon faucet slammed back: "I have already fed up with you, if the sorcerer will take you from me If I cut off my body, I will be very happy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man came to a bit of interest, said: "The secret of the dragon god? A little meaning, say to listen Listen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like this..." Black Dragon led the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't say!" The golden faucet roared again. The amber faucet is always quiet. Do not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that it was just that moment. The fat man has already waved his sword and left the flesh behind the evil dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog’s sword is burning with the sacred flame of the celestial flame, slowly falling, condensing above the dragon, faintly said: “Now you can talk "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Istalaze's entire body is shaking slightly, he struggled for a long time before he barely climbed from the ground. In addition to the sacred dragons and colorful dragons that rely on powerful magic, the meat wing is a small weakness for any dragon. The curse of the bird is so painful that the three dragons can't afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the golden faucet has finally remained silent, and the black faucet is hard to say: "Hey, I know that you are always looking for the secrets of the gods. Although the dragon god rarely shows miracles in peacetime, his mystery and power are unquestionable. In fact, the dragon gods and miracles are all over the continent, and now I am in front of you. To some extent, it can be said to be the dragon god. A miracle. Or, a cruel punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened quietly. The wind and moon appeared quietly beside him, and Nafi was still sitting on Rogge's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Many years ago, I was a strong and arrogant black dragon. At that time, I was convinced of my strength and even respected the Dragon God. As everyone knows, among the higher dragons, the dragon god is particularly concerned about the Yinlong family. I was extremely dissatisfied with it. After defeating several powerful silver dragons, I even began to curse the dragon god! So there is a young silver dragon. Wilram, come to challenge me. But the despicable silver dragon has already received the god of the dragon god before the final battle. The dragon language magic he displayed is not exactly the level of a silver dragon, and the power is straight. Chasing the sacred dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Istaraz is obviously excited, and the closed dragon eye slowly begins to seep out the blood line. He gasped and said: "But even this is the case, he may not be able to beat me! But watching the war is not good, the Dragon God actually borrowed the power of Verlam! At that time, I realized that the existence of my custom is simply impossible. Competing with divine power. Dragon God uses the dragon language of Verlam Law, the curse that can never be erased is imposed on me. Since then, my body has produced these two new dragons. Under the curse of the dragon god, I became a real monster. All dragons In addition to the double-headed jade dragon summoned by magic in the Elven Empire, how many dragons existed? I have been living with these two dragons for thousands of years, and I have to endure their never-ending, never-ending preaching. This is why I am so crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man frowned and said: "Things about the Dragon God!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon has been breathing for a while, and said: "The gods, you may think that there is only one dragon. Just like the human race and most dragons think. But the dragon god actually has three Or, it means three forces. According to your method of dividing the human race, the three dragon gods represent the three forces of order, chaos and neutral. This is why I have three heads. You want to study the power of the dragon god, You need to go to Moonlight Dragon City. In the innermost part of Dragon City, the dragon pool that has not been dried for thousands of years has the power that has been blessed by the order dragon god. I think you understand what I mean, there will be at least a bit of order dragon. God's divine power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge listened to the dragon and finished the last sentence. Faintly said: "This secret is not enough to buy your life. Do you have anything to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon seems to be sighing, saying: " I know that it will be like this. But I have nothing to say, you can do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and brought up the Great Flame, saying: "Actually, you want to destroy Moonlight Dragon City through my hand. But it doesn't matter. I will seriously consider your suggestion in your powerful soul. Moreover, you are too small to see my ability. The three dragon gods have cursed you. Then there should be three different powers in your body. I don't need to go to Moonlight Dragon City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flame sword was lifted high, but it did not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s face was gloomy and turned to look at the distant horizon. There, a little rainbow of light shimmered. At this point, the rainbow light is expanding at a rapid speed. In the blink of an eye, the whole body is almost transparent. The mysterious and beautiful dragon that circulates in the body of the seven colors appears in front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man has excellent eyesight. When he sees this dragon, he immediately recognizes that she was the colorful dragon Tedelia who was present when Vena and the Silver Dragon King battled. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger's brows are slightly wrinkled. He instinctively feels that there are two volcanoes in the dragon's eye, and there is an inexpressible anger inside. The colorful dragon and the sacred dragon are extremely rare dragons. Legend has it that these two dragons are the transcendental existence between the high-end dragons and the dragon gods. The sacred dragon is known for its unpredictable and powerful dragon language magic, while the colorful dragon is a natural fighter. Their attacks, defenses, and speed are rarely matched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is really not willing to anger a colorful dragon, although he does not understand why Tedera is angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this question was quickly solved by Tedelia himself: "I know your name is Rogge, and you know what you did recently. When the gods created the world, they agreed that the sky belongs to the dragon that is free to soar. But now, there are too many dragons falling for you. There are so many elegant and majestic figures in the vast sky! Even Some dragons are beginning to face the crisis of destruction! As a colorful dragon, my duty is to maintain the balance and prosperity of the dragon. I would not interfere with the activities of the Terran, but you have violated the dignity of the entire dragon. I, Tedelia, you will never be allowed to hunt a dragon like a hunting beast! And it seems that you are planning to invade the unbreakable area of ​​the Dragon God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The fat man indulged and bowed to Tedelia with respect and said: "The beautiful and noble colorful dragon, you really have reason to be angry. Only Istaraz is a sinner cursed by the dragon god... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& "He was first a dragon." Ted Leisen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog piled up a flattering smile and said, "Well, he is a dragon first. Then, if I give it to you, you can let Are we leaving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful dragons said in a majestic manner: "Swear by your gods, and you will no longer be in the field of dragons, then you can leave." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will swear!" The fat man was overjoyed, and immediately raised the flame sword and prayed loudly: "The god of heaven, In the name of the order of the Fryemir, I Rogge swears here, no longer invading the sacred and noble dragon family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oath is finished, Luo Ge looked at the colorful dragon again and smiled and asked: "Look. I have already sworn, can we go now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ted In the eyes of Leia, she flashed the disgusting color. As she flew to Istaraz, she said, "You can go, remember your vows! If you dare to swear, even your Lord God. ! Punish you, and I will give you the same due punishment "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the whole world suddenly quiet down at this moment. Tedelia has not heard a single voice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s all over the body immediately flashing the blazing seven-color brilliance, instantly shattering the silence that envelopes everything! When silence is broken. The colorful dragon happened to hear the last sullen note of Dragon Language Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with Tedelia’s magical resistance, he immediately felt a numbness in the whole body. With such a short moment, she could not move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful dragon was extremely surprised, and she struggled to turn her head and finally saw who was throwing the dragon language magic to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sacred dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tedreia made an earth-shattering roar, and her whole body suddenly lit up with a brilliant light that people could not look directly at. Instantly destroyed all the magic that was imposed on her. However, Rogge is holding a giant sword of fire, and it has already rushed like lightning, and he slammed into the body of the colorful dragon with his sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword tip of the Flame Great Sword quickly plunged into the body of the colorful dragon, and moved forward to half a meter deep and could no longer advance. The fat man was shocked. He died, but the giant sword was as nailed to the colorful dragon body. He said nothing could be drawn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is at this time. Roger's eyes glowed in front of him, and he immediately released the giant sword, and the figure quickly went as far as a light smoke. It wasn't until a few hundred meters away that Rogge's chest was cracked, and there were a few faint blood marks on his skin. The fat man jumped in the heart, just if he didn't see the machine fast. And the sacred dragon has added a dragon spell with a slow effect to the colorful dragon in time, then Tedelia's catch has already opened the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Xiaofengyue appeared. Her lichens and her hair were a bit messy. The blade of the Death Scythe was full of gaps, and the tip of the knife disappeared. And the colorful dragons have a few more minor wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue looked at the sickle in his hand and frowned at the colorful dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge reached out and grabbed the Dragon Soul Gun from the void. Dealing with the colorful dragons, this speed and defense are high and outrageous. The fate's blade, which the fat man is good at, is not enough to cut her defense. And he is not good at martial arts. If you use magic, the magical resistance of the colorful dragon is equally strong. Rogge's attacking magic is enough to clean her body. Only the dragon language magic of the sacred dragon can give the colorful dragon a certain threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tedreia is another dragon, Rogge only feels a flower in front of him, he immediately wants to think, the figure is dark and clear, and has already flashed Hundreds of meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only the goal of the colorful dragon this time is not a fat man, but a small wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Fengyue gradually blurred, and before the colorful dragon flew, she had already flashed a kilometer away, leaving only a residual image in the original place. If the speed is single, the wind and moon at this moment is still a lot faster than the colorful dragon, and she will never fight hard with Tedelia. Therefore, they chased the results in a while, but Tedelia also got a few punches in the wind, and was stripped of a few dragon scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful dragon is another dragon, suddenly changed the tactics and turned to the sacred dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the colorful dragon and the sacred dragon should be reciprocally present, but Gregory saw Tedera rushing, already scared It flashes and has already escaped into the void. However, the colorful dragons struggling to jump, even chasing Gregory into the void! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, there was a screaming scream between the heavens and the earth, and the sacred dragon tumbling from the void, sprinkling the big dragon’s blood, falling The ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed a little, his hands moved, igniting a magic scroll in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden loss of color between heaven and earth, and everything was still. Because at this moment, time has stopped flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful dragons that just jumped out of the void stared at the sacred dragon below, and solidified in the air in a forward-looking posture. The distance between the kilometer and Gregorian is only a short moment in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the day re-lights, between her and Gregorian. Suddenly there was more fat figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in time for the colorful dragons to react, Rogge inhales, clenches his fists, and then hits Tedelia's nose silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the silence, Rogge lit up a burst of seven-colored light and swallowed him quickly. When the unimaginable sting was uploaded from the skin, the fat man found himself making a terrible mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who said that the colorful dragons will only fight melee? She also has a dragon's breath! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat body is entwined with a colorful dragon as a bone. He flew diagonally to one side. In the space around his body, everything is slightly twisted. The dragons of the colorful dragons immediately dimmed, but they refused to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge has been so painful to roar, his speed has been greatly reduced, and even did not find Tedera’s pair of dragon eyes shining with the cold light Getting closer and closer to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as Xiaofengyue’s figure appearing around the colorful dragons. The ice of Senlan once again seals Tedelia’s body, and then again The second place was broken by the colorful dragon. At the same time, the strength of the wind and the wind are far from the past, and there is no means to restrain Tedelia. All her attacks are not enough to cause the colorful dragon to die. Therefore, the colorful dragon simply ignores the wind and the moon, only to attack Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, in the dragon eye of Tedelia, two green brilliances are suddenly reflected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nefie sat on Rogge's shoulder, blue-haired flying, the pair of emerald eyes, watching Tedelia coldly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of the colorful dragon became more and more fierce, and she could no longer maintain her flight attitude and swayed to the ground. Her dragon's body also began to reveal a green light, and sometimes the meat pieces bulged and calmed down. A piece of crystal-like dragon scale is erected under the top of the crazy growing body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windy month stunned, she stared at Naifei coldly, and Naifei looked back at her with a weak look, her eyes drooping and it looked like It’s hard to add. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Fengyue appeared immediately behind the colorful dragon, and then blew a cold wind to Tedelia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the wind, the crystal dragon scales erected in pieces are snowflake, flying lightly from the body, flying in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tedreia made a low whistle. Her beautiful body has been completely deformed, and the crazy growth of the body tissue not only crushed her bones. And infected her internal organs. At the moment, the colorful dragon body. Almost all of the internal organs have grown at least twice and are tightly packed together. But they are still growing wildly. Squeezing Tedelia's last vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a colorful dragon that can be used in the plane between the planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is strong and strong, not afraid of all the power of destruction, but in the end, she is falling under the power of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tederia reluctantly opened the raised dragon's eye and glanced at Rogge who had already extinguished the dragon's body and was flying at her speed. Full force, a dragon that represents her last dignity, and then a seven-color rainbow of light in the body, turned and rushed to the dying Istalaze on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The fat man's forehead spurred up and rushed at full speed, trying to stop Tedelia. However, he suddenly stopped suddenly, and the windy moon suddenly appeared in front of him, and he resisted the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a suffocating rainbow on the ground...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When rainbow The light disappeared, and there was only one deep pit with a radius of several hundred meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary beautiful and powerful colorful dragon, and the three dragons carrying the curse of the Millennium Dragon God, have forever disappeared in the long stream of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man picked up the windy moon and rushed over the deep pit with lightning, and then an invisible force field instantly enveloped the space around 100 meters. Occasionally, there is a ray of light that will come to Rogge. That is the faint soul of the colorful dragon and the three dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last moment, the colorful dragon Tedelia burned her own soul with her legendary power and eroded with a rainbow of light enough to destroy the soul. The body and soul of myself and Istaraz. She knows that everything on the body of the dragon is invaluable in the eyes of these greedy human races. And Rogge will not let her and the soul of Istarazze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Tedelia is close to the power of God, as long as there is time, it can still suppress the power of crazy growth in the body. She knows better that if she chooses to yield, then no one will reject the allegiance of a colorful dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But between dignity and survival, for her, there is never a question of choice. The destruction behind the gorgeous rainbow is the ultimate destination of her brilliant life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that, in the endless sky, there are two more legendary figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the Great Hall of Light is always so soft and warm, yet it is dark and cold in the Temple of the Twins. Under the beautiful statue floating in the air, the invisible flame is burning endlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind, I am sorry, today I still have not been able to bring you a powerful soul. I am really useless..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood in the Temple of the Twins, staring at the floating statue. In his eyes, invisible and colorless, even the celestial flame of heaven without a sense of temperature was originally reflected locally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising flame has already immersed the statue's bare feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
