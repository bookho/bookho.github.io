			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Heavenly Chapter Five Overture in Hell<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter Five Overture<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one final step left from the stability of the Ayre Principality, that is, the Xia Shang Yi who has deep grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place of execution was originally scheduled to be held in the Grand Place in the west of the city, but because almost everyone in Latvia is going to see the execution ceremony, the Grand Plaza cannot be so Many people, so Rogge temporarily changed the execution location outside the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of execution, Latvia is almost out of the city, and there are many people around the execution ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty gambles line up in a square, which looks shocking. This time, not only Xia Shangzhi’s entire family, but also more than a dozen of his main accomplices. Almost every Latvian knows the names of these people. This time they can see their gallows with their own eyes, and the heart is naturally very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the temporary high platform, Rogge is sitting in danger, a solemn and majestic look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the high platform, a tall, fat, and savvy little official is doing his best to read the guilt of Xia Shang and others. He had been yelling for half an hour, sweating all over his body, and he had only read a third of his long book of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the accused officer could not support it, another equally tall, fat, and full-fledged accused officer took over his job. Despite the assistance of the sound-amplifying magic, in the noisy and cursing sounds of 100,000 people, what they chanted is still unclear. But it doesn't matter. As long as you see the ridiculous complaints in their hands, people are already angry, and new hatreds are coming to mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the impassioned accusation, nearly a hundred people were successively imprisoned. Sent to the gallows. Everyone hanging on the gallows was personally audited by Rogge, that is, there was no such thing as a company, and it was guaranteed that there would be no one who was angry. These people are sluggish and almost dragged onto the gallows. They all seem to default to their guilt. No one shouts or distinguishes for themselves. In fact, they have been unable to speak. Before being dragged onto the execution ground. Rogge has cut off their tongues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thunderous cheers, the pedals of the gallows were taken away. A body is suspended in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now are you satisfied?" Rogge smiled at the Doolin and Bauhinia Butterfly Road sitting around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not think that Rogge would actually be so embarrassed and killed so thoroughly. He has been kept in jail, and he doesn't know much about the situation outside. The Bauhinia butterfly knows that everyone on the gallows has a way to kill, but she doesn't take it for granted. He whispers: "These people are not all appointed to you. Occupy the area? The purpose of doing this is to transfer the hatred of the people to them. Now you will kill them again. At least in most hearts, you have changed from a traitor to a wise and kind Monarch. Isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled lowly and said, "This is nothing to you, good, good! The Knights of the Moonnight are really good. But Since the people in the occupied area have been hurt, I will give compensation. Apart from the big merchants and the big nobility, I am prepared to waive the two-year tax on the civilians in the occupied area. Maybe this is not enough, but it is always stronger than the old royal family? You must know that no matter what noble reasons are used for war, the most bitter people in the war are always people who have no self-defense ability. At least compared with the old royal family, I ask myself to bring the people a stable, peaceful and prosperous life. Live. Have you ever wanted to restore the old royal family? Is it really a good thing for the people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s brothers and sisters have some surprises, is it Rogge? Is it really a benevolent monarch? They can't refute Rogge. However, seeing Rogge's endless sizzling means, I always feel that there is something wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The execution was completed, and the next step was to declare that the occupied area was tax-free for two years, and it was naturally a thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last play was that Rogge’s two rebel leaders, Jonathan and Gujar, led the ministry and swore allegiance in public. Rogge announced on the spot to give them pardon. Not only that, but Rogge also announced a one-month amnesty for the still-resisting Rebels. As long as they return during this period, everything will not be investigated in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it be said that Rogge has already arranged these things on the same day? A cold current passed through her heart. Although the Bauhinia butterfly is also familiar with the strategy, but her strengths are fighting in the march after all, when it comes to politics, it is mostly on paper, and where is Rogge's rival? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that she was forced to drop, she could not help but sigh. Now she only hopes that the city of Yunxiao can understand her helplessness, and the natural goddess can forgive her betrayal. There is still a hint of fantasy in the Bauhinia butterfly. She wants to promote the reconciliation between Rogge and the city of the Clouds. In that case, she still has the opportunity to return to the belief of the goddess of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she still doesn’t know that this little fantasy has never been realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge said to Du Lin: "You have been with me for some time, but there has been nothing to do. There is something you need to do now. You are Choose a thousand out of the old department of Wright Fortress, it is best to find those who have difficulties in their family and are willing to work for the Principality. It is up to you to form an independent force. These fighters have only served for the Principality for three years. You can get freedom. At that time, they can choose to continue to join the army or to break away from the army as a civilian. In these three years, their army is the same as the soldiers of the Principality. I think these soldiers should have a family for them. "Help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger continued: "You took them to the Central Mountain Range to scout the orc tribe. The orc has a good breeding power, but don't When we don't care, we will merge into a large army. You don't have to go too far, as long as there is no large-scale orc activity near the Principality. What equipment is needed, even if you open your mouth."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& Nbsp; Du Lin was surprised to say: "You are not afraid of me with these artificial counter-attacks?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled. Road: "Dulin, I ask myself to have some ability to look at people. Since you have promised me, it will not be regrettable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin still does not give up Just ask: "If I really reversed it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said: "I decided to use you, I will let go. My enemy It’s not a country, it’s a strong one. If you are afraid of even a thousand small units, what else can I do? If you really don’t go back, then I’m not sure, it’s no big deal. Our North Warriors have always believed that the battlefield is the ultimate destination of the Warriors. The Wright Fortress is the most courageous warrior of the past coalition forces. Recently, Kerry’s several times wanted to completely solve the Wright Fortress problem, and I gave it back. Arranging this mission, but I want to bring these warriors out of Wright in batches. Even if you really rebel, it is better for these fighters to kill the battlefield than to be killed in prison."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was silent and finally said: Duoxieluoge adults "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Roger nodded and talked with butterfly bauhinia military training to the Duchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the fat man. The most precious thing that Charlie left for him was the complete knight training system. This training system was born out of the training method of the Holy Knights of the Bright Church, but it is different. The whole training method has removed the sacred knight's belief-based magical techniques and special combat techniques, but has increased a number of ordinary vindictive combat techniques and actual knights' independent combat tactics. After all, the Holy Knights have a large number of Masters of Light, and the fighting forces are far superior to the pure Knights. Many of their tactics are not what the ordinary Knights can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this system, as long as time passes, well-trained knights will continue to emerge. Only the Holy Knight has always relied heavily on excellent equipment. Charlie is no exception. If you want to fully develop your combat power, you must cooperate with many specially designed equipment. Rogge can form a new Spartan Knights, but the fragile fiscal and empty treasury of the Principality cannot fully support a large-scale Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie exhausted the training system to cultivate a strong knight similar to the golden lion, and the Bauhinia butterfly from the cold moon camp is familiar with the operations of various arms and Training, her training system can be very effective in training the rookie into a soldier on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly felt a move. The establishment of the Cold Moon Camp in the city of Yunxiao has been painstakingly cultivating these military and political talents for decades. What is the purpose? Is the wrath of the sky wanting to pass the emperor's addiction, or is the Druids ready to become the great power of the bright church that transcends the country? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the ultimate goal of Druid, Rogge is prepared to destroy the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back to Dresden, Rogge flipped through the latest treasury report. The Xiashan genocide has only 300,000 gold coins, and a considerable part of it is industry and art. However, during this time he has been spending money like water, and the money spent on the night dancers and shadows has exceeded 100. Thousand gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to spread the news of Wei Na to the Silver Dragon King, spread the world of the dragon. Rogge was also blackmailed by a hundred thousand gold coins. This shadow and the night dancers are asking the same price. I don't know if it's a good deal, let the fat man have nothing to do. Then count the expenses of the institutions of the Principality and the cost of training the troops by Bauhinia. Rogge suddenly discovered that in the next two months, the last gold coin in the treasury of the Principality will be exhausted, and it will not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty, finally poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the question of whether the wind and moon challenge the Silver Dragon King, the fat man is not worried. In the essay, he has already designated the place of decisive battle in Dresden. If the situation is unfavorable at the time, he is already on the ground of the fat man. He has already made a good idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the foxes, the most outstanding genius of the Silver Dragons for centuries is Nicholas. The possibility that the Silver Dragon King is stronger than the Silver Miracle is very low. What's more, there are black dragons on the sidelines, how can the Silver Dragon King leave the Moonlight Dragon City and accept such an unpredictable challenge? This shows that the wind and moon are unparalleled in wisdom, which is actually a method of radicalizing Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge disapproves, but he knows that the Silver Dragon King has lived for thousands of years, that is, the dragon's standard, but also the old man. It is really hard to be strong enough to be a good old Nicholas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the message has been sent, the rest will only wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, Rogge has returned to Dresden. As soon as he stepped into the Grand Duchy, the boss always greeted him with a strange look, and lowered his voice: "Princess Maryka asks you to come back once, and I will go to her room immediately. She has something to tell."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger's eyebrows are slightly elevated. Silently said: "I will go right away, you will come with me first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding a secluded place. The boss’s management succinctly described the important events that have taken place in the near future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after Princess Marika arrived in Dresden, the poet Relo came. When he was busy condemning the rebellion and chasing the Bauhinia butterfly, Marika and Relo openly entered the pair. Relo was always in the name of discussing poetry with Malika, and went to the Grand Palace to meet with Malika. Avoidance. The people of the Dagong government have already been talking about it, but they are involved in the imperial princess. I was afraid that Roger would be angry, so no one dared to inform Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "Is that Relo adult now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The boss shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger nodded. He looked as usual and went to the main building where the princess lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, Princess Marika sits in the middle. Julie only gave Rogge a chair and placed it at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince Rogge! I have been to Dresden for two weeks, and I saw you for the first time today. You are really busy!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and said: "This is no way. The rebellion in the territory must be settled for the first time, otherwise it will lead to a great disaster. Besides, these days are not Did you let Ryro accompany you? I heard that you are very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika, I didn’t expect Rogge to be indifferent, face I couldn’t help but pass a slap in the face. Julie whispered a little whispered: "It’s a useless man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles and sits, as if he didn’t hear Julie at all Say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika said: "Prince Rogge. I am coming to you today, I want to inform you that I have decided to stop our marriage and marry Relo!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said, "Mr. Marika, this joke is not appropriate! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malika is cold and cold: "This is not a joke!" What you care about is only the title of the prince, but in my eyes, love is more sacred than anything else! I have no choice but to stop you once. In fact, the Grand Duke of the Empire has already lifted you! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
