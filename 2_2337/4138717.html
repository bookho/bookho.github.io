			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few pots of ice water poured down, so Karajan and Chrisma responded a little angry. Two once-incoming angels are now murky in their eyes, leaving only endless despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge carefully searched the two of them carefully, leaving one inch without letting go, leaving two angels. Androni also checked the entire valley and dragged a lot of things back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the two found out a lot of things, including the heavenly mirror roulette of the two angels, the legendary and elves related Sheepskin scroll, and a small white jade horn. Androni came back with Chrisma's sabre 'Backwind' and part of the armor of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things used by the two giants of the Last Judiciary, needless to say, nature is excellent. Androni has a starry sky, and no longer sees other swords. Rogge is different. He easily identified the great value of the headwinds and the clouds, and collected them hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armor of the two giants is not so good, the east and the west are all terrible scratches, and even a piece of nail has a hole in it. The broken gap is black. Androni frowned and looked worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, ask what you want to ask! I always feel that this is a trap, it feels very strange! From the traces of their armor, start I am afraid that the strength is not under me. If he hides in the dark, it is a big trouble. We have to hurry up here and then leave here. If he has any wrong ideas, it is not easy in high sports. Hide the figure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge promised, but he did not agree. He woke up two embarrassing adventurous angels one by one, raised the sheepskin roll and the white jade horn in front of the two people, and smiled and asked: "The two adults, we can meet again. I don't have much time, you are very busy. Can you tell me with pleasure that both of these things are used?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrisma snorted, Kara Yang closed his eyes . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has some surprises. From this reaction, Kara Yang may have a harder bone. The two coming angels are clearly not afraid of death, and perhaps they have a secret way to preserve the mark of the soul after death. Although all their divine power and soul energy have been taken away, even the best doctors can only sustain their lives for a few days, but who knows if there are any strange magic or artifacts in the church that can make them regeneration. Of course, the guy is getting more and more unpredictable. When did she have to take away the soul energy, but leave a person's life and consciousness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was a little impatient, two extremely thin, sharp blue chips formed between her fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be tortured! It’s so old-fashioned! These dirty men, get rid of the best!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang and Chris Ma looked at each other and looked at Androni with contempt. Kara Yang even said: "You have a lot of nonsense, no wonder it looks like a woman. To tell you honestly, I once had a little boy because he looks a little like you! Haha, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge quickly stopped Androni in the rage, the young lady’s extreme disgust and madness to men, don’t make it at this time. Killing, casting, may wish to ask what you need to say. Moreover, with Rogge's understanding of the Church of Light, they should not be afraid of torture and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two adults," Rogge said with a smile. "I know that you are not afraid of death. You can even say that death can fully prove that you are supreme. Devotion. After you die, the soul is not only as simple as redemption, you will be rewarded by the Most High God, let me guess, is the divine power going further?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two angels are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I guessed it right. Redemption is your purpose. We may wish to make a deal, I will let you get redemption, and you, Also help me, tell me about the things you are looking for in the elves this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the Elves, Carayan and Chrisma His face has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't bother. We don't need any redemption. If you want to kill, you can hurry and you can use the penalty. See if we can stand it." Chrisma is cold and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the two angels are somewhat unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's think about it from another angle. How can we let the two souls stay in hell forever? No reincarnation. Chapter 12 of The Holy Scriptures. Redemption. Five sins, the seventeenth chapter has four uncleanness, the twenty-second chapter has heresy and blasphemy. Do you want me to continue to talk about it, or do you need me to list one of the two adults?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These crimes you said are not added to us! The things we do to the pagans are all about the belief in the supreme god!" Chrisma Said Shen Sheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I admit that the pagans are killing more and more merits. Even if it is tough, destroy, or kill the village, it doesn't matter. But... I want to say Not these." Rogge stood up and walked to Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Missy, I want to talk to them about 'private' content, you will be uncomfortable, can you..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni's eyes widened and he looked at Rogge in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not interested in both of them? Although this method of torture is not without, but there is no one else, you can’t get them yourself. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge can't smile, the Missy girl is really a lot of quirks, and immediately thought of that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Missy! Where do you want to go! I just scared them. I have no interest in men. I can only have a big beauty like you. Let me lose my mind..." He stared at Androni with a fascinating look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni immediately lowered a layer of frost on his face and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her walking away, Rogge squatted in front of the two angels, carefully looking at their bodybuilders and seeing their creeps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two adults, don't be afraid. However, I think the two may be familiar with this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pale flame ignited in Rogge's palm. Kara Yang and Chrisma’s face changed immediately, and they tried to move their bodies and try to stay away from Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have sold the soul to the demon! You are a sorcerer! You will be burned by the Lord God of Heaven with the fire of the most angry judgment. You will endure eternal pain in the net fire of heaven in eternal life!" Chrisma cursed viciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it, two adults! Heaven will not care for this little person for the time being. As for suffering in the net fire, I don't know which year." What month is it? Let's not waste time, let me just say it, I have a contract with the demon who took your divine power. Now I have two choices, one is to kill you, to complete your redemption, let your The soul returns to the embrace of the Lord. One is to use your fire of the Necromancer to directly turn your soul into a fly ash. From then on, you will completely disappear from this world. Of course, I have a way to let the devil take it away. Your soul, you should know that there are countless spaces in this world. It is not easy to find a different space. It is not easy to prive your soul for tens of thousands of years. At that time, you can't commit suicide by committing suicide."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two angels are cold and sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, say so much, you must have understood it, I am definitely very good at cleaning up your soul. Now, as long as you cooperate, I I swear in the name of the High God, after I get the answer I want, I will kill you and give you the opportunity to be redeemed. If you don't believe, I can swear in the name of the Devil."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two angels considered for a long time, and finally succumbed to Rogge's arrogance, after all, the soul was imprisoned for thousands of years in the outer world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient parchment records a map of the Central Mountain Range with a mark on it, which is said to be the location of a large magical array. After blowing the Elf Horn in this magical array, the Elf people within a thousand miles will receive a message, knowing that Hilo's messenger has arrived here. Subsequently, the elves who received the information will return the messenger to the station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical array is said to have dozens of totals on the entire Big Six, the last miracle of Hilo's stay in the world. The only key that can open the magic array is the horn of the elf, and the horn of a genie only corresponds to a magical array. The elf horn in Karajan and Chrisma was derived from the Pope. It is rumored that in a prayer in the Church of the Great Shrine, the Pope suddenly got the shrine of Hilo, which was then created in the flame of the altar. of. According to the shrine of Hilo, the church excavated the map of the ancient sheepskin in an elf relic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Millennium return?" Rogge came to interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, according to the gods, Hilo opened up a piece of pure land on the Big 6 with great power, as a sanctuary for all elves. Hilo Store the location of the sanctuary in the souls of the gods, and use these gods to find the elves who lived in the 6th place, lead them to the path of returning to the Holy Land, and end the exile life of the elves for millennia. Since then, the cost of the elves' wars for the last war has been too great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one place in the Holy Land. The elves of the Big 6 will return to the Holy Land. Isn't it necessary to travel long distances and cross the territory of other ethnic groups? It sounds like the number of elves is not much. It is better to hide and continue to recuperate. Why do you have to return to what holy places?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know this. As for security, all human kingdoms who believe in the supreme god, the Pope will ask them to give convenience and protection to the elves. As for the pagan countries, we can do nothing. In the church power Inside, we will also send the Holy Knights to protect the migratory Elves. The church has tried its best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, the two messengers, now you tell me, Where is the Holy Land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roghaha smiles The flame of death in the hand is fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The map is in your hands, the horn is also in your hands. Tell me now that you are not a god?"?<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crisma is busy: "We are really not God. Our mission is to find this great magical array, but wait for the real god to come at the magical array and protect him safely to the elf. Family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! When did the church become so self-denying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two An angel swears. After hearing the oath of the oath in the name of the Most High God, Rogge would be suspicious. He looked at the parchment carefully and pointed to the text on the back and asked, "What are these things that don't work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The..." Chrisma carefully recognized it for a long time and said: "It seems to be a praise and description of God. This is written in Elvish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge clicked nod. Although he is not proficient in Elvish, he knows a lot. As a magician, identification and language are inherently compulsory courses. With these descriptions, it is much more convenient for his next move. Now, a huge plan is slowly forming in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said that this time it would be so smooth. In any case, with this sheepskin, you are sure to be more like a god than a true god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded. Suddenly his face sank and he asked: "How can the church know that Elise is the princess of the Mozu! Tell me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kara Yang and Ke Lisma was shocked and explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the two Big Three know very limited. They were summoned by Augustus on the same day and waited for half a day before being told to go to the Grand Duke to hunt down the demon Princess Elysses. Augustus said she would drink the tears of angels and told them to watch. After the flame of the angel's tears ignited, he rushed in to catch people. But they did not think that Elysses, who was burned by the flames, could still escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you catch people at the Grand Dukes? Do you know the relationship between Elysses and Dagong?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" At that time, an officer led us into the Grand Palace, waiting in a partial room until we sensed the tears of angels. Later things... you know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger's fingertips became cold, his palms were full of sweat, and he faintly felt that there was a huge conspiracy behind it. However, he really does not want to think about that aspect, and this even has his ability to bear the conspiracy. Reminiscent of the information on the scales and claws heard from Androni, a silhouette slowly formed in his chest, but still vague, something worse, so that he still has no way to seize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These secrets are only known to the adults of Augustus. After you escaped, we were only taken to the prayer room of His Majesty the Pope and entered the magical array set there. The Augustus adults have already waited for the magic to be transmitted. The other end of the battle. Later, you came over yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stood up and stood still, after a while: "I Already asked, this is like your wish, to send you to the outside world to stay tens of thousands of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kara Yang and Chris Ma face are distorted Get up, sigh: "You devil! You swear by the name of the demon and the supreme god! You will have retribution!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silent moment , said: "From the moment when Elysses was burned, I will not trust the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space fluctuations, *** Got out. Her two hands illusion into a virtual shadow, ** the heads of two angels, grabbed two groups of constantly struggling light groups, and went back to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karajan and Chrisma’s expressions were dull, their eyes looked at the sky without a god, and after a while, the heart stopped beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and stood still. I don't know when Androni has come back. She looks at the two bodies on the ground and frowns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did they die? You asked what you need, and remembered Elysses?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge got up and gave the information about the elves to Androni. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is a strong martial artist, but there is not much to deal with these big things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? Of course, find that magic Array, then find a way to kill the god, we are to be God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni is full of surprise. “Is there any benefit to doing this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Benefits? Of course. Your father’s brother is holding a heavy hand. We only have two people. How can I save you? Little lover princess? Do you think that anything depends on your sword skills? If you want to save your little lover in a thousand horses, we must have our own people. Someone, rich There is a gun! Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni not only did not understand, but was somewhat confused. Thousands of troops and horses, sneak in it, why do you have to bring troops to enter? What is the relationship between having a man and a god who pretends to be an elf? However, she said these things, and attracted Rogge a ruthless ridicule. Seeing that Androni’s face was slowly raging, he only took up the sarcasm and explained it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every adult elf is not a great archer, it is a magical talent. And the craftsmanship of the elves is not under the dwarves, their natural art. It feels very fascinating to create the equipment, which will greatly increase the value of these equipment. You see, is this not someone who has a gun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So what about money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the price of a Miss Elf slave, you should be very clear?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni was silent, her face was a bit white. Although she is ruthless, she is not a murderer. But it is the first time to talk about bloody, dirty slave trades naked. Rogge did not see it and continued to brainwash her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to have an invincible army? The genius of the general, the bravery of the warrior, the strict military discipline, and the absolute execution of the command. You Looking at the ancient dynasties and emperors, how long does it take to build a lofty prestige among the army or the people, and how much does it cost? They care about the food, clothing, shelter, and care of the soldiers, and they often have to deal with the soldiers. The people live together and eat the same food. And we, as long as the elves believe that we are gods, then our words and deeds represent the will of Hilo, and every command we make will be uncompromising. Execution without cost. We have an invincible army and loyal followers, and what have we paid for it? No, nothing! This is the power of faith! Faith is always a huge and terrible force! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a terrible thing to be enemies with such people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she doesn’t know is that although Rogge is not mediocrity, but greed is not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two follow the map and go all the way to the depths of the Central Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along the way, Rogge continued to support Androni in accordance with the instructions on the parchment, Androni is proficient in Elvish, although Rogge’s attitude was extremely dissatisfied, but after she read the parchment carefully, she had to admit that Rogge said it was justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the two rode two tall wild horses, one chestnut and one brown. Under the powerful Androni's hand, these two extremely strong horses were tamed to obey the posts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the two horses became pure white. Rogge used the structuring technique to become fascinating. Although his magic power was not strong, the high control power of the singer also made Androni open his eyes. Turning the fur on the horse into white hair is not an easy task. The two horses asked him to perform nearly ten constructions, which turned white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was quiet, Rogge took Androni to sleep, and quietly took two horses to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His spell was just half-finished, and Gregory was slammed to the ground! In the heart of the vanity bone dragon, it is now an incomparable worship and respect for Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master's owner, you are too sinister! Too..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Flying a foot, kicking the bone dragon to the side, and kicking the words below it back into the stomach. These days, she was almost annoyed by this spring-like bone dragon. When she cleaned Kara Yang and Chris Ma, she didn't have any other materials, but she had to remove four bone spurs from the back of the bone dragon to nail the two angels. In fact, I found an excuse to clean up the bone dragon. Only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two white horses smelled the bones and the scent of the cockroaches, and they were immediately overwhelmed by fear and squatted on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad luck of the bone dragon is not finished yet. After a brief exchange with Rogge, *** stared at Gregory and signaled it. The bone dragon was reluctant, and he took it one step at a time. A cold scent spread from the body, and the six-bone spear swayed behind her. Gregory knew that the anger was angry. It hurried all the way to the side of the *** Blowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***After comfortably taking two shots on the bone faucet, he reached out and grasped the two spurs on his back, and forced a fold, Titicaca Two sounds, two spurs about two feet long were removed. A group of green soul fires ignited in her hands, burning two bone spurs. Slowly, the bone spurs softened. ***Twist the softened bone spur and screw it into a spiral shape. She pointed to a bullet, and two fires fell on the foreheads of two white horses, burning and sizzling. Although the two horses were sorely shaken, the dragons of Gregory made them lie on the ground and could not move. ***The two spiral spurs were pressed against the white horse's forehead. Very magical and weird, the two bone spurs slowly fell into the white horse's forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took over the rest of the work. Under the stimulation of his mental strength, the white horse’s head fur grew wildly for a while, completely covering the implanted spurs. Scars left when. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Finally, I checked two white horses carefully and determined that the two bone spurs were completely implanted. In the harsh environment of the outside world, *** almost everything has to do it yourself. After shaping the Gregorian, the Black Warrior and the Flame Bone, it was a breeze for her to implant two bone spurs for the White Horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, two white horses have stood up, they look like a god, and the long angle of a spiral on the forehead is full of majesty and mystery. After blending with Gregory's bone spurs, they are no longer afraid of Longwei, and even bring a touch of Longwei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the stimulation of Rogge’s mental strength, their vitality is greatly stimulated, their muscles are arrogant, their bones are stretched, at least they become bigger and thicker. . They were still wild horses at the last moment. This moment has been beautiful and tall, and the wind instrument is close to the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Rogge is extremely satisfied with these two horses, although after his spiritual stimulation, the two wild horses that could have lived for twenty years now live the most. Last two years, but these times are too abundant for his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
