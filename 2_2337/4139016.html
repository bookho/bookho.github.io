			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seventh Day Book of the Seventh Day Trial (4)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis Tall’s body crashed into the ground . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air seems to be filled with a touch of mist, and all the scenery looks a bit fuzzy. The flames of the Holy Flame also rose with a reddish smoke, which was the cloud of blood catalyzed by the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel still maintains a stab-like posture in front of the sword, and the face with no expression is slightly confused. He glanced at his companion, and saw that he was staring at the door, and turned his head to look out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the door, there was a strong mist in the night, and the figure of Rogge slowly appeared in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel stared at the fat, sulky figure, coldly and coldly: "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter who I am, you just need to know that I am coming to send you back to heaven." The fat man smiled and looked into the sun. He glanced at the other angel, and the smile became a little evil. He added: "I didn't expect to see another light angel here. Although you can't compare it with the light angels I have ever seen, but Since you are so beautiful, I will be gentle when I kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light angel looks slim and beautiful compared with the angel holding the sword. many. Their similarities lie in the coldness of the expression, the exquisiteness of the mechanics and the face. In a sense, they are not like the legendary angels, but more like the magical figures made by the genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the light angel looks far better than the angel holding the sword, but the dominance of all actions is in the hands of the angel holding the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Rogge, the cold expressions of the two angels did not change. The angel holding the sword sighed: "You have married the sacred glow of heaven..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time the light angel glanced at the body on the ground. Suddenly, he said: "If you want to resist the heavens, then according to the rules of this plane, you should help him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge's smile More and more prosperous, he also looked at the body on the ground and said: "Since he sincerely believes in the gods in the sky, then he will die. And it is not a very reasonable but ironic ending to die in your hands? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the angel holding the sword. The giant sword pointed to Rogge's chest and said in a mechanical flat: "You have once again smashed the glory of heaven. Ready to be judged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Judgement? Wait a moment, let me think about it..." Rog smiled and looked at his whole body with a blind eye that the sword angel couldn't understand. The gaze was as if it were pure, it seemed to directly penetrate his clothes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, the fat man said: "...you have to let me think about it, will the angels hurt? Ah! I remembered. Angels are It won't hurt, if this is the case, then I will make you feel better..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderous murder in the eyes of the sword angel, the giant sword in the hand The flames flourished, and the wind was thunderous, and it stabbed Rogge's chest. It was only that Jianfeng had just advanced a few points, and he suddenly settled in the air, and then he looked up to heaven. Unstoppable tragic resounding through the night sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white feathers of the sky are quietly floating in the bedroom of the Marquis. Each piece of feathers is covered with a golden flame of stars. These flames are the blood of these angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when, Rogge has appeared behind the angel holding the sword. He grasped the white wings with his hands and his fingers were deeply caught in feathers and flesh. Slowly pull from the wing root to the wing tip. Wherever he was, the plump, beautiful, soft and radiant wings were stripped of flesh and blood, revealing the bones of the forest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword-bearing angel is shaking all over the body, but always maintains a stab-like posture in front of the sword. It seems to have been unable to move. In the face of this unprecedented pain, there is only a tragedy. No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Rog’s mouth has turned into a sneer, his hands are waving faster and faster, and the white feathers of the big canopy are accompanied by flesh and blood from the wings. Tear off! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge flew up. Knock the angel down to the ground and wave a hand. The Great Flame sword came into his own hands. He sneered again, and twisted the sword into a steel bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel groaned, twitching, just wanting to get up, the steel stick with the screaming sound fell, and he fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on the fat face has long since disappeared. Instead of gnashing his teeth, he squats and squats. Every word seems to be from his teeth. Extrusion is the same:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ***...hey? I will let you know now...what is 亵渎!**, there is a good piece of meat here. Ah... now it’s alright! Call me again, call me? Why don’t you say anything...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden flame keeps coming from the rolling angel Out, but just out of the head, is extinguished by an invisible force. Therefore, the angels who should have been incinerated by the flames have been delayed, but they have been smashed in the vicinity of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angelic mantle gradually sank, and Rogge’s snoring and wheezing are coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it’s quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is in the room, looking up to the sky. I do not know when, two lines of tears quietly fell from his closed eyes. From this moment on, the war has begun. This is not his war, but since it is her war, then it is his war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light angel stood still on the side, looking at this bizarre pair in front of him, seems to have stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly opened his eyes, glanced at the corpse of angels scattered around, and spit out a sigh of gas. He turned and looked at the light angel still standing aside, faintly said: "Are you self-destructive, or do you want me to do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing flame rushed to the height of a hundred meters, reflecting the entire Westwood as bright. The small towns flowed wildly and fled to the outside of the city to escape the fire. Such a fire, not only burned out the ancient and splendid Knights College, but also will certainly burn the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one noticed that in the blazing flames, a lonely figure emerged and disappeared into the hustle and bustle of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See him, don't go see him. See him, don't go see him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monotonously resounding in the heart of Furola. She sat on the top of the cliff, facing the endless night sky, the cold blue moon and the high hanging stars, letting the mountain wind shake the skirt. Her hands and jaws, a pair of white bare feet hanging in the air, just focus on a beautiful magical rose in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petals of the magic rose fly in pieces, turning into a small group of beautiful magic halos. Gradually disappeared into the night sky. In the bare gossip of the little goblins, the magic rose is shrinking little by little. Until the last petal disappeared into the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not go see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little goblin took a sigh of relief, and his mouth twitched with a fascinating smile. She thought about it, her right hand flicked, and another magical rose condensed in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on again..." she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See him, don't go see him... everything starts again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she understands that this ancient and simple divination is repeated no matter how many times. The result will be the same, because every magic rose she made, the petals are even. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the result of this time is still not to see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria’s mouth still smiles, seemingly immersed in the memories of the past. After a long time, her right hand was again a wave, and again a magic rose. Only this time, the magical rose that radiates vague glory floats in the air. Nothing changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of meteors flying around the stars that are falling, and seeing them drifting in the direction, it is the cliff where Furoya is. Looking at these fast-moving meteors, Froya knew that she no longer had to worry about this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteor has flew to her front and turned into three frosty angels. The headed angel is armed with a left hand and a right hand with Froya. "The powerful magician, your strength is acceptable to the gods, so you have the glory of the Lord God."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria smiled awkwardly, and the instant color seemed to brighten the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, no," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night. Extraordinarily long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this never ending night. Only the stars that are not falling are getting brighter and brighter. From its brilliance, new meteors will fly out from time to time. Join the hundreds of meteors flying around the stars. In the meteor that is almost a band of light, there will be dozens of meteors that will fly out and fly to every corner of the continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this night is unusual, most places on the mainland are still sleeping, such as a prairie in the western part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The night wind gently licks the long grass, and occasionally, there will be a few night-time beasts running wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the peace of the prairie has not lasted for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few meteors flew down and turned into four full armor angels. They stand in the sky of 100 meters, and if they have a real eye, they scan the entire grassland. Wherever they look, all life ceases to be active, and the only thing that can be done by these instinctual creatures is to express their fear in trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four angels searched repeatedly, but they looked nothing. The arched angel who led the head showed a doubtful color and frowned. After all, they are assigned to search here. For them, the existence of the assignment is unattainable and the power is completely unthinkable. It is not going to make mistakes. At this time, the target cannot be found, and the mistake must be with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow angel waved his hand, and the four angels were separated and searched in one direction. But they did not find it, just as they were just scattered, not far away, a girl was walking on the grassland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pale blond hair dances in the night wind, the pace is light and windy, and calm and calm, it seems to be just passing by here. Whether she is passing by or deliberate, the four angels not far away are completely ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly turned her head and looked at the four angels who had just spread. In an instant, she had already ignited a light blue flame in her eyes, and there was a fierce murder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four angels were shocked at almost the same time, and turned to look at the direction of the girl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they saw was just a flash of electro-optical light, and then. It is the endless darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl restored the tranquility and beauty of the original place, calmly and far away, just like passing by. In the twinkling of an eye, her figure is hidden in the night. Occasionally, the pulsating pale gold long hair will flash in the distance, as if it is not reconciled to the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night beasts on the prairie have quietly raised their heads. They are afraid that they have not yet gone. Still dare not escape, only to sneak into the flames of the four groups of burning flames in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lille City is full of crowds. There are shouting slogans everywhere, and the 100,000 torches will make the whole city shine like white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this seemingly frenzied city, only a large building on the west side of the city remains in darkness and silence. Here is the temporary headquarters of the Holy Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a large room on the top floor of the main building, Augustus is sitting in the chair, staring at the stars hanging high in the night sky outside the window. There is no light in his room. Until I saw more than ten meteors falling to the city of Lille, the blood angels were filled with traces of the years, and the lines of the swords were slightly moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a soft knock on the door sounds. Don't wait for Augustus to answer. The door opened and a young knight strode in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Augustus, the prophet Lafarash is leading the fanatic Protestant to advance here! He said that you have fallen, and the devil is killed and killed Six prophets, such as Muller who spread the glory of the Lord God. He declared that he would clear you for the gods of heaven. And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustus smiled in a low voice and said: "A lot of knights? I am afraid that all the holy knights will stand on the side of Lafarash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! Not all!" The young knight was excited and said: "Even with me, there are 86 guards who are always loyal to you! As long as your sword points us in the direction, no matter how many enemies there are. We will let them remember the courage of the Knights of the Holy Knights!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood angel turned to look at the young knight. He is handsome, tall, full of enthusiasm, and his young face is red with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The young knight hesitated again and said: "Augus are adults, why are there angels around Lafarash? They must be pulled Farah was created with magic and used to deceive the illusion of the believers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there was a noise coming out of the window, and half of the sky was also red by the torch. Augustus looked out the window, stood up, walked to the side of the young knight, gently patted his shoulder, smiled and said: "It seems that Lafarash brought at least 100,000 believers, and We only have 87 people. Are you afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young knights are excited. However, in the twinkling of an eye, he calmed down and said with resoluteness: "Even if I only talk to you. I will not be afraid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, you are already one A true holy knight." Augustus praised the authenticity, "and a real knight should only sacrifice for something worthwhile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He placed a slight movement on the shoulder of the young knight and cut a moment on the back of the young knight. The young knight looked blank, but could not control his body and fell softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus has reached out and said, in the snoring, the long sword that has been with him for decades has been sent to the hands. The blood angel opened the door and walked to the darkness outside the door, heading for the 100,000 believers and more than ten angels in Lafarash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the door closed, the young knight saw a pair of wings quietly behind the Augustus before falling into a drow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair of wings are dark as ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is in the crowd, and some of them feel the dryness and madness of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a populous city, very close to the city of Lille, but only three days away. Perhaps because of this, the riots and turmoil in the city of Lille also spread to the city. Like the city of Lille, the torch, spirits, frenzy and shouting became the theme of the city at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In almost every square, every pub, someone will occupy a high place, and will be speeched with impassion and even hysteria. Looking at the distorted, sloppy face, watching the crowd screaming at the stage, Rogge suddenly felt very funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are they so excited to find the truth? At this moment. Presumably they must think so. But in these thousands of wild people, how many people have seriously thought about the idea that they are told to be correct? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that Rogge can be sure of is that none of the sentient beings in front of him knows the fate of the coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil has emerged, the truth is about to be revealed!" A soprano tenor crossed a long space and was heavily obstructed, and passed into Rogge's ear without any loss. The fat snack was a surprise. Looking around, I saw a man in a robe standing on a statue pedestal and giving a speech. He is lean and lean. However, the volume is extremely loud, the sound is sharp and thin, and it is very penetrating, which is why it can pass through the 100-meter distance into the ears of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gods and messengers, the great prophet Lafarash has seen the true face of the blood angel Augustus, who calls on all true believers to the city of Lille. Go to cruel devil Augustus!" The man continued to scream. A sharp voice, if a needle, can not walk back and forth in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put Augustus on the cross!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd was boiling, and the shouts overshadowed the man’s voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Rogge suddenly burst into a burst of inexplicable irritability. He and her, as well as those who have seen through the plane and destiny, countless times of fighting, what is it? Is it for the existence of a plane, in order to maintain the survival, freedom and dignity of these people? However, it is no longer meaningful to think about the purpose of the struggle. He once had the glory of the Lord of Destruction. So can't escape. Since you are not willing to succumb, you can only fight to the end. Moreover, destruction is redemption. He succumbs or not, and the ending is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man’s mind was slightly moved, and it was already behind the lean man. The fat man kicked down the ten-meter high bluestone statue and grabbed it. Fold off the calf of the statue, then turn this huge and strange stone pillar and smash it into the man's back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will lead you..." The man’s screams came to an abrupt end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge picked up the stone like a calf, and when he just wanted to continue kneeling, he suddenly groaned. He looked at the stone like a calf and looked at the place where the man was standing. Although he couldn’t help but hate it, he felt that there was no need to make up a few more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly calmed down and could not understand the bloody reality in front of him. I do not know who took the lead and shouted: "Devil!" Just like a Mars falling into the oil sea, the flame of the crowd's heart is burning again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the crowds of madness. Rogge sneered. The lips are slightly moving and spit out a few simple notes. A whirlwind of slow flow is generated around the body. At this time, the fat man is not the youngster who first glimpsed the secret of magic. The magic he applied to him, regardless of the high-order and low-order, contains incredible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is very gentle and gentle as a knife. Dozens of wildernesses who had rushed to the ground suddenly stopped their bodies, and they barely loomed dozens of criss-crossing red lines on the skin of the field. The person in front stopped, but the people behind him were still unknown, and they still called the front. Under the push, dozens of people in the forefront have fallen down. Their bodies have not yet landed, and they have broken into dozens of pieces of meat, bloody! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believer is wild, but has not completely lost his mind. Those who accidentally stepped on the body block exclaimed and stopped. However, behind them, dozens of people are brave enough to go forward. They just stopped and were immediately pushed down by the people behind them. Next, there are countless feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is still blowing softly around the base of the tall stone statue, but its knife-like wind can't stop the crazy crowd, can't stop splashing The bloody fog also does not extinguish the blazing flames in people's hearts. Rogge calmed his face and lifted the stone pillar in his hand and squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, two, three...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After only a few, Rogge felt I am tired. He looked around and saw all the places in the city. There were already a few sacred lights that were lit up in turn, which was the brilliance of the angel wings. Rogge looked at the crowds who were screaming at the crowd, sighed, dropped the crimson stone pillars in his hands, and turned to the north. His figure flashed, and every step was a kilometer away. In the twinkling of an eye, Rogge had already gone. In the square, the wild people did not find that their goal had long since disappeared, and they still went crazy to the base of the stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking in the night, Roger’s heart is not only tired. There is also a loss. He has discovered subtle changes in his heart. When the fat man was young, he was already in a high position. The experience between life and death made him forget the word kindness. Although the fat man is not addicted to killing, when he needs it, he is not afraid to kill, no matter how many people are going to kill. However, every time he murders in the past, even when he was in the massacre, he regarded the other person as a person. Think of it as the same family as yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are unaware of their future destiny, but it is the food that the gods use to absorb the faith. It is like a pig and a sheep. They fought wildly, just to take a step closer to being a pig. Perhaps because of this, Rogge did not feel that he was killing when he was killing, but only slaughtered a group of pigs and sheep. He no longer sees these people as the same ethnic group as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he is at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this state of mind, what is the difference between him and the gods on that day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, there were seven more flaming flames under the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands in the air, his eyes once again plucking the mainland under the curtain. At this moment, how many people are fighting like them, alone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and turned to the north. When I was about to leave, I suddenly wrinkled my brow and stopped my figure. In front of him, there are two more angels. Their bodies are huge and their breath is different from that of low-level angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s face finally showed some dignity. The two angels are also worthy of serious consideration for him at this moment. Moreover, they are different from the power angels that Andreioli brought with him that day. They are directly taken from the gates of heaven, and the power of the body is much less affected by this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man narrowed his eyes and glanced at the shining star in the night sky. That star is the gate of heaven that is being built. No one knows how long it will take to build a gate to heaven, and Rogge also does not know. He only knows that there are high-ranking angels among hundreds of angels who surround the gates of heaven. It is very difficult to get close to the gates of heaven. Moreover, the side of the gate of Heaven is connected to this plane, and the other side is bathed under the glory of the Lord God. It is not destroyed by ordinary gods. Moreover, since the gates of the heavens have begun to be established in this plane, even if one is destroyed, the other will be established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this. Now that it has started. That will inevitably come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only from the time when the stars hang high in the night sky, and it doesn’t take long. Even if this night has not ended, has a powerful angel stepped out of the gates of heaven and began to inspect the entire plane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the stars are shining again, and the meteor group separates dozens of different meteors of different colors. Only this time the meteors were not scattered, but gathered into a bundle and flew straight in the direction of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it coming so soon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge doesn't want to be so fast As soon as he arrived, he walked down the night, just to get more than a few free angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not very concerned about the early arrival of the decisive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and grabbed his right hand. The huge death sickle has already appeared in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Rogge’s smile suddenly solidifies, looking again at the star that is not falling. Because at this moment, the night suddenly became awkward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upside down is just an instant, because there is a huge and incredible electric light that spans half the night sky, silently hitting the stars that are not falling. ! The intense light of that moment not only reflected the entire sky, but also completely suppressed the glory of the stars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 昼 became the night again, the thunder that rang through the heavens and the earth came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no faint star, but it is surrounded by flying meteors and there are nearly a hundred glimmers, wrapped in the blazing flame, falling to the ground. As follows, there is a beautiful meteor shower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is almost no time for people to think, the second electric light crosses the night sky and hits the stars again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars that are not falling are even more dim, and look like the ordinary stars. The meteors that orbited the flight, because they were already sparse, were hit much harder, and only forty or fifty were burning and falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of meteors flying straight to Rogge immediately turned their way and turned to the electric light. Looking away. The place where the electric light rises is the Elven Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a deep breath and took back his gaze, turning to the two angels in front of him, in a plain and unwavering voice: "Accept Destroy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the boiling continent, the secret temple of the Great Light Temple is dead, that is, there is no flow of light and shadow. I don't smell a little noise, it looks. It has completely turned into a dead zone here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sluggish moonlight shines through the high-rise floor-to-ceiling windows of the main hall of the church, and shines on the iron cage in the middle of the room. In the cage stood a dreamy black-haired silver-haired girl, she lifted her fist very slowly and very slowly, and slammed it into the thick steel bar. But every time, she seems to be afraid of touching her hand. When there is a little distance from the steel bar, the fist will be withdrawn. Whoever saw this scene. Everyone will feel that the girl's choice is correct. Her hand is white and sleek, almost transparent, and soft and it seems to be slightly damaged when it touches the steel bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made a fist and slowly hit the cage steel bar. It’s not going to return, so it’s like never ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight is getting brighter, just on this night, it’s the moonlight or the starlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls are more and more anxious. The water mist in the silver carp is getting thicker and thicker. Finally, the water mist condenses into a drop of crystal water droplets, which slides down her face. After this punch, she no longer retreats, but resists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face is gradually pale, her lips are faintly with a golden bloodline, but her right fist is moving forward, infinitely close The steel bars that make up the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden bang in the still room, and the electric light in the cage. The girl seems to have been hit hard. Falling to the ground. But her efforts are not all fruitless. After the steel cage shook, the invisible barrier finally revealed a gap. This gap is fleeting. But for her, this is enough. She opened her lips and suddenly shouted through the cracked stone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cry of Qingyue broke through the roof and went through the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last blow and shouting seemed to have consumed all her power, and even the flying black hair fell obediently into a soft silk, scattered Beside her. She gasped hard, and for a long time, she could accumulate enough strength to stand up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has not waited too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible barriers have just been closed, and a figure of presence will appear next to her. At this time, the flow was near the static space. She tried to open her eyes and tried to tell if she was wrong. After all, the figure was extremely erratic, and when she looked seriously, she would disappear completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed her silvery eyes and wanted to see more clearly. At this time, a sense of volatility was introduced into her consciousness, which was once she was infinitely fearful, but now she is extremely hopeful. Fengyue’s consciousness: “You are not mistaken, I am back.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls show their face, trying to show a smile, said: "It's so... great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feng Yue and the past The same cold language: "You know that I have been looking for the way back, and I know what happens when I come back. Why give me coordinates?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl smiled and struggled to reach out to the windy moon: "Because... I can't help him! Only...you can only..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The wind and moon silence for a moment, finally slowly squatting, gently holding the girl's hand, said: "You can not separate from this body and exist independently..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is silent, just holding the girl's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get started, I am ready." She closed her eyes. Feng Yue stared at her, this moment, her smile was calm and serene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time seems to be completely still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Fengyue opened his eyes again. The pair of silver urns are as cold as ever, and the black silk like a satin is falling down like a waterfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be supported by a pair of invisible hands, and the body of Fengyue floats up and stands in the cage. She just glanced slightly at the steel cage, which was a fist with her right hand and a punch to the steel cage above her head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of a dead silence suddenly swayed a little, and then a thunder thunder resounded throughout the secret! In the roar, dozens of magnificent buildings in the church have collapsed, splashing sand and masonry. The beautiful figure of Fengyue has risen to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel cage that embodies Rogge’s innumerable efforts, which he has been boasting for a long time, has already been torn apart and buried in the rubble field, becoming a future generation. The remains of people who think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and moon slightly recognize the position, that is, skyrocketing, flying toward the endless sky. The dreamy figure disappeared without a trace of light in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man groaned unclearly while pulling the feathers stuck to his hands. Busy for a long time. His heart angered again, flew up a foot, and kicked heavily on the huge body of the force angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took a long time for the fat man to clean up his body. He lifted the slashing knife on the ground and moved freely. This simple action, the result is that the dozens of wounds around the body are painful. Especially the horrible wound that penetrated his entire chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and blood of his wounds squirmed and repaired the damage. It is only Rogge who is not afraid of the flames of the heavens, but the wounds caused by this kind of flame are not so easy to repair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty eyes are slightly closed, slightly raise a god, the right hand will clench the death sickle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsettled stars have re-emerged in Guanghua, and there are nearly a thousand meteors flying around. At this moment, the angels standing in front of Rogge have changed from several names to dozens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat eyes slowly swept over the faces of the angels with no expression, then smiled and spit out a bloody cockroach. Ruan said: "It's really troublesome, killing can't kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly straightens his chest, and the three blue wings that are dotted with stars are quietly stretched to The biggest, invisible majestic moment has spread to a hundred meters away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are so courageous, disrespectful to me, that is, the glory of my lord dissmasen!" Rogge flat, mechanical, icy sound Resounding in the ears of every angel. For a while. All the angels face each other, revealing a doubtful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s brows were slightly wrinkled, and the blue-colored stars of the week could not expand, and they snorted coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge is already angry, the headed angel immediately dropped the giant sword in his hand and kneeled in the air. After him, dozens of angels also fell into the air at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-level angels are accustomed to fighting in various planes. In order to adapt to different environments, they will change themselves accordingly. Therefore, for angels, the appearance of the body is not the basis for judgment. The only means of distinguishing is the breath. In the feelings of these angels. At this moment, Rogge’s body is completely scented by the stars of Andreioli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-winged angel carries the brilliance that is second only to the Lord God, and that they are completely unable to defy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant when all angels are kneeling. Rogge suddenly moved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is flickering like a thunder, and has turned around dozens of angels in an instant. When the fat man returned to the original place, the death sickle still whirls in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dozens of angels, in the horror and incomprehensibility, turned into a dazzling sacred fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "It seems that I didn't expect it, the angels didn't have a long brain!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily!" The fat man suddenly sounded a gentle and sweet voice behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man was shocked and slowly turned back, only to find out when there was an angel behind him, smiling at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still the familiar star, still the six blue wings encrusted with stars, appearing behind Rogge, it is the star of Andre Ollie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the stunned Rogge, Andreoli smiled and said: "Although I am not smart, but if you want to fool me, I am afraid I will become my own dissmassen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems to be a bit difficult." Rogge said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be." Andreoli's voice is always so sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s right hand quietly clenched the Death Scythe, and he glanced at the star in the night sky, then said: “Since you have appeared Is the door of Heaven's Gate already built?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man took a deep breath and slowly raised the slashing knife, and the scenery around him began to blur. He stared at Andreoli's star, Shen Sheng said: "This is the case. Then do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreoli smiled He is beautiful and unparalleled, and this smile is even more attractive. To the surprise of Rogge, this invincible six-winged angel has no expression of any gathering power. He just pointed to the falling stars under the night and smiled and said: "Look, you still There are a lot of enemies to choose from. I also have a lot to do, so we don't have to play this game at all. Isn't it good to be busy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The fat man can hardly believe his own ears. How could this be what a six-winged angel said? But Roger did not dare to relax. After all, from the past records, angels, like demons, are guys who never talk about credit. And now the fat man is holding this one mentality to meet this final battle, so he is still constantly gathering strength, in a blink of an eye. The surging power in his body is approaching the limits he can handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge is still gathering strength! Faced with an opponent like Andreoli, no matter how much power is accumulated, it will not be excessive. And Rogge's only chance to get a resort is to be in the moment of a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life and death will be decided at that moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the slashing knife that has become distorted, Andreoli sighed: "Rogge, even if you want to continue this battle I'm afraid some people will not agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled coldly and said: "Who wouldn't agree?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold sound suddenly sounded from behind Rogge!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not yet waiting for Rogge to react from the stun. An ice-like slender hand sticks out from behind him, gently and dexterously taking the ready-to-go death sickle from Rogge's hand. Then Rogge only felt that the back of the neck was cold, and she hit her again. Her hands are cold and soft, and it can be said that it is the highest enjoyment with the skin, but with the touch, there is still a cold ice. This chill is completely irresistible, wherever they go. The power of Rogge’s all-out gathering will vanish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the panic in the fat man’s heart is far overwhelming. He only has time to say: “Fengyue! How come you will return...” However, the body is no longer under his control and slowly falls backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue left-handed, helped Rogge fall down the body, and then gently said: "Because this is not your war..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Rogge has lost consciousness, he has not heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon stared at Rogge, only then looked up and the silver scorpion turned cold. The Death Scythe pointed to Andreoli. Lightly authentic: "Get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreoli seems to have never heard of the wind, he just looked at the wind and moon. For a long time, I sighed and said: "Although we are destined to be enemies, but still the same sentence, you have other choices, I have something to do. So... we don't have to fight."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for the wind to answer, Andreioli slowly turned and flew to the distance, the blue wing full of stars flashed a few times, and disappeared with the stars of the sky One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fengyue frowns and wrinkles, she looked at the stardust in the night sky, and looked at Luo Ge, who was sleeping in her arms, just wanting to leave When I went, Andreoli’s spiritual volatility suddenly came: "The source of faith in this plane has collapsed, so my actor Desmasson will soon fall to the ground..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon are silent for a moment, slightly squinting silver eyes, looking at the stars in the night sky. Finally, she seems to have made up her mind, lips slightly open, from the ice of the lips, a chill out slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used the slashing knife to make a stroke in the void, where the blade passed, and immediately rippled heavy space ripples. Just a cut, the wind cuts the space barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave her left hand a little forward, and Rogge, like a boat on the river, drifted into the ripples of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this count of time, for her, for more than a few years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Fengyue was lifted and put down, and every time he couldn’t help but want to pull him back, every time he forced it down. She knows that there will be no more goodbye after this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the moon suddenly screamed, and the left hand swung forward, pushing Rogge completely into the space ripple, and then the death of the sickle waved, cutting off Rogge and Everything about this plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rises to the sky, if a roaring meteor rushes to the stars that are not falling under the night sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never looked back...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A groan, Rogge opened his eyes, some Looking at the light and shadow around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sat up, because everything before going to sleep returned to his memory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbulent flow of countless energy whistling past him, this space, no direction, no time, he has lost in the turbulent space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed and said to himself, "You can’t think of the wind, I still have a way to go back. This time, I win in any case. Haha..." It’s just that the laughter he made was so dry that he didn’t have any joy at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger’s hand waved gently, and the space in front of him diverge from the two sides, revealing a gap in the space. He stepped forward, but before he stepped into the gap, he actually shrank back. If it is repeated several times, Rogge never dared to take that step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of the gods in heaven, he is only afraid to know the ending that is destined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Rogge stepped into the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Rogge has not slept for long. Everything on the Gloria continent seems to have changed nothing, except for an extremely bright star in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the far horizon, the sky has begun to whiten, and on the other side of the continent, the residual night is still not willing to give up the final territory. Just in the middle of the sky, thousands of angels are flying around around the stars that are not falling. And in the center surrounded by thousands of angels, there is another group of dazzling gold, blue, silver and gray glare that is changing and brighter, and it seems that a great existence will be shaped in this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge condensed in the air and slowly scanned everything familiar and strange. His hand trembled involuntarily, and there was an unstoppable chill in his heart, almost freezing his blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly shocked the whole body, his figure flickered, and he had already traveled thousands of miles in an instant, falling on the top of an ice peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the highest Tanggula ice peak in the entire Gloria continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the peak, a deep black death sickle is inserted. Every time the strong mountain wind passes over the blade, it will make a fierce scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly stumbled in front of the Death Scythe, stretched his trembling hand, and gently stroked the blade and the blade. Every touch touched by the fingertips is so familiar. It seems that it seems that there is still her fragrant incense on her slashing knife, her coldness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars in the sky are getting brighter and brighter, gradually showing the true face of the gates of heaven. With a roar, the two doors slowly opened, and at the moment the door opened, you could see that countless angels were ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly stood up, and sent out a screaming arrogance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t say much, just pulled up the slashing knife and then stepped on it with both feet. The man rushed to the sky like electricity and flew to the heavens. door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangula Snow Peak quietly appeared numerous cracks, and then collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge clasped the scythe of death, unable to spurt the invisible flame, and turned into a burning star in the blink of an eye, crossing the yet The great existence of the formation, and then against the angels who have no count, the wings of the flies have merged into the Tianhe River, rushing upwards, whistling into the door of heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
