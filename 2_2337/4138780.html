			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long I have slept, she only thinks that this sleep is really long, very fragrant and very peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still remembers that in the moment when she was full of bright red, her heart turned out to be unparalleled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya suddenly sat up, still sleepy, and looked at everything in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a light and elegant room, the furnishings in the room are very simple, the style and design of the furniture is very beautiful, and you can see the art of making artisans. The level is not low, but the materials and decoration are too common, and there is no use of expensive materials. In the eyes of Furoya, this is a typical room of a lonely aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's fingers flicked and a few small electric sparks appeared at her fingertips. She smiles, as long as she can still use magic, that's fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, a handsome old man came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria immediately greeted her, she was extremely dissatisfied, and complained with a slap in the face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the underworld? Although the sunlight in this room is very unexpected, but the decoration and furniture are too simple! I was a princess before my death, and I am also a great magician! I have tried After that, even in the underworld, I can use magic. How can you please me to scorn me! Even the servants are an old man! How many maids must there be? So many civilians’ souls, can’t they all be drawn? And you! Don't stay there! Go and call me here! Look at your appearance, you should be an elf, you are not too young, how is it still a stupid look? No wonder in the underworld Can only be an inferior servant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man opened his mouth and his face was very weird. He said for a long time: "Welcome, Your Royal Highness, Flora. Although I I am sorry that I can't satisfy you, but here, the person who is in charge of the matter is "What do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is even more dissatisfied, and angered: "You are actually a person who manages things? No wonder the status of the gods is coming. The worse, not to mention the supreme god, even the killers rarely believe in it. How can you grow up in the underworld? If you have just come to the underworld, the requirements are not high, just Just do it. First, I didn't see where my clothes are, and where the clothes are. I also need a clean and spacious bathroom, and a few well-behaved maids. And, for a big magician. Say, the magic lab is even more essential! Since you know my name, you must know who my teacher is. Although he is not dead yet, but it is fast, and he can’t enter heaven, he will only When I came here, you want to come back to the knot. I am already late...Where!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sudden screaming and sucking A cold air, a pair of beautiful eyes, unbelievably watching Elf elders ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf old man has completely couldn’t resist the smile on his face, and his appearance seems so familiar...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria slammed into the window and looked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this beautiful and beautiful city like a paradise on earth, this city full of green and various colored flowers, this miracle that is always warm as spring The city is the city of gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the brush, Froya turned around and stared at the elf elders and ate the authenticity: "I remember you. You are... you are... Elder Sisters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled and said: "Exactly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria Some stayed, what is going on? Am I not already dead? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly reached out and went to the elders of Hughes, but when she retired, she let her laugh, and then smiled:" Your Royal Highness, Flora, you don't have to marry me, you can also know that this is not a dream. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria involuntarily reached out and stroked his neck, which was smooth and delicate, and what wounds?<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are very energetic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is absolutely impossible! I am going to kill him, Rogge is definitely not a soft person!" How could he let me go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes coughed a bit...Roger said it, and a scar, you are yourself The actions made have paid the price. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scars? "Floria's face is green, and she suddenly pushes Sius away, and hurriedly: "God! A scar! where is it? Is it on the face? Mirror, give me a mirror! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of her is so fierce that Hughes immediately fell to the ground in the sky. His old man spent a long time before he struggled to get up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya finally turned out a mirror and looked at the left and right. Her beautiful appearance did not hurt, but there was an inch in the neck. I couldn’t see the little scars. Although I put down most of my thoughts, Fu Luoya has always been very proud of her white and slender neck. Now there is such a scar, how can she not be angry and anxious?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She angered: "Rogue, this bastard, where did you go?" He dared to start, actually left me a scar! This time I will never bind, I will not finish with him! Even if he still loses, he doesn't want to win easily! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: "This is a bit difficult." God has made the adults now commanding the army to fight with the kings of Levi and Latvia thousands of miles away. I am afraid that he does not have time to come back and fight with you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya was really sober, she calmed down and Rogge really didn't kill me. What is going on, I slept How long has it been?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes is still a year-old smile and what happened to God between adults, I don’t know. I only know that God sent the adults to send you to sleep before the expedition, saying that you can take a rest in the city of the gods. Your situation at the time was not very good. My old man had to think about it temporarily, so that you could sleep more and regain your spirit. You have only slept for ten days. The method of my old man has been borrowed from the elves, and it has always been very effective. You see, when you wake up, it is so energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoring a meal, it seems to endure very hard to say: "And I can see that you originally planned to do a big job in the underworld, play A lot of heaven and earth......."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya screamed, blushing on the face, for a time it was simply nowhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt that Hughes’s intelligent smile was so abominable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the smile of Hughes, Froya became more and more uncomfortable, and the face was hot and hot, and could not be eliminated anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also sneaked out, sang a short spell, a cold wind blowing from top to bottom, let her fight a chill, this calmed down Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya got together and said faintly: "If Rogge doesn't kill me, then I will leave. Tell him for me, one day I will still Will come back to kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiusi said: "God told the adults to let you live in the city of the gods for a while, if you want to go, I have to wait until he comes back and say it again. You know, I am just an ordinary elder elder, I can't disobey the instructions of God to make adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, he is going to imprison me here?" Froya was cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you must say imprisonment, then the entire city of the gods and the dozens of miles around you are your prison. In this prison, you Fully free to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya snorted free? Are you afraid that I will run? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes smiled and said: "In fact, you don't have a way to leave." I am the person who is responsible for guarding you. If you win me, you can naturally leave at will. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya looked up and down on Xius, and was very reluctant to slam the elder, my memory is not so bad, you are a killer. The killer is the natural enemy of our magician, don't say that your strength is far beyond me, even if it is not as good as me, I am not willing to do it with you. I understand, in fact, you still want to shut me down? Well, I I won't leave, but the princess can spend a lot of money on it, so you can't afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, two cups of tea will be ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes greeted Froya, the goblin was not polite, sit down and drink tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she drank it, she carefully reminisced, and suddenly she smiled and grabbed the cup in front of Xius, and it was a drink. Do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes sighed, a bitter, and muttered: "My old man just ordered his own tea, you and God make adults." It’s just a pair of robbers who don’t know how to respect the elderly. Fortunately, how much you know about tea and give it to the gods, it’s completely wasteful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Looking at Xiusi cooking tea, Fu Luoya quietly dispersed the lightning chain that was ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes smiled, and it seemed as if the insight into everything made Froia's heart very uncomfortable. She is almost certain that the old fox must have known that she is ready to attack him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, an inexplicable frustration rushed into her heart. Perhaps the authorities that I thought I have been doing all the time have been seen by these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughes seems to know what Fu Luoya is thinking, saying: "His Royal Flora, God told the adults to let me tell you, he is very grateful to you. Everything the butterfly does. He said that the latter thing, he will do it for you, you don't have to bother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya was shocked, complexion Very ugly, barely smiled: "The wind butterfly is so cute... I didn't do anything for her... The voice is getting smaller and smaller, and finally I can't say it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Froya's mood is extremely frustrated. She has deliberately buried the wind butterfly this trick, this is to think that even if he failed to die, but also dragged Rogge to hell together. Fu Luoya talent is extremely high, This time in the Northland and Rogge reunion, not long after, if she can not destroy Rogge's soul, it is difficult to completely kill him. And this person is extremely cunning, rough and thick, powerful, magic Resistance and anti-virulence are extremely strong, and there are countless people around. If you want to kill him, how easy is it? After thinking about it, in order to ensure that, in case, Froya is ready Use the powerful cursing power of the Wind Butterfly Soul Contract to destroy Rogge's soul.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, everything is gone.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously Rogge already knew her layout, how can she prevent it? It’s not good, it’s just a command to commit suicide.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fu Luoya is really difficult to control her mood, her eyes are a bit red, low and low: "It turns out that he has known everything... he cheated me very well!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes sighed: "With my understanding of God, even if he doesn't know that you are helping him, you can't succeed." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria bitterly said: "Yes! How can he not leave a way for himself? He left the obvious flaws of the wind butterfly, that is, he hoped that the hidden enemies around him would use his brain to deal with him, so as not to find a way from other aspects. And he must have had a response. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes sighed: "God made the adults let me persuade you, you have died." In the past, those things that are not happy, let it go! Calculating others all day is a very hard thing. He hopes that at least during the time of living in the city of the gods, he will be able to think about nothing and enjoy a relaxing day. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya changed his face and suddenly burst into tears on the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was silently on the side. He didn't know where to find the tea and a pot of clear spring, and cooked a small pot of tea silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fire of the tea is just right, and the still moving shoulders, crying, Fu Luoya stretched out his left hand, fumbling to take the small teapot from the stove and end it in front of himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Froya sat up, her face still tears dry. She first drank the tea, and then took the mirror, carefully packed up the look, and said:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I recognize it! It seems that I am fighting but the dead fat man. Just want to fight, my magic equipment has been taken away by him, and what to do with him to fight fat fat, so generous! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
