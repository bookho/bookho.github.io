			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before returning to the emperor, Rogge reported his trip to the Emperor in advance, detailing the military establishment, the service, the generals and the list of spoils. The name of this return is to report to the Feuerbach Emperor. If the non-Delaware empire has been attacked, and this high-sounding reason is in the forefront, Rogge, who is the highest commander of one party, leaves the defense zone and leads the army into the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Feuerbach’s merits on the battlefield in recent years are lacking, there is really nothing to boast about, there is a bit of boring, Roger’s great victory. It’s time to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great also wants to see Rogge again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the two expansions of the Empire’s territory have been brought about by this well-behaved fat man, although he seems to be somewhat ambitious, and he is bold in his work. Heart is hot. Roger’s past actions in the South have long been investigated by the empire’s intelligence agencies. However, the heresy of the sin in the eyes of the Church of Light is not a problem in the Asrofic Empire, and this fat man is really useful. On the surface, he has limited ability, sometimes he does not know what to do, but the battle is there, this is the best proof of talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Rogge’s little ambition..., Feuerbach’s emperor came to the heroes of the feathers and thought that he could fully accommodate the town. And can also take advantage of Rogge. Although this fat man has expanded his power and cracked down on his dissidents, he has gathered a lot of dangerous people around him. However, for the upper class of the Aristocratic Empire, he is a foreigner after all, and he really wants to talk about appeal and influence. It is far from being a big power minister who has been operating for many years, such as Alexander, Straw and Pompeii. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching the battle report from the southeast front, the Emperor who likes to attack and attack is itchy. At this time, the well-behaved fat man invited the emperor to personally lead the army to the south, completely escaping the arrogant Hailar people to the sea to complete an unprecedented feat of winning an estuary in the Aegean Sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great had been in the past for a long time, but after a slap in the keel, it seems that he is ten years younger. After receiving the report from the fat man, the Emperor personally presided over the military meeting and repeatedly discussed the feasibility of using the troops in Hailar, in the lengthy and heated debate of the courtiers. The Emperor listened, mediates, and commanded the commander, showing extraordinary energy, as if to restore the style of the heyday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty princes see the father and the mother recover, all happy, and each of these emperors is a beaming look on these two days. Of course, whether their psychologically true ideas are consistent with the surface is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estuary is of great significance to the Asfirock Empire and Feuerbach. Although the Longines Sea is vast, it is strictly within 6 seas. At the other end of the sea, the narrow and steep Baili Strait separates the Longines from the vast ocean. Although the value of the seaport on the west coast of the Longines is somewhat discounted, it is also an estuary, and it is the dream of many emperors of the empire. Successfully got an estuary, the meaning is no worse than the dwarf empire that captured the West. After the addition of this martial art, the status of Feuerbach in the annals of history almost caught up with the emperors of the most sacred empire in the history of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great has already begun to like this fat man. If he can always be faithful to the Empire, the Emperor feels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a rather bad decision to assign Marika to the fat man. I heard that the princess was unruly and gave birth to many incidents. She and the poet lover acted in Dresden and even broke the rules of the aristocracy. She did not put Rogra near the emperor's room as the emperor expected, but instead pushed him further and further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feuerbach is increasingly annoyed with Malika’s assertion. He began to worry that the whip was really too light. In his mind, women have no place at all and should not have any claims of their own. The only value of Marika is to use the blood of the royal family to hold a minister in the empire, and that is all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! The Emperor picked up a small donkey and knocked on the desk a small clock made of Mithril. After a while, the boss Sarah Wenger walked into the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor indulged for a moment and asked: "Sara Wenger, according to your opinion, can I get Rogge's loyalty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of Richelieu is already far away. You can see the fascinating and magnificent buildings. If the eyesight is good enough, you can see the city's unique means of transportation. The two high-lifted boats slowly emerge from the cracks in the building, actually running between the vertical and horizontal waterways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching Richelieu, Rogge looked puzzled at the large crowd of black people, not understanding what happened. It wasn't until people saw the fluttering bloody battle flag and the tidal cheers that Rogge realized that these people actually came to meet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the empire's practice, a ceremonial ceremonies will be arranged as long as the generals who have made great contributions return to the Imperial Capital. Rogge did expand the territory for the empire and made great contributions. However, the Sergey Principality on his front line still exists. Although no one believes that this heroic Principality can continue to survive, but since the war has not completely subsided, Rogge’s credit has not been assessed for the time being, so there should be no welcoming ceremony in this return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who greet him are completely self-contained! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man himself did not expect that there would be such a heroic triumph, this is really inexplicable. Suddenly he was indulged, and he wondered if there would be any conspiracy in this, or whether he should change direction and enter the city from another city gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hoof sounded behind him, and Robsky rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults are really invincible! You see, even the people of the emperor are so respectful to you, is Richelieu? It is the first city in the North, Tiffany Compared with it, Ni is too stingy. You can conquer the hearts of the Emperor, and the difficulty is much higher than conquering an empire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stopped the team and frowned at the people in the distance. What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robsky immediately said: "This is no longer obvious." The northern national customs are brave, the most respected is the warriors, and the Asfirock Empire has always paid attention to military merit. Think about it, the adults will hold up the bloody double flag when you fight, such as the landslide and tsunami, and captured the Delaware Empire, where General Frederick is not allowed. If you march like this power, you can't beat it, and you can't win the battle. Let the Delaware people have a million corpses and a thousand miles of blood. So military! General Lieutenant General can be called the imperial star, then what about adults? You are the new army god of the empire! It is so normal for the Empire civilians to love you! What is this little welcome scene? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge said faintly: "I slaughtered a few cities and killed a lot of people." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are killing the enemy of the empire, naturally the more you kill, the better." What's more, they are not their loved ones. Who cares about this? In the past, where the Imperial Army passed, although there was no massacre, there were not many living people left. When Alexander took the name to attack the dwarf empire, he heard that the dwarfs were enough to have five million! "Robersky is the way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded, he naturally knows. But he is very reluctant to enter the city so arrogantly. But since the crowd has already Now that he is, it’s impossible to slip. It’s hard to avoid it, it’s only going to be more subtle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man frowned, on the Roberts Road : "The word "Military God" will not be mentioned to anyone in the future! Go into the city! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Rogge has experienced what is a narrow welcome.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young men are all excited, they are screaming, showing their muscular muscles, hoping to be seen by Rogge and join his guard. In addition to the fanatical worship, the girl’s eyes are more rippling. The spring affair. Although the elderly are not as impulsive as the young people, the enthusiasm in the eyes is not bad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first time for the civilians of the Imperial Capital I carefully observed Rogge. The fat man was unremarkable, and the kindness and kindness of the people did not match the heroic image of the people. But the bloody battle flags on the two sides behind him in the cold wind excited them to boil. They can't help but imagine that the dark red is close to the purple-black flag, which is dyed by the blood of many enemies!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you let them see What are the real scenes after the massacre, how do these people think about it? In the wave of cheers, Rogge slowly moved forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he felt that the world didn’t seem to be true, everything around him was away from him. It’s so far away. Everything is like a big dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheering people, although born in the Aspiro Empire, glory of war, But like any resident of a strong and imperial country, most of them will never see the fierce and cruel one on the battlefield in their lifetime, not to mention the fact that after the massacre, thousands of souls drifted in the wind. They will only be dazzled by the aura of the winner's head, and will not see the hell under the light; they think they smell the rich blood in the aura, and they are excited, but when they are really full of hands Will it be so hot when it comes to blood like a sea?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner or later, the empire will open a passage to the south. These people live on the road pointed by the empire's army, and they will die sooner or later. Dead now, countless souls can also be used to wake up ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can put your name on the back, Rogge will never hesitate. It’s just that none of his men have such a person. Among the people who have followed him, only Charlie has this talent, but unfortunately he has already died in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog suddenly felt wet and greasy on the hands, like the blood that had not fully solidified. He raised his right hand and watched it carefully. The hands are white and clean, spotless, completely smudged, and don't look like a hand with powerful power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the fat man closes his eyes, he will see that the hands are all dark red viscous liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But *** needs a soul..." Rog thought. I don't know why, at this moment, his heart and true thoughts have surfaced and are magnified thousands of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since she needs it, since no one helps me, then I will kill myself..." He closed his eyes and gently rubbed his tongue, his mouth exposed. A smile. It is like smelling blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咔嚓! In a gloomy basement, the crystal ball in the center of the altar suddenly burst open, and after the image of Rogge swayed, it twisted a few times and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big blood of the big stocks then rushed out of the cracked crystal ball, and the white altar was dyed into a bright red! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage wrapped in a black robe took a few steps and carried it on the altar. The mage struggled to prop up the upper body, avoiding the blood erupting from the cracks in the crystal ball like spring water. In the dodge, the hood was touched, revealing half of the face. Look at the beautiful silhouette, delicate skin and purple-black lips, it should be a pretty beautiful woman. Just the blood flowing from the corner of her mouth is a strange purple blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female mage finally stood up straight, wiping the blood from the lips with her sleeves. Surprisingly, from the cuffs of her cuffs, it was not the fingers of the beautiful women, but the dancing tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can his mental strength be so powerful!? I just tried to guide his emotions, and even the dark blood crystal could not bear the emotional shock. Fluctuation, this is his unconscious shock. If it is a full counterattack..." The female mage's voice is low and hoarse, with a strange beauty. It was only halfway through her words that she was interrupted by a violent cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the basement rang a very unpleasant snoring sounding like a laugh. The voice immediately said: "I told you long ago, don't try to touch his soul. Haha, have you suffered? You guys are so arrogant to become an soul sorcerer for years, but also want to touch Touching his soul? It’s almost the same by your tutor!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture can’t be transmitted, I rely on it, I’ll play it myself... I hope everyone supports it. what! ! The mage said evilly: "You shut me up! I can't touch his soul. Can't you still deal with you? Your faint soul fire, I can put it out!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice in the corner laughed a few times, then said: "The world you see in your shallow eyes is a bit more real? Look at your poor look now. I will not bully you. When you are fully recovered, if you are willing to test the strength of my soul, feel free to welcome it! In fact, I am still the same sentence, and your tutor is almost the same!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female mage is so angry that her robes are in a wave of waves, but she finally just throws a sentence: "You will pay for your rudeness!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the younger soul sorcerers are arrogant and ignorant guys, it’s not easy to see you, I still have to warn you, it’s best not to try again. What to do to him. I have observed him for a long time. But the instinct tells me that I can never approach him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The coward!" The female mage snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also provoked a ruthless ridicule: "He is the one chosen by the princess! The princess's vision, how is it better than yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female mage is speechless for a while, then hates the earth: "How can I not see where he is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
