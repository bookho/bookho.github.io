			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth day of the book is destroyed on the fifth day (seven)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing brush! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Flame Sword with a subtle humming, draws a beautiful blue arc in the air, gently strokes the body of the four fighting angels, The sky with dramatic color changes leaves four golden blood flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The servant of Dissmasen! What are you doing?" The voice of Niortola thundered and descended from the sky: "You are attacking the great plug." The servant of Tannistoria, you are betraying the Lord God of Heaven! You will pay a price for your betrayal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Neotoria The snoring came along with a large expanse of golden light rain. In this gorgeous light rain, all the demons began to suffer painfully, while the wings of the fighting angels showed a faint golden glow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the Mozu warrior will be ignited as soon as it touches these golden raindrops, then screams of all kinds of pain, twitching in the flames, Trembling, a little bit burned to ashes. These golden light rains are very strange. The process of destroying life by the flames is very slow. The ignited Mozu warriors are still not liberated until they are burned into a small piece of ashes. They are still struggling and making fine shackles. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this vast and vast golden light rain, the wings of the holy peaks tremble fiercely, and every drop of raindrops will cause a shield on the shield. The ripples of the circle. But no matter how violent the fluctuations, this shield always persists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of the sky, Rogge is retreating freely, and is not affected by this light rain. Those golden raindrops fell on him and squirmed for a while. It will infiltrate Rogge's skin and be completely absorbed by the fat man. The longer the latitude and longitude in the rain, the more radiant the face of Rogge, apparently enjoying the power of the wise angel Neotoria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are more than a dozen combat angels gathered around the fat man, but although they are dominant in number, the scene is absolutely inferior. In front of Roger's blue wings, all the fighting angels have feared from the depths of their souls. They are not afraid of Rogge, but the faint ruin of the Lord! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A battle angel a little further away from Rogge. The radiance of the body from Neotoria has been dimmed a lot, and the angels who fight in Rogge's body are even more unbearable, the radiance of the body has completely disappeared, and even the golden armor is faintly blue. Rays. Not only are they unable to gain power from Neotoria, but their power is also greatly suppressed by Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small space, Rogge’s figure flickered and his speed has reached a new level. At this time, the wind is here, I am afraid that it is not much faster than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left with a strange whistling sound, and easily grabbed a holy gun that stabbed his heart, no matter the sharp The extreme gun blade, or the extremely hot flame, can only leave a shallow scar on his hand. And Roger's bare skin is covered with such scars, and these insignificant scars are still healing at an incredible speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue wings behind Rogge quietly stretched to the maximum before more than a dozen lightning-struck weapons. Keep your entire back wing up. Then in the snoring, two holy guns, a flame axe and a thick barbed hinge hit the Roger's blue wing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a squeaky metal friction, four weapons originating from the heavens actually bounced off and could not completely break the wing of Rogge. Four heavy hits, only a few flying blue feathers in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wing is the most glorious, sensitive and vulnerable part of the angel, but the blue wings behind Rogge. Has become his strongest shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrast between reality and expectations is too great, and the four fighting angels could not understand the facts and saw the facts slightly. This momentary stagnation is enough to bring them into the abyss of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few invisible shadows appear quietly, and they have crossed the perimeter of the four fighting angels in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of these fighting angels are not able to see everything in the world, at least the loneliness of Rogge hidden under the blue wing has never appeared in their sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Blue Wing is a solid shield, the Winged Wing is a sharp blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niotolia makes an angry roar. Until then he remembered. Rogge has the brilliance of Desmason, and he will not be suppressed by his power. The damage that the fighting angels who use the Heavenly Flame as a weapon can bring him is also very limited. The moment he saw Rogge, Neotoria unknowingly waited for him as a cowardly demon, even after seeing the breath of the Lord of Destruction on him. He always couldn't understand why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shower is difficult to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inexhaustible light rain is also a very heavy burden for Niotolia. After the brief storm, the battlefield of the Devils finally rains. It is also the situation in which the Holy Light and the Blood Cloud kill each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The showers are short-lived, but the blow to the entire Mozu is far-reaching and heavy. Every moment of the rain, there are hundreds of thousands of Mozu warriors who fall down in pain and burn a small ashes in the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of the rain stop, Rogge bowed his head and saw that there had been a large expanse of open space on the entire battlefield. His eyes were sharp, and in an instant he had seen the empty space filled with squirming gray charcoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see the desperately struggling soul in the ashes, he can hear the hysterical pain of the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thousands of sorrows come together, even Rogge, who never knows what is sorrowful, has a slight shudder in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the souls of these Mozu soldiers have been associated with this land since then, even if the ashes are shattered, the painful souls will not get Relieved, they will linger on the edge of life and death forever, and endlessly recall the most painful moment of the edge of life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day. There is power that can overcome the existence of Neotoria and come here, and purify these painful souls, and they will receive eternal redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked up and looked at Niotoria, who was standing in the air. At the moment when his eyes met, a blue and gold lightning suddenly fell in the sky. There are countless angry thunders! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles coldly. The figure flashed, and it was already attached to the back of a combat angel. He stretched his left hand. The angel's wings are easily grasped in the hand, and then the right hand flame sword is swept away, and the wings have been squatted from the angel's back!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky The fragrance is overflowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked up again, and looked at Niotoria coldly, then his body flashed, avoiding the encirclement of more than a dozen fighting angels. U-turned to a distant battle angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niotolia's eyes are slightly closed. Start singing songs in a strange language. His spells are extremely simple and short. With just over ten syllables, there is a light that descends from the sky and hits the shield of the Holy Mountain supported by the Emperor. The light continues, it seems that there is no time to stop, but the pressure contained in it is always the same, and the pressure of the holy peak cover is flickering and it seems to break at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise angel sang a spell consisting of only three syllables. Then he reached out and pointed to Rogge! Only at his finger, Rogge’s figure has disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niottoria was slightly surprised. He had re-captured Rogge’s position between his thoughts, and then reached out to the fat man. However, just as he moved to the short moment of the extension, Rogge escaped to several kilometers as if he had not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niotolia was shocked and angry. Rogge’s blackmail has exceeded his imagination. He repeatedly pointed out, but all failed, but instead of being smashed by Rogge, he killed three fighting angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence Angel finally gave up the idea of ​​destroying Rogge with a short spell, and sang a longer spell. This time, he only needs to stare at Rogge with his eyes, and he can cast spells instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s body was stagnant in the air. Then he fell to the ground like a meteor. This sudden change is clearly beyond the expectations of the fighting angels, who have swept over Rogge. They all rushed. When they woke up and turned around, Rogge suddenly panned, then suddenly rushed to the sky, and put a group of fighting angels behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously in this short moment, he has fully adapted to the power of the Niortolian Thunder attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niotolia once again roared, this time he used only a few syllables to complete a new spell. At the instant of the spell's completion, all the fighting angel wings have a faint golden glow, and there are countless subtle symbols floating from the golden awns, floating in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rogue flying in the sky suddenly felt the atmosphere around it became very dignified, and then there was a subtle but fierce wind coming from behind. In the wind, the speed of the fighting angels that had been left behind him was greatly increased, and he had already caught up behind him! War guns, flame spears, giant swords, and simple lightnings rushed to his back, and the speed of fighting angels in the distance also increased rapidly, and they stopped in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although caught up by the fighting angels, Rogge did not panic, he was the glory of Desmasson, and any power derived from heaven’s power caused him The damage will be very limited. The blue wing behind him showed off the entire rear, and under the blue wing, the space was slightly distorted. The wings of the emptiness were ready, and the battle angels would not be hit. They will kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the huge and melodious hum of Neotoria is constantly falling, and Rogge knows that he is casting a spell, but he does not know the spell. What is the function. After listening to a few notes, Rogge suddenly felt the great power contained in these spells. Almost every syllable contained more power than the high-level magic launched by the Terran Magi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s heart chills at the beginning of his life, there is a sharp pain in the back that has penetrated into the bone marrow! At this moment, the unspeakable pain has made his soul completely It turned into a blank! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally realized the pain of the most feared wings of the angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to turn his head and look back, only to find that the fighting angels’ weapons were like their wings. There is a faint radiance, and there are countless symbols in the light that represent the power of various forces, but they do not break. This time, the Great Sword left a deep scar on his blue wing, but that's it. The extra-large flame spear completely broke through Rogge's defense and pierced his blue wing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge screams and his body twitches. When it falls, it falls. The blue wing that was pierced did not rub against the flame spear, and the wound quickly cracked. Almost let Rogge faint! However, the enlarged wound finally allowed his blue wing to escape from the flame spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rogge didn’t have a breathing time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a breeze around him, and several of the fastest fighting angels had gathered together, raising their weapons and slamming them into Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s mind is in dizziness and has not recovered from the heavy blow of the wing damage. However, he faintly felt the arrival of the crisis, so he struggled to shake the blue wing, and it was a sharp pain that broke through the heart. However, this time in addition to making him a resounding trombone, he also completely removed the vertigo from his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! The sound of metal crashes in the sky is like the huge bronze bells hitting together. Then there was a golden flame in the sky, and the golden flames burst into fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the moment when several fighting angel weapons are about to fall on Rogge, Rogge’s body suddenly disappears without a trace, leaving only the film in place. A piece of watery ripples. These combat angels are still not adapting to the sudden increase in strength and speed several times, unprepared, and slammed together. Their speed and attack power are so powerful. However, the defensive power has not been enhanced, so under the collision, all the fighting angels were seriously injured, and even one of them was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s figure emerged outside of the kilometer, he just jumped out of the void, almost a moment of collapse. Has not been moved. Although he has read the book of Hilo, he has a good understanding of the secrets of the gods, but the momentary movement of this magic beyond the mortal magic system is still an extremely heavy burden for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the wound on Rogge's blue wing has healed quickly, he still can't move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two flame swords are lifted high. Heavy fall. But when it reached the end, it suddenly lost all the power, and the sword was biased. Sliding past Rogge's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of the eyes of the two fighting angels quickly dimmed, and a sudden burst of intense light in their bodies, one planted to the ground. After the battle angels, Locarna’s small land and the giant blade of the hand appeared. She has a wide variety of colors in her eyes, smiling at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her unhurried gesture has not been finished, just an exclamation, dancing with a giant blade to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge, this reminds me that Loka will not fly at all. It is really impossible for him to understand why the terrorist forces in Locara could not fly in the air, but now it is obviously not the time to explore this issue. The fat man who got a little breathing gas has recovered some strength. His blue wings have spurred and rushed to the bottom of Luojia, and he copied her small body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, three or five combat angels roared to catch up. Rogge waved his backhand and opened an invisible force field around him. The fighting angels rushed into the field of force, and the effect of the force that was strengthened by Niortolia immediately disappeared without a trace. This time they were unable to adapt to the sudden weakening of the force, the trajectory of flying in the air changed direction, flew obliquely from the side of Rogge. Of course, Rogge would not let go of such a good opportunity. He endured severe pain and waved a giant sword in his hand, and smashed half of the wings of a fighting angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! Hurry and throw me back to the Holy Peak! I won't fly!" Lojay suddenly struggled in Rogge's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge couldn’t think about it, and between the waves, he had already thrown Luojia into the distant peak. Her small body fluttered to the holy peak, and she had a huge blade in the air, and she fell heavily. Then a battle angel in the distance seemed to be drawn by an invisible force and flew to the blade of Locar. It turned into a group of incense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After throwing Loga, Rogge endured the pain and began to fly in the air, and behind him, more than 20 combat angels agitated the wings, full speed Chasing. And more than a dozen combat angels tried to intercept Rogge in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between heaven and earth, the voice of Neotoria is still thunderous. The glory of more than a thousand combat angels is getting brighter and brighter, and their power is correspondingly greatly increased. Rogge has felt extremely strenuous. At this moment, he did not dare to fight with these fighting angels. If one is not good, it may be entangled. At that time, more than ten combat angels swarmed up, and the fat man might have been sleeping in the land of Devil. On the side of the holy peak, the guardian enchantment supported by the devil is inconspicuous, and the fire of the canopy will burst from time to time. It seems that it is possible to collapse at any time, and Loca also tends to leap several times in order to reach a fighting angel. The fighting angels she cut down are often hurt and not killed. As for the demon dragon who has just resisted more than ten combat angels with one strength, he has not dared to fly out of the scope of the magical peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than a dozen of the demon sorcerers who supported the guardian field on the holy peak were nearly exhausted, and fell one by one. And the real hell is actually under the holy peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, the Devils’ warriors who can still hold nearly a thousand fighting angels, no matter how brave, it’s hard to delay the battle with a lot of fighting power. The speed of the angel slaughter. Only powerful dragons can fight against several fighting angels. However, the rogue fighting adult dragon is only more than ten heads. Compared with thousands of fighting angels, they are in absolute disadvantage in quantity. In addition to the hundreds of the most powerful Mozu warriors, there are no other demons who can help the dragon fight against the heavenly battle angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every second, there will be thousands of Demon warriors falling down, and the next second. The combat angels who are less obstructed will be slaughtered faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the holy peak as the center, the color of the earth is changing from dark red to blue and green, and the blood of the Mozu warrior is slowly flowing, spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niotorlia stretched out into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s snoring seems to have filled every corner of the battlefield! Numerous power symbols emerged from his body, surrounded by him and surrounded by flying, forming a beautiful ring of aura. Around the aura, there are many small angels flying up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Rogge always fled in the east. It is better to add to the wounds in the battle of the angels and not to rush to the sky. Attack him. Neotoria is not sure whether Rogge has not attempted to attack his ontology directly because he knows his current state. The Seventh Wisdom Angel is different from Victoria and the Light Angel. His body has a very weak fighting power, and he is not much stronger than an ordinary combat angel. However, his body's defensive power is far beyond Victoria, and his true ability is reflected. It is that it can greatly improve the combat power of the battle angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his power has reached its peak, and the defense of the body is close to being immune to all attacks. Even if the Lord God is in person, it is difficult to break his defense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niotoglia squats while looking down on the battlefield. He simply did not look at the tyrannical demon who was fighting on the Holy Peak, and his eyes always followed Rogge. Whether Rogge is invisible, leaps into parallel space, or uses magic to launch a storm or a rain to cover up his body shape, Niortol's eyes can always look in the right direction. And the eyes of dozens of fighting angels chasing Rogge are consistent with Niotoria's line of sight, rushing toward the focus of the vision of the wise angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Neotoria saw Rogge look back at him, and the fat man’s eyes flashed a sneak peek! The angel of wisdom suddenly trembled, but the figure of the fat man was blurred, and he was out of his sight and disappeared into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Niortola is at its peak, but his power has been consumed too much, and soon, he blessed the fighting angels. The ability of the project will disappear one by one, and he himself will have to return to heaven because the power is too large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to everything now is time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this high in the wise angels. Only by killing Rogge with all the demons in a short period of time will it stop the excessive consumption of power, stabilize the existence of the devil, and complete the work of cleaning the entire devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he saw the unguarded sacred guardian field, Loka will never tire of jumping, the damn dragon that is dying but still fighting In any case, it is not to fight with the fighting angels. And with a burst of purple brilliance, suddenly appeared in the battlefield over the Miro. The wise angel finally knows that his mission here is probably to end in failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the power of Neotoria is already consumed too much, and Rogge is different from the Mozu, the fat man who carries the glory of the Lord God has a huge advantage for the angel. If the fighting angels do not get the full blessing of Neotoria, it is difficult to form damage to Rogge. Fat people can rely on guerrilla tactics. Kill these fighting angels one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river of time has different flow rates at each plane. Neotoria knows that the process of returning to heaven and regaining power is very long. When he returns to the devil world, he does not know what year and month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Heaven have patience and give him another chance? Neotoria knows the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission of the Seventh Angels includes cleaning the entire demon world and supervising the growth of the new generation, until then, the fighting angels will return to heaven. The duties of the Guardian Devils will be handed over to other Lord Gods. When the source of faith in the entire plane is exhausted, it will become a deserted place outside the horizon of heaven. Only one or a few low-order angels will be appointed to inspect the abandoned land to avoid the breeding of power. Too strong presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even though Neotoria has almost killed the Mozu, his mission has not been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the battlefield. In addition to a few demon-defying dragons, almost all of the Mozu warriors have fallen in the blazing flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the extinction of all Mozu races, the future of the Mozu has completely fallen into the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large block of blue-green blocks everywhere, and almost every time the wind blows, it will contain a strong aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a war without a winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Rogge is still looking for opportunities to find the chance to be a winner, thinking that the wind and moon will return to the godhead. Over time, the power of Neotoria began to decline rapidly, and only a few high-ranking Mozus on the earth were already at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
