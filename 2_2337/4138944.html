These whistle sounds are so high, they have already surpassed the range that ordinary people's ears can capture. The sharper and sharper whistle contains powerful power. Wherever they are, the slightly fragile items in the room of Xiusi burst, and naturally include tea sets that he has not yet had time to pack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle sounds like a wave of waves, a wave is higher than a wave, and in the blink of an eye, there is a hurricane in the room of Xius, a mess. Until a wall suddenly blasted a magical flame, a magical array hidden in the wall was completely destroyed, and the whistle broke the source and slowly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle also reveals a faint sacred atmosphere. It is the elf girl in the city of the gods, Effie, who can sing the whistle that is so rich in the sacred power that was originally characterized by the thick and gentle nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the jade whistle in her hand with some confusion, which was covered with cracks, and a small magical flame radiating the last light and heat. Obviously because she was blowing too hard, this jade whistle has been ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie thought for a moment, but did not want to understand anything, she simply stopped thinking, just throwing the broken jade in the hand, and then called Road: "Constantin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal dressed as a waiter came out from the other side of the gallery and said: "Effie, yours If things are done, then go to practice immediately! You must hurry up for time training, or when can you take the prophecy further and further? Look, the other elves in this shrine city. How much time does it take to clean the environment every day? Dress up on your own body, oh, so these elves have pure souls, but the power is still so bad. Effie, as long as you listen to my teachings, and progress according Fighting with the two elders. Of course, their facts are nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie frowns: "In the city of the gods The elf is not as useless as you think. At least the elders of Hughes are very powerful. He is a killer. ., And the strength is close to the sanctuary "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"? Sanctuary "Constantine smiled. Tao: "In the face of the glory of the Most High God, the power of the Sanctuary is only a negligible flame. Although the killer can be said to be the natural enemy of the law-control, but if there is a chance, I will still compare with him, you will know the Holy Kingdom. The magic and the vastness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie’s body suddenly rises to a sacred atmosphere, and then looks at Constantine with clear eyes, literally and authentically : "You will be very miserable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin. Then he laughed and said: "Effie, your sacred power is progressing fast, but the prophecy is much more practice. Well, go to meditate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Effie suddenly frowned, his face ugly, and couldn’t help but say: "Good bloody suffocation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin to the South Looking at it for a while, slowly said: "There are a lot of elves in that direction. I see that there are five or sixty thousand in number, and many of them are wounded. You continue to meditate, I will go and see what can be done. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the whole city of the gods boiled up, and the elves ran back and forth, seemingly flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a chaotic moment. There is no elf to take care of Constantine who stood in the temple of God. Although the elves of the City of God do not exclude the Terran and other races because of Rogge's relationship, it is impossible to trust the Terran in the short time if they want to trust the people. Moreover, after Constantine arrived at the city of the gods, in addition to teaching Effie's holy spells, he only cleaned the temple every day, and never had the time to reveal his skills. The elves of the City of God also thought that he was just an ordinary human race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrors of the elves are for a reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, a few elf riders came to the city of the gods. They brought a very amazing news, the Green Sea was robbed by the orcs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf generals assembled nearly 30,000 capable elves and mobilized a sufficient number of war gods to leave the Green Sea. The generals were determined to keep the dirty beasts out of the green sea, and they must not let their filthy claws step on the land of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a broad and sparse woodland, the elves and the orcs launched a decisive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf generals found that the orc equipment they faced this time was much better and more organized than before. They are no longer in the shaman's magic, and they are red-eyed and charged. This time in front of the superior elf, the orcs actually know how to gather the formation, slowly retreating, although the elves and war beasts continue to impact their defense lines, and each impact has caused huge casualties, but in the orc army Like an invisible and brilliant command, the line of defense never collapses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand elves are on the 50,000 orcs. According to past experience, the elves will inevitably occupy an absolute advantage and will soon become a massacre. The beasts who made this time, despite wearing simple armor, the weapons in their hands are much better than the past, but they are not comparable to the elf warriors who are well-equipped and dwarf. According to the experience of the wizard generals, this battle should end within half a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the battle continued from noon to dusk, and the orcs dropped more than 10,000 bodies, but they were still stubbornly resisting. And the physical strength is far less than the orc's elf warrior, it seems a little exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a burst of stench quietly enveloped the entire battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves erected their ears alertly, and the gryphons hovering in the sky also made a burst of uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the earth began to tremble slightly, and the sound of the beasts was sent to the battlefield with the wind of the evening! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf generals are not locked in the threat of the beast trombone, but the heavy footsteps of the thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals have at least 100 years of leading experience. As soon as they heard it, they could tell how many orc warriors were represented by these footsteps, and the orc warriors were quiet and terrible, just trotting and rushing to the battlefield, and there was no such raging landslide and tsunami! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals of the elves have a word at the same time, a word that they can't believe, discipline! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs will have discipline, is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They immediately ordered. The horn was sung and the green sea was ready to be withdrawn. But in front of them, the orcs suddenly fought back. I was forgotten to drag the elves to the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the first row of orc warriors appeared on the hills. When they appeared, all the elves had passed a chill. Is this still the orc in their memory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the orcs are taller and stronger than the orcs that are common in the Central Mountains, and the skin is dark green, and some places have thin scales. Every orc warrior is draped in a shiny heavy armor, hand-held with a fine steel axe and a thick steel shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presented in front of the elves is a large, well-disciplined, well-equipped orc army! Behind the regular infantry. Raised a battle flag on one side, the totems in the center of the battle flag are different, representing different orc tribes. Only from this can you still see the characteristics of the past orcs in the tribal era. But that's it. All the orc warriors are neatly equipped. If they don't have those flags, they can't see the difference between these orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These flags not only represent different tribes. Every orc tribe will have a ritual or shaman ranging from a few to a few. Then the more than twenty tribal flags fluttering at least represent the beasts with nearly a hundred shamans and sacrifices. This has overwhelmed the wizard wizards and sacrifices in number. Moreover, the mana's mana is also nearly exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc warrior suddenly ran out of a large number of trolls, they were carrying ten javelins behind them, jumping and marching in the woods. Coming to the elves. Their landmark guns are not as good as the elf's bow and arrow in terms of range and accuracy, but the horrible lethality is unmatched by the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolves act quickly. Powerful, it is a terrible race in the orcs. However, they have always had low fertility, so the number has not been much, and thus it has not been able to set off a lot of storms. But at this moment, there are four or five thousand wolves in the back of the Elf army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beasts not only have a great army, they not only use tricks, they even have many war monsters that the elves have never seen before! The scouts whose elves were scattered did not have a return, so that tens of thousands of elf warriors did not know that they had been surrounded by orcs. Maybe the Elf Scouts may be wiped out, but why didn't there be an alarm in the sky? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the generals have no chance to find the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when the orcs were fully encircled and launched a full charge, the headed elf general suddenly discovered that there was a thick smoke rising in the direction of the Green Sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100,000 orcs swept the entire green sea like tides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although although he spent hundreds of years of peaceful life in the Central Mountains. The elves still have not forgotten the hard living environment and the danger of enemies. Green Sea has several programs to deal with emergencies. Each of the elves' minds will receive relevant training when they are mature. So when the orcs arrived, the Green Sea Elf was shocked. But there is no confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves of the brigade squad were neatly and orderly evacuated to the designated place, the soldiers used for the garrison were mobilized, and the remnants of the war monsters of all ethnic groups were Concentrated, led by the elders who can fight, greeted the orcs who came from all over the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf is very elegant even in the battle, it is also a rare enjoyment in the eyes of other races. They always have the means to gracefully send sharp swords, guns or bows and arrows from the weakest parts of the orc's armor. Unfortunately, these elf warriors are green sea elves. Rather than the elves of the city of gods, there is no poison on their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc warriors are physically strong and tenacious. If they are not directly involved, they often struggle to fight for a while, and then die. However, the elf warriors are different, they only need to be brought a little by the orc's huge weapons. It is possible to be seriously injured and lose fighting ability. Then their delicate body, along with the magnificent armor of their body, will be distorted under several heavy weapons that fall at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is so short, they don’t even have a scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elf warrior fired the arrow on his back, then threw the magic longbow, pulled out the close-fighting dagger, and threw himself into a tall orc warrior. She opened the orc's throat with a sword, but the orc swept across the ground and brought a chill to her abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaped lightly and landed on the ground. Then I looked down at my abdomen and the beautiful face turned white! The orc's tomahawk not only scratched her armor, but also cut her abdomen, almost cut her waist! There are not only blood, but also numerous pieces of internal organs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf female soldier snorted and realized that the sky suddenly darkened. She looked up and stared indifferently at a giant foot that was slamming down on her head and nearly two meters wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak elf female warrior disappeared into the foot and could not even reveal her hands and feet. Only the tip of a short sword was exposed outside, and the blood was like a spring, and it was flowing along the sword of the short sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thrilling roar spread throughout the battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war behemoths on the battlefield, whether they belong to the orcs or the elves, shivered under the roar of this roar. The elves and the lions are weak and can no longer carry the knights on their backs. One by one, it fell. The war beasts on the orc side are on the ground, indicating that they are victorious. And the various war behemoths of the Elf side have stepped back, and it is useless to let the elves who drive them out order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf of the Elf female warrior and the other three giant feet together supported a huge body of more than 20 meters. This body resembles a dragon rather than a dragon. It looks like a kind of Yalong. The body supports a huge upper body of a humanoid, and the giant has a curved corner and some resembles a demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like a thunder. Spit the smell of sulfur. A pair of giant claws swayed the wind and thunder, and rushed through the tens of thousands of elf troops...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unnatural flames are rapidly igniting in the green sea. This is a large wall of fire hundreds of meters wide, and the ends are still growing rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side of the fire wall is tens of thousands of lucky to be able to leave the battlefield elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the wall of fire, there are countless orcs, troops after the elves, and those who have not yet had time to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among the 100-meter fire wall, there are hundreds of elves and thousands of orc warriors who are screaming in pain. Under the burning of the raging flames, they walked through the last part of their lives with pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time was too urgent, and the elves who fled almost abandoned everything in the Green Sea. The road to the south has been occupied by the orcs, and their only way out is in the north. At least in the north is a city of elves, a city of gods. However, there were only over 10,000 people who left the Green Sea tribe. The elves can't keep the green sea, and how can they count on the city of the gods to withstand the attacks of the orcs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the only hope for the surviving elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves of the City of God have informed the Green Sea of ​​their position, and now the Green Sea Elves are escaping to the city of God in full speed. Come. They also sent a speedy knight to come to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the city of the gods has some feelings of no ownership, both Xius and Rogge have no news, and the actions of the orcs are very fast, it is expected three days later. You will arrive at the city of the gods. The elves who fled the team will arrive in two days. In fact, the time left for the elves is very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the information provided by the detective who came to report, the two elders who presided over the city of the gods knew immediately, with the fragile nature of the city of gods City defense is not enough to stop the orc army coming from the tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They immediately decided to withdraw to the underground castle that had just been built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf city that is integrated with nature is different from the human city that cannot be moved at all. It is much easier to relocate. But if you want to move completely in a few days, that is absolutely impossible. So the elves can only choose to relocate the most important things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves have a good time to say that they can survive tens of thousands of years in the seed state, but what about the Amorro that provides energy to the city of the gods? ? Once it is lifted, there is no one who can subdue it in the city of the gods. The two elder elders negotiated and finally decided to speed up the operation of the magic array and extract all the vitality of the Amorro. Completely destroy its existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, this kind of ectopic demon can't let them exist in this plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the elves of the order have just gone out. Effie pushed the door in, and she followed the commanding elf behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amorro is useful, don't kill it! I will advise it to work with us." The elf girl entered the door as soon as she entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two elder elders face each other and persuade a demon with a different face? is it possible? However, they all know that Ai Feier has a different relationship with Rogge and Hughes, so if she thinks about it, she agrees to try it. Anyway, there is still some time, waiting for this elf girl to defeat. As soon as they ran the magic array, the blood-sucking thorns inserted into the body of Amorro would grow wildly. In less than an hour, all the thorns would gather in the heart of the Amorro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they got permission from the two elders, Effie immediately ran out like a gust of wind. Her goal was not to hold the hall of Amorro, but to return to the temple of God, and to drink until Constantine automatically appeared in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a demon in the hall over there. It's quite useful. Go and persuade it and let it go with us. I I have to find something, and I will hand it over to you." Effie specifically emphasized the word 'good'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the clear eyes of the two autumn waters, Constantine has nothing to say, only a smile. He shook his head and was about to go out. Effie cried again behind him: "Don't scare it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment later, he had stood in front of Amorro, where the guardian guards and the wizard wizards were ordered by the elders and withdrawn. Of course, the elves looked into the gaze of Constantine's gaze, full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dull roar, the hall door of the main hall slowly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantin looked up at Amaro, with a smile on his lips, and Amorro began to struggle uncomfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the hall door opens. The cardinal walked out of it without incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves who had been waiting outside the temple door immediately swarmed. They looked into the temple and found that all the blood-sucking thorns of the trapped Amaro had withered. Scattered in one place. On the huge body of Amorro, it is completely unbound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves were shocked and immediately took out their weapons and guarded them all. But Amoruo is on the ground, not moving, and taming like a kitten. It was just that it looked at the door of the temple, and it seemed to be full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to it?" An Elf Master caught up with Constantine and asked in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the name of the Lord, I just called it." The Cardinal replied faintly. He accelerated under his feet and had already gone far in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning three days later, the city of the gods has become an empty city. Although most of the buildings formed by plants still exist, there is no existence of ancient trees. They also lose their spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning breeze, Effie suddenly appeared, she dragged a big bucket, and came to the small lake, the milky white milky liquid in the bucket They are all dumped in the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake suddenly boils, like there are countless huge creatures in the life and death! After a while, a huge * in the lake rose into the sky, and the wave jumped out of a transparent giant egg with a diameter of nearly ten meters! Through the outer skin of the giant egg, it is faintly seen that there are countless small things in the squirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound, the giant egg suddenly broke a hole, so countless small and nearly transparent worms came out from the breach. In an instant, it is simply illusory that you are in purgatory! These insects shuttled through the lake in lightning, then jumped into the city of the gods, and found a plant that was still alive, and then drilled in, and there was no trace in the blink of an eye. Behind them, even the tiniest holes were left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie was standing by the lake, quietly watching countless bugs rushing past her feet. After a while, she finally stepped away. Wherever she falls, there is an endless path in the sea of ​​insects, just for the path she exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Effie left, another burly figure came to the lake. He looked at the direction in which Effie left, his face full of dignity and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the terrible insect tide is nearing the end, but there are still a large group of worms jumping out of the small lake from time to time, rushing to the city of the gods. And the clear little lake, the lake has dropped a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Elf City still looks no different from the beginning, although it loses its spirituality, it is still beautiful and refined. However, under the gorgeous appearance of the buildings, I don’t know how many bugs are lurking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of worms flew in front of the man, and he reached out and grabbed one from the swarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bug is only a short length, white body, soft shell, but the toughness is surprisingly strong. It has sharp ends like a cone and has short steel hair on the body. The worm made a sharp squeak, the body slammed, and the tip of the tail was inserted into the man's palm, then slammed and slammed forward, flashing forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s in a small body, it’s unexpectedly strong, and it’s the power of the bomb, at least a few meters away. However, the sacred light of the man’s palm radiates lightly. In this light, the straight worm that the body pulls straight does not fly, but how can it not reach the range of the man’s palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a drop of blood in the palm of his hand. The drops of blood have climbed out of countless tiny white spots, apparently this is the larvae of the insect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
