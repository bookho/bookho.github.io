			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod’s mood at the moment is as depressed as the sky outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of Bavaria, Dagong, just called him to talk long, the content is nothing new, or about the marriage. The old man insisted that the marriage of Louis IX was a great glory of the Bavarian Principality and a testament to the goodwill of the Rhine Union royal family. For the future of the entire Principality, Orphee Rock must accept this marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s already morning, the gloomy sky doesn’t put much light into Dagong’s study. Five huge candles on the candlestick blazed, and the warm light drove away a lot of haze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father! The three miracles contained in the history book have made the three great empires. With these examples in front, Louis IX can't be wary of us! He has no pre-emptiveness, but he is not prepared enough to start the war immediately. He has no chance of winning! This marriage is nothing more than he wants to delay the time!” Orpheco was a little excited, walking around on the scarlet carpet. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Rheinhart sitting on the high back chair moved his body and said slowly: "That said, but this time he has treasured his life." Princess Froya gave you a marriage, and it also showed sincerity. I heard that Froya’s child has a beautiful look and is under the guidance of the Jero Magi, and everything is worthy of you. You see you that night. I have been through her, how do you feel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophrod is not surprised that Dagong knows about it. In the past 30 years, Old Rhinehart has been in the political arena and the battlefield. Bavaria has been operated by a small Earl Territory and now has the most powerful force and national strength of the Rhine Union. It is not just lucky. of. In recent years, although older Rheinhart has become older, he has become more versatile and less enterprising, but his methods of minding will only be more old and deep. Even Orpheq himself did not know how much strength his father had in the dark. Although the combat power of the Knights of the Five Thousand Lions is enough to allow any opponent to think carefully before offending the Principality, Orphey will never simply believe that his father has only these superficial strengths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc sighed: "Father, in front of the throne, what can be sacrificed? Not to mention a princess? Louis IX is not willing to provoke Yero If we are willing to build such an enemy? If Louis IX turns his face, can we really kill Fu Luoya? Besides, if the other party intentionally delays, only engaged, not married, Louis IX after one year I can prepare for the military affairs. I can't refuse to give up this marriage and disrupt the layout of Louis IX."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is still not in a hurry Unsuccessfully: "Children, the marriage between the nobles is based on feelings? Marriage is just a benefit and blood bond that binds the two big families. I don't think you The real reason for accepting the princess is for the female magician named Elysses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc silently, came to the default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This Elise..." The old man has been indulging for a long time, apparently spending a lot of brains on how to use the words. "She is indeed a great woman, and her magic is very strong. In my opinion, her magic may be close to the magician! This outstanding girl is also the first time I see it. It is not surprising that you are fascinated by her. Just Child, as you said earlier, you can sacrifice anything for the throne. If you are just an ordinary youth, without this talent, I will not ask you so. But you are rich in nature, the Principality and William. The family is likely to shine on your body, and the name is eternal! For a woman to influence the decision of Qingming, it is not the wise man! Besides, I have not reached the point where the old eyes are dim, and the darkness of Elysses is so strong. It’s never just the result of practicing Dark Magic. At this time, you have to be careful to get in trouble!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offik Shen Sheng: “Father! Elysses will never do anything unfavorable to the Principality. And with our strength, it is now starting the army, I am also sure to defeat the Rhine League within three years! If it is to compete for personal strength, it is even less Worried. Even if Pross himself came to the Principality, whoever wins with me and who is who he wins, can still be said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Rhinehart looked The son of a calm and calm mountain, said only faintly: "Children, the paladin is not the invincible world, the battlefield and the political arena are completely different fields. Looking at the big 6, although the younger generation can compare with you almost No, but if you look down on the heroes of the world, you will suffer in the morning and evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, we are the only Principal in the alliance to support the Holy Church. The three thousand temple knights promised by the church will arrive in the Principality in two months. With my Golden Lion Knights and the Knights of the Temple, I am sure to defeat the Rhine League. What's more, the Philippe Emperor will never sit back. What are we afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orphey Roth: "I have promised that once the Principality and the Alliance war, students will be sent unconditionally. The church's request is to establish churches in various cities. The Principality is a religious country, and now there are several cities without churches. What is the difference between such conditions and conditions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children! Regardless of the consideration, accepting Froya is only good for the Principality. There is no harm! You can't get the 'glamour' magic, you can't see the obvious facts! This Elysian origin is so suspicious, but you are my only son, I have never asked. But when the forces of the various parties are gathering in the alliance, can other people not pay attention and will not ask questions? Is the head of the Knights of the Knights, Blood Angel, Augustus also turning a blind eye? The law enforcement officials of the Inquisition are also Is it your nephew? Your decision, where is your wise, where are you going? If you go on like this, don't say defeat the alliance, I am afraid that you can't even keep yourself and Elysses! From today , Elysses wants to disappear in front of the public, you can no longer be as unscrupulous as before!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc is cold and cold: "Father, We don't need to be so careful, does Elysses disguise herself with other breaths?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke saw Orphey's stubbornness There are also some helplessness in my opinion, and Elysses should go away immediately. But the child is proud of his character and should not be willing. Orphee, think about me when you go back. There are too many variables in this world, and there are too many unknown forces. Your power cannot determine everything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These reasons have been understood by Orpheus at a very young age, but on the question of Elysses, he has never been able to remain calm and rational. From the study, Orpheq thought about the current situation and walked to his own courtyard. He was far away, and he felt the powerful magical fluctuations in the courtyard. Obviously, Alexis is currently The mood is not very good. The golden lion smiled a bit, with the pride of Elysses, where did she evade or converge on her own breath? After thinking about it, a passion and self-sufficiency came into being. Elysses was powerful. No match, the day is not far from her true strength. With the combination of the Paladin and the big magician, the vertical and horizontal big 6, will be afraid of who? Not to mention, Orfiroc sneer, he has not yet revealed all the strength However, with Orphey's wisdom and force, I can't figure out how to explain the marriage and comfort Elysses in the rage. But the front is even Really hell, he can only bear his head The skin jumped.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofiroc sighed and looked firm and stepped into the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Rogge is leisurely turning around in the city, drinking tea, eating a meal, and going to the 'Knight of War' to take a look, take a nap. By the spirit, he will go out of the 'God of War. Hammer', the horse went slowly to the southwest of the city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black and gorgeous carriage came up from behind, and a trace of dangerous smell came out of the carriage. Rogge instinct's cold hair is straight and vertical, and the driver who is driving under the mental force actually hides the huge amount of energy, which is the yellow-green color that he is very familiar with. The two cars in the carriage are more terrifying and powerful energy. A group of blue is a little bit of starry temperament, and another energy is the magical red magic energy that rolls extremely uncomfortably.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles In front of these three comets, don’t think about escaping well. Under the crowd, you don’t want to come to each other. Killer, right next destination blatantly pain. "What's more," Rogge thinking to myself, "I would do a little buying no value? "Thinking about killing Ericis from the outside world, although it is not so voluntary, she should always say something? But Elysses is still proud of Rogge, how much is the fat heart?" There was a bit of resentment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the carriage was parallel with Rogge, the driver picked up the hat and screamed at Rogge, but in the eyes of the fat man, the handsome face of David Behind it was filled with yellow-green thorns, so that he was as uncomfortable as being stared by a worm. At this time, the curtains opened, and a small face that made the glare of Rogge appear on the window.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is a glimpse, and the beautiful face of Froya has made Rogge upside down. At this moment, it is close to the feet, and even Rogge can't bear it. The bang, the whole world is Rogge blew up in his head, and every piece of debris shone on the little witch!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya looked at Rogge’s desperate look, could not help but Cover your mouth and smile. This smile is dangerous and dangerous, and Rogge laughs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s brain is a nearly naked body that flies in the air, a little doll is doing the same thing. In this respect, Rogge’s instinct is always faster than Reason, his body immediately responded. The three people in the carriage are top figures, and the change of Rogge in the first time, the eyes are concentrated on Rogge **. The fat skin of the fat man is thicker than cowhide, at the moment Under the gaze of six swords like swords, I can't help but be red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is bound to be infinitely useful in the future, it is only the benefit of adding fuel to the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little witch’s face, which is destined to be a miserable year, has a face that is almost equally beautiful, but seemingly boring. Andre looked at Rogge contemptuously and snorted with disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same two peerless faces, Fu Luoya let Rogge not be self, Andre is like a cold water with ice cubes in the same basin, immediately let the fat one The area of ​​severe congestion has returned to normal. When Rogge was awake, he immediately piled up his face and smiled. He said: "Several people are big people. I saw it in a hurry that night, and I can’t wait to say hello, huh, it’s too rude!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre snorted, faintly said: "I was in a hurry that night. My brother has been boasting about it afterwards. We must come to see you carefully. Today At first sight, Lord Rogge really 'uncommon<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge immediately lost his smile: "Andrei is a disciple of Juggernaut, and is the alliance of Roscio Grand Marshal. Why do you want to see the next second-class knight? It’s really a shame that I’m just dying. Princess Flora's glory is the best in the world. Can you control yourself in the next generation of nobles who have never seen a few worlds? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria burst into a smirk and was happy to use Roger's flattery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the guise of the words, the eyes turned and said: "The only good ancestors of Andrea Andre and the unparalleled martial arts of the world are the good match of Princess Furoya. I admire the swordsmanship of Lord Andre in the end. Although I couldn’t understand it that night, I thought about it over the past few days and finally got some experience. I only hope that after ten years of hard work, I can have some of the achievements of Lord Andre today. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre snorted with you, ten years of effort also want to learn the sword skills of this 'blue stars'? That is not the world is Juggernaut "The words are still ironic, but the bitter coldness of the original has disappeared." I have to wait for the phrase "only the nobleness of the blood of Andre, and the martial arts of this kind, is the good match of Princess Furoya." I couldn’t help but feel that my heart was greatly used. . Waiting for a turn to see Fu Luoya's hibiscus-like side, my heart is tender and tender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Andrei deeply felt that this Rogge was interested in knowledge, more insightful, and understood the truth of the beauty with the hero. It seems that David is a brother. Still some look at people's eyes. He couldn't help but squint at Rogge. He felt that his fat face suddenly became a lot more lovely. He felt that the cold words that had just been to him seemed to have gone too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s heart groaned, I felt that I couldn’t help Orphey Rock, and thought to myself: “Ophrod, ah, now I’m worried. You only have to be wronged. Anyway, the Paladin is inevitably big, you are a true hero, I will not fight this white face Andre. Of course, if you really can not compete with him, this hero title, Probably some of the names are not true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge thought about it, this Andre made it clear that he wanted to wear a green hat for Orphee. It’s a trifle to wear a green hat for the paladin. If you are Orphey Roth, you must find a dark night in the dark and secretly kill this Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya stared at Rogge with a smile and looked at it from the top, and from the bottom, he saw that Rogge was not Free, I doubt if I am wearing something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregor, you will be very pity for that night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is short A short sentence immediately made Rogge fall into the ice, and the hands and feet are cold. He almost couldn't help himself, he had to shake his mind and then escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, after Froya said that, there is nothing else to say. Rogge’s mad heart was calm, but from the face of Froya, Rogge couldn’t see it. She already knew that she was the one who provided space for Elysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David raised his whip and smiled: "Well, see you have seen it, let's go first. Rogge, you have to be self-sufficient!" By the way, I have not been in the Legion for a long time, and the military discipline of the Knights of the Wolverines has been scattered. If I meet the evil horses of my subordinates in the future, I will not only be polite. There is also a 'Night Return' hotel in front. It's a bit interesting, don't miss it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David spoke away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Rogge is very interesting. The potential is very good. It seems that I have begun to understand how to use my mental power. But with this, it is not worthwhile for us to run for him once? My dear brother, you have spent so much thought. Is it worth it in his body? Is it because of the reason why you have a bad taste on a woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David sits comfortably in the position of a driver, laughing Answer: "My dear brother, in front of the princess of the honorable Froya, you still have to open two more mouths, lest you vent your old master of the country. Perhaps you should go to the Dro empire under the command of the eldest brother. In the year of the swordsman, you can expand your strategic vision. This Rogge, the wonderful thing is that he is good in strength, there are quite a lot of tricks, and there are still many problems. The greed and greed are despicable, and there are quite a few. He can't move him, and the big master like my dear brother doesn't bother to move him. This is the reason why Mingzhe protects himself in troubled times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre He snorted and refused to answer. There are many sons and daughters of Rochester, and the three most outstanding people are the eldest son Solomon. Now the Dro Empire is the head of the Knights, the third son David, and the younger son Andre. Solomon's army is outstanding, David is longer than politics, and as for the highest martial arts, it is also the most Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre is arrogant, but not arrogant, and he knows very well that since he has been focusing on swordsmanship for more than a decade, there is almost nothing in his life. Speaking of politics and art of war, I am far from the difference between my two brothers. But there is always a vent in a anger, so a crow that does not open his eyes becomes a scapegoat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crows in the tree suddenly panic, a crow is planted on the ground, its body constantly shoots a blue light, slowly connected Blood red eyes turn blue. In a twinkling of an eye, the crow turned into a blue crystal bird. A breeze blew through, and the blue crystal crow turned into countless tiny flying debris, disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the complicated crow and turned his ash into a gray ash. He sighed and drove the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dark room in a city in Lille, a thin, tall figure fell to the ground and spewed a blood. He hated and cursed Andre in a strange language. Although there are no ones, he only dares to whisper. It seems that the voice is a little bigger and will be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just took a few steps to meet a small hotel. The small hotel was very deserted, except that there were two soldiers standing at the door, as if there were no guests inside. The iron signboard kept shaking in the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night returning to the hotel?" Rogge read the signboard in front of the hotel. For a moment, he only felt that this small shop had some unspeakable taste. It was a feeling of deja vu, but the strange thing was that he had never been to this place. In the midst of thinking, the store has been left behind by his sprinting horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait! Why are there soldiers standing at the entrance of the hotel? In the heart of Rogge, there was a sudden uneasiness in his heart. He blinked and looked back. Look at the two soldiers in the attire should be the people of the Knights of the Wolf. The look is not like eating or something else. It is like... What is it? Yes, it is alert! What are they on alert? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly fell into a cold sweat. He couldn't think about it, immediately pulled back and rushed to the small hotel.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not yet at the store, the soldiers of the two Knights of the Wolfs turned their heads to stare at Rogge, and the look was a little nervous. Rogge flew down to the store, but was the two knights. Stopped.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay! who? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog smiled and said: "I want to drink saliva and live in a shop." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two soldiers looked at each other and said coldly: "This hotel is full." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog looked at it inside, as if there were no people inside, how could it be full?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the two soldiers was impatient and impatient, and shouted: "This shop is packed today! You have no long eyes, grandfathers are the people of the Knights of the Wolf! Grandpa is here Do things, let you roll, you roll, and there are so many nonsense! Beware of the uncle's official duties!" Rogge is a casual dress today, but the horse is a valuable purebred horse, so this knight is awkward, I also know that there are some advances and retreats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
