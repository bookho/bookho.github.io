			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍如如梦章七南归上<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章七南归<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road leading to the south has not been opened for dozens of kilometers, but the hard work of more than 100,000 guilty ushered in a rare rest. In order to show goodwill to the Dro empire, the Asrofic Empire stopped the process of building the road, and it was necessary to wait until the ambassadors of the Dro Empire had a result before starting construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this kindness is quite reluctant. The ambitions of the Asrofic Empire have long been known to passers-by, and it is only a matter of more than ten days to cut down dozens of kilometers of forest. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, among the virgin forests that have not been cut down, hundreds of riders are walking all the way to the capital of the Dro Empire, Oshini. Roger wore a common outfit, and he followed the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many fine ridings in the North, that is, the fifty foreign ministers who presided over the negotiations are no exception. Therefore, even if this team is in the forest, the speed of advancement is quite fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stepping out of the forest, guided by the guidance of the Dro Empire, the squadron set foot on the road leading to Drodi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge takes a leisurely look and enjoys the surrounding scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the scenery of the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is only a few hundred kilometers away from the current territory of the Astrofic Empire, the climate is very different. The remnant of the central mountain range blocked the cold current in the north, so when the night wind was cold in the northern country grassland, the Dro Empire was already green and hot. Most of the people in the corps were obviously unable to adapt to the sudden warming of the temperature, and had already lost their clothes. Rogge is still wearing a robes, the temperature is high and low, and he has no influence at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery of the Dro Empire is still quite different from the Bavarian Principality. However, when Rogge saw this southern scene, there would always be a feeling of deja vu. Unconsciously, a township thought rose in the heart of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this feeling is just passing by in the heart of the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this road, Rogge’s most common thing is to stand alone in the wilderness at night, staring at the stars in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the gang was stunned by the night and quietly entered O'Siyah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohini has a population of 500,000. The city has a thick wall and a dark color. It looks solemn, mighty and spectacular. In contrast, the buildings of the more southern countries are much more agile. If the southern countries are like a gentle girl, then the Dro Empire is a majestic young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the southern part of the Dro Empire, hundreds of thousands of troops are fighting to die. At O'Neill's negotiating table, the fierce struggle is no less than the battle on the front line, full of blood and smoke. The two sides have great differences in the conditions of the Astrofic Empire. The Astrafik Empire ambassador insisted that the Dro Empire cede a large territory in the north and then be willing to send troops to participate in the war. The Dro Empire simply wanted to slash a small piece of useless wasteland and pay some gold coins for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge has no interest in diplomatic negotiations, and this aspect is not his specialty. In the eyes of the fat man. The sword is the factor that can determine everything. This kind of diplomacy is just a flower hanging on the edge of the blade, and it may fade at any time. And the contract from the negotiating table is largely nothing more than a piece of paper. The great countries strictly abide by the sincerity of the contract, and I am afraid that at most, the fat man is similar to the devout god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the departure of the Dro Empire, Rogge had studied a great deal of information about the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dro Empire is different from other great empires. She originated in the southern foothills of the Central Mountains. At that time, the land was dotted with dozens of small city states and principalities with common ethnic composition and cultural practices, but the relationship between them was loose. There is still no shortage of war. These small countries have been used by the great powers in the past 100 years. Once wars occur, they either send troops or pay for them, and they are tied to the chariots of other big countries. They can only swallow the bitter fruit when they are defeated, and there is no advantage in defeating it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation lasts for a hundred years. Finally, miracles descended on the Principality of Dro. The Grand Duke of the Principality of Dro has no other skills, but his ability to incite is unparalleled. He lobbied and spoke in one country, one country, one city and one city. The centuries-old history of humiliation in his mouth has been rendered into the darkest period in the history of the human race since the birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it is a year of war. The major powers are naturally reluctant to lose the traditional sphere of influence and have sent troops to intervene. Grand Dro has no talent in the military, so he elected the great Duke of Thomas, the highest commander of the league. Leading coalition forces to fight with the interventional forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year of war. The two sides have won each other and the alliance has more failures. However for freedom. The 20 million people in the Alliance can endure hunger, cold and sacrifice. For freedom, they can bear everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toughest winter has passed, and the major countries around the loss have finally realized that they can’t beat the hearts of the Alliance’s people who are eager for freedom. Retired, acknowledging the independence of the alliance. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the fruit of victory, Droan, who had been very low-key throughout the war of the whole year, revived as the father of the Alliance. He never commanded the army, which may be a disadvantage in wartime, but at this time it became a kind of capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he never failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the outstanding generals, in the year of the downwind of the war, there will inevitably be a few defeats. These stains became the best excuse for Dro and the political opponents to blame them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people still remember Drog, who was the first to encourage them to rise up, and they were dazzled by the dazzling aura of the big man. Da Luo also publicly declared that he was all for the people, and did not seek the position of the head of the alliance. As a result, his reputation was no longer there. The masters of the cities and the great men who made great contributions in the war began a desperate battle for the great position of the Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political struggle quickly developed into a bloody phase, in just a few days. Four city owners and Dagong were assassinated. At the beginning, Dro’s grand lord pushed the Grand Duke of Thomas, and when he returned home, he was killed by a mysterious killer in the night, and the elite guards of Baiqi did not survive forever! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly face of politicians is quickly known to the public. The major factions in the league are not consistent, and finally they have to compromise each other. The result will always be super-external and special. The Dro Grand Duke pushed the throne of the Alliance Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dero’s Grand Duke’s war was nothing, but it was a rare conspiracy in politics. He spent a full twenty years. Through all kinds of means, the main opponents were pulled down one by one, so that the Principality of Dro became gradually big in the league. He also brought together many small Principalities through his own marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years later. The Grand Duke of Dingdi has finally completed all the arrangements, officially announced the emperor, and created the Dro Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the Dro Empire determines its unique reality. In the empire, dozens of affiliated principalities and city-states, large and small, occupy half of the empire. All localities are not only holding the power to appoint officials, but also to collect taxes. Many of the Grand Dukes also have heavy troops. These Principalities were the product of the compromise of Dro’s Grand Duke in order to establish an empire. Therefore, among the three great empires, Dro’s emperor’s chamber is actually the weakest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of the characteristics of each of the Dro empire's squadrons. The Bavarian army will be so smooth. It was difficult for the main army of the Dro Empire to mobilize the troops of the squadrons. They could only helplessly chase behind the agile Bavarian army and watched many fighters slip away from their side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge settled in O'Hisnia, he had an initial understanding of all aspects of the Dro Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, Rogge went out of the place where the mission was staying and began to visit the Emperor O'Siniya. Where Roger went, it always caused passers-by to stare. This is not because the fat man is handsome and unparalleled, but because he is followed by a charming little fairy. Froya only wore a very common mage robes. In this public occasion, she is also accustomed to dressing up with Wen Liang Xian Shu, but this can not slightly reduce the fatal temptation of her beautiful face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya followed Rogge, his face kept a slight smile, and whispered with Rogge. Her every move, there is a spring wind. Quietly entered the bone marrow. When I wake up, it is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is so low that only Rogge can hear it, but her content does not match her clear and flawless appearance:" Dead fat man, you are very cold these days! I decided to derail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I leave you alone? Every time I go to find you, you are not doing magic experiments, you are meditating! Right. Miro's strengths are not magic. If you need magic guidance, why not let Aide Renee helps you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like her." Froya refused to be crisp and neat. Then he said: "Yes, I heard that you have another child. If you haven't left me, why aren't you a child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For For this question of Froya, Rogge couldn't answer. He had to be vague: "You know, I have never been cold in this regard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This little goblin smiled and said: "Okay, that seems to be a problem with one of our two people. I don't know if you are still me. This is good. In order to prove that it is not my problem, I am going to find someone. Let's try it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria saw that he was almost on the verge of breaking out, and immediately closed his mouth. Suddenly lost the reason and can not be angry, this can not help but let Rogge more depressed. But as soon as he saw the appearance of the little goblin snicker, all his anger could not help but fly to the 10,000 meters cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked on the busy street, and Froya finally couldn’t help but say: "What good and dirty city is this dirty and chaotic?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the state of war, Oshnia, who was also famous for its architecture, has long since disappeared. The broad avenues appear to be quite depressed on both sides. Many Shangshang have been closed down. The roads meet people and talk about wars. There are three or five groups of wounded soldiers everywhere in the city, and people have to face the cruelty of war. Occasionally, there will be a small team of iron rides passing by on the boulevard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Oshnia does not say that compared with the famous cities in the south, it is far from the famous northern cities of Richelieu and Tiffany. Not too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue looked at this filthy city. Smiled: "There are so many things to see here. The world is wonderful. You can see and hear even thousands of miles away when you stand in any place. So we may wish to walk in Oshiniado. I have not been with you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya pouted slightly, reluctantly said: "This will accompany me. Is it better to practice meditation in this time? Do you want to see any military secrets from the details of the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗Ge smiled and said: "Now the military affairs of the military have someone else to worry about, do not need me to manage. Forget it. Wait until your plane meditation practice to a certain extent, I will explain it to you. Now tell you. I'm afraid you don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria snorted and said, "If you don't say it, you don't even say it. It's still a big magician's shelf. It seems that just a few years ago, there was a man who could only hold the skin thick enough to harden my magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; Every time I think of the high, the princess who is always out of reach, has now been shackled by myself, and the sense of accomplishment in an instant will make Rogge swell out in every pore. Even if he is already in the position of the first religious pope in the North, some bad habits on the fat man have not been able to be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted to laugh a few times, and suddenly there was a thunderous hoof from the end of Long Street. Then dozens of royal banned iron riders wearing black armor appeared from the corner of Long Street and quickly rushed to the Imperial Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogra with Fu Luoya, standing on the street, let these dozens of iron rides as the wind rushed from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rider in the team suddenly snorted and pulled the reins hard. The horse suddenly stood up and took a few steps and turned to Fu Luoya and Rogge. The dozens of riders of the Royal Guard also showed their superb riding skills and turned around. Come with the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge frowned, looking up and down the knight who was obviously coming to both of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier looks very young, with a dark edge on the edge of the armor with gold rims and a four-winged dragon representing the Drodi room on the chest. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight grabbed the horse in front of the two, raised his hand and picked up the helmet, revealing a pretty handsome face. His pair of hot eyes just stared at Froya. After a while, I couldn't believe it: "You are... Princess Flora? How come you are in Osinia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers opened their arms and wanted to hold Furoa in his arms. However, at this time, suddenly there was a smiling fat face in front of him, replacing the beautiful and unparalleled face of Fu Luoya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers are in a state of turmoil. This scare is no different. He screamed. After a few steps back, I almost sat on the ground. The royal guards met. Immediately, two people jumped out of the horse and lifted the knight. The rest of them pulled out their swords and pointed to the two men on the field. More handcuffs are aimed at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned a blind eye to the blade of Sensen, smiling at the knight: "Hello, I think you made a mistake. Froya is now It’s no longer a princess, she’s just my woman. I’m sorry, I’m not very generous, I don’t want to make people hug me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the back of Rogge, there was a smile on the corner of Froja, and she quietly reached out and grabbed Rogge’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers listened, first glimpse, then they saw the intimate look of the two, their faces were already mad, and said: "Bold things, you know me." Who is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hello?” Rogge’s smile never changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Froya whispered behind the fat man: "He seems to be the three emperors of the Dro Empire, called...called..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight’s ear was good, and he heard that Furoa recognized himself. At that time, she was overjoyed, and she couldn’t remember her name. She said: “ My name is Rather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather stared at Froya for a long time, and turned to look at Rogge, his face immediately gloomy. Drinking and asking: "What are you, even dare to kidnap the princess of Froya? Come to me, tie me up, bring it back and interrogate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The threat to Rather, Rogge did not hear. Just looking back to Fu Luoya asked: "Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria frowned: "I used to see him in Rhineland, then The Dro Empire’s assistance to the Father’s land was more than me...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded and said, “It’s so.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward and looked at Rather calmly. The smile on his face didn’t know when it had disappeared: "His Royal Highness, it seems that the role you played that year was not glorious!" The brilliance of the Dro Empire is faint by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather's face is gloomy, just handcuffing forward everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black armor has been rushing forward. Surrounded by Rogge and Flora, the sword has been lifted! They are well trained. Everyone is cautious, for fear of hurting Furoya, who is standing still and unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge held his hand in the same place, glanced back at the black armor, and smiled coldly: "All down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s voice is not big, and it seems that there is absolutely no intention to do it. The black armor escort had raised the alert, and nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is at this time. They squatted dozens of horses suddenly collapsed together! Unprepared, even these elite black armor guards fell to the ground. There was a black armor who missed the hand and inserted the sword into the ground to ride the ground. The result turned out to be like a big leather bag. In a flash, it was sprayed with a thick, black, stinky liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wiped off the mucus on his face, stood up and looked at the ground, and took a breath! The war horse, which was still very strong, was now flat on the ground like a pocket that emptied the liquid! He looked around again. It was only then that the guards were staring at a horse that had fallen into the ground and had no shape. They were pale, and the hand holding the sword was shaking, and they could not help but retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Rogge’s face is unclear whether it belongs to the devil or the angel’s smile. He looks at the fallen horse and looks at the black armor that has fallen back. Guard. Lasser smiled at the white paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather went back a few steps, but he was still less than tenth, and he actually stood firm, but some of them were unexpected. It seems that the three emperors are a bit gutsy and have not been intimidated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
