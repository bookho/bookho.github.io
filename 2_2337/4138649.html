			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunset mottled in the woodsEven the midday summer noon, there are few after the unusually lush foliageIn the magical forest, even the edge is always cold and wet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty knights silently walk through the forest, most of them dressed in fine half-length knights, hand-held snow axe guns, about half The knight is still hanging a longbowThis team of knights is Roger’s "Dragon and Beauty" mercenary group.At the time of the departure from the thieves (or mercenaries) in Claysburg, some military experience Kate led the team into the Devil ForestAfter a painful march in the forest, the mercenaries were already out of reach.It was very smooth along the way, and I didn’t encounter any fierce Warcraft. After all, the mercenaries were only acting on the edge of the forest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creeksburg is surrounded by mountains, but mostly low hillsDue to the remote location, the lack of property, coupled with the intentional indulgence of Orphey, no one has been questioned for half a year after the occupation of Silesburg.Just suffering from the flat people in the surrounding areasBut these are outdated intelligence, and Rogge and others eventually have to rely on the map provided by Orpheek for this reconnaissance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, the mercenaries estimated that they had been close to the patrol range of the other cavalry scouts from less than 7 in Clersburg.Kate ordered, the mercenaries opened the distance and slowly moved forward in a scattered formation.The four old mercenaries jumped off and quickly searched forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cavalry wearing a black half-length knight in the middle of the team is RoggeThis is not a fat man in the hands of the wizard, but also a short-handed axe.The Tomahawk inherits the gorgeous style of the "God of the God of War". The lines are beautiful and even make people feel beautiful. The inscription on the back of the axe is engraved with magical inscriptions. The axe handle is embedded with a rare black crystal.After seeing Rogge’s appearance for the first time, Franco, whose mouth is vicious, said: "I think the Tomahawk Master is not funny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Masters are buried in the magical code for many years, and are exposed to all kinds of harmful substances (for humans, how much is the majority of Warcraft?) A little poisonous), physical strength is not so good, wearing heavy armor is definitely a big burdenMoreover, the metal has been confirmed to have a great hindrance to the magic of the gathering. Even if a magician is standing still and wearing a body armor, the probability of magic failure will also pass through the battle. This is a life-and-death.For Rogge, neither of these is a problem.His mental strength is too big, and it is really easy to control that poor magic.And I don't know if it is the reason that the body has been transformed. Rogge's mental power is very small in the magic of crossing the metal gathering. With his magic point of only three levels of magic, he is sealed with a metal ball. Still can release magic<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogg is often in a state of sorrow since entering the Devil’s ForestIn his eyes, everything around him often turns into a flat picture, and all kinds of strange screams always ring in his ears.Rogge looked around, as if standing in front of a huge landscape painting, he tried several times to use the tomahawk to smash this layer of paper to see what was behind it.He seems to see Kate coming over and talking to him loudly, and he is like a fish in the water, only seeing people on the water moving, but can't hear what to say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge shook his head hard, as if breaking a mirror, the plane world was brokenSound, color is back to the world"Rogge!! What happened to you??" Kate shook him hard."I'm fine, what happened?" Rogge felt as tired as he had just smashed ten sluts.Kate stared at him for a while and said: "We are now on the patrol of the other patrol. I think we better ambush here, grab a few people to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate's current patrol is only 10 miles away from the outer edge of the forest. There is a clear horseshoe print, old and new, in terms of quantity, it is a 7 , a team of about 8 peopleThese traces indicate that teams of the same size often pass through this path, and perhaps this forest road is the patrol team’s stepping out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is getting late, the mercenaries have rested in the forest after setting up the trap.In the early morning, Kate arranged a new scout to look around the forest, and the rest continued to rest.The people with extremely limited military knowledge don’t really know how to ambush. Some of the mercenaries hired are still familiar with this. Some arrangements are also very good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, Rogge and others discussed it overnight and felt that the patrols might not be so simple, otherwise the two good players would not be missing.However, in addition to strengthening prevention, there is no result in the discussion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a rest, Rogge’s energy was restored.He stroked a green ring in his hand and sang a start spell softly. A small, unremarkable ball of light slowly formed and gradually rose to the sky.Rogge gave a little spiritual strength to enter the ball of light, and it seemed to open another field of vision. As the ball of light slowly rose, it stabilized in the air of about ten meters.The magic of this wizard's eye is not very high-order, and it lasts for a long time. It is a convenient reconnaissance magic.But the shortcomings are equally prominent, and the magician needs constant attention, so the magicians will not be able to maintain this magic during the battle.Another disadvantage is that this magical fluctuation is easily detected by another mage, often exposing the position of the magician.And this is often a deadly threat to the magician.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six reconnaissance cavalry slowly followed the path. The cavalry are dressed in leather, wearing a knight sword, carelessly patrolling, talking and laughing, it seems that it has not happened for many days. The position of the patrol's leather chest was originally painted as a sign, but it has now been scraped. Rogge in the tree suddenly felt a guilty heart, as if a poisonous snake had been staring at himself in the dark. The fat man immediately took back the eyes of the wizard and turned his eyes to full force to perceive the magical fluctuations around him. The mentally savvy fat man immediately felt that the mercenaries had a faint source of magic outside the two sides. From the eyes of the wizard who had never seen him, the magician gave himself an invisible, at least a mid-level master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge can't do anything, mental perception can only find out the general direction of the other side, and the real eye that can be solved invisible is four levels of magic, you can now put it come out. But there will always be a way, the fat man thinks about it, the smile of the yin, and the distance that the mage is here, there is a little distance. He quickly negotiated with his nearest Ette, and disappeared into the forest with the unique agility of Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol knights are slowly digesting breakfast, but the scenery of this forest is really not very good. They are not too worried about their own safety, after all, a mid-level wizard is secretly protecting them. The thick-lined cavalry did not consider the problem in the direction of the bait. A few people talked about the young villager who met the last month's patrol, from white skin, a slightly thick but powerful waist, a screaming scream, and a wonderful struggle, especially the twist of the waist. The sound of ** is getting louder and louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death always comes at the most unexpected time. Deep in the depths of the trees, such as the arrow, twenty short bows, three machine squats all aimed at the three cavalry in front. These patrol cavalry were quite handy, and they quickly called the arrow, and they actually blocked a small part of it. But the three people in front of the three are still in the middle of a few arrows, falling Malay. The three cavalrymen who did not have an arrow responded to God and quickly rushed into the woods, giving the mercenaries a second chance to put their arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries dropped their bows and arrows and pulled out their swords to start a melee fight. The martial arts of the patrol knights are good, especially a knight with a giant sword. He manipulated the horses to bypass the two big trees and rushed to the middle of the three mercenaries who had just pulled out the sword. The giant sword picked up, swept a mercenary, and then slammed into the second mercenary. . The mercenary raised a sword and was swayed with a long sword. He suddenly flew away, his left arm raised, and he guarded his heart with the Knight Steel Shield on his arm. The sword's tip and the steel shield of the Great Sword make a spark, giving a soothing and sharp voice. The curved shield forced the tip of the sword to slide to one side. The mercenary was rushed to the ground with a huge impulse, and a light and fragile fracture sounded on his arm. Immediately, the great sword knight snorted, his wrists were shaking, and the giant sword sank down. He stabbed a large visible bone on the thigh without mercenary protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third mercenary turned around and hid behind the tree, the Great Sword Knight’s eyes swept away, and now his armor is much more gorgeous, and immediately put down the wounded two The mercenary, the horse chased the past. The mercenary was Rens. At this moment, his life was over, and he was covered with agility. He was not afraid of the thief's agility. He walked around in the tree, and the knight behind could not catch up with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two patrol cavalry may have no luck and skill. A positive horse chased a mercenary, and suddenly two two axe guns came over the top of the tree. He was shocked in his heart. He was in a hurry and was on the horse’s belly. The horse was going out for more than three meters. Robbery. However, another axe gun came silently from behind, and easily opened the leather armor, almost all of him. Kate gently jumped out of the tree, and had no time to look at the body. He quickly took the axe and covered it with the sound of the fighting. Another patrol cavalry was surrounded by five mercenaries led by Etter. The tiger couldn't stand the wolves, and soon he was sneaked into a thigh by a mercenary, and then he was cut down by a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sword Knight followed the two circles of Rens, and the two screams from far away made him change his mind, dialed his head and prepared to escape. His horse suddenly stood up, and a horse was inserted into the horse's buttocks, and the knight was taken down. He was in danger, and a roll up stood up. Now Kate is holding the blood-stained axe gun in front. The rear Etty focused sword also appeared. Franco, who was armed with a hand-held machine, also ran out of Rens, who was still struggling to escape. The knight’s palms sweated and he cursed: “Where did that damn mage go?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s situation is not good. After the existing person used the eye of the wizard, he applied invisibility and quickly and carefully approached the battlefield. At this time, the fighting sounds in the distance. Fortunately, he was 30 meters away and a knight with a strong armor was ambushing in the woods, watching the body dressed like a commander. The magician secretly satisfied his luck, hitting a lightning bolt and hitting the target. Watching the knight fall over with a small electric spark, the sculpt of the sculpt of the body has gone. He is very convinced of the power of his spells, not to mention the second lightning magic reserve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
