			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers are still flowers, trees or trees, and the colors of the world are not different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rogue that wakes up is like a fish in a pool of water, looking out, the whole world seems to be shaking gently in the waves. This flower, this tree, this color, is like a painting, a flat painting. There is something behind the painting. Rogge tried hard to see the past, and even involuntarily wanted to throw it out. However, like the fish in the crystal fish tank, he bounced back in front of this picture every time. When Xia went to the autumn, Rogge recovered. It is exactly that he has restored all the bad habits of the past. In the morning, he no longer checks whether his hand has become a hand bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge can clearly feel the existence of the origin of God, the silver eyes, the lines of the knife, the ripples of the white robe, just like a dream The fragments occasionally flash in the brain. So Roger’s heart was like a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer's dislike of the angel's instinct did not dilute Rogge's erotic heart, but was gradually overwhelmed by the latter. The paranoia that many nobles have is particularly evident in Rogge. But the way most aristocrats are paranoid is to believe that they are nobler than civilians and superior in all places, and Rogge's idea is much simpler, using God's origin to recreate a light angel as his pet. Rogge never looked so strong as he was, and the angel of light was so unforgettable. What the gods on that day should look like. The pet is a spirit of the level 7 magician, the necromancer chooses to leave the fusion of magical knowledge, and the purity of the origin of God, when his magic reaches the level of the third-level Master, may be able to call Make your own pet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face is a nine-level mage, and the Magic Lab is a quiet, two-story building in the depths of the college. Originally, with the strength of Faith, there is no such treatment in the second grade, but because Faith is also a very accomplished goldsmith, this is more important than his magical strength. Because high-grade magic items are everyone's favorite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Rogge’s appearance is unpleasant, and Fiss chose Rogge as an apprentice, on the one hand because his ass is really good. On the other hand, Rogge has withstood the test in front of many valuable gems. Rogge is by no means a gentleman who does not pick up the road. He just understands that "in order to make a big profit, the small profits must be abandoned." There is also a reason for Faith's deep consciousness, that is, he is a civilian, and he absolutely enjoys the life of a nobleman. After several times of searching for flowers, Fes and Rogge’s friendship was deep and they found many common languages. However, in any case, it was quite happy to see Rogge, who was suddenly mad and delved into the magical array and the hard-working magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, what are the symbols of these twists and turns in the magic array?" "Like the spell you have learned, these symbols are for the purpose of gathering space. Painted with magical energy. The spells used to draw different magical materials have different functions. The function of a magic array is determined by the size, type and order of the energy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many combinations of magical arrays?" "That is, of course, there are hundreds of recorded magic materials, and there are dozens of magical energies of various pure attributes." Of course, it includes all kinds of divine power. Coupled with the control of energy size, flow direction, time spell, the number of combinations is endless. The existing magic array is summed up by the predecessors on the basis of numerous failures. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If a magical array is wrong and started again, what will happen?" Just after asking Rogge, he said that he was a fool, from time to time. Did the explosion in the Fiss lab not explain the problem?However, Rogge's luck is really good. As a goldsmith, Faith's mana is not very good, but the knowledge of the magic array is really proficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three-quarters of the students at the Rhine School of Magic are nobles, and the lower aristocrats like Rogge are often blinded. Aristocratic students are mostly inferior to civilians, but they are both primary mages, and the gap between magical equipment is enough to enable them to fight civilian students. Due to the financial gap between the students of the civilian population, they had to use the method of persuasion to improve their magic. The original Rogge had no financial resources to buy magical equipment, nor was he willing to be as hard as a civilian. Therefore, the strength is average, that is, occasionally oppressing civilians, but also the grass-roots people outside the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is getting colder as the day goes by. The people who once knew Rogge were almost different from his changes. The chunky and shameless guy is not buried in the library's pile of paper every day, just in the room to meditate. With the slow increase of magic, finally on the day when a snow flutters, Rogge's magic reaches the level of a three-level magician. In these days, Rogge also had an accident. After being thoroughly reformed, the body has explosive power and agility that does not lose to the beast. "It's better to say that it is a Warcraft than you are an individual," said the Necromancer. At the beginning of the soul fusion, Rogge can talk to the Necromancer in consciousness. By now, the souls of the two people have become completely integrated, and it is impossible to tell who is who. But obviously, this argument can only come from the Necromancer who knows the human body and the body structure of Warcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
