			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon Claire Ferrena’s sleep these days has not been good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last sleep, a small bug dared to sneak in its sacred territory. The ability of this little bug is OK, if it is not disturbing your own baby, maybe you really can't show it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena’s whole heart is now on her baby, the silvery baby is so beautiful! The curve of the eggshell is so soft! She believes that after the baby is born, it must be a beautiful silver dragon! Listening to the baby's faint heartbeat, it has become the happiest thing for Cris Ferrena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not have any treasure in her territory. For her, her baby is all her wealth. She has no time or interest to look at the treasure. So the little bug could not find any jewelry in her territory. She is a very elegant silver dragon, not as greedy as ordinary dragons. At that time, her beauty, her holiness and her power even fascinated the genius recognized in the silver dragon, the Nicholas known as the 'silver miracle'! The dragon egg under her body is the crystallization of their love. Only the geniuses in the two silver dragons were too proud. After a big fight, Kris Felena flew away in anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the flight, she felt a huge evil force coming through. The silver dragon's destruction of the dark nature made her turn around and go all out, but the evil power flew away in the blink of an eye, making her feel very puzzled. But then she felt a very weak source of evil that made her instinctively feel chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most primitive evil, the simplest of darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately decided to settle down and carefully search for this source of evil. But this evil has only loomed once since then, and there is no news anymore. This evil appeared so short and too vague that she could not find exactly where it appeared, only knowing that it was within a radius of 500 kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long life gives the dragons some unparalleled patience. She has made a good idea to live in this mountain area for a hundred years, to give birth to the baby in the belly, and raise and grow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her life was quiet and detailed until a small bug visited her home for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena originally wanted to ignore it and continue to sleep, but the little bug dared to touch her bedroom, its breath made silver The heartbeat of the dragon egg has also accelerated. This awakened Cris Ferrena and completely angered her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver flame of the holy dragon is filled with her huge bedroom, but to her surprise, this bug is extremely flexible, even in the thousand uniform Escaped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena sneered, chasing it down, finally catching up with the little long straight channel on the dragon ** import insect! The bug is fast, and it’s not too fast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena was satisfied with the small bug being hit by the dragon, flying out of the dragon and falling down the snow peak. She always figured out a bad smell, although at the end she didn't see what the little bug looked like, but it didn't matter. Under her holy silver flame, everything will become unrecognizable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time the sleep is still not good. I don't know why, there is always some faint anxiety in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint vocal voice coming from the door of the bedroom! The silver dragon suddenly woke up from the slumber, and the huge faucet turned to the hole in the bedroom. She was sleepy, her eyes still didn't open, just sniffed a few times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inhalation of the nostrils makes her feel very comfortable, this is a sacred atmosphere mixed with the taste of a pure virgin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena put her heart down, and her sleepyness hit her heart again. She lazily snarled: "Which is outside?" The elf, dare to disturb my sleep? Is it to show your respect to me? Come back in a few days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl is young outside the bedroom The voice, they expressed their apologies in horror and respectfully, and said they wanted to leave immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena opened her eyes, and she immediately heard the sound of the singer's spell screaming outside the bedroom. With the curse, the magic wave was raging, and the waves were higher than the waves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her angry roar, an agile figure flashed in the doorway of the bedroom, and a huge iron box caught her with a strong wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stench of a middle-aged man who wants to vomit is scattered in the bedroom of Kris Felena. The evil, darkness, and horror in the stench made her baby extremely uneasy, her heartbeat suddenly accelerated, and even a scream in the eggshell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon is irritated! She snarled, and the long dragons shook the whole hole and they were shaking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic array around the iron box lights up, dozens of bundled chains break, the iron box bursts, and the black mist melts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil and stench suddenly became strong, and there was a strange, painful, angry, and unwilling roar in the dark fog! An extremely ugly huge meatball floated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrible giant mouth in the center of the meatball, hundreds of sharp teeth can not help but squirm, rubbing each other, making a sour voice, The stinking yellow mucus couldn’t keep coming from the cracks in the teeth and drip down. Above the giant mouth is a huge, bloodshot horror eye. There are more than ten tentacles around the meat ball dancing. The black fog soon dissipated, and its entire body finally showed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon Claire Ferrena can hardly believe her eyes! This is one of the most horrible abyss creatures, a magical eye tyrant who is naturally capable of manipulating magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not afraid of the tyrant of the eye, not to mention only one, that is, no more than a few are not in her eyes. It’s just that there is definitely no place for abyss creatures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves outside the silver dragon bedroom can hardly believe their eyes, and they are imprisoned in a mysterious iron box escorted all the way! Even Hughes looked at Rogge with a gloomy look. Rogge didn't realize it at all. He stared at the movement of the silver dragon tightly, and kept ordering: "The Elf girl immediately quits the dragon! The magician assistant prepares the second wave of magic! The soldiers protect the magician! Wait for me. The order was immediately executed according to the original plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tyrant’s giant eyes stared at the beautiful and turbulent silver dragon egg, almost protruding Now! The innate nature of the gram makes him instinctively feel the delicious taste of the silver dragon egg! The hunger almost made it faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong also felt the intent of the magic eye tyrant, the fury made its dragon like the rough sea, this Longwei even affected the elves outside the bedroom. Only in the first wave of magic, the elves have already blessed the spirit guard in advance, and their resistance to Longwei has been greatly enhanced. The magic eye tyrant naturally has a fear enchantment, and the resistance to the spirit class is also extremely strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the dragon flame of Haotian is not so good! The sacred atmosphere of the sky makes Rogge also a dizzy. But there were seven silver magic shields around his body, blocking all the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic eye tyrant was burned by the silver dragon flame, screaming in pain, and the giant eyes were red, if you want to drip. The ice cold magic shock wave that flashed the cold light could not be released from the giant eyes and hit the silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena also screamed in pain, and dozens of huge scales were smashed by magical shock waves, and the flesh was blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rushed forward, swept the giant tail, and smashed the magic eye tyrant! Its huge meat ball slammed into the opposite side of the mountain wall and almost hit a piece of meatloaf! Yin Long’s hatred has not disappeared. Her eyes are closed, and the holy breath is almost endlessly spurting, burning the eyes of the magic eye tyrant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a sigh of relief, Cris Ferrena stopped to breathe. The opposite side of the mountain wall has been burnt into her half-meter by her hot dragon flame. The tyrant of the magic eye has long been invisible, and the only trace left in the world is a shadow on the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena felt that she had a bit of a bad breath. There was a huge pain in the wound. She looked down at the huge faucet. A dozen wounds had begun to rot black, and the outflow was no longer blood, but the blue and blue stinking pus. After all, the Magic Eye Tyrant is a horror creature from the abyss of the earth. Its attack power is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong raised his head alertly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four four-meter-high soil elements rushed into the silver dragon's bedroom. They shine with a touch of magical brilliance, and the silver dragon familiar with magic immediately sees that these tall earth elements are blessed with adder and blessing! Now these two eyes are shining with dark red light and the earth element has become a horrible war machine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena sneered a bit, she was sure that there must be a lot of magicians hiding outside her bedroom. She snarled, letting the two soil elements in front, bowed and slammed into the back two earth elements. Her momentum was so great that she actually smashed a soil element! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Dragon rushed to the door of the bedroom, couldn’t help but take a breath, the outside hall was so dense that I didn’t know how many elves, the magic light did not Live flashing, it’s just that the magician looks more than twenty! Dozens of elf warriors are connected by giant shields to form a thick line of defense in front of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath and prepared to use her dragon flame to give these intruders a deep lesson, and suddenly the footsteps of the earth elements sounded again. She screamed badly, hurriedly squirted a dragon flame, and looked back, seeing two earth elements rushing toward the silver-colored dragon eggs, their thick arms have been lifted high, and are preparing to kneel down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong wind blows up in the bedroom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eager silver dragon flew up in a small space, her head slammed into the roof, and a beautiful silver horn was broken. But her two front claws grabbed a soil element and pressed them firmly to the side of the dragon egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's cold command can't reverberate in the ear of each elf: "Summon the earth element! Control the earth element, bless the magic! The earth element of Bonus The target dragon egg, the rest of the magician earth element target silver dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four huge earth elements are once again summoned by four senior elf magicians, on the side The two auxiliary low-level elf magic apprentices added the addition and blessing techniques to the earth elements! There was a soil element that suddenly screamed in the sky, and the magician who summoned it was soft on both legs and sat on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This earth element is out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni rushed up with a beautiful blue flame tail, and the blue sky was swept away, and the earth element was immediately wrapped in blue ice crystals. Do not move. The warrior with more than ten months of dark face armed with a long gun, pierced the body of the earth element from all aspects! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth elements are not willing to struggle a few times, scattered on the ground, turned into a pile of residual soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong just shredded all the earth elements, the heavy footsteps sounded again, and four new earth elements rushed in again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Master who can summon the earth elements has eight people, each with two low-level magic apprentices. Each summons four earth elements, the magician goes down for a while, and the other four masters continue to summon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria is screaming a very long spell at the door of the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver Dragon has shredded the third batch of earth elements! She is very angry. These earth elements are huge, powerful, and heavy, and they can't stand it. The soil elements that have been added to the additions are quick and difficult to deal with. She has to be distracted to take care of the dragon eggs behind her, sometimes having to make a few hard notes. The earth element is too big, and her giant claws or dragon tails are not necessarily able to knock them down. It is a luxury to want to take a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the third batch of earth elements fell, the bedroom was surprisingly quiet. Cris Ferrena was also able to breathe a little, killing twelve earth elements, and even she felt a little tired, and the wounds on her body hurt together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall white bone door grows slowly! Froya's magic is complete! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall hell of the demon is stepping out of the door of the bones, the green eyes are fixed on the silver dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong was irritated again, she snarled, and the lightning rushed up, only to throw the hell into the hell, and then the overwhelming dragon The interest burned the hell from the very close, and in a blink of an eye, the hell demon became a blue smoke in the horn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge's face is frosty: "The earth element continues to be prepared!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly killing the hell, the silver dragon also feels a dizzy in the brain, in front of The scenery is also a blur. When the heavy footsteps sounded again, she couldn't help but chill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong slowly returned to the dragon egg, staring angrily at the four earth elements that rushed over. The proud Kris Felena is determined to fight the invaders to the end! With her knowledge of elves and human magicians, the average level of such a large number of magicians is certainly not too high. If there are ten levels, it is not easy. In terms of their magical powers, the three or four earthen elements will come to an end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you have finished the magic, I can't afford to hurt, I bow to Nicholas's bastard, I will kill you! Nicholas, you are a bastard. !! If you are willing to let me know, our baby is so dangerous!" She thought angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three dials of 12 earth elements and the hell of the two Furo summons, Kris Felena feels like A century is as long. She gasped heavily, and there were dozens of large and small wounds on the body. There were dozens of huge silver dragon scales scattered on the ground. The pale blond blood is not dripping, but is pouring from the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryss Felena’s calculations are error-free, and most of the Elf Magicians do not have magic. However, there is still a Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge doesn't have much magic, but he has money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sullenly, waved his hand and issued the last order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several warriors dragged out three boxes and opened them one by one, which is a magical scroll of the whole box! There is also a bundle of magic wands in a box! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Warrior is well trained and everything is in order. They handed over the magic scroll of the summoned earth element to the elf magician, and handed the magic scroll of the magic to the magic apprentice. The other eight magic apprentices each received a magic wand that would give ten blessings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected by Kris Felena, the sullen footsteps echoed again throughout the dragon! This time, she finally felt a trace of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give himself a high-level invisibility technique, and Rogge, who has been standing at the door of the bedroom, smirked and said: "There are twenty earth elements, etc. You are here! 200,000 gold coins for a silver dragon, hey, value!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same invisible technique, standing on the side of Rogge The look of the battle is complicated. Originally, Rogge asked her to summon the earth elements like other elf magicians, but she conceded her to use three levels of six-level magical bones to summon three hells. However, the result of the battle is that the damage caused by a hell demon to the silver dragon is not as good as a magical earth element! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Dragon magic resistance is extremely strong, and the attacking magic exerted by Froya's magic can only cause slight damage to her. When she saw the silver dragon at first sight, she decided to use the summoning magic, but the physical defense of the silver dragon was also strong, and the sharp claws of the hell were too bad for the solid scales of the silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a powerless, deadly earthen element of the dead after the magic is the nemesis of the silver dragon and a solid dragon scale! Of course, the horrible steel smashing effect is better, but only the big magician can summon the steel shovel, and what kind of earth element is economical? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, Flora feels that this Rogge is really different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena could barely stand, she couldn’t remember how many earth elements she had killed, but the sullen footsteps continued to ring. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is finally desperate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incomparably noble silver dragon, the genius of the dragon and the unparalleled beauty of Christine Ferrena, are they going to be killed by the despicable enemy with earth elements? ? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggled to stand up and restore the most majestic and elegant manners, Longwei is like a sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena screamed at the long dragon, and Roger was dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris Ferrena turned her head and looked at the dragon egg with a fascinating look. Then, her huge head struggled and rose, almost touching the top of the bedroom with a height of 20 meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad, desperate, unwilling dragon language can’t stop roaring in the dragon **: "Nicholas! You bastard! Remember to avenge us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three silver lights flew out from the back of the silver dragon, and in a twinkling of an eye, they crossed the thick mountain wall and flew to the north! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the Yinlong Snow Peak, there was a black gas flashing in the air, and the three silver lights disappeared immediately. But there is still a silver light that has escaped and disappeared in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windmill-like death slashing knife slowly stopped, and the enchanting armor’s *** quietly looked at the sickle blade, two The silvery dragon head shining with beautiful luster is stopping on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s beautiful..." Gregory, who was quietly floating behind him, also looked at the two dragon horns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was a noble dragon, I heard about the beauty of Silver Dragon Clariana. Nicholas is the Silver Dragon. Fighting genius, I did not expect that the two of them were together, and there are descendants." Gregory's tone was a bit sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect that Claire Ferrena would appear here! It seems that the genius silver dragon will die in the hands of the master's master. Still dying under such a despicable means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** faintly authentic: "Not so simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, they really want to kill Claire Ferrena? Nicholas is not a good guy! It was already in the world of dragons just a few hundred years ago. Small and medium-sized is famous! If you really want to kill his wife, the child’s end will not look too good, but the consequences are very serious. Does the owner’s owner not know? Silver Dragon’s companions have a soul connection. Whoever finally killed Kris Felena will surely be touched by Nicholas. Hey, is he trying to eat two silver dragons? It’s so great!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The huge dragon can't stop coming from the dragon **, unlike before, this time it also carries the screams of countless elves before death. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory is a little nervous, and *** seems to have shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly unplugged a leaf of a demon lotus. The dark black leaves are getting brighter and brighter, and suddenly a faint flame is burning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! You can't..." Gregory screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-foot-long demon lotus leaves with a faint flame tail, and there is no snow peak between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cris Ferrena is almost out of the bedroom! More than a dozen summoned creatures were smashed through her huge body of twenty meters long, and they returned to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the shield of the dark-faced warrior for dozens of months, she shouted and slammed it up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle pierced deeply into the body of Yinlong, and couldn’t bear the tremendous momentum in the blink of an eye, and it was broken, and it was a scream. The 30-month-old warrior disappeared under the huge body of the silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now facing the huge faucet that is nearly three meters long, there are more than twenty elf magicians! In the eyes of the silver dragon, there is an angry flame. She knows the preciousness of the magician. She wants these magicians to bury her and her children! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few figures suddenly flew up and rushed to Chris Ferrena! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly swept over the silver dragon body, and her wheel saw pulled a deep, but long wound on the silver dragon's abdomen. Her wheel saw was poisonous, but the silver dragon was almost immune to poison, so this wound, although it looks terrible, has little effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dragon’s giant tail swayed in a lightning-like manner, and it was taking the wind butterfly and took her to the mountain wall dozens of meters away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinlong screamed, and then there was a familiar breath in the nose. This is the smell of the little bug! Cris Ferrena’s most sensitive nose followed an unspeakable pain! This pain even shakes her soul! Then a burst of paralysis spread quickly, and the world in front of Yinlong slowly dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She snarls and squirts the last bite of the dragon, just hit the little bug! The raging dragon's interest is not over, and continues to rush to the magician in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froya's five magical devices lit up at the same time, and half of the elf magicians in front of the silver dragon suddenly disappeared. But the remaining half were dodging, and they were all contaminated with the flames of the silver dragon. These undead silver flames burned them. In a twinkling of an eye, the five elf magicians and eleven magic apprentices stopped screaming. Not moving on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Hughes were ruined and swayed from the air. In his hand, he still clasped a short, short, short sword that shone with Mori's blue light. If these two short swords are seen by the teacher of Froya, Jero, they must be coveted. This is the killing dragon sword that has a special killing effect on the dragon! Hughes has already cut a terrible giant cross on the nose of the silver dragon, and the fate of Christine Ferrena is not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Yinlong, the whole world is rapidly darkening. At this time, a figure surrounded by seven magical silver shields suddenly swept past her eyes, and then there was a huge pain in her hindbrain, and the whole world was finally completely dark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body of Yinlong finally fell, and a dozen elf warriors who could not escape were pressed underneath. Rogge was on her back, half of her body was surrounded by black flames, and deep purple scales appeared vaguely around her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right arm has fallen into the back of the silver dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is born between the lights and stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint fireworks suddenly appeared in the dragon! It is so fast that no one in the Dragon ** can see where it came from and where to return. Only that faint flame tail suddenly appeared in the dragon ** out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people in the dragon ** stayed for a while, only to see the end of the flames connected to the top of the hole, one end did not enter the back of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog didn’t feel the pain, but the consciousness was blurred. Suddenly he was planted from the head of the silver dragon, and his hand was still firmly in the fist. A shiny silver spar. On his original silver dragon faucet, there was a small hole that was two inches long and bottomless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unbreakable demon lotus leaf at that moment, came out from the top of the hole, pierced Rogge and Silver Dragon, and returned to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until Rogge slammed down on the ground, the dragon ** was like a fried pot, a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the snow peak, the Death Scythe suddenly fell from the hands of the ***. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Gregory stayed in a hurry and swooped down, biting the death sickle and flying back to the back. It’s also a mess in his head. “God! Master.... The master will also miss it!...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Stayed for a moment, suddenly Nothing to say: "He must not die!" The figure disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory stayed, hurriedly vaguely shouted: "Master! Your sickle..." It jumped into the void . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge fell at the foot of Froya and scared her. She hurried forward and lifted Rogge, seeing him pale, it was already a sigh of relief, and there was a two-inch long narrow wound on the abdomen that looked small, but looking closely, it was through the body of Rogge. A transparent wound! Around the wound, under the terrible heat of the fire of the demon lotus, a layer of black crystals has formed. These black crystals, like life, are still slowly extending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hughes, who was bruised and bruised, walked over and glanced at Rogge’s wound, and looked sad and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria put Rogge’s body into the hands of Hughes and stood up. The whole person gave off a faint magical light, and the air suddenly appeared. A sloping gate, more than a dozen elf magicians fell from the door and fell into a ball. Froya ran under the gate and jumped up, but could not touch the door. Her magic power has been exhausted, and she has barely spurred the paradise, but her mouth is at an altitude of five meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
