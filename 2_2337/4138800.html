			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss of the dragon was shocked, it did not care for Gregorian, turned around and rushed to the ***. Originally, *** was already dying, but now energy is slowly recovering. Although the degree of energy recovery is not fast, it still makes the dragon of the abyss feel extremely shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to recover power in battle, this is something it has never heard of!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp If both sides have the same strength and skill, then the outcome of the battle will no doubt be the one who can restore strength to win. Especially when the power reaches the king level, in the case of similar power control, the small difference in power can sometimes determine the outcome of a battle. And now the *** not only has overwhelming power control, but also self-recovering power! Even if her strength is always on the level of the king, it is also invincible in the world of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A cold smile, the figure disappeared, and a few meters back, it was a paw of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss knows that the current *** is still very weak, and the power is not even as strong as his own, and the degree is slower than the memory of the kings. Quite a lot. However, in the past, when the kings fought against the ***, her degree was swift and incomprehensible, but the kings could always judge the trajectory of her movement, and each king had a way to restrain her high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, although the degree is slow, all her actions are no longer elusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abyss of Dragons slams every slap, *** is only avoided by a few meters, a pair of silver enamel with a faint disdain to look at the dragon of the abyss . The whole body of the abyss is tens of meters long. It seems that it is slightly tumbling, and it can squash the *** that is kept close to it. What makes the dragon of the abyss chill is that no matter how hard it works, the distance of these meters is always the same, just like the gap that existed in ancient times, it has not been widened or narrowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown why, the dragon of the abyss suddenly felt that the *** it faced had completely changed into a new existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak Gregory has long been stunned by the abyss of the Abyss, and fell to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***, it should be said that Wella, suddenly fluttering backwards, and the dragon and the abyss of the dragon opened a distance of hundreds of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and took a look at it, and the Death Scythe appeared in her right hand. Seeing the death sickle in his hand, Wella couldn't help but stunned, obviously not very suitable for this weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A milky white flame ignited from her palm, and the whole death slashed in the blink of an eye, and the dark black with the cyan ornate pattern was swept away. Turned into a milky white decorated with golden flower branches. The huge blade was also straightened in an instant, turning into a huge pale gold gun tip that was more than a meter long. The three lightning-shaped fine blades separate and extend from the tip of the gun. They are not covered by the tip of the golden entity, but a void. Behind the hollow seems to lead to another vast dark space, there is no trace of light at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s hand shook gently, and the three sharp edges of the gorgeous long-gun rifle illuminate the blue arc, and there is no small lightning ball. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon of the Abyss knows that the last moment has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although *** is far less powerful than it is, it instinctively knows that victory can never belong to itself. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this last juncture, if the kings did not instinctively choose to escape from survival, but to rush out and fight with the ***, then they suddenly lost their resistance. The *** of ability has already become a dust in the world of death. Even if the power of the *** is intact, the remaining five kings will not be able to win. But who would have expected to get *** would have ruined the flame chariot? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flame chariot is in the hands of the ***, the kings have no chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, facing the *** directly, the dragon of the abyss suddenly felt that even if they were asleep, the kings could not escape the trace of ***. The magic of the Lich Elgha has caused the kings to escape the eyes of the heavenly patrols several times, but can they cover the silver plaque of the ***? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss puts down the emotion in the heart, and a new feeling comes from the bottom of my heart. It clearly feels the power of ***, almost invincible and powerful. But the dragon of the abyss has forgotten what is fear and despair, it just wants to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss, who has embraced the mortal heart, screams in amazement, and rushes to Weiner with the gale of the sky and the dark gray dragon!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner's gun in the hands of Weina slowly waved to the dragon of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the pounce of the prison gun, a light ball with a diameter of 100 meters and flashing glory greeted the dragon of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great body of the abyss dragon suddenly multiplied several times and involuntarily fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a gravity attack that is very familiar to the Abyss Dragon. It struggled to flutter, and while confronting the sudden increase in gravity, it rushed to Weiner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina snorted softly, with a smile on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravity added to the dragon in the abyss suddenly disappeared! It couldn’t control its power for a while, and the whole body rose from the sky, passing by Weina’s head. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, gravity returns to the body of the abyss. But this time it is no longer a multiple of gravity, but dozens of times of gravity!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss of the dragon screams, the body involuntarily falls nearly a kilometer, This barely controls his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravity is once again enhanced, but the direction becomes up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurricane whistling The dragon of the abyss that completely lost control rushed into the thick cloud of lead color. The thick lead clouds rushed and the dragon of the abyss fell again. This time, its huge body was spinning wildly under the gravitational pull of the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sneer of Wella, the dragon of the abyss is completely unable to control his body, under the powerful gravity of flickering, flickering, and fluctuating. , rolling in the air, no resistance or even the power to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In just a few minutes, the power of Wella has returned to the power of the original king. But her power is stopped here and no longer grows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina clearly snorted!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravity of the Abyss Dragon suddenly disappeared completely. But it still slid up and down for dozens of laps before it barely controlled its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Wella’s real attack has arrived...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always cloaked the abyss The dragon's ball of light suddenly filled with hundreds of gravitational forces. These gravitational forces are not only different in strength and direction, but are still intertwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moments, the left wing of the abyss dragon is pulled upwards, the right wing sinks downward, the neck can not stretch, the head is pressed to the body, and the giant tail Then a dozen of gravitational tears can't help but tremble!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of the abyss roars in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the real fatal thing is the gravitational ball that tumbling in it, and the strong gravitational structure of the abyss dragon is twisted between hundreds of powerful gravitational moments. Have to smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wena White's left hand in the snow is stunned in the void! Her scene within a square of a kilometer is bizarrely twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, all the gravitational forces of the abyss of the dragon point to the point in the center of the body. Its body structure is so fragile that it is very fragile. Now, under the strong gravitational force, the huge body of the abyss dragon is actually shrinking little by little, and it is a whole circle in a blink of an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the dragons of the abyss that are less than fifty meters from beginning to end, Wella suddenly stopped all attacks. But the battle is over. The dragon of the abyss, which is seriously wounded and weak, can only barely float itself in the air. Now even if it wants to escape, it is impossible to escape from the hands of Wella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humble rebels..." Wella's voice became extremely gentle. "If it weren't for your stupid behavior, I wouldn't be as embarrassed as it is now, even the control of the body is incomplete. I am very Anger, very angry...so you won’t destroy it right away. I heard that you are a dignified person who doesn’t even dare to improve. But we still have twenty-two minutes, I will give you ample opportunity to show Dignity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner in the hands of Wella couldn’t stretch and grow bigger, and at the end it stretched into a 30-meter long, A terrorist weapon with a diameter of one meter. Only the one-meter gun that Wella held was still in its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's petite little body now looks like a negligible little ornament hanging on a giant gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, shape, size, and even weight are insignificant, but power is absolute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is showing this truth. She looks like a petite body condensing in the air, a 30-meter-long gun with a screaming gale slamming on the body of the abyss, knocking it down like a meteor!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a weird battle, or, beating, and being more accurate, it is killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner’s soft and weak body is so small that the gun body she holds in her hand is thinner than the huge gun body with a front end that is one meter thick. It seems to break at any time. Similarly, the 30-meter-long rifle and the abyss dragon's body of 50 meters are not prominent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the big gun is waving in the hands of Wella, just like no weight, lightning can not slam on the body of the abyss, in the thunder of the thunder In the middle of the ring, it was smashed up and down in the air, and the carrion flew around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s mouth is more and more happy with a smile...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finally started reciprocal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina snorted, the prison gun returned to the prototype, and then the left hand stretched forward, and in the blink of an eye, it was condensed into a huge ten meters in front of me. Among them, the light ball burning with the blazing flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the reciprocal sound of ***, the flame ball slowly flies to the abyss of the dragon that has been slammed with only one skeleton, and the raging flames are ruined. It is completely incinerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reciprocal of *** just ends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death has calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the lead cloud and the mountain peak, in addition to the gale of the whistling, only the *** is standing against the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The golden cross of the left eye dimmed and turned into a golden headless angel image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master...Save me..." A faint spiritual wave undulates in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Void a trick, only a small half of the broken bone dragon flew from a distance, stopped in front of the *** . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory sighed a sigh of relief, this time, it seems that life is back. It has a good mood and is ready to take a few flatterings. However, when I saw the golden cross star in the right eye, the bone dragon suddenly felt an inexplicable chill, and the mouth opened a piece. A few flatterings rolled on the mouth, but they couldn’t get out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Regained the expressionless face, her right hand caught in the air, and the prison gun appeared in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the prison gun, *** also stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A touch of black flame from the hands of the *** can not spread, in the blink of an eye, the prison rifle once again turned into a dark black with a bright cyan pattern. The tip of the gun was also twisted and stretched, and it was restored to the huge blade of the Death Sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The death of the sickle wave, the large ash that is still corroding the bone dragon body was immediately expelled by the black flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not in a hurry, slowly repairing the body of the bone dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body is not strong enough, the attack means is single, and the attack mode and the soul attribute do not match... The soul inherits, the previous life is a dragon , very weak dragon. You have a vision, ***." Weina taunted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** replied faintly: "Vena, you only use the same, or even weaker, in such a short time." Thoroughly defeated the dragon of the abyss. Especially the final battle is very 'gorgent'. You are really majestic, Wella."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, although the whole The origin of God is controlled by you, and most of the time of this body belongs to you. But as long as I think, I can absolutely control this body! Although the time is not long, it is enough for me to do a lot of things. You are the most Don't irritate me." Wella is cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you did ‘Many sides patched Gregory, and replied faintly: “Then I ruined this body. You have lost control of the source of God and will immediately fall asleep. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you dare to do this, before I fall asleep, I will erase all traces of Rogge's existence! Maybe I should let you have a storm of faith. Power has a little more understanding. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will destroy the original of God." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina in the sea of ​​consciousness sneered a little, the right hand reached in front of the ***, her long fingertips had a thin gold Silk, one connected to the body, four to the sky of nothingness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, have you seen it, this is where you are The four coordinates in the world. I know that you are very fast. Do you want to gamble and see if you can rob the original of God before I destroy these four coordinates? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Suddenly pointed to one of the golden thread points, and Wella just sneered, letting her fingertip point on the golden thread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The fingertips pass through the gold line, but the gold line is still me, completely unaffected, just as it does not exist in this plane. In fact, *** knows that the golden thread is in the sea of ​​consciousness, but it exists in a way that she has no understanding.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That..." *** hesitated a moment, but in a blink of an eye, the eyes returned to calm: "Destroy together. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***And Wei Na looked at it for a long time, long time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden The lake solidified again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner’s eyes slowly lit up, and a smile appeared in the corner of his mouth, softly saying: “***, I do It is to give you control of the origin of God, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unbeatable force is falling from the sky, suddenly *** Into the Golden Lake! Wella's figure appeared in the original position of the ***.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said the next sentence: "...I Can't you grab it back? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina screamed, the left hand went up, the golden lake boiled again, and a huge wave rushed to the sky and brought up from the bottom of the lake. One, *** flew over, the slender neck fell into the five fingers of Wella...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory's new body skeleton has been After the construction, the four thin wings have begun to take shape. Now the whole body is still unable to use it freely, and it has to be further strengthened, but the bone dragon is already excited and screaming.<br /><br />&nbsp ;;;;;;;;;; What kind of new abilities are there, but certainly not ordinary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously the reward of the owner’s loyalty to it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon is excited and slightly trembles, it wants to want to scream a few times, at least a few hundred ass, However, it includes several new kinds of fresh flatterings. But I don’t know why, as soon as I see the golden cross star in the right eye, Gregory is all stiff, and consciousness will fall into a blank moment, even a little spirit. Fluctuations can't be released.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of flattering can't stop in the bone dragon consciousness, but they can't shoot it anyway. The sadness in this is really impossible to say. Gregory can't wait to use the newly repaired skull to hit the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not bad anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The repair work suddenly stopped, she just stood still, the golden cross star and the headless angel in her eyes disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar, Gregory fell from the air. Its body has not yet been completed, and it is still unable to float alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory doesn't know what happened to him, but it knows that I am afraid that the owner will not be able to take care of himself for a while. Fortunately, just the master of the gods destroyed the abyss of the dragon, the other kings must have no courage to appear in the vicinity. Otherwise, when you come out with a king again, everything will be over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge woke up from meditation, it was already a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with any meditation in these days, this time he is still summoned back from the magical world by a sudden panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and pushed the door out of the meditation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold moonlight slid quietly into the room from the wide windows, and everything was plated with a layer of silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake's surface reflects the silvery moonlight, which is mysterious and beautiful, with a little sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger slightly in front of the window smiled a bit, this time is always inexplicable panic, now even feel sad, is your heart really changed Soft? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and ruled out all the distractions, and finally calmed down. In Rogge's consciousness, all depression and sentimentality are extravagant things, and he does not have so much time to squander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog went to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is still very long, he is going to take a shower, then go to the magical magic spell in the black crystal. If the curse method can be used freely, and then combined with his spiritual power-driven instant magic, even if only low-level magic is used, it is not something that ordinary people can resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was already a maid in the bathroom door, and the towel and Rogge’s clothes were being placed at the bathroom door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge, a few hours later. At this time, in addition to the vigil of the vigil, other people have been dreaming for a long time, how is this elf still here? And as if you know that you want to bathe at this time, send clothes and bath towels over? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Rogge, the eyes have turned into silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf put down the things in his hand, turned and was about to leave, and suddenly saw Rogge behind him, scared and exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at her carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This elf girl is tall and taller than the average elf, and her face is very beautiful. She is quite outstanding in the elves. However, Roger is surrounded by a real beautiful woman in the elves, and the elf maid is dull. Not to mention the comparison with the stunning butterfly, Androni or Froah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger has a pair of silver eyes carefully scanning her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young elf girl martial arts is still unclear, but the vindictiveness is only ten. Maybe it’s a good one among the elf women of the same age, but it’s definitely not with the genius. When Ajani was much older than her, she became a 12th-level guardian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge puts his heart down. Even if he is completely unprepared, this unarmed elf girl will never die. Speaking of poisoning, if the medicine is not so violent that it can poison a dragon, then Rogge is a condiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her clear eyes, Rogge suddenly moved slightly, and asked: "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Effie."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that I am going to take a shower at this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger adults this roughly this night Time will come out of the meditation room, and then go to the magic after bathing. So I prepared in advance tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ge has some interest, "True I didn't expect you to be so hearted. When did you transfer to the temple of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was responsible for the day when Rogge returned to the city of the gods. Take care of your daily routine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger brows slightly wrinkled and thought: "How can I not have an impression..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The adults are busy every day, and they are used to seeing the wind butterfly, Miss Froya, and naturally will not pay attention to these maids."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Rogge laughs. This elf girl seems very interesting, facing her own tolerance, just like having known each other for a long time, there is no other elf to treat her blind obedience or respect. When it comes to wind butterfly and Fu Luoya, it is like saying something completely irrelevant, totally innocent, envious or even teasing or shy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly wanted to tease this elf girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles and approaches, looking at her clear eyes: "Effie, since you are so dedicated, you will not want to... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"willing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s crisp answer surprised Rogge . He looked carefully at the eyes of the elf girl, there was no, no ambition, nothing, only a clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roghaha smiled and slammed Effie and strode into the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky was twilight, Rogge finally got out of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie’s thin eyebrows are tightly wrinkled, wet gold sticks on the forehead, a row of white fine teeth biting the lower lip, right hand Grabbing Rogge's arm and moving it step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiled and looked at Effie, who was stubbornly asking himself to walk, and said with a good intention: "Have a rest in the next few days, huh, huh. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie shook his head and said: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She let go of her hand The body immediately shook, and the little face became pale. He had to change his mouth: "...just rest for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge finally couldn’t stand it Lived and laughed, the haze over the past few days was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He managed to hold back Xiaofei, where is your room? I will send you back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie resolutely pushed Rogge's hand back. It's time for you to study magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie’s answer came out of Rogge’s surprise, and he watched the Elf girl move step by step to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Effie suddenly turned back,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deep, deep<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clear eyes, it seems to contain endless confession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stayed for a while and only came back for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Effie, has already left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wilderness of the world of death, Gregory is boring and boring on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its body is far from being completed, and it is the short distance that can fly. It is also the result of its full intelligence and perfection of the body by its own strength. Gregory knew how difficult it was to improve his body. Although *** had built all the frameworks for it, it gave Gregory the direction and all the precautions. But this is a slight improvement, and it is almost a breakthrough when the bone dragon is almost desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has to admit that, besides flattering, maybe it is not always a genius in other respects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone dragon heads up to the sky and tries to look into the sky. At the height where it could not be seen, *** still stood there quietly. In addition to waiting, Gregory knows that he can't do anything. Within a few tens of kilometers, I couldn’t feel the breath of any undead creatures. From the most powerful destruction of the Cavaliers to the lowest level, nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone dragon can only wait alone in isolation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death is now much deserted. After several catastrophe, there may be no one in the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the wind is still whistling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong wind hit, the black of the *** suddenly fluttered in the wind, and people were immediately blown away by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then she stabilized her body, and the black hangs straight again, and the golden cross star and the headless angel in her eyes gradually light up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea of ​​consciousness, the golden lake has completely condensed, and from time to time there will be a large group of golden mist spurting out and dissipating in the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** and Wella are still squatting, but no one is going to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of God's original is drawn by both of them endlessly, and is now in a very dangerous state of instability. If you fight again, it will really be destroyed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina looked at *** with hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two battles of the Sea of ​​Consciousness, Wella has an absolute advantage, but she can't break the last line of defense in any way. . Every time I saw the pair of silver enamel, Wei Na felt uneasy in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the original of God is already on the verge of destruction, and although Wella is reluctant, she still has to stop fighting. *** Naturally, the battle will not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condensed golden lake slowly opened again, and no gold fog erupted from the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *** and Wella, who had just been so embarrassed, also recovered calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina repeatedly searches the memory of God's original, trying to know why she can't break the last line of consciousness anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is temporarily impossible to rely on the battle to regain control of the origin of God, Wella decided to think about his law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***, when I just destroyed the dragon of the abyss, how do you see how I use gravity control?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." *** replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner smiles slightly, can you use gravity control like this now? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The brow is slightly wrinkled and replies: "Not at all." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can freely retrieve your memory and use all your attack techniques, but how much do you know about me?" What is the belief storm? What is space free? What is in my memory? What are the missions, essences and characteristics of the Light Angel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time *** did not answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina is not going to wait for her to answer, He said from his own feet: "***, you just rely on instinct to grow up, and the time for growth is still too short. You don't know anything about the origin of God, and you won't use it at all. For the memories and experiences that belong to us, you are also blank. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weiner suddenly asked: "***, if we don't rely on the origin of God, but we each have our own body, even if we have the same strength, do you think you need a few *** to defeat me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Brows wrinkled, coldly replied: three. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina proudly smiles very honestly. We have an irreparable gap in our understanding of the battle. Then why can't I beat you in these two battles? What is the last barrier of consciousness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Waiting quietly, she knows that Wella will give her the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because of you..." Weina looked at the ***, word by word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no feeling at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The light in the eyes suddenly jumped slightly. This volatility has been taken up by Weina, and she is not prepared to give any chance to breathe and continue: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God is in the existing angel system In addition, the purpose of creating a light angel again is to adapt to the battle environment of different planes. We are the sword in the hands of God. It is the basic requirement of being a powerful weapon without any emotional influence. We have different environments. Choosing the instinct of the best way of fighting, but emotions will not only affect our judgment, but also shake our will. Although you fail to inherit the power of God, you will also benefit from the battle of God's origin. Instinct. So you choose to fight against it, not because you want to die, but because you 'know' I don't want to face destruction. I can't destroy your last will, just because you don't have feelings at all, so the will is like this. Firm!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** In the eyes of the ***, there is a trace of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina’s cold spirits echoed on the golden lake: “***, are you still gonna admit it? For example, you would rather destroy it and maintain it. Rogge, his heart is full, his will is not strong enough, his mood swings are very powerful, his strength is not as good as a lower-level angel, and cultivation is the troublesome and useless magic of the devil. Is there such a place worthy of you? Is the existence of my own existence guarded? In fact, the real answer lies in the origin of God. Do you want me to tell you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina faint smiles Waiting for the answer of ***: "That is because you 'should' guard him, not you guard him. From the moment you are born, the continuator who guards Rodriguez - Rogge is solidified into Your instinct, and the most important instinct, even surpassed your own survival. There is only one person who can do this, that is Rodriguez!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The body trembled a little. For a long time, she sighed and asked: "So, Wella, do you have feelings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na hesitated for a moment and sighed again Only answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I was created, I came directly to that plane. It is in the body provided by the pope. It is very dangerous to come. The new body is perfect, but it has too strong and firm feelings and will. I have not waited for me to completely conquer the new body, and wiped out all the emotions to Luo. Driggs. He took advantage of my physical weakness at the time to make my will shake a little, thus controlling the origin of God. Later, I lost and died, and you were created by this. Because I was When I die, I am still in an incomplete state, so I should have a feeling like you, and I have no feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weina slightly smiles The understanding of power is still very young, but I can't always subdue you. This is the difference between emotions. In fact, you and I are one, it can be said that the two different faces of the light angel. But you don't know the origin of God at all, and obviously you don't know the memory of God's origin. Rogge, who you are desperately guarding, is the heir to Rodriguez. I think I should let you know what Rodriguez once did to us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vina's hand waved, and the large section of memory was like a continuous stream of turbulence, pouring into the depths of the *** consciousness, scouring Her soul!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the lingering black air, the golden sacred squatting, the blood and mucus flowing around, the blue-purple skin, and the prestige Na Na’s cry of tearing the blood cloud!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
