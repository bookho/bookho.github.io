			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 15 Sparta<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of the Gods can finally come to an end Rogge left a bunch of problems for Hughes and was ready to leave for Dresden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dragon horse is dead. Fortunately, after the silver dragon breastplate, no longer need to wear a heavy body, although the dragon and dragon gun is not light, but this weight can be affordable for the average horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge came back with the smoky, savage dragon-slayer gun, even Androni was shocked. She wanted to try this gun with the blue sky, but Rogge’s distressed silver dragon horn was hard to come by, and she refused to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is still weak at this time, but the injury is recovering quickly. It seems that it will be able to go down to the ground in a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge arranges the elf craftsmen to produce poison arrows, broken armor arrows, and fire arrows, such as Frostbolt and Frostbolt. He is prepared to fully exploit the long-range attack ability of the dark face talent of the moon. If the money is spent, he can earn again, but the elf is dead. It is much more difficult to regenerate one. He can't afford the loss of these elite elf warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leather armor made of silver dragon skin is not weaker than the general body armor, and it is very light, just right for the dark side of the moon. Unfortunately, the number is small, only one hundred sets. As for the ten sets of heavy armor made entirely of silver dragon scales, except for the two surviving guardian warriors, the rest of the elves can't wear them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind butterfly is now wounded, and the bow of the Elf King is changed back on Raphael's back. This Shadow Knight, always hidden in the dark, is like a newborn little wolf, desperately absorbing all the knowledge around him, and the enclave is progressing. In just one month, the effort has broken from ten to eleven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the original re-entry into the city of the gods, when Rogge walked out of the city of the gods, the troops behind him seemed to be much thinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the raging Rogge stepped into the Grand Dukes of Dresden, he happened to have met between Auntie and the Minister of Finance and Military Affairs. Fierce competition, Hilley is also difficult to decide. The dispute has been in existence for several days, but Rogge disappears mysteriously every time he goes, no news, and he does not know when he will return. The Principality of the Principality only knows that Roger's Elf Guards established a city among the Central Mountains, and the devil's soul is taken into the city. As for the specific location of the city of the gods, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the elves have restored their magic, and the city of the gods has been re-hidden in the long, virgin forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By convention, every time Rogge returns to Dresden, he will first appear in the house of Hilley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of talking with Hille, Androni and Froya were also listening. Seeing this man and woman in a beautiful position, Hilley also took a moment to slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge took a sip of tea and put down the report in his hand. The rebellion of the Snowy Congress is not surprising, nor is it a big deal. Although Frey adults ate a small loss, as long as our army passed, forgive these traitors can not play any tricks. It’s just that Aunt’s decision is a bit strange. I hired a mercenary group of only 30 knights to fight for rebellion with 5,000 gold coins. There is also this five percent of the armor tax... This tax does not say it first, Hilley, have you seen the mercenary group, what is your evaluation of them? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sile has indulged them as truly outstanding knights, and I have never seen such majesty and murderousness in other knights. In addition to their arrogance, I can't see how much they are much better than the Snow Bear Knight. It is reasonable to say that the price paid by Auntie Dagong can hire a mercenary group of more than 1,000 people. But before you left, you told me that the candidates for armaments and officers were headed by the aunt, and the old ministers did not intervene, but this time her two decisions involved the authority of the finance and military ministers. The power that you pre-approved her will lead to disputes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly said: "Selecting talents by publicly recruiting mercenary groups, it looks like There is nothing wrong with it. Why are you so fiercely opposed? Do you think Auntie is carrying us what action?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillley hesitated for a moment, only on the road "Auntie’s duty to treat her is almost fanatical, I still can't see what she will do in the back. But Roger, the mercenary, like the prostitute, has no other way than to get money to get their loyalty. I think I want to choose the officer from the mercenary. Very bad. Adults, Auntie is very smart, sometimes she is crazy and bold, although the effect so far is good, but to rule a country, can not rely on this gambling approach!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the barracks in Dresden were full of screaming, screaming, screaming, and fighting. Rogge stood at the gate of the barracks and looked at it from the distance. He smiled at Hilley: "Auntie is a good idea. Anyway, this barracks is also empty. It is nothing to give the mercenary group to apply for free. Instead, I can earn a return on the meal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillley apparently disliked the noise and confusion inside, and he said with a beard: "Rogge These mercenaries are lawless. Once we are not selected to perform the counterinsurgency mission, I am afraid they will make trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge smiles more than a thousand people Who dares to make trouble on my site? Let's go in and have a look. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni suddenly caught Rogge: "Wait, there is a very good guy who already feels that we are here." Still be careful. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger said: "Not afraid, we are not fighting." Go and see. "When he said, he first stepped into the barracks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barracks were sitting in the yard with many mercenaries. At this time they had already eaten dinner, it was the gathering. When I was together, I was awkward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noisy barracks compound suddenly quieted down, and countless pairs of naked eyes fell on Froya. And again, there is an inviolable iceberg. Rogge knows that this is her true appearance. Since that fragrant night, he understands that Froya’s previous charm and style are all disguised, she Like Androni, not only psychologically, but also physically have an absolute rejection of men.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for these vulgar mercenaries, Rogge is dark Thinking, if it is provoked by Fu Luoya...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, Hille led Rogge to the west of an inconspicuous small barracks door sand The mercenary is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stands at the door, no entryAndroni put his hand on the starry sky, and Froya also looked at the door intently, turning the blue crystal ring on the filigree jade finger. They all felt the murderous murderousness that suddenly rose behind the door. Rogge sniffed a trace of blood. This is a faint bloody suffocation that can only be experienced after countless battlefield killings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a quicksand mercenary group? We are not malicious, can we come out and see?" Rogge said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy wooden door opened, and an ordinary man came out. Rogge seemed to be familiar and looked at him carefully. The man was also looking at Rogge up and down, and there was an unbelievable look in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are...Charlie?" Rogge asked tentatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you be Rogge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue never imagined that it would be in miles Meet the old man outside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Charlie is dressed in a normal, face-faced color of frost, at first glance it looks like a savvy man of about thirty, and there is still a half-minute round table knight. Noble and glory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rogge, Charlie was also a little excited, but the two of them were the ones who worked together as a master, and even the general exchange could not be discussed. This reunion, although a little excited, but can restrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the quicksand mercenaries inside?" Rogge asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie gave him a smile and said: "There are all the old ones who followed the Orpheek adults. Rogge, please come in!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty former gold lion knights have some wind cream on their faces at this moment, Rogge’s familiar arrogance has disappeared, instead of calm and murderous And cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the past one by one, and then asked: "The golden lion knight of the adult... Is there only these people left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie said faintly: "After me, a total of 31 people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge trembles After a moment, I asked: "Charlie, you... how did you become a mercenary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge whispered: "Charlie, I am now a court magician of the Principality of Are, you are not willing to temporarily grievance, and the brothers in the team? I urgently need a reloading knight "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie stunned and said: "Master Rogge, I have many friends in the Church of Light, and I heard that you are judged to be heresy. After all, the old Orpheq adults who have survived have been very admired for your resignation and the flight of Miss Elysses. Anyway, we are also exiled. If we can help you, we will stay. In the Principality of Alei."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog’s heart is overjoyed, and it’s great to be excited! The environment here is too bad, come and come, I will take you to the new residence! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Lion Knights have no extra baggage except for the armor weapons. Simply clean up and follow Rogge out of the barracks.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"***! I said how to do so, people dare to pick up the task! It turned out to be a big aristocrat who knew the Principality! "A yin and yang voice came from the mercenary who was watching. The mercenaries in the barracks were attached to the squad, but no one came up to challenge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at both sides and felt a little strange. He smiled and said: "It’s strange that these mercenaries are shouting. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie smiled and said: "Why don't you?" On the day we moved in, almost every mercenary group came over. But they are very smart and generally won't come back for the second time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni screamed at the round table knight and the golden lion knight, and these three-way mercenaries were of course asking for trouble!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie heard that there was a thorn in Androni’s words, and the smile still remained unchanged: “I was not the opponent of Andre’s adult, and now your martial arts are obviously more than before. Further, let alone, as for Princess Furoya, I am absolutely unwilling to be an enemy of a great magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Androni It is a matter of the past with Froya and Orpheus and Elysses. Nowadays, the movements of the stars and the things are human and non-existent. In those days, the heads of the family were in exile, and they met in the North, and all the grievances of the year were already weak. At this time, Charlie was in peace, and Androni and Froya were too embarrassed to be difficult for him. Moreover, they are currently asking for Rogge, and they will not be boring to destroy his good deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Charlie is not willing to be an enemy of them, and they are not willing to arbitrarily build a round table knight Charlie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, Charlie led the thirty golden lion knights, and in the hostile eyes of more than a thousand mercenaries, proudly walked out of the barracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing Rogge returned to the Grand Duke was to find Auntie, just pushing the door of her room and screaming at a vase! Rogge took the vase and smiled. "How come you see such a big fire every time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie sees the incoming people, Exclaimed: "Rogge! You are finally back, I have been waiting for you! The two old idiots of the Finance and Military Secretary are simply too jerk!..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay! Auntie, I know everything you do, you are doing very well! But I have two questions. One is why did you choose the quicksand mercenary group? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie’s face is slightly red and I know... I will look at men. Although there are not many people in the quicksand mercenary group, it is calm, calm and murderous that I have never seen before. Their Charlie, at first glance, knows that it is a very capable person. I talked to him once. His vision and chestliness have only been seen in you. You should be a class of people, so I want to leave him in the Principality to help you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am completely different from him in two categories, but some places are similar." Anyway, you have done a very good job! What do you want to levy on the armor tax? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is like this, Rogge, you know that there is a rebellion in the country of the ferrets, and the Frey adults brought five hundred soldiers to chaos, and actually ate." A defeat! I think this is a good excuse. It is a good time to expand the army. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog is very surprised, but still can't see any expression on the face: After?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In his heart, Rogge was amazed at the alternative views of Auntie, but still faintly asked: "All wise men think that there will be no good end to the military. If you do this, are you afraid of dragging the national power of the Ayre Principality?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogge, although these civilians will have a hard life, but the war will divert their attention. As long as you continue to win on the battlefield, these The good news will support them to continue to endure hardships, not to mention the trophies to compensate in the future! The Ayre Principality is a small country, we are like a poor man with no chips in hand, if you want to win, you must have all the hands The things that are bet are all on! Go to double or lose!” Auntie is like a fanatical gambler! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's more," Auntie added: "If we take out all the chips, we don't necessarily qualify for the gambling!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge silently, he finally looked up and looked deeply at the aunt's frantic dark brown eyes. I must admit that I really looked down on you. Just do what you said! First, in the name of chaos, the Principality and the Recto Province will be fully mobilized, and then the armor tax or the spear tax will be levied. From tomorrow, Auntie, the finance minister of the Principality will obey your instructions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie gave a pleasant surprise, pulled up Rogge's hand and kissed it hard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay! No need to do this! The quicksand mercenary group has promised to play for the Principality, and I will let them try to train a heavy cavalry in the shortest possible time. If they have any needs in the future, you have to do everything possible to satisfy them! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now every minute is very valuable to Rogge. The next day, he takes Charlie and gathers all the troops that can be assembled, including all heavy infantry. The Light Infantry and the Snow Bear Knights, and even the Grand Guard's Guards, have been convened for Charlie to pick the right fighters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole busy day, over and over again With lowering the standard, Charlie finally picked out forty knights and seventy alternate knights. These forty knights are selected from the Snow Bear Knights and only need intensive training. And the seventy alternate knights It is selected from the various infantry units, and the first step is to train horseback. These things are given to the general instructors. In addition to practicing horseback riding, the golden lion knights point to their martial arts, vindictiveness and battlefield knowledge.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the 40 Snow Bear Knights, Charlie personally trained.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these precious gold lion knights, Rogge couldn’t bear to lose one more. He rushed thirty sets of silver dragon scales. The solid heavy armor gave these golden lion knights, and Charlie prepared a set of heavy armor made entirely of silver dragon scales.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New knights When the next day was not yet bright, Charlie was pulled to the drill field in the cold wind. The knights were only wearing thin pajamas and shivering in the cold wind.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, Charlie’s milky white flaming flames are particularly dazzling. Before he came to the new recruits, he looked at them one by one, from the beginning to the end, and from the tail to the end. Then stand in front of the team. Snow bear knights look at the arrogance of Charlie in awe, which represents absolute strength, the only thing that can conquer these unruly knights.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Charlie. From now on, I am your instructor, boss and...natural enemies! "Charlie is almost the last word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, proud knights, let me see your vindictiveness and make all your strengths." come on! It’s very dark now, you can easily let me see the vindictive light! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no matter how hard the snow bear knights work, the team is still dark. The strongest knights of them are just eight, and they are out of the air. There is still a long way to go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie snorted and said: "Why didn't I see a piece of light, is my eyes smashed? Obviously not, then, from today, I will deprive you of the title of the Cavaliers! Because you are not worthy! Because I have checked the Cavaliers, there is never a level 10 or below! When can you let me see your vindictiveness clearly, when will you officially become a knight of the Knights! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the day is still not bright, the wind is cold! But compared with the battlefield, this is already a paradise! So, how long can you stay in heaven? I can tell you, fourteen days! Fourteen days later, I will take you to settle the rebellion in the country of the snowy mountains. I hope that you will not underestimate these rebels. There is already a 14th-level Druid who has failed. You have forty people now. If you want to have forty people standing in front of me after the rebellion, then in these fourteen days, you will give me the strength to breastfeed! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
