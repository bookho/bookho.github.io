			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream roll chapter six has been under <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Wang Qingshui in the hands of crystal jade The roundabout, the rippling water surface reflects a delicate and refined face: the eyebrows are like a light willow, and the eyes are like a clear moon. It was only at this moment that the dusty eyes of the eyebrows were scattered with a scorn that could not be captured but could not be undone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air on the surface of the water, transpiration, gradually blurred the delicate face, that faint sly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Wang Qingshui then flows down from the finger joints. If a small waterfall falls, it can be broken in the fat-blowing bombs. On the skin, and then along the curve of the bumpy, beautiful and tempting, all the way down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly sits in this luxurious bath made of obsidian. The old scorpion has no look and looks, and it seems that the soul has already been removed. There is only one body left behind. At this time, she is like a shadow film man who is manipulated on a stage, carefully cleaning her skin one inch at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to wash away shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water is clear and hot, and the transpiration of the water masks the body of her red luo, so beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the Bauhinia butterfly daggers slightly, and the faint eyes cast on the skylight on the ceiling of the bathroom. Outside the window, it is still the distant and mysterious night sky that she has stared on many times. A sigh of indifference sighed slowly from her lips. She lowered her head, took the hot water again, and slowly dripped it on her round shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a dark color in the water that is no longer clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up a handful of water, this time there is a clear visible blood line in the water, which is slowly spreading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly smiled slightly. Beautiful and beautiful, she lightened her whole lifeless face. However, this beauty is like a flash in the pan! The smiling Bauhinia butterfly suddenly trembled all over the body, like the dead leaves that floated off the branches in the autumn wind, slowly falling backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is gradually dimming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly fell backwards, fell to the poolside, and knocked down a delicate porcelain bottle. The porcelain bottle rolls along the bath pool for a few weeks. Dropped from the edge of the pool, and slammed into a piece of shiny porcelain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lights are on. Rogge walked out of the emperor's palace with exhaustion and climbed into his carriage and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His energy is very understandable, the magic is superb, unless there is a big fight with the opponent, otherwise there will be no feeling of fatigue. It’s just that the intrigue between people and the struggle for power, sometimes more insane than a magical battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is not lit today. Emperor Feuerbach summoned Rogge, Alexander and Pompey and several of the most cronies to the palace to begin discussions on the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty thousand hardships took a month, and after 20,000 deaths, more than half of the forests leading to the south have been opened. The Poseidon Corps led by Pompeii is a long-distance drive, sweeping the area within 100 kilometers of the avenue. For a time, countless years of powerful World of Warcraft in the forest have become victims of the Poseidon. Alexander has completed the reorganization of the Glacier Corps and the troops have been added. At this moment, he holds 120,000 troops and nearly 200,000 slaves of various ethnic groups, facing the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire has basically completed the occupation and plunder of the West Bank of the Longines, the war preparations needed to fight the South are piled up, and the garrison of locals The troops have also been assembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire West Coast of the Longines is divided into three sections, three new imperial provinces are established, and the main officials are basically appointed. This naturally means countless opportunities for profit distribution. Therefore, Rogge was passionately involved in this struggle to divide the fruits of victory. In the past few months, after countless negotiations, threats, plots and compromises, the major forces of the empire have finally completed the struggle for the three new provinces, and initially determined the pattern of interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge’s sacred church unexpectedly became the biggest winner, and he recommended the members of the club in a big way, carefully selecting the candidates for each position. . In the meeting, almost all the core children in the major families of the empire are gathered. Therefore, if Rogge is interested in one position, he will look at which faction and which family members want to compete in this position, and then give the corresponding members of the squad. Recommend the past. Many of the powers of Rogge were caught off guard. Often Rogge has a letter of recommendation. The person who competes for the most active position will opt out. After all, I am willing to work in this province. Are the children of these families, how can they compete with the members of the guild? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, although the military expedition to the south seems to be easier to create a career, but that direction has gathered all the empire's famous ministers, it is very difficult to get out. What's more, the Imperial Army's expedition to the army and the battle with the Dro Empire, one of the three great empires, no one can say that they will win. Of course, the Dro Empire was worried about external troubles at this time. The national strength was no longer the same, but the foundation industry was placed there for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rogge’s agitation, most of the members of the club accepted new positions and took office. They are gearing up one by one, doing something on this piece of land that is still dripping with blood and smoking. There is never a lack of opportunity to build a new world from the ruins. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few people who are extremely fanatical about the war, and those who are confident in their ability and who are committed to emitting dazzling brilliance in the Nanzheng industry, choose to stay In the army of the Southern Expedition. For these people, Rogge also spent a lot of effort, one by one to give proper arrangements. Some of them were recommended to Alexander and Pompey, and of course these people had a good relationship with the military faction. Others were placed in the Ice Temple Warriors. At this moment, Rogge's Ice Temple Samurai regiment already has more than 2,000 elite warriors. Because of his outstanding individual strength, he has become a force that can determine the situation of the local battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes Rogge worry most is that he has never had a talent in the military. There is no choice. He can only use the rose to prepare the entire ice temple warrior regiment. But the head of the ice temple warrior regiment, he still can not find the right talent to take over, resulting in this position still vacant. After thinking about it, only the Bauhinia butterfly can be combined with his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bauhinia butterfly and the rose are all born in the cold moon camp. When it comes to using soldiers, she is stronger than Mei. It is only the Bauhinia butterfly that controls the entire army of the Ayre Principality. The position is equally important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month. The question of the selection of hundreds of positions broke Rogge's brain, but in this respect there is a careful and easy to use, Robsky can be divided for him. Only Robsky is politically personal. It’s equally difficult to use the soldiers. At this time, Rogge could not help but miss the Charlie who had passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great emperor of today called the empire to discuss the relationship with the Dro Empire. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the Dero empire had been fighting with the Bavarian Principality supported by the church for several months. The Bavarian Grand Duke re-exhibited the year, and he and Rocherio unified the army. It is like a broken bamboo into the Dro Empire. The Dro army, which is significantly superior in military power, has repeatedly battled the Bavarian army for a decisive battle. However, both Dagong and Rosherio are determined to avoid the war. Wandering around, constantly eroding the strength of the Dro army in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war has made the world truly aware of the power of the Bavarian Principality. In the months of the war, the squadrons with strong combat power and outstanding merits have surfaced. The Lionheart Knight, the Lions Legion, the Human Face Spider, and the Moon Wolf have made the Dero soldiers famous and frightened. And the three sons and sons of Rocherio have faintly become the famous generals in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the main force of the Dro Empire is defeated in the early and final battles, then the Bavarian group will be recognized by the entire continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other less-obvious news is quietly circulating among the politicians of mainland countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegedly in the late spring and early summer, an elite 1000-man light cavalry regiment of the Dro Empire attempted to raid a military-required area behind the Principality. The result is that the Holy Knights of the Church of Light are resting in that small town. Since then, this light cavalry has no news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a battle report is a far-reaching message in the eyes of a caring person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few hundred years, the Guangming Church has a detached position and a large number of believers, making it so useless, even though it has enough force to rival the great powers. The land of martial arts. It was the dispatch of the Holy Knights to suppress the infidels, and there were only a few times in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the defeat of the Astrofic Empire a hundred years ago, the light of the Church in the South is not affected. Instead, it expanded rapidly. In fact, the kings of many countries in the South are believers in the Church of Light. Dro, Austro-Hungarian and the Bavarian Principality are the same. For the war between believers, the Church’s attitude has always been to stay out of the way and not to intervene. This time, if the news of the defeat of the Dero empire light cavalry regiment is true, it means that the behemoth of the Guangming Church has finally given up its position of not interfering with the secular for hundreds of years and began to formally intervene in the national war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the powerful power of the Bavarian Principality has far exceeded expectations, it has expanded too quickly and its power has been limited. Even if he can finally defeat the Dro Empire. Most of them can't escape the fate of losing both. however. If the Guangming Church officially joins the war, the battle will be different immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe after defeating the Dro Empire. The sword of the Bavarian Grand Sergeant is still sharp enough to take another few monarchs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war is burning fast enough, and I don’t know how long it will burn and how many countries will be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bavarian Principality is like a fierce beast, even though it is still fighting the giants like the Dro Empire, but the neighboring countries are already in danger. Therefore, despite the signs that the Church of Light is ready to formally intervene in the war, there are still several countries that are secretly in contact with the Dero Empire and ready to intervene in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of the South has quickly changed the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Astrofic Empire has opened up a large road in the forest and gathered hundreds of thousands of troops on the border. If there is goodwill to the Dro Empire, then It’s just that even the goblin can’t lie. However, today the great emperor discussed with the ministers, but whether it is necessary to form an alliance with the Dro Empire on the condition of territorial cession. Send troops to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the surprises of Rogge are that the Emperor’s proposal has won the unanimous support of the ministers. This is not the minister's flattering of Feuerbach. In the empire, these ministers have always expressed their opinions on major events and are not afraid to collide with the great emperor. This is also the biggest difference between the Astrafik Empire and the countries of the South. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge soon realized that it was not the Bavarian Principality that these great ministers really minded, and even the Austrian-Hungarian and Dero empire were not placed in their eyes. Inside. The only place above and below the empire is the bright church in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge is currently in a state of detachment. He participated in all important meetings of the empire, but rarely made comments. Regarding the issue of aiding the Dro Empire. He is always silent, but his heart is thinking. Rogge was initially enemies with the Church of Light, half for Elysses, and half for the identity of his Necromancer. Then, with the deepening of the study of the Church of Light, Rogge involuntarily doubted the true purpose of the existence of the Church of Light, and the answer he got was that he did not even want to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If things only go to this step. There may be compromises between the fat man and the bright church. But after seeing Achilles, Rogge finally understood that the man who had stood behind him and did everything for him silently could never see the heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So no matter how hard and desperate this road is, he has to keep going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly understood Rodriguez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter how smooth he is, how it is, how to use it, there are always times when he has no choice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe many years later. He will be another Rodriguez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, what would he think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge suddenly thought of the child in the belly of the rose, that from the moment of existence, he proudly declared his extraordinary child to the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he becomes Rodriguez one day, he only hopes that the child will not become Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man in the carriage only feels exhausted. Can not help but lick your own forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the outside of the carriage suddenly screamed and snorted, and the wagons on both sides of the carriage hurriedly erected the giant shield and pulled out the long-handed axe. After the defense of these warriors was completed, dozens of figures appeared on the top of the buildings on both sides of the avenue, and dozens of arrows were shot at the ice temple warriors of the guards. In the face of the ice sergeant, who has a thick shield and a strong force, these arrows certainly have no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attackers apparently were unprepared for this result, but they saw only ten ice warriors, and the number of the two sides was very different, so a leader The man shouted a few words to the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge closed his eyes, and some impatiently said: "On the ground to kill! The body does not have trouble. Leave it to the city defense army to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge closed the window and separated all the cockroaches out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He barely waited for a long time, the carriage drove gently and continued on. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the ten armored blood-stained ice warriors escorted Rogge's carriage back to the Great Temple of the Holy Church. When he stepped out of the carriage, Rogge, who had a short break, had recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rogge returned to his own office, a thick stack of secrets was piled up on the table. The fat man sighed in a low voice. He really wanted to have someone to share these chores. Unfortunately, the number of government personnel is also scarce. The only thing he deserves to boast is the number of powerful people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge disassembled the secrets one by one and read them one by one. Suddenly, Rogge suddenly stood up and looked at the secrets in his hand over and over again, and his face had already become iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the secret is very simple: the Bauhinia butterfly suddenly committed suicide, but fortunately, the treatment was timely, and the life was saved temporarily. However, until the secret was issued, she was still unconscious. In the second half of the secret, the situation of a few days before and after the suicide of Bauhinia butterflies was briefly described, and a conclusion was drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly put the secret into the brazier, then called into the waiter, and told him coldly: "Through my order, let Ett come to see me immediately!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather in the North is getting warmer every day, and the fishing of the Longines has gradually increased, which has greatly eased the pressure on the supply of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days. Rogge was too busy. The Asrofik Empire has been in secret contact with the Dro Empire and is preparing to send a mission to the Dro Empire to discuss the war. This ambassador is of course dominated by military and political personnel. However, the most distinguished of the secret members of the corps is the Pope Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge decided to go to the Dro Empire in person and see the customs of one of the three great empires. Rogge was not interested in the expansion of the empire, and this time he traveled with the ambassador. He has another purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before three days ago, Et actually arrived at Ludan Port. Only Rogge has never seen him. At the end of the night, Rogge finally adjusted his mood, and felt that it was time to see the friends who were fooling around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is stepping into the office of Rogge, the fat man is walking back and forth on the floor. Et wants to have a hug with his old friend as he used to, but somehow, he suddenly feels that there is a wide gap between him and Rogge, so he will take back the steps he has taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the long-term loss of friends for a long time. Rogge sighed heavily and finally said: "Att, if you can't find a woman, why can't you find it? Why do you want to provoke her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Etter was a bit uneasy, but when he heard Rogge, his face slowly gloomy and slowly said: "All the women I have met are not as good as her one."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Rogge screamed at the table angrily. Shouted: "You want her, no problem! You go chasing, go to soak! Why must you use this method? What is she, is it a woman in the pub who can play casually? You and him** I don’t know how much effort I had when I caught her. I had decided to transfer her to lead the entire Ice Temple Warrior Regiment. The result was that you committed this and got her committed suicide! Are you satisfied? Who will bring me now? Bing. You?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Etter’s face was blue and red, he stared at Rogge and suddenly screamed: “She likes you! How do I go to bubble? You are now bigger than me, and the status is higher than me. What do I want to compare with you? After the reunion, you don’t even sit in a decent position. If so, what hopes do I have? Get her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ete screamed, but calmed Rogge. He looked at Etter quietly, and the cold eyes finally closed the magic swordsman. And subconsciously turned his gaze to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue coldly said: "I will send you alone to lead the soldiers? What do you want to do. Go to die? I put you next to the Bauhinia butterfly, just want you Good students follow the school. When you learn how to lead, I will naturally let you stand alone. Et, you are still the same, you have no patience, how can you become a big event? And how many people are involved in each decision, how many things? How can you possibly move you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
