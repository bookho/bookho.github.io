			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh day of the book on the third day of the earth<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day of the earth<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint morning light is quietly scattered in every corner of the mystery, looking out from the white stone pillars of the cloister, the mountains are bright and seductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that these beautiful scenery are not naturally formed, Rogge still feels a joy in his heart. At this moment, his face was pale and his feet were vain. If the fat man has already sneaked into the power of the heavenly flame by the flame sword left by the angel, and transforms all the power in the body into a sacred attribute, how can he stand in the flame? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as there is a trace of darkness or death in the body, it will be like a drop of honey, bringing all the destructive power of the Holy Flame into Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat body is like World of Warcraft, but the Heavenly Flame is enough to easily disengage from the steel, even if he can fight against the divine power of the same attribute, but the soul is subject to The bitterness of burning, what is the word that can be described? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge came all the way, and the sacred church was courteous to him. Rogge smiled and returned. He knew in his heart that if these churches knew that he had lost all his strength at the moment, he did not know whether he would rush to the killer regardless of the strict rules of the church. However, he believes that with these eyes alone, he can't see his own reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is now like a tired lion, heading through the wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if the churches know that Rogge is very weak, they may not dare to come up and do it. On that day, the Battle of the Dragon Slayer, not only the three dragons that were unheard of in the sacred churches, fell in front of Rogge, and the colorful dragons that were as beautiful as God and strong in the gods were also fallen! And only at the last moment. Beautifully colorful dragons also occupy the absolute upper hand, it seems that you want to put Rogge to death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the legendary dragon fell in front of this ruthless and unjust fat man, what other existence can stop him? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this campaign, all the churches were more respectful of Rogge’s superficial respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger admired the scenery while walking to his main hall. At the main entrance of the main hall, the piano is standing there from Zhuo. Some looked anxiously. Seeing the fat man slowly moving forward, her face passed a burst of joy. Accelerated and flying directly to himself, quickly rushed to the front of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Lord of the Church, you are finally here! Fengyue...The wind seems to have changed, I am not sure, but the breath in your room and before It’s totally different...” Although the piano is anxious, it still maintains the proper etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man only heard the word of the wind and the moon, the figure immediately flashed. It has disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the main hall, the piano stood for a moment, sighed heavily and flew to the main hall. Everyone in the church knows the importance of the little girl named Fengyue in the heart of Rogge. In case something happened to her, the fat man is very angry and is likely to kill all the coming angels. When the piano found that the atmosphere in the room was wrong, I thought about breaking into the door. But in the face of two doors of frost and green, she has tried her best. Can't even get close to the door within five meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano is finally determined to satisfy the fat man as much as possible. As long as she can give him an excuse to find the troubles of the angels, she can give everything. The piano is puzzled by the Pope’s decision, and he is not afraid to speak out to the fat man. She is an adventing angel. She used to use her identity to quietly pray to the heavenly gods and high-level angels, but no matter how hard she works. There is no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rogge stands in front of the door of his bedroom, the ice on the door will change alternately and the ice and the blue will disappear in an instant. No trace, the two brass doors look completely eccentric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat brows wrinkled, standing with hands, silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle wind blown in from outside the window, smashed the brass door, encountered a blockage, and folded back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the golden fog. The appearance of two girls slowly appeared, whether it was silver or blue eyes. They were all surprised to see the door that suddenly disappeared, and did not expect this to happen. They looked at each other and the surprised moments on their faces were replaced by frost, and they turned their heads to each other. No one looked at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the two girls silently and couldn’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already understands why the piano is panicked. At this moment, the breath of the wind and the moon is looming, and it has not been a violent murderous situation a few days ago. Naifi began to reveal the green brilliance, and she began to show a weak power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are not important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat looks at the windy month, and then look at Naife, so repeated, seemingly no end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, it was the fat man who endured the flames of the flames, and he was under pressure for a night. For him, this night is naturally very long. Long time should only be a feeling, but at the moment I saw Fengyue and Naifei, the fat man suddenly felt that last night it seemed really very long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the wind and moon are full of a head, always standing in the air, if she is standing on the ground, it is not much shorter than the fat. She seems to be fifteen or six years old, and her childishness is exhausted. The supreme color makes the whole person like the wind and smoke in the light smoke, if the dream is like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Nafi has become the appearance of twelve or three years old, and the growth rate is even more amazing. She looks a little shorter than the wind and the moon is still a little childish, but the appearance is very delicate, if it grows up completely, it should not be much less than the wind. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two girls is temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is cold and cold, cold and proud. And Nafi is lively and lovely, just as I see pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you fighting again?" The fat man asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls shook their heads at the same time and resolutely denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger smiled bitterly and habitually extended his hands to the two girls. As a result, the fat man had a flower in front of him, and the wind and moon flew directly into his arms. Nafi went up to her shoulder. But now they are actually not too small, it is difficult to retract into the fat of the fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the windy moon at a very close distance and couldn’t help but feel a little dizzy. The wind and the moon seem to be the mind that grows up with the body, no longer the little girl who cares about nothing. She stared at the fat man, and she also stunned, and some did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small group of ice winds suddenly exploded in the hall, and the fat man was sullen. Fly backwards. When he was still in the air, he had a good body. Stop here in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wind is standing in the temple, the silver eyes are leaning to the side, it seems that some dare not look at the fat. On the surface, she was determined by Ningning, but she could grasp the clothes without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nafi has no scruples, sitting on Rogge's shoulders in a big model, a pair of long legs swinging around his chest, it is very proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s just a moment when you can’t tell the truth. Outside the hall, there was a sudden footstep. A church ran at full speed and bowed to Rogge. "The lord of the sacred church, the Cardinal of the Lille City Burke, came to the news and said that you are looking for The poets have been taken to the Cathedral of St. James, waiting for you to order." His tone is full of doubts, do not understand why Rogge will suddenly think of it to find a poet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty faintly: "Notify Bishop Burke. I am here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The church was ordered to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge looked at the windy month again, smiled and shook his head, and went to the temple first. Fengyue hanged his head slightly, silently following him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the fat man has been reminiscing about the time he once embraced, and his heart is quite emotional: "Feng Yue this guy... Well, it’s really good now. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is at this time. Nephie sitting on his shoulder seemed to feel something, and suddenly laughed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the bishop of Burke has been blessed, and his hair has fallen too much. Fortunately, the high crown of the Cardinal covers his shimmering bald head. Burke must have been white. The face is no longer the shrewd and brave. Instead, it is oily and flattering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Burke has only fourteen levels of bright mana, and many years have passed. His mana does not go backwards, I don’t know why it is the years, or the result of his self-destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge stared at the Cardinal Burke, and suddenly the past suddenly filled his heart. But these feelings passed like a breeze through his frozen heart, leaving no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge nodded slightly to Burke, faintly said: "Take me to meet the poets!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Burke promised, and smiled and said: "The noble Lord of the Church commanded, of course, I must do my best, now the poet in the entire Principality is a little famous. I have already invited me to come here! I will make you satisfied! Then, when I saw you at the beginning of the year, I was shocked by your talents and knew that you are not in the pool! No, you became the Lord of the Church when you were thirty, and you have never had it in the teaching history of the entire Bright Church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rog said nothing Hair, with two little girls, surrounded by forty churches, murdered to the front hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the cold reception, but on the way, Burke is still awkward, endless, tireless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man strode into the front hall of St. James Cathedral. At this moment, there are hundreds of poets gathered in the cathedral of thousands of believers. They seem to have waited for a long time, and many people should be reluctant to come. What Burke said in his mouth is please, but who knows how he brought so many poets here in such a short time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These poetry crowds are excited and noisy, one by one screaming at the anger of their hearts. Perhaps a poet will only wait in the hall, but a hundred poets feel that they have been able to fight the entire Knights. There are now four or five hundred poets in the hall, to see their momentum, and perhaps the glory of the gods when they created the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is an excellent opportunity to showcase talents, how can poets be willing to let go? So everyone straightened their necks and sighed with a sigh. It is really a spectacle to sing a poem to protest. The noisy thing is that Rogge has never been to the most lively market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the side door of the main hall opened, Rogge strode to the middle of the main hall, habitually looked up at the altar, seeing that the altar is neither supreme, nor di Smerson. So I went straight to the front of the altar. Burke has already inquired in detail about the various lords of the new sacred church, and sees the opportunity at the moment. Immediately moved a heavy chair and ran to the back of Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man snorted and sat down slowly. Forty churches immediately spread out and surrounded the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the situation is different, the poet’s boiling point is quickly cooled down, and the hall is silent in the blink of an eye. The angry poet’s passion has just vanished. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge glances for a week. Seeing that all the poets are watching him, this slowly said: "I am the owner of the current church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetry crowd immediately snorted In this war, the Church of Light directly participated in the war, and the name of the Church and the Holy Knights was spread all over the world. The poets talked for a while and quieted down, waiting for Rogge's following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time everyone is coming over, I want to invite you to do my best to learn. Everyone writes a few poems that praise the brilliant god Desmasen. We will Choose the best of the hymns from all of you, and include them in the church's hymns. The poets who created these poems will be recommended by me, and I will join the church and write the hymns. Well, the benefits of joining the bright church. I don’t think I need to say much. Anyway, it’s definitely better than what you think. Of course, if any of the hymns made is too far away from your past level, it’s a sin.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat threat and temptation of the fat red luo let the churches feel a frown, and the poets, except a few, have mostly eyes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the waiters entered the pen and paper, and hundreds of poets rushed to the top, grabbed the pen and paper, and scattered them all over the hall, thinking hard to meditate. A few high-level people looked at the swords of the church. Also do not pick up the pen and paper. I sighed and sighed and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment later, Rogge and Kate and Franco met in Helen again. This time, Fengyue and Naifa's eye-catching glare made them look good, especially Franco, and the gloomy face also showed appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge routinely lets Fengyue and Nafi wait next door. When he just sat down, Franco asked: "I heard that you recently ordered the search for poets around. Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said "It is to write more praises to the poems of the main god Desmasen, so that my men can have some new tricks when they pray. The holy poems of the church are unchanged for hundreds of years, and the gods of heaven must have been annoying. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dysmason? Why haven't I heard of such a god?" Franco asked doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "The existence of Dissmason is unknown, but his brilliance does not need to be questioned. As long as I can make him happy, no matter what What are the problems, the problems are not big. Those who want to use the opportunity of prayer to secretly sue me will find that they don’t say the Lord God, even the angels in front of the Lord Gods will not be interested in listening to what they say. This is called bullying. On the squat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco silently said, half a day before sighing: "Rog, I really don't know you at all."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man smiled and said: "In fact, I envy you. Some things, the more you know, the more painful you are. So you still know a little better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Kate picked up a long sword and pushed it from the table to Roger. He said, "I have already told you what you said to Mr. Prossis. He thought for a long time, and finally let me bring this sword to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge picked up the sword on the table and slowly pulled out half of it. Jing looked at the blue color of the blade, as well as star dust out of the little free. For a long time, he sighed heavily and stalked the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate frowned and asked: "Andre... No, Miss Androni, if it was really killed by Mrs. Catherine, then I see Mr. Prossis. The meaning is that I don’t plan to report this hatred.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge’s silence for a moment, faintly said: “Kate, please do me a favor. Go and tell Pro Sith, I said that I want to see him, ask him to go to the church, and visit the hundreds of inheritance of the Church of Light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the fat man I returned to the church early, and the piano was slightly puzzled. It seems that Rogge has nothing to do with this day. She immediately saw the fat man behind Nephie and the windy month. Immediately for their glory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge ignored her and went straight to her own hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piano lowered its head until Rogge disappeared into the temple door, and then he looked up and stared at the distant hall, all in his mind, Fengyue and Nephi The position and posture. Her heart suddenly tightened slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge left the wind and Nephi in the room, and entered the magic laboratory at the back of the hall alone. The sanctuary is specially prepared for him. The magic laboratory has three floors. There are all kinds of rare magic materials, and there are more than 50 magic apprentices and several templars to listen to Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat when pushing the magic lab door. A roar of noise came. The brilliance of the various colors in the laboratory came one after another, and the magicians shuttled around and kept on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge was very satisfied. He went straight through the lab hall to a small lab where he could only enter. There is only one magical array in the hall, and the energy of various attributes is being collected from the dozens of arrays of magic laboratories throughout the magic lab. In the middle of the magic array, there is a small group of extremely red flames that are beating weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger is staring at this small group of flames. The eyes slowly turned into silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a piece of flame tyrant Tang Ke Bakala’s soul shard that he rushed back from the space storm. Under the universal sky, perhaps only the Church of the Light Church will have such manpower and material resources, and consume a huge amount of magical materials that are hard to imagine, and slowly reinforce a piece of soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge slowly extended his hand to the soul fragments of Donk Bakkara. The small red flame jumped sharply and seemed to be full of fear for Rogge's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
