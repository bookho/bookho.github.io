			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a dream roll on the 12th anniversary of the day <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 12 Memorial Day<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting in the air, fighting incessantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, the war between the two major groups of the League and the Treaty has been going on for more than three months. In the initial series of battles, the two sides had each other's successes and losses, so the front line was correspondingly in a staggered trend, constantly stretching and extending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is now the only topic in the entire continent of the Terran nation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long southern border of the Dro Empire became the main front of the war. The terrain here is complex and it is the place to go. In the past few decades, this is the only way for trade and transportation. Therefore, the population is numerous and the towns are dotted with stars. It is a very prosperous and rich land. Naturally, it has now become a battleground for the two major groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it’s completely different. The commanders of the two major groups have taken the vast territory of the soldiers very seriously. The two sides have invested heavily in the military and cautiously tested the other’s intentions. At the same time, they have tried their best to reinforce the towns and even the villages. Stick to the fortress. In a few short months, the prosperous and fertile southern towns have become a military fortified and heavily guarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this battle of thousands of miles, every village and town fight, every fortress will change hands, at the expense of the lives of hundreds of soldiers. The intention of the Shenghui League is very obvious. They intend to drag the main force of the sacred agreement in the boring and cruel positional battle, like the meat grinder, slowly smashing the vitality of the sacred agreement. After all, the cavalry of the Asrofik Empire is famous all over the world. Even if the Bavarian Principality has an elite knight, there is still no confidence in resolving the opponent in a large-scale cavalry battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infantry of the Dro Empire is also very famous. The Emperor of Dro was old and stupid. But this does not prevent the empire from producing one or two outstanding generals. The tides of the Astrophy Empire and the two major regiments of Poseidon are no strangers to the positional battle. Therefore, on the main front, the two major groups are hard to find. As time goes on, there are more and more fortresses on the front line, and they are getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the main battle direction is not glued, the eyes of both sides naturally extend to both sides of the battle line. Most of them are small countries sandwiched between the two major groups. In the attitude towards these small countries, no matter whether it is the Shenghui League or the Holy Agreement, there is no difference. The two major groups may threaten to intimidate or directly send troops to occupy. In just a few months, except for a very small number of locations, it is actually a remote country and several overseas islands. All countries on the mainland were forcibly divided into camps and tied to the chariots of the two major groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tangible front can block the footsteps of ordinary warriors, but can't stop the strong guys who are out of the ghosts. These strong people can quietly mix into the enemy's heavy ground, or destroy, or assassinate. If the timing is right, they can even play a role that no big army can achieve. Only nowadays, the two major war groups are gathered together, even if they are the sanctuary. It is also very dangerous to go deep into the enemy territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of war, the three major industries of the thieves’ guild, the killer group and the mercenaries are beginning to flourish, but these dark world organizations are powerful, but Obviously it cannot be compared with the two war groups. Therefore, in the crisis of survival, many organizations have to join one of the two camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chaos, there are also maverick organizations. The organizations of these dark worlds are all powerful and exist in every corner of the mainland. For such organizations, there is nothing to do with the sacred agreement and the sacred alliance. After the war in March, the whole continent was counted. It is also able to maintain an independent dark world organization but only five or six. Among these organizations, the dark night dancers firmly occupy the status of the king of the dark world, and the new shadows rely on fierce and fierce means to annex many small guilds and killer groups, the scale is rapidly expanding, faintly challenging the dark night dancers dark throne The trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great people who like the power are like the troubled times, they like war more. Because in the age of war. In the name of victory, you can do many things that you can't do at all. But there are also people who don't like this war, and that is the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the power of the magician is too horrible, the two groups are strictly monitoring the magicians within their control, and immediately arrested when they are discovered . All magicians, even if they are just a magic apprentice, must make a choice, either to join the war or to die in prison. One side is glory, power, beauty, and the other side is hunger and black prison. Almost any sane wizard knows how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of the war. The sacred church Pope Rogge fully demonstrated the ruthless side of his iron fist. With the support of the powerful church, Rogge pushed religious persecution to a new height. In a short period of time, the Holy Church built hundreds of large and small churches and shrines within the control of the Holy Allies. The main function of these churches, besides developing local believers, is to persecute the original bright church believers and force them to change their faith. Therefore, in every large parish, an inquisition will be set up separately to inform the bright church members who are confirmed or suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Church has developed too fast. A trainee pastor three months ago is now likely to host a small church. He even has the right to organize a small armor to defend the church and fight the infidels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a regular clergy three months ago can work in a medium-sized city. The middle-level priesthood in those churches has also become very scarce. At least within the scope of the sacred agreement, there are already hundreds of large and small parishes, which is more than the sum of the middle-level clerics! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a young clergyman comes to the new district with a three-five entourage, arbitrarily occupying a big house, and hangs the emblem of the Holy Church at the door. The statue of the goddess who is working hard due to emergency work will be placed in the hall, and a regional church can be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such rapid expansion, the faculty members of the host side will inevitably be mixed. However, the gallows standing on the ground in Oshniiya made them dare not go too far, and they did not dare to act on the issue of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope Rogge was hidden in Oshnia’s Icewind Temple for half of the time. The other half of the time is in the various parishes. In every parish, there is a must-have program, that is, trial. Most of the people who were hung on the gallows were bright church believers who refused to change their faith. However, occasionally there were cases of derelict sacred church personnel floating on the gallows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the promotion of Rogge, the sacred treaty countries have declared the Church of Light to be illegal, and all believers in the Church of the Light need to change their faith within a limited time, otherwise they will Will be subject to a series of taxation and punishment measures in military service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge still seems to feel that the raging fire of this religious persecution is not burning too hard. Therefore, a lot of dry wood was added to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need for pity for those who are enemies of God. They have stolen the world that was originally a goddess believer. Their greed is endless. They should be punished! Everything they hold in their hands should belong to you, the great Aussie Rey, the true believer." In an open religious ceremony, Rogge said to the tens of thousands of believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His speech was quickly misinterpreted intentionally, and the sacred, ulterior sacred church believers began the mad persecution of believers in the bright church. At the same time, the size and aristocratic bureaucrats of various countries also took the opportunity to clean the political enemies. For a time, on the vast land of the sacred treaty. As long as you are accused of being a believer in the Church of Light, there will be life and worry in the whole family. Therefore, even if it is only to protect one's own small and small security, these civilians living at the bottom must also prove their belief position, prove that they are not believers in the Church of Light, or have turned to believe in the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every morning, Rogge will take a special half-hour to review the reports sent by locals about the extended believers and the bright church believers who hanged at the application office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of gallows needed is increasing, and finally one day. Even Robsky, who is responsible for sorting out these reports, can't stand it any more. He carefully advised Rogge: "Is there a lot of people killed by Rogge? If you provoke public anger in the war now. It is not good for the future situation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge put down the report in his hand and asked: "What do you think is the real reason for pushing this war? Can it be said that all the monarchs of the great nation are crazy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robsky quickly passed the grounds of all the wars in his heart. American Civil War? King power hegemony? Religious opposition? Among all the reasons. Only the last reason seems to be the least. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger looked at Robsky, as if he had seen through his mind and smiled and said: "This war will almost all human races." The country has all come in. If it is only for the territory and the population, even the big ambitions will not be crazy to this point. The real driving force of this war is the war between two different faiths. It is a wonderful thing. A religious person with a devout faith can ignore all the difficulties and obstacles in the world. They can't buy it, and they never give in. In addition to killing, can there be any better way to deal with them?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge sank a bit. Tao: "Those who are still maintaining the bright church until now, there is one we will kill one. It is better to kill. You can't let go. But what you said is also reasonable... This is good, you can inform Mora, let She looked at the people who had the most corruption in the church, picked them up and killed them, so the rest should know that they are a little more convergent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Luo Ge Daren.” Robsky withdrew the document and left the study. He did not understand why he must kill the believers of the Guangming Church, and even spurred the great danger of the people's change. This is the time when the small countries on the edge of the war turned out to be a small matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robersky left with anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s art!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the king city of Lille, Catherine flipped through her hands A thick report, while admiring. An elegant smile and sincere joy also gave her perfect face a faint glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco was sitting in the chair in front of her unusually large office desk. He has a dark black gold-tone dress and a little lace trim. Adding elegance and not showing vulgarity. From the expression to the costumes, he was meticulous, silently waiting for Catherine's instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Franco has been over thirty years old, and there are traces of some years in the forehead. His face is still handsome, his face smiles for a long time, but it is just because the blood is too heavy on his hands. He has no warm feeling in his eyes. Some are just cold and indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few minutes, Catherine read the dozens of pages of reports. She will push the report forward. To Franco: "You also come to see. Your past friend Rogge is now a big man. He is creating a mess, provoking people's hatred and opposition, and persecution." It is that I am sitting in his position, and it is impossible to expand the Holy Church faster. And he can always control the hatred and dissatisfaction of the people on the edge of the explosion, so that the situation will not get out of control. Right, I listen. Said that his magic is not bad. It seems that there is already a level of the big magister. It is rare!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco took the report and watched it at a very fast speed Finished, I put the report back and respectfully said: "He is really powerful, I am not as good as myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine picked up another report While flipping through it, he said: "You are also very good. In some respects, you are not worse than Rogge. He can have it today. In fact, luck accounts for a big factor. If you can sit in his current position. You must be able to do some business."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco is indifferent to Catherine’s compliments, just saying: “I am just a loyal dog in front of you, not interested in a higher position.”<br /><br />&nbsp C&L; smiled and said: "Even if it is a loyal dog, when the master's strength is not enough to suppress it. Maybe it will bite the master. But you can rest assured, Since your master is me, then you will never encounter such an opportunity to make your entire family annihilate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your kindness." "Franco stood up and succumbed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine’s attention returned to the report in his hand and waved to Franco. “You go back and prepare, we will go to the front line tomorrow. Turn, go and visit the soldiers who have worked hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franco has some doubts in his heart. Catherine has a lot of opportunities, and he is a prosecutor. He has to go to sleep late at night. Excessive labor has already numbed him. In this moment of the war. Both of them are busy scoring themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time do you go to the front line? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that Catherine has always been inscrutable, and every step must be useful. So I didn't ask too much, I silently quit the room and went back to prepare myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a thousand full-armed knights are guarding several carriages in the moonlight. In the carriage, Rogge is closing his eyes, and Froya is kneeling on his lap and sleeping deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a horn screaming outside the car, and the entire team stopped. The delicate face of the Bauhinia butterfly appeared in the window, whispering: "Roger is an adult, there is an ambush in front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The Bauhinia butterfly took the lead and sent a series of orders. One hundred ice temple warriors were half-slung, replaced with a light shield heavy axe, and the other half immediately loaded the steel arrow on the heavy raft. Several mages walked out of the carriage behind and climbed the roof. In the twinkling of an eye, these knights are ready to fight, the movements are fast, the actions are neat, and they are amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have sensed something, and Rogge’s eyes blinked, and Froya was gently placed on a thick cushion and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floria sleepy and loose, confused: "Dead fat, where are you going? Someone want to attack us? I can't feel anything." The powerful guys exist, let them kill." After the intermittent slang, she immediately fell into a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge turned back and carefully fixed the quilt of Froya, and then picked up a huge magic scroll in the carriage and walked out of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roger, you..." Seeing Rogge stepping down the carriage, the Bauhinia butterfly glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a guy in the ambush who is good, so I will help you. Fully attack, quick fix, don't waste time on the road." Rogge succinct The instructions were given underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road around the road is a horse, and the road is more than one meter high. Those who dare to ambush in this kind of terrain are thieves or killers who are good at hiding. See Rogge's team stopped. They also put out the format of the war preparations. These ambush people immediately knew that the whereabouts had been discovered, so they screamed and screamed. The dozens of killers under the cover of the long grass and the night, smashed back and smuggled them over to the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was short and intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves and killers who serve the Shenghui League obviously do not know the origins of this team. They have a large number of people and their skills are outstanding. There is indeed a reason to launch a storm on a team of 100 knights. It is a pity that they did not encounter ordinary knights, but hundreds of high-ranking ice temple warriors. The defensive power of thieves and killers is so fragile in the face of the mighty force of the Ice Warrior. It’s not easy to get rid of, and the close-range shots are not able to dodge. They are not holding long and short swords, they are daggers, and the thin and sharp blade is also useless in front of the heavy armor of the Ice Warrior. Moreover, the personal force and melee coordination of the Ice Warriors are far beyond the expectations of these killers, so the war situation has just opened and the sneak attackers have suffered heavy losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the height of the battle, Rogge unfolded the magic scroll in his hand. Just at the moment. Suddenly, a faint figure leaps in the deep grass near the road, and rushes to Rogge at a very fast speed. The murderousness of the moment has even caused several high-ranking ice temple warriors to change, subconsciously retreating. One step, giving the killer a way to the side of Rogge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden change did not alarm Rogge, he still looked at the scroll calmly, his mouth seems to be singing the start of the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡! In the hands of the killer, the dark blue shorts snorted and seemed to be excited about the blood that was about to be drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡! The magic scroll in the hands of Rogge also trembled softly. Suddenly opened a small mouth toward the end of the killer, a featherless short arrow like a sharp needle flew out like electricity, instantly immersed in the killer's chest, and flew out from her back, the speed is not slow, in a blink of an eye It disappeared into the night of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plop. The killer was planted at the foot of Rogge, and her hands and feet twitched involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trauma caused by the short arrow is heavy, but not enough to be fatal. However, the huge poison painted on the arrow has already disintegrated all the killers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggled to support her upper body and looked up, just in time to meet Rogge’s gaze. At this time her face towel has fallen off, and the beautiful face flashes a strange blue under the moonlight. That is a sign that the poison in the body has already occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge just had no warnings in that arrow, and the time angle of shooting was not bad, she couldn’t even do it. From the timing of this arrow alone, you can know that Rogge wants to kill her but it is a little effort. What's more, how can she think that such a mechanism would be hidden in the magic scroll that would have been destroyed once? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...very good. But...why use this method. Don't you... kill me with the true ability?" The killer was hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogge dropped such a sentence. Just set foot on the carriage. The team re-started and galloped to O'Hisnia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer keeps looking up. She has already stopped breathing, and her still-stained eyes have been dyed blue by the poison in her body. Accompanied by her, there are dozens of companions with broken bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few thieves and killer organizations that are employed by one of them and are active in the other’s territory. These organizations tend to group actions, a group of main attacks, and a group of counterparts. It’s just that the poison used on Rogge’s short arrow comes from the hand of Froja, and the haze is far from being comparable to the general poison. If the colleague who died of the killer wants to bury their body, as soon as they touch her body, they will be poisoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, O'Shinia finally appeared in the morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger’s carriage drove directly to the main entrance of the Icewind Great Temple, which stopped. Rogge walked down the carriage and strode into the temple. Along the way, believers and clergymen continued to salute him. Rogge looked holy, but nodded slightly, and his feet were not slow. He walked into the back of the Great Temple under the embrace of the Ice Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in the back of the hall for a while, and finally walked into the room belonging to the rose. Rose is lying on the bed, when the cold is cold, the face of the iceberg can't keep sweat, and it will always frown in pain. Seeing that Rogge came in, she barely smiled, and then it was a painful embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mer, how are you feeling?" Rogge held her hand and asked gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should be... soon..." Rose gasped, and suddenly a painful embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid next to him met and went forward: "The noble pope, Miss Mei is about to be born soon, please ask for it first."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rog nodded, walked out of the room and waited outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man would have to go back to O'Siyah in a few parishes in the south, but suddenly there was an urgent report that will be produced by Rose. Rogge was taken aback by the big deal. Because according to common sense, Mei has only five months of pregnancy at this moment, and at least three months is the normal production period. However, when I think of the rare vitality of the little guy in the belly of the rose, it seems that it is normal to be born early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Rogge immediately ordered the team to turn around and went straight back to O'Siyah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogge did not wait for a long time, I heard a baby crying in the room. His heart, which has become cold as ice, can't help but sway, it is a favorite of his own flesh and blood. The fat man gently pushed open the door and walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid handed a baby to Rogge and smiled and said: "Respected Rogge, congratulations, you have a beautiful daughter." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daughter?" Rogge took a trip. He clearly felt that the child in the belly of the rose was a boy. How did he suddenly become a daughter when he was born? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the baby carefully, yes, this is a girl, and the girl’s body is indeed his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly, the room suddenly fell into absolute darkness, this dark world is empty, only Rogge and his little daughter in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the baby girl holding in Rogge’s arms at the moment doesn’t know when it has become a very beautiful little girl. She was staring at Rogge, her mouth sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the beautiful unparalleled little girl in her arms, Rogge’s hands trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the little girl’s eyes are as clear as the emerald green! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rogue Master! Rogge!" and called to bring Rogge back to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a renewed light around, the little girl had disappeared, and Rogge was holding a newborn baby girl. She was beautiful and lovely, not crying, but smiling sweetly at Rogge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
