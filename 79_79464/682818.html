On the way back, Du Lin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was calmly evading all the questions that should not be answered and what should not be said at the time of the trial, but this does not mean that he can rely on himself to complete Trial and defense work. Professional things should be done by professional people. This is what Du Lin learned in his dreams. Lawyers know more about the value and loopholes of each legal clause than he knows, and know how to use the mouth to persuade those who have no culture. member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already contacted Kevin, and Kevin introduced him to a lawyer who works at Orodo, a very powerful one. Of course, Kevin said that he is a little worse than himself, but some places are a little higher than himself. The difference is the skill, the higher is the cost, the cost of one hundred blocks per hour and the agency fee of three thousand is indeed a little higher than Kevin. Du Lin also hopes that he can afford his price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he can't, he will go back to hell to see Pluto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After calculating the time, this guy should have arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason took his handcuffs and took him forward. He had to wear ankles according to the evidence collected in the police station and the charges against Du Lin. Fortunately, the management of the police station is flexible enough and "humanized", so there is no such thing on his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The application has been sent, you can see your lawyer at around 9:00 am tomorrow, you have thirty minutes." This sentence Mason endured forbearance, and finally did not hold back, continued: "I don't know if I am crazy, there is never more than one hundred pieces of cash in Dad's treasure, and now you ask a lawyer for an hour. It costs a hundred yuan, and you need to pay another 3,000 agent fees. It’s really crazy!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Mason’s three views are also subject to The violent impact, when I was in the country, I was able to get very, and the 20th was happy, just like the New Year. It is said that the woman in the town is fifty in the evening and thirty-five in the old. Mr. Xmas's "treasure" - the small iron box contains some money, not much money, never more than one hundred, which the whole family knows, only Mr. Kemas thinks that everyone does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at it now, here, every morning, when the eyes open, you start spending money until you sleep. Sometimes Mason is skeptical. If you go to a more prosperous place like the capital, will you even have to breathe money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this possibility, each person is only allowed to breathe freely fresh air every day, more than one penny per mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is the illusion and fear of an old hat against the metropolis, and it doesn't mean anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has a contradiction and conflict perception of the concept of money, money should be very precious, many people will earn 10 yuan a month There are three or fifty high and middle class. But on the first day of his arrival, Du Lin gave him a sum of money and let him decide what he should do, but he must spend all of it in a month. So he and the police officers who are willing to stand on their side in the branch have spent a long time corrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcohol, cigarettes, women, and even the land they have tried. He already felt that he was extravagant and wasted, but he asked for a lawyer... please forgive him for his ignorance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer is indeed a very expensive move, but can get different explanations from different angles. In Doolin, it seems that asking a lawyer is not a waste of money, but buying money with money. No matter how confident before the trial, it is necessary to rely on the jury and the district judge to decide whether he is guilty and how many years he should go to jail. Not asking a good lawyer is indeed very cost-effective. In the city of Tener, there are ten 20 blocks in one hour, and lawyers with agency fees of only one hundred are everywhere. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can’t help Du Lin minimize his or her “prison” x-day tour, only those lawyers who need to spend a lot of money can do it. at this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in fact, asking a lawyer is equal to using money to buy a shortened sentence, so it is worthwhile, which is why Kevin can eat incense. This damn "devil spokesperson" can always do what he should do unexpectedly, sometimes over-completion, provided that you must let him "eat". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned to the cage, when the iron door’s friction sounded, the original noisy cage suddenly became quiet, like the subjects Waiting for their king's arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow I will let people bring in the stove, and I think if you don't need it, you should let your men do the best." Mason untied Du Lin's handcuffs and couldn't help but swear. "You died four on the first day. Although I am not managing here, it is still very difficult to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his wrist and turned The smile said: "They won't!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four dead still can't understand the current situation, but also ran to death, that is, that person is damned, no one can stop it. Du Lin believes that people who are still alive should not be too stupid. They are all "social elites"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When turning around, the Buddha has already greeted him. After the group of people guarded Du Lin back to the room, they all asked: "Return Is it smooth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took off his coat, wrapped himself in a new quilt, wrapped it tightly, and satisfied the two screams, "Follow Before our plan came, there would be no problems." He turned over and put the last quilt completely under his body. "Be careful with the interrogator, don't say what you shouldn't say, don't be nervous, this Everything is just a game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This damn weather makes the quilt feel wet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the complaint, Du Lin fell asleep. When he woke up, it was already the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelvin introduced the lawyer as a date, a very spiritual "young man", probably in his thirties, a decent suit, very neat and tidy, The lawyer's badge on the chest is shiny. He can feel his strength when shaking hands with Doolin, and he should look like a guy who can afford his high salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, I want to ask you something before we talk." He opened his notebook with a smile and took out the pen. "The police station has all the charges against you. Do you think you are guilty?", saying that he laughed twice. "I am a ethical lawyer. I will never disclose any employer's information and the content of the conversation. This is The law gives me the power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "I am not guilty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When the lawyer took a table, suddenly the action scared Du Lin, and his eyebrows shook. The guy said, "It’s good, it’s this attitude. I believe that any of my employers is innocent. They are all sinless. All the accusations are shameless and despicable. Then we have a few questions to solve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this lawyer, As well as communicating with him, Doolin gradually understood why Kevin would let him spend such money to ask him because of his connections. In addition to the very high professionalism, the lawyer industry needs to have excellent persuasion and public relations skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ten-hour, one-hour lawyer may know one or two court staff who are not very eye-catching, and a fifty-one-hour lawyer may be with the police chief or the court The judge has a little connection, then a hundred-hour lawyer, maybe the judge is his father! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This money is worth a lot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the 3,000-Mr. told Doolin, as long as he asked for an appeal after the trial of the Trinell District Court, he had a way to go thoroughly in the state court. Wash away these allegations and charges on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, you also need to spend more money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very reliable lawyer, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the attention of the mayor, there is a perfect script, and the performance of this scene is much faster than imagined. It took less than five days to start the first trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Du Lin’s first time in this life to participate in the trial. Before the trial, Du Lin made the final request to Mr. 3,000. - He needs a shit, let him and his people go to jail for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the trial, everything was arranged as the script, Du Lin calmly looked at one after another allegations were denied, and the ignorant citizens of the hearing were constantly Exclaiming, just as Doolin thought that everything was over, suddenly the prosecutor asked to summon a witness who was not in the plan and presented a testimony not in the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin frowned, and Mr. 3,000 was also inexplicable because the witness and testimony were not on the agenda of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
