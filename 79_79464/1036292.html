			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s words did not receive the results he wanted, and Alisa looked at him silently, her eyes barely and prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching the two for a moment, Alisa shook her head and said in a very firm tone, "This is not the child of anyone else, this is me." Child, mine, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s mouth smirked. "I have no other meaning, just ask casually, on We met at the Tener Regional Police. I remember when you said that you didn’t see what the robbers who attacked the bank looked like, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alisa found the memory in her mind. Du Lin got some of the contents of the security system in the bank by interacting with her, so that she could break through the bank almost perfectly with the help of some methods that would not be known to outsiders. There is no shortage of vaults, and it has stolen the gold that has just been sent for 30 million. Originally she could testify to the robbers and even tell them what they looked like, but when she found out that Du Lin was one of them, she flinched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She decided to lie for two reasons. The first reason was that she provided Doolin with a lot of key information, whether it was deliberately revealed. It is still impossible to change the fact that it was taken out in some special circumstances. She provided very important information for the gang of robbers. Once she has accused Du Lin, Du Lin will certainly tell the things she has done, and she may face jail time by then. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial central bank’s overbearing Alisa is very clear that they don’t care if the suspects have actually done anything that is detrimental to the interests of the imperial central bank, as long as they are Suspects, then in the eyes of the high level of the imperial central bank, these people must be criminals. Only by letting these criminals get the proper end will they be able to warn more people and not to attack the idea of ​​the imperial central bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is because she still had an idea at the time, maybe Du Lin had a hard time, he might be coerced to participate in such a case in. Girls who treat the first person who takes away their most precious things often have tolerance and tolerance that men can never understand. She felt that after experiencing these things, Du Lin would come back to find herself and then fight for her forgiveness, but in fact Du Lin disappeared and never thought of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not happened in Irian, maybe she won’t see Du Lin for the second time in her life...not right, I’ll see it in the newspaper later. Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driven by these two reasons, Alisa made a testimony that was worthless to the progress of the case. She denied seeing Du Lin and denied that she saw Du Lin when the robbery occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa has a tight heart, she snorted, and a hand pressed subconsciously on her raised belly. This little gesture made Amp's eyes slightly stunned, and he already knew the answer. At that time, Alisa saw Du Lin, one of the robbers of the Golden Robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, when a person’s lies are exposed, there are two situations. The thicker skin will be awkward, but the thicker liar will find a way. Resolve these flaws and give new lies in an attempt to cover up the facts of lying. Another situation is to make the liar feel nervous and insecure. As a woman, Alisa, when Amp directly pierced her lies, her first move was to put her hand on her stomach. This is not because she felt that her stomach was too big and she felt very elastic, but she After being mistaken by someone, I was afraid that Amp would hurt her child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is protecting her child because she made a mistake and was debunked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa doesn't know what's wrong with her movements. She made a calm smile and said twice, "Mr. Amper, your imagination is really rich. I didn't see anyone at the time. I was uncomfortable and left early. I didn't pay attention to who is the robber who is not a robber." This testimony is the same as what she did at Turner at the time. Because the indifference and tyranny in Doolin's eyes scared the little girl, and then ran back home with a cry of sadness, which happened to be the key point in her testimony to prove that she didn't know anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows if she really saw the face of the robbers. After all, the robbery happened after Alisa left, so no one continued to chase this. There is another reason for the line to go, and Alisa’s father is an official of the Ordos State Government. But now, Amp thinks he has discovered the facts, and he suddenly screams, "You lie, you are hiding the truth of Doolin is a robber!" "This sudden roar made Alisa stunned. Her eyes became a bit timid, a little shy, and dare not look directly at Amp." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp stood up, he walked back and forth a few steps, his eyes staring fiercely at Alisa. "You lied, Alisa, you know Who is a robber, Du Lin, right? No matter what kind of considerations at the time did not provide such an important clue, now is an opportunity for you to recover your crimes. As long as you can make testimony that tends to Doolin’s crime, I am able to make a guarantee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guarantee that neither you nor your child will be implicated in this matter, and that when Doolin is in jail, all his property acquired through formal channels will be owned by you and your children."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you still have a lucky attitude and firmly deny the fact that Du Lin is guilty, when I got enough evidence from other places to plead guilty, Alisa You may spend a long time in jail. According to imperial law, the case involves more than one million, which is enough for the accomplice to stay in prison for twenty to fifty years, if you don't want your child to When you are born, you lose your father and mother, and you become a child of the criminals who laugh at the classmates. You are better off making testimonies that are conducive to the promotion of the case!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not Just kidding, Alisa, the opportunity is here, if you can't grasp it, maybe you will regret it forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp closed his mouth and watched Alisa, who is silent and bows her head, turns to the door, "I will People send a piece of food, I hope that before we meet next time, you should think about it and make a decision. The mistake between adults, don’t let a clean and innocent child bear it, it’s unfair to him. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he pushed the door out and told the guard outside the door to go in and look at Alisa, don't let her surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the phone in Doolin’s villa rang, and Dove walked into the living room and made a phone call. Du Lin smiled and showed the guests. They sinned and quickly stood up and went to the study. He answered the phone in the study, the phone came from Irian, and he asked Dove to close the door of the study before making a phone call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, operator No. 2 is at your service, Do you want to order now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin thought of the line 2 and his call from the previous line, the person who has been tracing him invites the tower. Mr. Kss returned to the empire and again investigated the inside story of his jewellery store in the early days of Irian. Du Lin is also very clear that this person's idea is the same as that of Amp. He wants to find his loophole from the big gold robbery of TNell. Now both Mr. Tucks and Line 2 have returned to the empire, and indeed it is It’s time to close the net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little thought, he said, "I will personally discuss with Ms. Sophia. You will contact her to confirm the menu at night and let her provide the cooks that I need to use this evening. I have some guests here. I can send the dishes to me. If the guests can't go to the banquet, they will dump things and the lights will be turned off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good sir, I understand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, Du Lin called the phone of Ms. Sophia's private residence. It is already five o'clock. Sophia doesn't like the excitement. She will definitely be there. Home. The phone was quickly answered, and Du Lin guessed that there was nothing wrong with it. Ms. Sophia was dining at home and she was very happy to receive a call from Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I need to do? You haven’t called me for a long time. It seems that my old woman doesn’t like young people like you. You are like this, my daughter is like this, it is really sentimental!", Ms. Sophia's tone is very relaxed, this is just a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and said that after two sentences, he said that "I need you to do something for me, from your side or in the meeting." Find ten good-looking cooks, and someone will contact you later. Someone will provide a menu for the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia eagerly asks Tao, "Do you need more people? I can transfer no less than 50 veterans anytime, anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said, Sophia’s development in Montreux surprised everyone. If it wasn’t for Doolin’s request that she leave some markets for others, don’t block other people’s lives, I’m afraid all the bars in Monterrey are for sale. All are Doolin's private wine. Sophia was originally a very ordinary woman. After her husband died, she was able to support her children, and she took out the extra money to help the poor Guar. If she had to find her, she could do her best to help others. Good is like a saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the help of Doolin, she turned into a queen under the night of Montreux, a gang member and enemy who died directly or indirectly in her hands More than 300 people, even a lot of Monter's social celebrities must be gracious to her, this is a bloody queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't need so many people, it's just an ordinary dinner, if it raises some attention..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
