			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time in front of Mason is a car with a canvas, from the outline of this covered car, it is absolutely impossible It is a cheap car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those high-end cars that are so expensive that people can only sigh and despair will have some unconventional shapes. Obviously this car is one of them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason doesn’t know the car, but he knows the guy in the cart. This guy has known him for 17 or 8 years and is the postal staff in the town. And the only postal staff. The reason why I can remember this guy is probably that every day he will ride a bicycle in the town and tell you that there is no letter written to them in the post office, and there is no ticket. This is a very boring, sometimes very interesting person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you here?", Mason looked at the postman like a sly, and it was hard to imagine what he had experienced before he could become this. The appearance. The curled hair sticks together, as if there are a lot of things crawling inside and there are some grass leaves or something else that is not easy to notice. There was only one piece of canvas clothes that was very worn out on his body, and he shivered in the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held his arms, a slightly blueish face with a touch of warm color, "Du Lin... let me... give this car to you In the hands, Mr. Mason.", said that he also patted the car around him, and took off the canvas, revealing a smooth car without a trace of scratches and dust, sparkling. The only thing that regrets is that the wheels of this car are mad and the wear is very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason immediately invited him to the police station and made people get a set of clothes and warm milk for him. Then he told me the story of his own for half a year. Mason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is no story, very boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked him to drive the car to Mason, and then Mason decided to keep himself or send it to the town to Mr. Xema, so The postman was very responsible to drive from the city of Irian, with the goal of the most northwestern city of Tener, spanning thousands of kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, including Dooling, forgot one thing - replenishment, and the possible failures and necessary maintenance costs of the vehicle during the long distance. When the car opened seven or eight hundred kilometers, there was a problem. A tire was pressed into a nail and it was mad. The postman made up his tires and wrapped the tires. Before he left, Doolin gave him some money, which was quickly spent on the next journey, such as continuing to repair the tires, replacing the power cabin, buying catalysts and crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he drove the car to the middle of the empire, it was unfortunate that the car was broken. If the little money left was used for repairing the car, I am afraid I could not support him to drive the car back, so he chose another one. The way to bring the car back, that is push. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bought a piece of canvas to cover the car, avoiding things like rubbing and hurting the body, and he will be in the car when the weather is cold. Sleeping, the feeling of adding a layer of canvas is absolutely different. In this way, he said his experience as if he were telling a legend, which made Mason feel that his brain might be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why...I mean why don't you call me or the town?", if he can make a call, no matter who picks up the phone, Can avoid a lot of things and troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postman was silent for a moment. "Sorry, I don't know your call. As for the town... Is there a phone on the town?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Mason, who has already had some standards, suddenly think of a sentiment. Sometimes the wealth that can't be afforded is not a good thing for a person, but can only become a heavy burden. There is no doubt that if Du Lin gave him something that is worthless, maybe he gave up long ago, but this is a luxury car, a luxury car he can't afford, plus his inexplicable responsibility. The heart finally forced him to complete a journey like a legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was a little silent, Mason didn't know how to open it, but a police officer saved him and said that someone would find him and let him go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason took out two hundred pieces and handed it to the postman, and held his hand tightly. "This car is very important to me, more important." What is your responsibility is very touching. Now what this society lacks is the perseverance that can continue to do one thing. This is a little reward, you must accept it, you know, I still have something... ...", the postman said that he had no problem, Mason only thanked and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked to the lobby on the first floor, a woman with a mask immediately looked at him, which also made him know who was looking for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the director of the Tenel City Regional Police Department, Mason. Is there anything I can help you?", Mason is very polite, he No one is proud of being a director. Children who grow up in the country always know how to be awe and polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman wearing a mask is very... cold, there is a kind of arrogance that can't be said, just like when I was a child, I saw the businessmen who bought it in the town. The merchants always cover the nose with a handkerchief, just like the air in the country is different from the air in the city. They always look down on everyone with a high-headed look, and the eyes are still low with a red fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this woman, Mason felt the arrogant attitude, but he did not show any plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are the military, this is my ID.", the woman showed her identification, the name column above wrote Lily, she is very I quickly collected the documents. "For us to move out a vacant room, we need to check some things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare to use the military officer’s card at the police station is not a madman It’s a fool. It seems that this group of people is not fake. Especially the woman’s eyes behind the mask reveals a kind of disdain. This is really no way to lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason quickly took them to the conference room. If there is no limit to the deadline, the task in the police station is basically empty. Lily’s woman asked her two men to sort it out and asked: “Ziqi Town is also within the jurisdiction of the Tenel Regional Police Department. Is there any information on the town?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this masked woman is Anna. Last time she couldn’t help but go to Zizhen Town, she didn’t find any useful clues. At the same time, she had a feeling that she seemed to be alarmed. Some people in the town. So she can't go anymore. If there is no evidence to catch people directly, those people will probably run away. This is something she is not allowed to happen. After catching up for so many years, I finally got a clue that she didn't allow herself to fail. Therefore, she was seconded by this amp, and she had no chance to go to the Tenel Regional Police Station. She got the information of the residents in Zizhen Town, whether she could find Mr. Ke Ma, absolutely It is not useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason reacted very quickly, his face was quietly nodding, and he should continue, "Yes, there must be. Zizhen Town is indeed in ours." What information do you want in the jurisdiction? Or all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna took a deep breath and found a chair to sit down, "All!" <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason left the room and told several policewomen to move all the information of Ziwei Town and return to their office. He was going to make a phone call to Mr. Xerma. He didn't expect the postman to be still there. After watching the two for a moment, the postman just took half a cup of hot milk and said goodbye to Mason. After closing the door, he was silent for more than ten seconds, then made a phone call and dialed the number in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
