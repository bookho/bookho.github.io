			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the manager's business prepared?" Du Lin pointed to the two chairs across the table, indicating that they were sitting down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert and Ivan are honestly sitting opposite Du Lin, even though Du Lin’s age is only half or even one third of them, they Can not violate the will of this young man. This has nothing to do with respect for esteem and has a relationship with the status of wealth. Under the era of rapid expansion of capitalism, the more people who struggle to survive in developed cities, the more they understand the importance and significance of their own values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked what Albert was responsible for. He immediately took out his list and some documents in front of Doolin. The company has already registered, and the same company as other cities is not registered in the official organization, but in the Ianan branch of the Chamber of Commerce. It is said that Magus intends to take back this authority, but it has been strongly resisted by all parties and can only be given up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he is compromised or temporarily put on hold, it’s hard to say. Magus is a very wise, calm and politician who can use whatever he can to achieve his goals. Even his son's death has been written by him. A group of businessmen opposed his opinions could not stop his determination to execute, he was just looking for opportunities. Once he has found an opportunity, he will never leave any feelings and slashes, and he will not receive blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin first looked at the list provided by Albert, which basically listed the talents needed by a manager company, including some that Dulin himself did not consider. Talent, such as accounting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of accounting in the current society has not yet been taken seriously by people. Only listed companies that are listed on the market need to have accounting, and there are no mandatory requirements for those private companies. But Albert still absorbed a newcomer who has been in the accounting industry for five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not express his position and put down the information of these members, and turned to other documents. Among them, Du Lin is 70% of the company's shares, Albert is 10%, and Evan is 5%. He shook his hand and looked at Albert, and Albert explained it immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The remaining fifteen percent I want to use as an incentive share. If someone is exceptionally good, give him a share and let him become the company. Partners. Only in this way can they motivate them to work harder for the company and contribute to you.” The incentive to buy shares is nothing new, and the capitalists have already achieved the potential to squeeze people's potential to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to put forward this idea and implement the financial tycoons on Xie Lisi Street, they gave very good conditions to their economic agents, including through hard work to create better performance to get this part of the shares, Become a partner of the company. This method has greatly stimulated the "elite" on the streets of Xie Lisi who are carrying the cheapest bread every day, drinking free drinks from the company, and constantly fighting for the company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that this method is very effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and put the file down. "I don't mean the stocks left, but I think my equity is too much. Al. Burt, this is your company, I am just a shareholder.", Albert seems to want to say something, but Doolin raised his hand to stop him. "My investment does not mean that I must control this company, If I control this company, this company may only be able to serve me alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then I make it impossible for you to build this company because I can Hire you directly. And what I need you to do now is to serve me as much as possible, to improve the value of the company through work, to complete your own life planning and to benefit my investment. This is not a complicated matter. , right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not deceiving Albert, this is his real thought. A manager company can't bring much profit to Doolin. Maybe some managers do a good job, but how many years have those companies been there? If he came to control and control the company, he could not put all his energy on the company. Secondly, the various personnel in the company would not work hard. This is not his original intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give Albert a chance to let him and his employees do their best to better serve themselves. This is Du Lin. What is needed. And there are shares in, there is today's sentiment, Albert will not betray him, but will better provide him with services to prove his value. If one day Albert feels that he doesn't want to do it here, or if he doesn't want to serve Du Lin, he is also tempted to sell Du Lin's profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Doolin controls the company, he can’t stop him or even speed up his reverse behavior, because his previous efforts were not for himself. But for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert was a little excited, he rubbed his fist against his eyebrows, so that he could relax and take a copy of the text on Doolin’s desk. Up, "My parents have given me the power to come to this world. Teacher Ivan taught me how to face the world...", his eyes flashed with some light and looked at Du Lin, sincerely lowered. Head, "And you gave me the most important thing in my life, my dream!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss..., Mr. Doolin, I thank you. Please contact me whenever you need it, anytime!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my commitment to you ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan sighed deeply at the side, as a former salesman with a wealth of social experience, he has seen too many people and thing. I have to say that Doolin is not old enough, but among the people I have seen in Ivan these years, it is definitely the best one. He and Albert actually know the purpose of Doolin's doing, but they can't refuse to accept the kindness and humanity from Doolin, only to get caught up in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is the difference between a successful person and someone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and accepted Albert’s “loyalty”. He raised his hand and let Albert sit back. “Grateful words will stay later. I need to set up a company. You can help me to register. The name is called 'Irian Star'. It mainly provides video playback and movie-related service provision. I personally fund it. The specific cost is implemented according to the company's regulations. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert recorded all the words Du Lin said in the small book, and he nodded hard. "I will do it in the afternoon. I will send you the relevant certificate tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Ivan by the way, and Ivan’s performance at the auction site was very exciting. More than Du Lin’s expectations for him. At the auction site, Ivan played an investor from other cities, helping Du Lin to raise the price of almost 100,000. His expression is in place, and there is still a slight refusal in some hesitations, successfully sending the price to the price of 820,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan, one of the investors in East Coast Entertainment, also received some compensation from the spill price, he originally intended to send the compensation to Du Lin, but Du Lin decided to continue giving him a chance to act and let him play another role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the investment compensation money, even if it is paid for him. Doolin knows very well what these people in the bottom of society need. They don't need care, they don't need justice, they don't need justice, they don't need what people think is meaningful. They only need money, more money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin fiddled with the pen inserted in the ink bottle, then looked at Ivan and said: "In this time you go to find a more ceremonial company Learn the attitudes and instruments of the upper class, including meals, travel, communication, etc. All expenses are covered with proof of receipt to me for reimbursement. I will give you a month to complete the task. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
