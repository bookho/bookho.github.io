			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men and women who walked in the park gave the girl a feeling that she had never experienced before, that is peace and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aristocrat, she has seen many lively banquets, dances and other activities. Her excitement at this moment is not in her previous life. The excitement is a kind of peaceful and lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are passers-by who walk in the evening. She can’t call out the name of any of them. These people may have nobles or more civilians. They didn't have any rude behaviors, and each person's face showed a friendly smile, which seemed different from the adults and the civilians in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their wearing, their accessories, the expression on their faces and the relaxed pace, they are very satisfied with their current life, although there are many people in the park. But no one will bother her and him, they are clearly around her, but they did not interfere with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is never realized in some private gardens, where there may be some fine gardening, with flowers that bloom in all seasons. Everything is beautiful, but it is deserted. Except for one or two people or three or five people, there will be no more people. It is like a small castle that separates things inside the castle from the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go to the Royal College in the second half of the year, will it be the same here?", the girl soon found her interest in the ten Before the age of seven, she had been receiving elite education in the family estate, which is what the middle class often said in envious tone. More than a dozen well-known scholars in society, who teach one or several children alone. education. Coupled with some of the ideas that family members instill in them, this is the elite education of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Royal Academy, in a sense, it is like gold plating, even the nobility can not be independent of the trend, the current society is very knowledgeable and The school, and the students of the Royal Academy itself are a resource, a resource that students can master. The normal classes of the Royal Academy are aristocratic members. They come from different families. The contacts they meet in the college are not family resources. This is why young aristocrats are willing to go to school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, or resources, are always the most missing things for every nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment, holding the little girl's hand to the side of the bench, the little girl struggled for a few times without breaking free, and her face was slightly lowered, and Du Lin pulled her hand and stepped forward. I don't know if the sunset is too beautiful, or the girl's shame is too tempting. The girl's face is like the most pink peach. It is just a little mature. Under the fine fluff, it is a healthy and rosy pink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two sat on the bench, Doolin did not let go of the girl’s hand and said with a smile, “The Royal Academy is a very interesting place, There you can get a lot of new things, especially some science subjects, they will let you see very interesting experiments, it is a rare experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "As for students, there are very many, and there are almost three to seven hundred people at every age."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl showed some surprised faces, "So many..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a few special talents are open, and more and more wealthy people in the empire want to send their children. Entering the aristocratic college to accept the influence of the aristocratic atmosphere, it would be better if you could meet a few aristocratic friends. Under this kind of consciousness, more and more rich people are willing to pay a high price to send the child to go to the one that may not be able to learn anything at all. School. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has also created a very special phenomenon. Some aristocratic students are full of discrimination against those who come in, including some teachers who have this prejudice. I feel that these people have polluted the learning environment of the Royal Academy, and the highest knowledge hall of the empire is full of copper smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some aristocratic students who have a good relationship with special talent classes. They are willing to use their aristocratic status to recruit some rich followers. These people will For them to spend every penny in their pockets just to make them more comfortable. After they have inherited certain industries from their homes in adulthood, these students can also be their helpers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is definitely not a pure land. Some of the students in the family have actually come into contact with a more real society before they enter, so it is definitely not pure land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the students who really got the invitation to enter the Royal College with their own personal abilities, there are actually not many people who actually go to school. They all hold different purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say this, the real students actually don’t have the purpose of learning. If you learn more knowledge and get a diploma, you can get a better job, and you will be among the middle class and even the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked about the boundless topic while enjoying the last touch of sunshine. When the day began to darken, the girl suddenly said, "I thought you would be a Very old-fashioned people, in fact, you are much more interesting than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked a brow and said, "Why is there such a thing?" Idea?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl wants to laugh when she thinks about the impression she left when she first saw Doolin. “I saw you and Uncle Magus that day. When I was sitting together, I almost ignored your age. I feel that you can talk very well. There are not many people who can sit and chat with Uncle Magus in the family. I think your age may be even more. Bigger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Du Lin is nine years older than a girl. In some people’s words, he is a scum, and he can compare himself to such a young age. When a girl starts, it can be a problem of marriage in the eyes of the nobility, and it is even more impossible to obstruct the marriage. In history, some princes and ministers are forty or fifty years old. My wife died in various accidents. I still don’t want to marry those girls who are only ten or twenty years old to become their wives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of politics and wealth can never be expressed in age, whether it is good or bad, if Dulin is young and discriminates against his influence, The guy who made such a stupid mistake will definitely be miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although for the girl, he is a little bigger, just a little... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin continued to play with the girl’s hand, and the girl seemed to get used to him. “Lord Magus is a good person, I need to thank him...” Looking at the girl's confused eyes, Du Lin said with a very subtle smile. "He helped me a lot and helped me find a beloved girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Once I was asked, will my conscience hurt when I squint and say something? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Du Lin asked himself after the question, no! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
