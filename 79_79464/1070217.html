			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital games are a must-have for capitalists to grow themselves in a free economic market, defeating all business opponents and gaining the fruits of victory through legal means, in the business economy It is very normal behavior. Although many times it may be too cold-blooded emotionally, this is the world, the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After holding more than 53% of the shares of the South Bank and the Imperial Bank, they are able to get the Western Insurance Company into a bankruptcy protection sequence anytime, anywhere. Never overestimate the morality of businessmen, and do not underestimate their shamelessness, otherwise they will become a helpless loser like Mr. Jackson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He not only lost a chance to take off, but also put a large amount of debt, then declared bankruptcy protection, and finally accepted the bank’s liquidation and liquidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he doesn’t play in another way, he wants to vote for Doolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jackson’s rebellion made Du Lin breathe a sigh of relief, and Mr. Jackson became a war when he and the Queen refused to participate in the insurance business. A key part. It is only necessary to simply connect some details together. He has already thought about how to get the insurance company under the Southern Commercial Bank in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a southern business, it’s an insurance company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think your friends have reliable people?" Du Lin opened the next page and kept looking down at the newspaper. Did not look to Mr. Jackson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jackson shook his head. "I don't know who to trust, who should not believe, some of them are ready to fall to one side, and some are Hesitate, but it is possible that they have made a decision, but it has only been manifested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and stacked the newspapers and stood. Get up, "I understand, go contact them, try to persuade them to stand with you, things will soon turn around!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and left Not long after, Mr. Jackson also stood up and chose to leave in the opposite direction. Dooling is not to guard against the official who is stalking him. He does not commit any crimes now. He is not afraid of being stalked. He has to guard against the possibility that two people may send people to choose a place with dense traffic. Obviously a very good choice, just a few minutes will not make people realize what happened, if someone is actually tracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the current situation, it seems that the insurance companies established by the two major banks have steadily eaten Western insurance companies and Mr. Jackson and other retail investors. They arranged a very scary business trap for these businessmen who wanted to gamble on a tomorrow with their contracts. This time they dig into a pit, an abyss that leads directly to hell. Dooling’s brain is starting to get active. If he doesn’t guess wrong, once the insurance business is determined to create good benefits and the risks are not as big as they think, there will be seven bankrupt businessmen who may choose to jump off the building or swallow guns. suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They owe a 50 million loan from Southcomer, although 60% of the shares are taken away, and the rest are the same I owe a lot, including Mr. Jackson as an example. He now holds 6 percent of the shares of the western insurance company. The western insurance company currently has a market value of 50 million but the negative assets are 50 million. These two data need to be calculated separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50 million assets are not in his hands, which means he has a debt of 3 million, and will assume the same proportion from the second year. Interest. On the other hand, the two major banks used the name of the loan when making the capital increase statement. Mr. Jackson holds 1% of the shares of the two major banks. The two banks have total assets of 400 million, and the negative assets. 300 million, this also needs to be counted separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because of the signing of a series of contracts, Mr. Jackson’s personal assets have increased by 4 million, but the negative assets are still six million, in positive and negative After hedging this calculation, which is not counted as a statistical method, he inexplicably shoulders two million loans and pays interest for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doesn’t seem to be terrible, because there are actually two million assets belonging to him now in the bank, it looks like this, no The problem. However, once the two major banks holding more than 53% of the shares of the western insurance company decided not to play with them, they only need to split the western insurance company first, and part of the non-debt, that is, five thousand in the bank. Millions are split and then the assets of the debt are taken out, which is part of the 50 million loan they carry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then sell the positive assets to the bank with absolute equity – at a price of two thousand in various names, such as the company’s good business profitability or other names 10,000 or even 10 million yuan sold to the bank at a low price, and then returned the money to the bank in the name of the debt, so that the entire company’s positive assets are sold out in the name of business services, the entire company. There are only 40 million debts left. And because of the unequal treaties in the agreement, Mr. Jackson not only has to bear 2.4 million, but has not yet paid 15% of the interest every year. He has to pay a total of three years, and the money needs to be returned to the bank for three hundred and four. 180,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the insurance companies under the two major banks, it is even simpler. They still use the split and divestiture methods that capitalists like most, and they will separate some of the advantageous industries and transfer them to banks with low-cost valuation as a way to repay bank loans. Even if they eat a good look, a good asset of 100 million yuan was given to two banks for a price of 50 million yuan. Now they are also carrying a debt of 2.5 billion yuan, calculated by 1%, Jackson. He also had a debt of 2.75 million yuan and a interest of 1.24 million yuan generated by this part of the debt, which means that he did not do anything, and he owed the bank a loan of 7.46 million. The fraction is not counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this result is actually very simple, the equity in their hands is diluted to the lowest, they have no power to interfere with the three company shareholders meeting and the board of directors Decided that only this result can be accepted. They can go to prosecute the two major banks, but for this capital market, capital is everything. The two major banks have enough time, financial resources and experienced rogue lawyers to fight the lawsuits, and drag the lawsuit indefinitely. Go on until they are completely bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the lawsuit would naturally not be able to continue because they were bankrupt, because they did not have the money to hire a lawyer to continue to seek legal help. The possibility they faced at that time was A tens of millions or even more debt. If the two major banks are in the way of suppressing the companies they are operating, speeding up the process and increasing the level of their liabilities, they may have to bear more than 20 million debts after a period of delay! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the end of the collapse of the building, they have fallen into a bloody life, and they have no way to go for the debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital has never revealed a kind side, it has always been a bloody bloody mouth, sometimes some people are swallowed by this big mouth, sometimes they Swallow others. Don't try to see who is more pitiful through the results. In fact, from the day they embarked on this road, they are not worthy of being pitiful. They are all participants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Du Lin’s breakpoint is at the Western Insurance Company, or the Western Insurance Company’s $50 million deposit in the Southern Commercial Bank. "on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people who have not even come in have actually started to discuss how to close the door. This group of people may have forgotten the store because of their great advantage. In the field of capital, there will always be a miracle, a miracle that belongs to wisdom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many people who didn't believe in this evil all the way around Du Lin. In the end, they all handed over honest answers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insurance industry without Dooling’s interference is really a piece of land that has not been developed and cannot be easily said otherwise. Unclear gold and silver treasures, as the think tanks of the two major banks continue to deepen their analysis of the profitability of the insurance business, they feel that this is a good business after the bank, and even more than the bank. It is said that there has even been a slogan from the inside of the central bank - "Let everyone have a safe guarantee"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in great news and unprecedented interest Next, the two major banks quickly applied for an industry self-regulatory organization in the Imperial Capital, called the Imperial Insurance Industry Self-Regulatory Committee, and initiated the formulation of industry standards and the establishment of industry access standards in accordance with the standards they had previously negotiated. As long as these two documents are approved, the insurance industry in the future will become the back garden of the two major banks, and they always believe that the two documents will be approved without any hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their relationship with the capitalists and the Chamber of Commerce, it is impossible for the Chamber of Commerce to take them for too long on a matter of non-interest, which is not in line with the total The current interests of the Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Chamber of Commerce and the two major banks are facing the same problem, facing the cabinet's step by step, but there are some differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Chamber of Commerce, Maggs’s attitude is clear, they will be defeated when they find the opportunity, and then the power of the Chamber of Commerce for commercial approval will be brought back. As for the merchants of the former Chamber of Commerce, Magus provided a lot of help, but it was a private friendship and should not rise to the national level. When the New Party government did face a heavy crisis and spent the toughest time with the help of these businessmen, did they not give the Chamber of Commerce 30 years of development? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the international community is changing day by day. The think tank of the cabinet believes that the future war situation is likely to change from armed conflict to economic war. Let Magus more want to get back the power that should belong to the government and is currently hosted in the Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the bank is concerned, too many anonymous accounts have caused very bad negative effects, which have caused great damage and loss to the economic construction. The banking industry must be included. In the government's supervision, even some of the power should be handed over to the government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
