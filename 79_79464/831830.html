			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sally came out of the house that was about to collapse, she looked at the paper in her hand and she suddenly felt that smuggling was a stupid thing. Because some people use a better way to start sucking blood from them, and these people live in Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome looking guy is willing to provide a complete set of instruments for Seri, and he shows his new wine license and liquor license, then Also issued a patent, the name of the patent is called "concentrated wine blending formula." To put it simply, these people have legalized certain levels of alcohol to some extent. It takes a lot of money to get this whole set of documents from here, and it is not a one-off. Each authorization cycle is only one quarter. After more than one quarter, you must come back here and be slaughtered by that guy before you can continue to be legal. "smuggling" private wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selly suddenly had some boring feelings. When all this was legalized, was this still smuggling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of smuggling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tension in smuggling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of uneasiness keeps praying, and when you reach your destination, you’re happy and have a sense of accomplishment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you say that soon they will be from smuggling gangs to businessmen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t know, she was not interested in knowing that she returned to the station with all the proofs and used her two carriages from the police’s hands to use the tractor. Pulled it out. Looking at the two cars parked on the auxiliary road, Sally was a little embarrassed. After this trip, I am afraid that all the smuggling rules in the north-south direction must be changed. She didn't know what kind of temper the mayor of the city had to do, and he did things that others could not do, as long as he could persist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to imagine how much profit will be eaten here in the huge smuggling trade between the North and the South. But she knows that perhaps this small city will soon become different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are indeed as Serie has imagined, it took only three days, and the smugglers in the city of Nal Lindos knew the news. And is constantly spreading out. In particular, after Sally put the tax-declaration certificate and all the documents in neat, after the goods were delivered to the place without any surprise, the inexplicable sense of loss made many smugglers excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is necessary to take half of the profits from Otis, but half of the profits are exchanged for safe business channels, and the value is not worth seeing. Most of the smaller smugglers think it is worthwhile. They were small in scale. If they can't protect themselves and the safety of the goods, it is very likely that an accident will be enough to send them all into hell. Large-scale smuggling organizations feel that this is also good, especially when they know that the mayor of the city is called Doolin, and they are more willing to cooperate with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is Dolin, the bottom people don’t know much, but the top people know it too clearly, especially since this year, Du Lin used money and force directly. After clearing the way, with the help of the Navy's power to perfect their own smuggling channels, all those who are engaged in this trip know that they have a new partner and opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who make their heads on their belts never look down on anything, because those who are careless and careless have long been on the side of the railway. The cheekbones, they investigated how much Duoling after a sigh of relief. This guy is playing with his own, not interfering with others, and will not let others interfere with him, which makes people feel relieved. In addition, there is a contradiction between the underground money laundering dealer and Du Lin. Du Lin is very prestigious on the top of certain fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to have such a reputation is actually related to money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clean up a sum of more than 70 million, it’s definitely not something that can be done with a touch of the mouth. It involves a lot of doorways. It can be said that the money was washed by Dooling. The largest money laundering banker in the empire did not pick up a new job from the receipt of the list, and still wash the money for him. Big customers naturally have the wait for big customers. The rules of ten-pounds and threes have become ten strokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the dealer was afraid that Du Lin suddenly turned his face and took the initiative to call Du Lin, Du Lin’s money, they are still in operation. There are too many things involved in this area, but all of them reflect that Du Lin has a certain reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With prestige, you can be assured that people who have no reputation and no prestige have gone, so they want more people with word of mouth. Cooperation, at least rest assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a small push, the city of Otis suddenly seemed to be bustling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than seven or ninety people will get off the bus here every day, and there will be two or three when there are few. At the same time, a group of agricultural carriages appeared outside the station, and the washing was clean and dedicated to killing guests... Passengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big cities have the benefits of big cities, and small cities have the advantages of small cities. There are many things happening every day in big cities, but people don't know everything, they only know the changes around them. Small cities are much simpler. The big things are enough to make the whole city talk. The city has changed in less than three weeks since the new mayor took office. This makes some people reluctant to leave the city. Someone who is motivated has felt the change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may not know what the future of the city looks like, but they know that there is already improvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s money is growing at a crazy rate every day, and he not only allows those smugglers to take the initiative to set up a den, but also The mayor of Ilyan was alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things that Doolin did not intend to marry anyone, nor who to take advantage of, because he is the mayor, the city’s largest official, even It is the governor who only has the power to oppose him and does not stop his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin, have you been doing something too much?", when the voice of Doolin appeared in the receiver, the mayor of Irian - Hossington immediately complained. "These things you are doing are smearing the face of the New Party. Some people think that your actions have hurt the interests of the New Party. I hope that you will immediately terminate what you are doing now, and The victim's public apologizes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin made it easy to say that this trick is simple, but before he used this scheme, others have not used it. . Perhaps they also thought about it, but they did not implement the problem because of the face. After all, the mayor of a city officially washed the smugglers. It is a bit shameful and not worth it. Once they do this, it is equivalent to encouraging smuggling, not only conflicting with the cabinet's ruling plan, but also morally resisting the middle class and possibly losing the election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these questions are not at all in Doolin’s consideration. What is the whole Otis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he dare to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Hossington’s statement, Du Lin just smiled calmly. “Mr. Mayor, if the cabinet has a resolution, you can let the cabinet members contact me directly. I will consider how to do it after considering it. But..." He said that he paused here and silenced the other side of the phone line. Houston was immediately annoyed. There is no doubt that Du Lin did not say anything behind it. He does not have this power, nor is he enough to manage his affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Hoxton very, very annoyed, and Doolin arranged for him to go out, whether he received a suggestion from a higher level, he is this Executor. There was a problem with Doolin. He might not care about the pat on the butt. Everyone knows that he has money. It doesn't matter if the rich do anything. But then the next slap would fall on his Hossington. He also planned to run for the next governor. At this time, Du Lin did completely disturb his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with patience: "Dulin, this is not a discussion, but a request. Someone has submitted some descriptive documents to you, saying that you are involved. And organize smuggling, and use the official identity as a cover and umbrella. Once this matter is taken seriously by the adults, you may be able to catch up! You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin did not give Hossington the opportunity to continue speaking. He interrupted the other party's words. "Mr. Mayor, if you have nothing else, I will hang up. I am very busy here, if I have time, I will I will call you again. Then goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders after hanging up the phone and continued to bury his head in the next step of planning for the city. Every day these smugglers will bring him tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of income, in addition to the state to shut up the governor, and some will be used for urban transformation. Otis is too poor, too rudimentary, too backward, not at all in line with his plans for this, and the things that Hossington said are completely meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, each state of the empire is equivalent to a small autonomous kingdom. The laws of each state are different except that they comply with the Supreme Basic Law. It may be illegal to sell alcohol in this state, but it may just be unruly to go to another state to sell alcohol. In Irian Dulin, even the winemaking and selling of wine can be opened, and no contraband bureau or city hall personnel are seen to sanction him, so he does not need to inform the new party cabinet, as long as the state government passes it. Anyway, he does not intend to climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
