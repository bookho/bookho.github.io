			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Williams left the trading desk, he found a good place to look at the stock name and price that was constantly rolling on the public sign. To be honest, this is him. The third time I came to the trading house, I was very upset about everything here. Can anyone tell him where he can see the shares of the joint construction workers and the damn price? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 8.7 million federal shield’s desperation gave him a rapid adrenaline secretion, which made him utterly dry and heart-wrenching, he never did it. A big "gambling", he now regrets a little, but regrets no help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe some of the powers heard his prayers, a guy with a tie in a formal suit and a good demeanor appeared beside him and shouted His name, "Mr. Williams?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams looks at this young man, who is only about 27 or 18 years old, with a hint of alert," You are?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s face immediately blooms in the sun, revealing a row of clean and tidy teeth, and the smile is full of sunshine. He reached out and kept a humble gesture. "Hello, Mr. Williams, I am the agent of Dunn Stockbroker, Befort. I just noticed that you don't seem to have a stockbroker in the same trade? If you haven't For your own agent, consider Dunn Stock Brokers, where we have the most professional analysts and traders to ensure that your interests are maximized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" And...", he pointed to the second floor of the trading house. "We have our own seats on it. You can pay attention to the stock price changes you bought for a long time. We will also provide you with the corresponding news and intelligence analysis. There is also a free meal and cold cycle system, which is much better than the lobby.” The stockbroker named Befort just saw Williams using a bank draft, like the empire, a small amount of payment. Most people in the Federation choose cash checks, and only the transactions that exceed the limit on the cash check will use the promissory note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be a transaction of more than 200,000 federal shields. Such high-quality customers, and high-quality customers without stockbrokers, are almost extinct and can be found. A wild is simply a gift from the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, the Golden Lord is a non-God and non-life thing of the federal people's faith. If you describe it in the simplest words, you only need one word. --money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams has been sweating at this time. It may be because the crowd in the hall has weakened the coldness caused by the cold cycle, or it may be the function change caused by the adrenaline secretion. He is a little tempted. He has heard of stockbrokers. Mr. Mark also said that he has a stockbroker and that he is a joint venture that the stockbroker recommends him to buy. Perhaps he should also try it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Williams’ hesitation, the Bethford agent once again persuaded, “You can go up and sit for a while and feel completely different from here. The atmosphere, a successful person like you should not stay here, and you can rest assured that we do not have any compelling requirements, if you feel unsatisfied, you can leave anytime, anywhere, we will not charge any fees, Will not be embarrassing you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams, who was not so determined, was convinced that he and Befford went to the second floor, west of the second floor. In a place, there is indeed a trading hall with the "Don En" brand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before along, Befort is introducing Williams to the facilities on the second floor and the gap between the second floor and the first floor. If you need to trade on the second floor, you don't even need to go to the queue. You will miss some quotes. You just need to shout or press the button to say your request. Soon there will be a trader who specializes in large-value transactions. They do all the documents. In addition to this there is also a place to provide leisure, similar to a small salon, Williams saw many people sitting in the talk, commenting on stocks, or talking about their own experiences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and nodded. The atmosphere here is more suitable for wealthy people like him, if Mr. Mark did not lie to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not bad, it's much better than I thought." He sat in the area of ​​Dunn, facing a huge public sign, and The following are some of the continually rolling public signs. The stocks on the public signs here are fixed, and the only real-time price changes are rolling, which makes him feel a lot better. At least, he didn't have to wait a few minutes to know what happened to his stock, which gave him more security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Befford put some pastries on the table, and people brought some information about joint construction, with their own curves and columns. The picture explains why Mr. Williams has risen, why it fell, and how people are observing the potential and ideal price of the stock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
