			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man gave a sigh of relief, and some said defeated, "I'm sorry, I am rash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "I am very sorry to say that I forgot your name, so I don't know how to call you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" My name is Carter, sir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carter, although I refused your request, you don't have to be discouraged because there is something more suitable for you waiting You.", Doolin pointed to the sofa opposite him, and Carter sat up cautiously. "Do you know the fellow country?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card features nod, "I know Mr. Abigail and his associates have advertised to us some time ago, saying that you...", he looked up at Du Lin, and Du Lin signaled him to continue. "He said that you are engaged in the population. Trafficking in businesses and opening private mines, let us be careful not to contact you, lest you be sold to black mines in other places to do labor.", saying that he is not good Thinking scratched his head, he actually believed A Bien propaganda, really think Doolin is a black villain heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knows these rumors, but it still makes people laugh at this time, maybe Abbey’s rumors are correct, he really "eats people", but only "Eat" his enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fellowship needs to be developed. I don't have enough people to do this now, and you are the most suitable person. The fellowship is a melon. The core of the people is also the only civil organization. Our purpose is not to restore something impossible like other extreme organizations. The fellowship is just a mutual concern, mutual love, and better living conditions and welfare for us. An organization that works hard to treat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know why those provincial people are always able to get a better job than you? Because they are very united, in the face For some troubles, they can spontaneously unite and let people know their unity and the difficulties they face. On the contrary, our Guarts are too silent, even if they suffer from unequal treatment. Say it, this is not right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't fight, why should someone give you? Only you fight, let the public and the empire hear your voice ,Got it The appeal will only consider whether it is necessary to satisfy your conditions. The Guart people have been silent for too long. For a long time, people have forgotten that the first king once conquered this continent. The glory of the ancestors is in our hearts, right in our In the hands, it is time to let it shine. Carter, my compatriot, this is a glorious mission, but also a heavy burden, I want you to take this responsibility, can you do it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter was a little excited, his lips trembled a little, he nodded hard and his hands became fists. "I can, Mr. Doolin, I am sure I can! In the previous incident, I realized When it comes to what you said, when we encounter unfair treatment, no one can save us except ourselves. The provincial sage, the Ogdin, the northern barbarians, they only see our jokes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if I can do this well, but I will do my best to do it!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up and took out the checkbook from his arms and installed it. He has a large denomination of checkbooks, but the maximum denomination of the checkbook is only one thousand. More than one thousand checkbooks are not called checkbooks, but are called "promissory notes." There is still a big difference between the cheque and the promissory note. The promissory note is equivalent to a certificate of cash, and you can get the cash indicated on the promissory note at any bank. The check needs to have a verification process to prove that there is money in the account to get the amount on the checkbook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Irian area, a thousand checkbooks are already the maximum amount that can be applied for, and more than one thousand banks will recommend customers to use the promissory notes. And fast, the loss to the bank is also minimal. Because the promissory note rarely acts directly on the early invoice bank for cash withdrawal, it can be hedged by different banks on the settlement date to solve the problem of the reduction of bank deposits. (In the early days of the United States, there were still five-dollar and ten-dollar checkbooks, and the minimum amount was said to be two dollars.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let Airlis go I took a 10,000-piece promissory note and taught it to Carter. "Go to the fifth district to find a piece of land to buy it. The rest of the money is spent on operations and your personal salary, and as much as possible to absorb members, as long as Guart. People. Tell them that their fellow villagers will take away even a penny from them, only give them money, and have equal and fair power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Carter took over the 10,000-dollar promissory note, his hand was shaking. He had never touched so much money in his life, but now he met, he can feel the trust and value from Doolin. He put the promissory note in his pocket, held Doolin's left hand, and kissed the cat's eye ring on his index finger. "If you wish, sir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After sending Carter, Doolin contacted Garfield. After the last friendly meeting, Garfield was very happy to agree with Du Lin. The place agreed by the two was at the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling really wants to buy a boat, but the purpose of buying a boat is not as simple as a simple logistics. He plans to take Juan’s liquor license and immediately start expanding the winemaking workshops and transport them to the various empire. The place is for sale. There is also a small idea in his face. He will only sell the wine to the Guarts. Those Guarts must have more to protect their own interests or to make more money. Bloody! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profit of private liquor has skyrocketed under the second prohibition of alcohol, and the retail price of private liquor in many areas has tripled, so attractive The market, even those who are honest, will be red-eyed and knives for those who try to obstruct their wealth. And Du Lin can also use this opportunity to form a network covering the whole country, these people will become his disciples! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, when every city has Doolin people, and these people have the courage and strength, Doolin wants to do something to do Not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the premise of all this is that he must have wines that can be supplied to the country, and a network that can transport these wines to various places quickly enough. He once thought about finding something else for his stupid compatriots, but it seems that only to let them in order to protect their own interests can inspire their blood. This is not the fault of anyone. If you are not looking for a person to confess the solitude of the Guar people over the years, it is the fault of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garfield didn’t let Du Lin wait for a long time, and Du Lin’s footsteps arrived, and he’s got to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there anything I need to say on the dock?" Garfield smiled and blamed the car. He stepped forward and shook hands with Du Lin. "What I said yesterday made me benefit a lot. After I went back, I thought about it for a long time. I decided to go to the west to buy some mines and do it myself from the source to the terminal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin said those words, Garfield immediately realized that if the economy is really recovering as Dulin said, and the real estate industry is about to enter a period of rapid development, then the demand for steel in this society will increase dramatically! Because whether it is building a railway or building a house or something, it is inseparable from steel and cement. He is unfamiliar with cement, but he can't cook anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also realized that once the demand for steel in the society rises, the ore that is the raw material will become a tight cargo, and even face a short-term out-of-stock phenomenon, so he decided Go to the west and buy some iron ore. Even if you don’t do it yourself, you can make a profit through the supply. He never considered robbing the name of the steel tycoon. He couldn't afford it, and he didn't have such a big skill. He just wanted to use this opportunity to make some money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
