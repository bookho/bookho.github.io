			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really playing...", the body of Zene lying in the alley twisted like a snake that had gone to his head, he just got When I came out of the prison, I knew a lot about Du Lin’s current situation. Most of them came from newspapers. This kind of newspaper is the one who gives more money, who is more difficult to provoke, whoever listens, so Du Lin’s image has always been positive. However, in the Imperial Capital, in the investigation team, those agents in order to help as much as possible to help Xiuen as soon as possible to understand the more "three-dimensional" Du Lin, these years Doolin do Things that have passed but never been reported are presented in front of Xiu. Touching the conscience, at that moment, Xiu En really stunned, not who wants to lie, it is really embarrassing. Even if the investigation team released him, he would probably find a job and stay away from Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a monk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen thought that Du Lin was very hot during the period of Tynell. When the street attack killed Wood and made a pier shooting, it was killed. Many gangs belong to the kind of sultry people in the entire Tener area and in the cases he has participated in before. But when I saw that the book was five feet thick and used eight talents to hold the file, he even wanted to die. It’s not a good idea to make a conspiracy with this kind of monk. Once you are discovered, you will die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity that the investigation team gave him two choices, either to go back to the cell for free to live, or to take the initiative to get close to Doolin’s identity as an undercover For them to collect evidence of Doolin, he did not choose, can only fight hard on the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in order to achieve enough "program effects", but also to guard against fraud, let Du Lin find out the possible flaws, so they are really trying to fight , playing very seriously, very real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatting on the ribs, the elbows are slowly sitting on the ground, and the ups and downs of the upper body make his painful muscles straight, he can feel Out, at least one of his ribs has broken, and the pain and pain that ooze out of the bones are completely different, just like hurting in the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It hurts!", he bit his teeth and looked at the empty alley, no Doolin, no one else, it seems that the plan failed, but Inexplicably he breathed a sigh of relief and whispered himself. "Failed best... failed best, I don't want to deal with that bastard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But sometimes there are always things that make things counterproductive, whether it is Du Lin or Magus, they will never go smoothly, let everything run according to their own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wall stood up and rubbed his ribs and slowly moved toward the alley, Xiu En was keenly aware that someone was Observing yourself, this is a very special feeling that cannot be described in words, but it does exist. It’s like a bus coming out of the house in the morning and taking a bus from the city to go to work. Suddenly, when I look back at someone who is looking at myself, the instinctive reaction that suddenly the nerves are not touched is actually The instinct of a species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that there is something looking at me, and then I look back. The silly brain may still evaluate the woman’s ass, but our neurons are not Stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief confrontation, most people will look away, covering their innermost embarrassment for their inexplicable return and lasting two or three seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a feeling like this, or a reaction, he looked up and saw the opposite side of the road, a young man in a jacket People are watching him. The two men's eyes crossed the road and the pedestrians met in the air for two seconds. The young man bowed his head and took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. He then slammed the crowd and disappeared into the street. But Xiu En dare to bet that the man was absolutely observing himself. Unlike other people who watched the lively observations, his eyes had a strange calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scalp of Xiu’en’s scalp is probably the person of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the two investigation teams are prepared to "recycle" the tatters of the show. According to the scheduled plan, they will ask if they need to be a good-hearted person. Help, then send him to the ambulance that will arrive soon. But inexplicable, Xiu En actually sat down against the wall and refused the help of these two good people. These two agents are also senior agents directly under the military office of the Imperial Capital. Their lives are like a movie that will never end, and they continue to play different roles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Xiuen refused them, they immediately realized that Du Lin’s people might be around, and the two had pretended to be a little angry and left. The deputy leader of the observation immediately let all the observers begin to lock the observers that might exist on the street. Finally, they found a coffee in the yard of an open-air cafe opposite the road, but they were always observing the grace. young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful, Du Lin got hooked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy leader waved his fist and put down the telescope and said, "Okay, proceed to the second step.", a group of people quickly left the room. Even a trace of it has not been left, as if they have never been there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who followed Xien’s followed Xien’s day until he slowly walked to the rescue station and checked the injury at the rescue station before taking it. Some medicines and five dollars were slowly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every city has a rescue station, and the rescue station provided accommodation services early, but later, because everyone ran over for free, some people even regarded the rescue station as After the casino and the place where you can compete with skilled women for professional skills, the rescue station canceled the accommodation service, and kept free medical treatment for the tramp, free of charge for some cheap drugs and some help. You can get it once a month, up to five dollars, which makes the tramp of the Imperial City far more than other places, after all, it is easier to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people have suggested that the Imperial Capital, as the premier cultural and political center of the empire, should prevent these tramps from appearing on the street and affect the image of the emperor. These tramps should be sent to Irian. The policy of Irian to the tramp is to send them to the mining area in the seventh district or to the labor district where heavy labor is needed, until they have enough to buy one. The money in the house will let them leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, someone intends to escape, and some people want to resist, and finally these people become part of the manufacturing cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this proposal did not pass at the end, because another group of people think that the emperor’s tramp is more and can make them look more like the tramps of other cities. Better, but more able to explain that the emperor is the most loving place of the empire, and indirectly to the visiting foreign friends to demonstrate the attitude of the empire to the nationals and the social security system. In short, I don't know who made the final decision. This is so decided that the city center of the Imperial City can often see a bunch of tramps sitting in the alleys begging during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen bought a bottle of inferior wine on the way back, although it was inferior, but it was much clearer than the inferior wines a few years ago, and the taste was also Heavy. He didn't know what was going on outside in prison, and he didn't even think that the young man who had allowed him to take it, not only became a big man, but also changed the pattern of the private liquor industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a bottle of inferior wine requires a bottle of ninety-one bottles, seven hundred and fifty milliliters, which is very difficult to drink. But for the tramps, this is the best thing to drink. They always drink drunkenness to sleep peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shen is swaying back to his "residential" park, where there are some basic rides that are free to the public, and at night it becomes The holy land of the tramps. Those basic rides provide good shelter from the wind and rain, and provide them with the necessary warmth in the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Xiun, what's wrong with you?", a bearded tramp waved his hand to Xiu'an with his already smashed clothes. He and a few other tramps sat on a bench, each holding a bottle, and they could smell a complex multi-source odor before entering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles on the face of Xien’s face trembled, and he endured the pain and walked a few steps. After a fall on the bench, he sighed with relief. While unscrewing the bottle cap, he said, "I met a young man during the day. He said that I soiled his clothes, and then a group of people invited me to dance!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a communication word between the tramps that is similar to the whispering. The tramp also has the division of the site, the division of power, and sometimes the battle. In order to avoid trouble, they learn the gang's way to replace some vocabulary involving illegal behavior with some less sensitive words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, dancing means that you don’t use weapons to beat with your fist. Words like this are Barbie, and the word stands for a fight. There are also many words such as sacks and plaids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tramps heard that Xiuen was beaten, and suddenly they laughed and laughed, and the first culture of the bearded tramp was raised. The bottle in the hand, "Be a curse for Xiuen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen took out the medicine sent to him at the rescue station, also I got a glass of wine and swallowed it with a bottle of medicine. "Cheers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time outside the park, the investigation team has discovered a young man who is tracking the grace of Xiu People, these two young people are very cautious, they did not go in close quarters to stare at Xiu, but looked away and looked away. Dooling’s instructions were not to disturb the grace. They naturally would not go to Zion to stare at him. When Du Lin passed his instructions through the local president, he also told them that Xiu En was already a member of the investigation bureau. Has a certain anti-tracking, anti-reconnaissance capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
