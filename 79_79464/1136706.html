			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting the progress of governing the country according to law, raising the awareness of governing the country according to law, and clarifying that the fundamentals of governing the country according to law are important standards that reflect the degree of civilization of a country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in the wilderness period, someone will scream the ignorant argument that "I am the law". The more developed the civilization, the more important it is to understand the importance of ruling the country according to law. necessity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time ago, tax collection was a clear law in the form of text in the Code, but in the past feudal society, the nobility of the nobility had a confrontation with the central government. The ability and foundation of centralized rule, anti-taxation has become a very common thing. Moreover, in the feudal society of the old times, the royal family enshrined the area to the nobility, and the aristocrats exercised all the power in this land, forming a small kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the new society, in the new era, everything is different and should be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Tax Administration has always wanted to achieve further results on the tax issue. The performance of the Imperial Taxation Bureau on the New Party’s site is not bad, but in the old party’s There is a little trouble on the site. These aristocrats who have traditionally resisted the tax habits did not play the game of paying taxes with the Imperial Taxation Bureau. The taxation was withheld and the assassination of tax officials occurred from time to time. Gradually, a vague hidden rule was formed. ——<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new party pays taxes in full, and the old party “deducts” taxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of this consensus is not the way to do so, and the so-called "deduction" is not a real tax reduction, but also in accordance with strict standards. The process levies taxes, but there are always some names in these places that can provide sufficient excuses for them not to pay taxes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when a disaster occurred in a certain place, the City Hall temporarily allocated some taxes as funds for disaster relief, or the city’s economic development is slow, and many companies are on the verge of bankruptcy. The tax payment, the overall tax completion is low, including many means of making fake accounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Doolin wants to break this rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a different understanding of the current mainstream group, the empire’s tax administration should not rely on the wings of the cabinet...", Du Lin’s The brain is spinning at a high speed. Sometimes the political roll is not necessarily for the sake of self-interest, but for the opponent to get no benefit. This kind of starting point that harms others is not a news in politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus listened carefully to Doolin’s words and let him continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that the tax levy of the Imperial Tax Administration on the entire empire is related to the development of the empire, which has surpassed the jurisdiction of the New and Old parties and should be given The higher stage of the Imperial Taxation Administration makes this department no longer subject to the cabinet. Whether it is the New Party or the old party, the Imperial Tax Administration should be independent, independent, and authoritative. At most, it only accepts the cabinet. Supervised, but not subject to the control of the cabinet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus heard the laugh here, "So you thought about it, if one day you have Qualified to sit here, a group of disobedient people may interfere with your policy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very optimistic about Du Lin, so much so that On the phone, I said that Du Lin might have sat in his current position one day, which made Du Lin very happy. At least Magus recognized his ability and gave himself a good stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not think much, and the thoughts in his heart blurted out directly. "The power of the Prime Minister is greater and the status is higher. It only represents the will of the entire imperial citizen. The power embodied in the individual as the will accepts the power given to him by the people to manage the country. The prime minister can have a lot of power and a high status, but he should not be higher than this empire!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tax issue is related to the development of the entire empire. From my personal point of view, the importance of taxation is higher than the control of the first relative power."<br /><br />&nbsp "The Prime Minister is empowered by the people. The Prime Minister's job is to serve the empire, to serve the people, not to benefit for themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin’s words were spoken, Magus’s heart was breeding a wonderful mood swing. He knew that Du Lin was lying. He knew Du Lin too well. He almost watched Du Lin from a Unremarkable, following the obscurity behind Harry Acting Mayor Adams, right up to the point where about to become governor. I also watched this young man in the empire and danced internationally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not a good thing, but this does not mean that what he said is not a good thing. On the contrary, Magus felt that the words were so good, so that he also resonated, and the only one was awkward. The place is that those who say these words are obviously not able to do this, and they are still a jerk, a villain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus’s silence did not last long, he asked after thinking, “But now changes to the Imperial Tax Administration and some circumstances will affect one. The interests of a large number of people, they may become crazy, this may not be the most appropriate time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you are wrong, Uncle Magus. "Duo Lin refuted Magus's point of view. "I think that now is the most suitable opportunity. We all know that you are the pioneer of the new era. You changed the empire and changed the rule of decay in the past. We bring a bright light. Everyone says that you are the soul of the overall reform, then the idea of ​​continuing to implement change by a reform pioneer like you is not exactly what you should do?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you said it before, you will be going back soon, there is no better time than now. One year, enough for us to destroy many things, and above Rebuilding a building that is more responsive to the times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn’t actually understand the words too well, but Maggs understood, and now he did make a lot of noise, but He is going to retire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his own eyes, in the eyes of Du Lin, in the eyes of some people who know the truth, he used active retirement to completely kill the life-long official. But in the eyes of those who don't know, he will become a "loser". In the new round of elections, he will be saved for thirty years. This is undoubtedly a great victory for all those who have suffered damages during the Magness administration. The grievances they have accumulated will also dissipate with the "defeation" of Magus because they succeeded. Revenge, Magus did not continue to be re-elected is the result of revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They beat Magus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes those who have been hurt because of tax reform. They have no way to continue to attack Magus, and they can't even make any rude actions against Magus, otherwise they will break the most terrible rules in this empire, waiting for them to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I have already thought about how to convince me before you call, then does it mean that there is no such thing as Otis, you will find a time "I said these things with me?", Magus's laughter was very brisk. He liked the idea that Du Lin put forward. "My line is confidential. We say something private, if there is no such thing as the city of Otis, How are you going to do this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also smiled a few times, then took a look at the western sky, “I will let people know tax It is the duty of every imperial citizen. I can't manage too many people, but on my site, everything must be heard from me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening, Some of the shareholders of the seven major casinos gathered together. Webster suddenly announced that the behavior of the seven major casinos was not like his style. Everyone thought that there must be others under the command of Webster. He did this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never seen it, Webber is so powerful, he is willing to offend us all at the same time, who do you think is standing behind him?", someone asked In this sentence, the room suddenly fell into a dead silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who can make Webster make such a rash move, there is no such thing in Otis. In other places, there are so many people, for example, everyone is the most Do not want to mention the character, Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn bitch has jumped over the floor and has already taken Du Lin’s attention. This is not a good thing... maybe we need to consider Speed ​​up the process of our plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time someone came up with another idea, "Maybe we have other solutions that attract those who are Dolin The gaze of the people grabbed them and threw them out, letting them calm down Dooling’s anger. This would not cause any loss to us, but would be more beneficial. Without these people, our equity integration will be smoother. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some people have different opinions on this. "Then you have considered it. After these people are handed over, they may have planned what we are planning." Do you tell Doolin to exchange for their chances of living?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
