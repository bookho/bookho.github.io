			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a low-pitched discussion in the conference room. Powell’s direct shot to Du Lin was actually directed at Magus, if there was no Magus and Harry. Unanimous affirmation and trust, Du Lin is also unlikely to be the mayor of the city of Otis at a young age. He was only 21 years old this year. When almost everyone in this room was 21 years old, he had just completed the initial stage of his life. The aristocrats had just completed their adult rites for a year and had not been assigned family tasks and resources. The politicians from the civilian population are still doing their studies and are about to set foot in society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if someone is willing to give them a chance, they can’t be the mayor of a city in one go. The mayor needs to have enough experience and experience, definitely not two. At the age of eleven, you can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin did it. He was already a mayor when he was twenty, no matter what the purpose of Hossington’s nomination for Doolin was. In short, under the arrangement of Harry, Doolin became the mayor of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is a Marcus man, a member of the New Party who is a big aristocrat. If there is no Magnus nod, Harry may not be able to put Du Lin arranged to go to the city of Otis to be the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, according to the current political system of the empire, the state has a considerable degree of autonomy, and a mayor does not need a cabinet nod, no need to vote in the party But this is too embarrassing. Some people even began to speculate that the original Dulin was thrown into the dilapidated place of Otis, which was their one-step plan, and then secretly tilted and planned a follow-up development route for Du Lin, making the city of Otis an amazing The speed has developed to what it is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young round of the sun rises in the hinterland of the empire, and Doolin has gained great prestige. When he was assassined some time ago, he was even more famous. . He has become a representative figure of “minority officials” and this is his most powerful protective cover. If someone arbitrarily deals with him, he must first bear the nickname of racial discrimination against ethnic minorities, so that people who are satisfied with Doolin will not speak out, and those who are dissatisfied with him will not say anything. No one wants to be a paradox. The focus is still the worst one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confrontation on the face of Magus’s accusation against Powell gradually converges. He leans his head slightly and meditates. He has not spoken yet, sitting in the nineteenth Harry’s seat first spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Powell, making mistakes is the power that God gives to each of us. Every one of us will make mistakes. I believe that every one of you has made mistakes. No matter how big or small, mistakes, as long as positive corrections, to make up for the losses caused by mistakes, We will turn mistakes into experience and experience, which is the most precious wealth on our path of life. And as you said, Doolin is still young, this is his power and his harvest."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry’s sudden voice made other people’s eyes focus on Harry’s body. As the top boss of Doolin, Harry’s performance is still very good. Harry can be said to be at the top. Not only does he have a good relationship with members of the party, he has a good relationship with the old party, the capitalists, and people from all walks of life. His development plan for the state of Cosnas has already shown great results. It is necessary to know that Cosnas is one of the most “backward” states in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because during the Great Patriotic War, the Federal Pioneers and the Victory Corps were surrounded in the state of Cosnas, in order to force the Union to sit on the negotiating table honestly, At that time, the Imperial Army carried out long and indiscriminate shelling on the state of Cosnas. Where are the major cities almost completely razed to the ground, the ruins are everywhere, and the farming and animal husbandry is completely destroyed and ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Great Patriotic War, the state of Cosnas can be described as poor and white, not to mention the industrial base, even the economic foundation is completely absent. Under such circumstances, the new party The first eight years of renovation in the state of Cosnas allowed Cosons to restore its industrial base, during which Mayor Harry emerged from the mayors of many cities. It took him only five years to make his city a city, attracting enough immigrants, becoming a political star at the time, and highly appreciated by Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, Magus made a decision to make Harry the governor of Cosna, and during the reign of Harry, this was almost the same as the white. The state has quickly recovered and developed, and has a light and heavy industrial base that can be self-sufficient. The economic and ecological environment in the state has also been greatly improved. In particular, Harry has a very good way to pull investment. It took him less than 15 years under his leadership. Cosnas got rid of the primordial situation of the empire and made Harry own in the party. Quite prestigious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps from the present seat, Harry’s status in the new party can be seen, except for Magus, the chairman of the New Party Committee and a vice chairman, and Powell. In addition to the party members and members of the cabinet, his ranking can be said to have entered the top three, which is why he has confidence in running for the next prime minister, as long as Magus supports him and nominates him. He has great hopes to win that position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this at such a time, no one would think that he was arrogant. When he was the mayor, he was in his twenties, and he was almost the same as Du Lin. He told Powell with his personal experience that Du Lin was not "special" and he was not much different from some politicians here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But those imperial citizens who have lost their lives should not bear the fault of not being their own, if they use hundreds of lives to accumulate for a politician An experience, then I think it is a kind of rude, cruel, loss of human 'growth'." Powell shook his head, he looked down at the pen he was playing with, and later looked at Harry. "I don't deny the changes that Mayor Doolin brought during the Otis City administration. I admit his contribution to the city of Otis, to Cosnas and the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, he made a mistake after all, I know that the outside media said that the mistake was in the joint construction, but in turn we reflect on why the mayor of Doolin did not let the empire after getting the design. If the engineering company with rich construction experience makes a review? If he did this, I believe that any company with sufficient qualifications in the empire will tell him that the design is unqualified. But he does not, for whatever reason, there is How was it He must be responsible for these three hundred lives!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry squinted his eyes and quickly turned his head to shut up, he The chest was violently up and down, and it seemed that he was very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining Doolin is an instinct from a politician. Politics is actually a game circle. There are rules of the game that belong to you. Anyone who wants to make achievements in the imperial political arena, has certain achievements, and pursues higher goals, can never be alone. He must have his own partisan, have his own team, then defend himself. What the team captain must do, even if he knows it is wrong. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, after arguing about his attitude, Harry no longer confronts Powell because it does require someone to be punished, so that the public opinion and public opinion saw the government. The importance attached to this accident, that person will not be him, nor will it be Magus, but it is impossible to be other people, only Du Lin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did what he was supposed to do, and then accepted the result calmly, his mission was completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus glanced at Harry and then looked at Powell. "So what do you think Mayor Doolin should do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is a temporary recall, he At present, it is too attractive for people to continue to govern in Otis. We need to refrigerate him for a period of time, let him realize his problems, sum up his mistakes and gains, and let him have a process of growth. The storm of this incident has passed, and Mr. Du Lin has been re-enabled. We still need his talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus nodded and nodded, "I want to I understand that since Mr. Powell has put forward this intention, then we will vote according to the rules and regulations. Please agree to temporarily dismiss the mayor of Doolin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the gradually raised arm, Magus looked down with a blank expression and recorded a piece of content on the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 8 o'clock that evening, Du Lin was sitting in the living room drinking, and the phone ringing suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the cup and held it halfway, looking at his Scott, and shrugged his shoulders easily. "If I didn't guess wrong, This is definitely not a good signal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott smiled and put the raised glass down, the smile on his face was very stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin went to the phone and made a phone call, and Harry’s voice came from the receiver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin, I am very sorry, today’s meeting at the party meeting passed a proposal by Mr. Powell to temporarily dismiss your position. I have tried very hard to defend you. However, it has no effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out a cigarette, and Scott took out a lighter to point him up. He waved his hand. Turned around and lit a cigarette for myself. The friction of the lighter made the Harry's hand across the phone a little sweaty. He continued: "But there is good news... I have won some convenience for you, and the recall is only temporary. After the limelight of this time has passed, The party will once again activate you. And you don't have to worry about your position within the party. After the restoration, it is at least the mayor. It is very likely that you will be nominated for the Imperial Assembly. Many people wait for this step, but wait for a lifetime."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
