			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A staff member of the Imperial Central Bank put the originals returned by Amp back into the filing cabinet. He returned to his desk and started to process some The backlog of documents, and a few colleagues talked and laughed for a while. The bell ringing from work, he packed all the personal things into the briefcase, and queued to leave the bank through the employee channel. He didn't go home directly, drank a little wine with his colleague, ate something, then got on the bus opposite the home and got off at the bottom station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked two kilometers, the time was almost eight o'clock, he took out two very rich coins from his pocket and entered a closed Public telephone booth. As the core of the empire, all advanced technology will always be popular here. In some remote places, it may be that the phone only exists in the city hall or important institutions, but the public phone booth in the emperor has appeared on the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, although there is a public telephone booth but the usage rate is not high, it needs to be coined every 20 minutes. The average person can not afford such a price, they are willing I am also not willing to call. For those at the bottom of these society, time is not as precious as money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dialed a number and both sides were silent for a while, he quickly said a word, then hung up the phone booth and put on his hat, driving down The hat squatted and left the phone booth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the line, a man in a formal suit sitting in a bright office with a white-collar appearance put down the phone and he walked out of the office door and walked to the hallway At the end, pick up the phone and dial the administrator on the upper level, and reported his name, job number and application code. After two minutes, the elevator door opened. He sorted out his dress and walked out of the elevator after ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only six offices on the 19th floor, where the company's partners are working. It is very difficult to see them. If he didn't have a one-time application code, he wouldn't come at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rang the door of the innermost office, the dull voice made his heart beat a little faster, and he waited until he heard a "come in" And enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man sat behind his desk and turned his back to him, only to see the man’s shiny hair. The man faced the night scene outside the floor-to-ceiling glass wall and seemed to be enjoying something mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, there was a threader who discovered a little bit of a situation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he rewrote this sentence, he took the initiative to leave. He knows that his purpose has been achieved, and that staying will only be counterproductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he left, the luxurious chair turned back, the young face with a hint of cynical sneer, he gave up his mouth and called to call a number There was a busy tone soon on the phone... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pick up!", Du Lin shook his hand and prevented Dove, who was ready to answer the phone. It was already nine o'clock in the evening. At this time, the average person would not. To bother him. Those who can call him at this time are either in a hurry or a very important partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Doolin." Du Lin took the phone and dragged a long telephone line and walked outside the house, the wind could cover his voice. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the phone came a voice that made him want to laugh a little, Kevin. "I am selling a message to you, 10,000, you think about it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linhaha laughed, he couldn't help but ridiculed: "You have recently increased the price? Is it 10,000 yuan an hour now? Still Say you have 10,000 yuan in a sentence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Doolin’s laughter Kevin didn’t care, just like Amp’s knowledge of Kevin, he This person wants money to be shameless, and divides the business and private affairs clearly. Even if things are considered private by others, they will be summarized into business affairs by Kevin. Business requires money, but it is definitely worth it. Private things don't cost money. Sometimes he doesn't want to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, I think this message is worth 10,000. Of course, you can also choose to refuse. Let's talk about something else, such as the recent economic situation?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought about it and decided to spend 10,000 to listen to what Kevin wanted to say, but he had a request, "If your message is worth 10,000. Block..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard, do you want to say that you want to send me a bullet?", the earpiece also laughed, and the laughter soon Convergence, Kevin’s voice has become serious. “Someone is investigating your fund account, including the flow of a jewelry company and more accounts that have money with this jewelry company. If you think this message is worth 10,000 I know your account. If you don't think it is worth it, give me one thousand five."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, I am going to raise the price now, one hour and one thousand five!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted, "I know, there are other "What?", he still waited for Kevin to reply, and there was a busy tone in the receiver. He shook his head and put the handset back on the phone, put the phone on the grass, and walked alone to the edge of the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the night of Irian is more beautiful than the daytime, the silver moonlight is scattered on the whole beach, the waves are silver, the beach is silvery, everything is so Confinement, so holy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Juan and Luke began to spit out after being caught, and all the things they thought were valuable to them, including he. Doolin didn't need to find out, they knew that they must point their finger at themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he dared to give these two people to those in the investigation bureau, he naturally handled the tails. It’s just that he didn’t think that the other person started investigating the jewelry company so quickly. It seems that there is a very good guy among those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thinks that all his operations can be said to be flawless, including jewelry companies. But there is no absolute perfection in this world. There are always things that are not clean, such as the registrant of a jewelry company. The Chamber of Commerce always requires all companies, companies and institutions to be registered by a living “natural person” because it involves a special situation in business, so he randomly found a gambler and asked him to register the jewelry company. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I’m thinking about it. It’s more convenient to go out to sea here. Once someone really catches it, it’s unreasonable to take him down. He can also In the first time, I left Ilyan and fled to the Federation. Unfortunately, the level of those who handled the case was limited, and they did not touch his tail, giving him the opportunity to grow and develop. To this day, there is no evidence to move him? Then ask Irian’s City Hall to agree to disagree! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His total investment in the eighth district is close to 20 million, which is not to say, he also hired 10,000 people in the fifth district "Work for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 20 million project, 10,000 or more jobs, a large amount of tax each year and the expected future profits and taxes, moved Du Lin, It means cutting meat on the body of the city hall. You don't need him to resist, the city hall will protect him. The rich people who have good relations with him can say a few words. This is influence. This is the value and significance of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of this message is not worth 10,000. Du Lin thinks it is worthwhile. The value is not the content of the message itself, but the special intelligence channel of Kevin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He welcomes the people in the investigation bureau to come to Irian to find him. He wants to see what kind of tricks these people can play. He is confident that he is safe and sound. Spend this "crisis". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time always slips away from people's fingers without knowing it. In the blink of an eye, the streets of Irian are very deserted, and the winter break is coming. At this time, the outdoor temperature is only ten degrees, and the seaside wind is still big. There are few people who are willing to run to the beach in such a weather. It is not enjoyment, it is a crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two small news happened during this time. The first news was the first professional actor training school in the Empire, which was born in Ilyan. In addition to Freina, Du Lin also hired several well-known, highly skilled supporting actors and some older protagonists, who will become the first teachers of this school. The school enrolled the entire society. It was not long before the students announced that there were many students who came to report, and there were also students who were arranged by Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this, the second thing is that Dulin’s winery is finished. His request was to build the factory at the fastest speed and then to drink. They set up the frame first, and then made it after the renovation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin is in the winery, full of intoxicating fragrance everywhere, here is a long time like a drink of wine Dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Rhodes, who has been appointed as the general manager of the winery, smiled and walked over with a glass of water. He handed the cup to Doolin. Du Lin carefully looked at the liquid in the glass. Some are turbid and pinkish white. This is the so-called "raw pulp". Because there is no distillation process, these liquids are the real "raw pulp". He took a sip and had a very obvious wine taste, which seemed to be heavier than the other wines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, although it was a bit sour, but it was already a good wine. "Higher alcohol? When can I come out?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhodes is very happy that Du Lin has not criticized or talked about this new wine, which means that he is very satisfied with these wines, the old man said with a smile: "A high degree of wine also needs For about a week, let Longxue absorb the impurities and water in the wine as much as possible, so that the color is high and the degree is high!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
