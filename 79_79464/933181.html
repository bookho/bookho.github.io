			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Nasha, you worked in the Empire Star, how much do you think the Empire Star is worth?", Doolin took a copy from the drawer. The report is placed on the table. "This is the sales report for the fourth quarter. There will be some sales in the last ten days, so it will not be recorded here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nasha understands the meaning of Dooling, the company was founded by Du Lin, and he also supported this company as the first brand in the current tape industry, with a very broad audience, among consumers. Word of mouth is also very positive. People like to look at the tape of the Empire Star trademark, which has politicians who are constantly out of the ocean, even those who speak without going through the brain, some small programs that are very popular, and the last most popular melodrama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few words that can’t be said that the actors who perform in a deductive way can never forget, and at any time recall some of them. Bridge, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. They are always looking forward to what kind of jokes these people will make in the next episode, and even consumers write letters to the Empire Star, hope that this sitcom can be played forever, and never have the end of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also said that the heart of the empire is the messenger sent by God to the world, spreading happiness to humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of feedback like this, no doubt, as long as the Empire Star Media Company continues to maintain the current excellent production and standards, the market share in the tape market It will only grow bigger and bigger. She remembered that when she became executive president of the Empire, Du Lin told her that when people used the hosts, actors and melodrama in the Empire Star as part of their daily lives, they succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, just like getting a cup of coffee every day, baking two slices of bread, making a fried egg and frying some bacon, this is the daily life, see the Empire Star tape is also a daily! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrible influence, the more you know, the more Nasha feels that Doolin’s counter-question is very difficult to answer. This is a bottomless gold mine, and she can give the price, Du Lin should not be satisfied. She regretted that she had worked in the Star of the Empire. She had not learned the business of squinting and talking about her words. It was clearly a gold mine and could be said to be a mud mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Nasha said, "I have a villa in the emperor, the eleventh oak oak, the best house!", she finished After a pause, Du Lin did not express it. She knew that it was not enough, so she added it. "There are three buildings in the center of the Imperial City. Although they are burned, they can be used after repairing or rebuilding. The location is very good. "Du Lin still didn't speak, which made Nasha's heart sink." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villas in the Imperial Bay of Oaks, especially the villas on the 11th, have sold more than 2.5 million if sold. Under the Oak Bay is the Empire Bay. At that time, the real estate merchants made a hoe, opened a small lake in the middle of the mountain, and planted many oak trees next to the lake. They pumped up the sea from the Bay of Empires, then ran out from the other side, and farmed a lot of beautiful marine fish in it, keeping the water temperature between 27 and 30 degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small lake is Oak Lake. The house that was not so valuable is because of this small lake, the price is doubled, and the developer is willing to sell it. The strategy of not selling at a low price, as well as the perfect service, has attracted many rich people to settle here. According to the rules of Oak Bay, the top 20 is a big man who can buy it and become a higher area alone. After the 20th to the 50th, the rich can buy it. As for the 50th... There are only 50 houses in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the beautiful environment and the security of peace of mind, Oak Bay is also a country that merchants yearn for, and there are too many legendary tycoons and consortium representatives. There is a saying in the business district of the Imperial City - squeezing into Oak Bay means you have succeeded in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows the extraordinary charm of Oak Bay, which is hard to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than one million in the three properties in the city center. These two add up to almost four to five million. But Du Lin has not yet opened, Nasha is still considering what can be cut to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she bit her teeth, "plus the suburban manor...", she looked up at Doolin, the biggest she could afford. One more than the number, in addition to some odds and pieces of cash and some cash, these things can also be worth millions, but these millions are not so easy to cash. As for the ownership of the vast majority of newspapers in the Empire, it has been ruled as invalid under the witness of the Imperial Supreme Court and the Imperial Lifelong Justice. This is tens of millions of assets, so it is so light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family assets are separated from the remains of Mr. John, and the assets worth more than 10 million are reserved for Nasha. She can only come up with so much now. . The rest of the money will be used in the places where they need to be used in accordance with Mr. John's last words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slowly nodded, "Real!", he stood up, took the initiative to hold his clothes and reached out, and shook with Nasha, "This It seems that our first very formal handshake, congratulations on becoming the true master of the Empire Star, as the founder, I hope that under the leadership of the Empire Star, you can create greater glory and achievements!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you! Thank you very much!” Nasha was also a little excited. Taking the Empire Star means that the most important piece of the layout is placed in the frame, and the rest is to make other pieces to fill all the neutrals. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I ask a question?", Nasha's emotions are a little bit agitated, and her emotions have not recovered in the past few days, Du Lin nodded, she Continue to ask, "Why don't you like the George family, do we have anything to offend you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his mouth and smiled," From the time you started our cooperation as a gift to me, I don't like these decaying big families. For me, this is not for my face and opportunity, but you should feel it. I am happy and excited to work with me. Unfortunately, our two sides have different perspectives and different positions, so there will be some minor misunderstandings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha Smiling and nodded. "I understand, then transfer the book..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will let the secretary do it right away, you can go to Irian first, I I believe that people over there may be very anxiously awaiting this result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and After Shake said goodbye, Du Lin shook his head with a chuckle. He called and dialed the number of the lab. "Boss, what new ideas are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Stanley is answering the phone. These purely academic and research people are not like those in the academic world. They put too much energy and attention on research, they will not be like Edward. The instrument is extraordinary, graceful, and will not be like the flattering of the spring breeze like Edward. Turin may like their temper, some of them more pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stan's love because of this is because Du Lin always "a flash of light" came up with a burst of thoughts like a meteor passing over a large level, pushing them Research often has an unparalleled boost. In the research room, everyone agreed that it is possible that when Doolin was born, God kissed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course they will not consider Du Lin as a Guar, according to their actual relationship, his gods and Gods should be the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thoughts? There is no idea, but there is good news, I will come up with two more for you to use the cable signal transmission fidelity and decoding. The problem, you can hire more people, you can buy all the materials you want to buy, including the patents owned by people!", when Du Lin finished this sentence, he heard the cheer of Stan Ein, he quickly of this matter conveyed to the others, the research laboratory constantly ringing "the boss is a good man", "the boss nothing like capitalists" like embarrassing flattery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
