			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Igor kissed his wife’s cheeks after eating breakfast. He hung himself and felt a disgusting smile with his wife and children. After leaving, I left the house. At the moment he closed the door, his almost perfect smile, who played the good father and the good husband, was put into the "drawer" and replaced with a touch of boredom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to be like this. He used to love his wife and love his children. He is almost willing to give everything he has. I only hope that they are healthy and happy. But when he became the director of the telegraph office, everything changed inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sorted out his clothes and greeted his neighbor with a smile and sat in his car. He recalled what happened before returning home last night, the female operator. Sometimes he is a bit disgusted with this, but I don't know why whenever someone uses this method to deal with him, he can't completely control his own desires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car started slowly on the road, the scenery inside the block has not changed for more than a decade, only the appearance of those people, and the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I faced this temptation, on a sunny afternoon, he just became the director of the Telegraph Office. There were seven telegraph bureaus at the time. An employee, including him, is eight people. For the telegraph office at the time, there were not so many staff members here, so Igor thought that the first work plan after he took office was "reduction of staff." He had to lay off four people and left only three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person is responsible for daily file preparation and documentation, one person is responsible for the transmission and reception of the telegram, and there is a situation where a person is in a state of emergency, plus him It is enough for the Secretary to have only four people in the entire telegraph office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he put his thoughts out, those people have some incredible faces... it should be fear. After all, there are not many wages here, but the benefits are very good, and the work is not busy. Everyone may complain that the job is not very satisfactory, but in fact everyone cherishes the job and no one wants to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a cruel thing to pick four out of seven people, but Igor thinks this is necessary. After the new party took office, it has not built any new departments. Instead, it has merged some departments and proposed to streamline the ideas of the members of the organization. He did this in order to cater to the governor and the higher-level ruling. He was very ambitious and thought that he might be able to climb higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the day he announced the incident, when he got rid of the documents on his desk after work, and collected some drafts to leave, the female telegrapher at the time did not ask for the door. . He still remembers that it was autumn, the female telegrapher wore a nice coat, and he stood up and sat down to ask the female telegrapher what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her coat and revealed the white lace underwear inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the body of the second woman Igor saw in addition to his wife. He struggled and struggled with his own desires. When the woman took off all her clothes and sat on his lap and took him into the chest, his brain was blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the female telegrapher stayed and became the winner. Although her approach is somewhat despicable, perhaps this is precisely their most sharp weapon for women. Since that day, Igor has become interested in women other than his wife, whether it is a female subordinate or a technical woman on the street. When he comes to sex, he will find these people to solve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything will have a fresh future, just like love, everyone’s love will have an unforgettable, passionate time. But after this time has passed, everything will be flat, and Igor is also. When those women could no longer give him more freshness, he began to change his goals and aimed at those women who had husbands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also studied his own behavior. He believes that he is not looking for pleasure from the body, but is getting deeper satisfaction through psychology and is deeply immersed. Among them, you can't extricate yourself. When he saw that the women were complacent and had to show themselves their bodies and all their enthusiasm as their husbands, he was more excited than doing anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that he is a perverted, psychologically distorted metamorphosis. He had a secret and didn't tell anyone. He used to find someone to do something he shouldn't do after his wife was intoxicated. That made him very excited, but he didn't dare to do it for the second time, because he was a man with a head and a face. He couldn't let his chaotic private life ruin himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at himself in the mirror, Igor vacated his hand and patted his cheek. This long-awaited flame was called by him. After Natalie’s woman refused, she began to surge again. He needs a perfect vent to get the woman out of his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he didn't want to think about it, the more his horrible thoughts rolled in his mind. He suddenly reversed the steering wheel, and the sudden turn of the car caused the driver behind to cock up the middle finger and scream. He couldn’t take care of this. He was heading in the direction of the station in the opposite direction to the telegraph office. He needed to find someone to find someone who was not living in Nam Lindes and talk to him. Transaction, then send him to leave forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His car is parked outside the station. The special status and environment of Nano Lindes makes it happen to many people from other places every day. People leave this paradise from here. He ordered a cigarette, sat in the car, observed each one coming out of the station, and not quite like the residents of Nam Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he shook his head, and a burly strong man walked past his car. There is no doubt that this strong man is definitely not a resident here. He is wearing very rustic clothes and is still very old. He is not as good as the coolies in the station. He should come from outside to seek work. He doesn't like brawny, because it will appear to be "small" and he likes those who are similar to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting for a while, the new train arrived, and a group of people went out from the station, he ordered another cigarette, and his eyes looked at each It is a man from a foreigner who stops. In the end, he was disappointed to see that the group left and did not find a suitable one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10 o'clock noon, he has been waiting here for two hours, and when he is about to give up, his eyes are bright! There was a person he was satisfied with coming out of the station. He didn't look like a person from Nalinders. He also said that he was not right to guess. The other party does not look like a poor person. It seems that he still has a little money from his dress. When he looked around and looked at himself inadvertently, Igor realized immediately that this was the person he was going to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately pushed the door and went out, quickly catching up with the guy, the guy was very alert, he only followed less than thirty seconds, the other Stopped and turned to look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swallowed a sip, squeezed a smile and pointed to the car not far away. "That is my car, I have a business want Talk to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man shook his head and said that he left without interest, Igor chased two steps, and the man turned back again. At that time, there was a gloss in his eyes that he couldn't tell, just like... Looking at the lions in the zoo looking at the crouching in the cage. He took two steps and raised his hand to show that he was harmless. "I really have a business that I want to talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
