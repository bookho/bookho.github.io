			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff said at night that her brother will arrive around nine o'clock in the evening, so she has to pick it up, this time to remind Du Lin to think of it. Merlin should also be here today, he almost forgot. After he made a phone call to Mason to confirm, he called Duff, who was packing and preparing to leave. Since her brother and her brother are coming tonight, it is better to take care of them together, so that you can save something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Eat something to eat at night and pick up people, wait for me to drive." Du Lin picked up the car key and put it in his pocket. He has been sleeping in the town hall. He can't afford to buy a house here. It's just that the nearby houses are going to be demolished soon. Maybe he will move just a few days later. He doesn't want to do this. If you go far away, you can't sleep for a while, and you just live in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to not having so many entertainment projects outside, it is actually quite comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said, Dove only said that when he was polite, he immediately said: "It doesn't matter, I will go by myself, you have to rest at night. "She said that her face was a little red. Her parents wrote to her every day. The letter told her more than once that she must firmly grasp the line of Doolin, and now the feminist movement is in full swing, taking the initiative." Some are not anything... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Dove had not considered this situation, it would be inevitable that there would be some embarrassing thoughts under the constant enthusiasm and promotion of his family. She wondered if Du Lin felt that she might be in danger of walking alone at night, so she drove herself to pick up Buck's bastard. However, this embarrassing atmosphere had not been rotated a few times in her body and was pierced by Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to worry, my brother should be the same bus, pick it up by the way." He took a thin coat and it was already In September, September in the north is cooler than in September in the south. The cold air blowing from the farther north brings a touch of coolness to this hot autumn, plus the geographical environment around the city of Otis. At night, the wind will become bigger and the temperature will drop to twenty-four degrees. It will feel a little cold without wearing a coat at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devef understands that he is really "multi-hearted", a little embarrassed, bowed his head and left the city hall behind Doolin, and sat Got a car from Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will go to the nearby construction site and take a turn, then find a place to eat. After dinner, we will pick them up later. What do you think of this arrangement?" Du Lin inserted the car key into the keyhole, leaning his head. Asked, Dove has not broken free from the shackles. She did not answer but just nodded and touched some hot connections. Du Lin looked at her strangely, and stepped on the pedal of the power cabin. The car rolled up a burst of dust and rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times and pasts, when the whistle of the train came from afar, it was already a few minutes at 9:30 pm, the steam locomotive was The time spent in Nano Lindes exceeded the expected time. The train conductor and the flight attendants got off the bus and had a dinner. It took more than an hour to eat, so everyone could wait for a while. Fortunately, although it was late but not too late, it was only 30 minutes late, which is not too late for people of this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam locomotive that used to take this route never stops in the city of Otis, but it can grow up with the speed and reputation of the city. I will stay a little longer. Some people in this nearby city have begun to travel to Otis to find new opportunities in life and want to change their ordinary life and destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck found Merlin and Alisa before getting off the bus. His eyes were fixed on the man who occupied his seat and firmly took the man’s appearance. Remember in my heart, as long as there is an opportunity, he will definitely return the shame of today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never been as shameful as he is today. He feels that his face has been torn by the other side and thrown on the ground, and he has stepped on a few feet. This kind of shame and humiliation made his heart rate speed up a lot, and his breathing was a little short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Irian, who didn’t know that his sister was Doolin’s maid and housekeeper? Every time I go out, there are all kinds of people he knows, or people who don’t know him say hello to him. Even if they have a little dispute with others, the other party will soon choose to give in after knowing his identity. After all, Mr. 350,000 is too famous, and this rich man, especially after Du Lin may be suspected of murdering Juan, can still be acquitted, no one wants to provoke Du Lin, and Du Lin has Relationship people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucker mistakes the awe of these people for Doolin as a reverence for him, and gives him the illusion that "I am also a big man", but he Without such a big face, he thought the world too simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three people came out of the station, Buck stood on the steps and looked around. He immediately pointed to a car parked in the distance and said to the two people around him: "Hey, my sister came to pick me up, or you guys. Let's go with me. After all, time is already late. It may not be convenient to find a place to live." In fact, Buck is not a bad person. He just raised his hand at home and did not get a mouthful of reality. So there is still a little innocence and fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, he is actually a good guy. The only downside is that he always feels that he is the center of the universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shook their heads, Merlin knew where to find Du Lin’s bastard, and Alisa, who stood next to him, knew, so they didn’t plan Leave with this "very powerful" funny artist. Buck felt a little pity, so he smiled and said goodbye to the two. He had not heard a few steps and heard a rush of footsteps. He looked back in surprise, and Merlin and Alisa had caught up with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes to make friends, at least in Irian, and almost every third of Dove’s monthly salary will fall on him. In the hands of others, he became a friend of "derogatory" in the mouth of others. Although several real friends told him that others were cutting him, he was happy. He likes the feeling of being surrounded by people, even if he spends a little money for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just before he greeted and introduced his sister to the two friends, both of them crossed him to the car. He looked at it with a little stunned look, followed the past and walked in front of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This must be my brother-in-law, knowing that my brother-in-law is very great here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck’s words have not been finished, his "sister-in-law" has left the car, he knows Du Lin, and has seen a few faces. Once he also asked Dove to go to the 350,000 manor to play, but was ruthlessly rejected, so he also had a few weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was just about to say something, Du Lin took him away and walked over to the guy behind him who was silent and called Merlin. After a glance, hug together. This made Buck's chin almost fall to the ground, hell, what is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could he know Du Lin? If you don’t know why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short embarrassment, Buck laughed a few times. Anyway, he spent all day in the shackles. This little cockroach could not hurt his sensitive and fragile heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, Melissa is very good...", Du Lin teased a sentence, and when he finished, Merlin used a little gas, Le Dulin I am about to turn my eyes. He pushed Merlin and took a deep breath to break free from Merlin's arms. "Welcome, brother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is not only when it comes out Silly, Alisa on the side is also stupid. If you talk about the relationship with Du Lin, I am afraid that no one on the scene can match Meilin. Even Alisa is unbelievable, should she be so clever? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin smiled and patted Du Lin’s shoulder, and Du Lin took a step to the other side. He screamed at his painful shoulder. Sentence, "Daddy said that the brothers of Layton's family are the species of the dragon. In fact, I think you are too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he looked to Alisa. The smile greeted the past. "You are also welcome. Why don't you call me before you come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa is coming back, gnashing her teeth : "I am afraid that you ran!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin laughed like a spring breeze, "I am such an uncomfortable person in your mind?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that Alisa would continue to fight against him. I didn’t expect the next second. Alisa took a few steps to get close to him, grabbed his body, and suddenly he was completely emotional. The crash, crying out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose and tears swelled like a river after the rain, and Du Lin smacked her back while comforting her, "What happened?" Things need to run so far to find me? Is someone bullying you? Or what happened to Mr. Bain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa turned his head, emotions Once again, the whole person is shaking from the slightest. "We... our children are lost!" After she said this sentence intermittently, she almost cried and couldn’t breathe, even Dove’s eyes were wet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until this moment, Alisa’s long pain was finally released. Whether in front of Mr. Bain or in front of Mrs. Bain, she is very strong and even comforts them. But only in Doolin here, she is helpless like a little girl who lost her face on a rainy day, tearing her heart, crying, helpless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
