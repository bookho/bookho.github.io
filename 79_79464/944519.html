			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The change in the city of Otis is really big, the mayor of Doolin is indeed a talent!", Felicia changed a set of casual and Vito Walking on the streets of Otis, their family knights, now the bodyguards, have been following them, examining every passerby close to Felicia. Because of her dressing and makeup, no one recognizes her identity, she only regards her as a son-in-law of a wealthy family. This lineup is no stranger to the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitor does not want to admit this, but he can only nod his face, otherwise they will not appear here, "the layout of the streets and these shops, entertainment venues The layout is very characteristic, just like... I don't know how to describe it. It seems to satisfy everyone's requirements for travel and shopping. This planning ability is very unique."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every street, every store, what kind of store and special sales items are all personally checked by Du Lin. The most striking places on a street are the street and the street. Because people enter a new street, interest and curiosity will be completely stimulated, just like there is a mysterious treasure waiting for them to discover the excavation, so these shops on the street will be very serious to visit and have a certain passion. The role of shopping will be stimulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So street shops are dominated by luxury goods and high-end stores, and some blind tourists will choose to buy something they like but may not use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As visitors spend their energy on these shops in the street, curiosity will fall sharply in the second stage, they will only pay attention to what they like. Content, not all content, will go through it. At this time, some goods and handicrafts with local characteristics are more popular. People will always buy a pile of meaningful souvenirs on their way to remember the memories of the places they have been to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the third leg is reached, there will be a significant drop in physical strength and energy. Some visitors will choose to take a break at this time, some cafes, simple restaurants, Entertainment and rest areas will be very popular. After waiting for the visitors to replenish their strength, most people will choose to continue to visit, instead of leaving because they are tired and leaving to find a place to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When visitors enter the fourth leg of a street, the desire to purchase and curiosity are almost exhausted, and even the things they like will not take the initiative to see. Unless it's particularly attractive, the shops around this time become a store of light entertainment content, such as some outdoor game consoles or indoor entertainment projects. You don't need a lot of time, you don't need too much money, and you can get back the feeling of happiness with a little money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it arrived at the fifth section of a street, that is, at the end of the street, Du Lin arranged some light luxury goods stores here, and the price would be more close to the people. When tourists find that they have spent ten yuan on the street to buy goods, they are famous for their gas, but when they can buy eight yuan, seven dollars or even six dollars, they will consider whether or not they want to buy them. Buy one or two things for others, or use them yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge gap in prices and the subtle gap in fame make them feel that it’s a good deal to buy some goods at the end of the street. Let them re-enter the store for blind shopping and leave a lot of money to take away what they rarely use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for giving away... maybe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every street has a similar arrangement, and there will be certain themes, which ensures that each street has a distinctive atmosphere and cultural color. It won't let people wander around a street and enter the second street to create a feeling of "I just came here before" and "I am here just like the front." They will be full of curiosity again and continue their shopping journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no excavations for ordinary families, they will shop around to choose goods, they continue to travel to and from various stores to maintain a high degree of purchase, will It brings a lot of popularity and shopping atmosphere to the entire street and even the commercial area of ​​the whole city, so that some people who do not plan to buy things also have the idea of ​​buying something to bring back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very deep study, or Du Lin’s dream of listening to a master who specializes in the layout of commercial districts in the dream, Daxie invested A cultural street, invited the master to come, a simple chat for ten minutes, Daxie decided to give the master plan to the master. The effect is of course excellent, and the word-of-mouth effect has been formed in the short term. He has “sneaked a little bit of learning” and used the concept of the master here, which also played a very effective effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ferrari walked from the street to the end of the street, she was followed by two carts filled with things she bought. The goods here are as cheap as ordinary people to go to the wholesale market. Except for the real master craftsmanship, there seems to be no mass production that can make her people like this feel expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When coming out of the street, Fei Lijia still has a high interest. If she didn’t look back at the cart behind her, she didn’t know she’s already Purchased so many things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to find someone to look at the business planning methods here. I think there is a deep learning in it. Once the new SAR is built, it will become very troublesome to make changes. So it must be built before the new district. Put the plan well.”, Fei Lijia said as she walked, Vitor recorded while walking. After the pedestrian turned three streets, the cart behind him had expanded to four. This is still the convergence of Fei Lijia. the result of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some surprise-looking passers-by around, she asked the maid to return the goods to the hotel, and then found a special restaurant to eat "Stone meal". This restaurant is based on the contents of the Stone Age. According to historical handwriting and some historical documents, in the early days of the origin, people were in the Stone Age. It was an era of scarce resources, and everything was related to stones and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restaurant is a good way to rehabilitate the human diet in the early days of the early ages. The whole restaurant is full and they only found one after spending fifty dollars. The table, which had just been replaced, had a very interesting lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole table is a huge round stone, and there will be a sunken hole in front of each person’s seat, which uses twin crystals as a fuel for heating. Originally used is fire, which is more characteristic of the origin. Later, after visiting this restaurant, Du Lin put forward his own opinion. The flames are too easy to cause fires. If a fire breaks out, it is not a shop or two shops. It is likely to spread to more shops. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin gave the owner of this restaurant two choices, either changing the way food is cooked as a heat source, or rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last boss chose the crystal, on the top of the crystal is a slate that has been soaked with butter after processing, all the dishes are raw food. The way is presented in the middle of the table. After the guests wear the apron, they can cook it themselves, mainly by frying. In addition to the barbecue, the barbecue is made in the back hall and cannot be operated by the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth mentioning that all the tableware in the restaurant is made of beef bones, which gives people a feeling of being surrounded by a strong cultural atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meal made Felicia more and more surprised. This kind of creativity and the way she saw it for the first time, this use of hot slate makes The process of cooking their own food has brought great pleasure to the guests. Looking at the very thin beef on the slate and the sizzling sound is more satisfying than eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a meal and eating for more than an hour, Fei Lijia felt a bit full for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the restaurant, Fei Lijia suddenly remembered something and asked: "Du Lin took a handwriting for me in the morning, it is a squiggly, I am curious about this, let's check it out and see what he did during this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I suddenly remembered it and said Out, Fei Lijia also has his own consideration. In the morning, she didn't take this matter seriously. She could be sure that she and Vitor had not used such a handwriting by the people around her. The only letter sent to Doolin did not have any fierce content. Tell him that someone in the Fatima family is coming over, I hope he can receive it, although he did not receive it, there have been some minor contradictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these are the little contradictions. Suddenly, Felicia realized that this might be a problem. The reason why Du Lin did it was obviously not wanting her to see the letter. All the content, then will Doolin blame this on her head? It was not without this possibility. She only had a hand with Du Lin. If Du Lin was threatened to let him think that this was his own, wouldn’t he have to escalate the contradiction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to the street in the morning, Fei Lijia realized that Du Lin was a very talented person. She did not intend to turn Du Lin into her own family. People, but she still hopes that if possible, Du Lin will be able to help in the planning of the new district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, both sides must have a more harmonious attitude, at least not to hate each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitor nodded immediately, and he and the family bodyguards around him said, the bodyguard disappeared into the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri Lijia’s day’s whereabouts were all overwhelmed by Du Lin’s, and he’s not yet teaching this arrogant lady, after all, in his The accident on the site was a serious blow to his personal reputation and his reputation in the city of Otis. So he had to wait for Fei Lijia to leave the city of Otis before he could give the other a small lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is currently on the phone with Mr. Jack. From the last exchange, it seems that poker seems to have some cooperation with the hymn consortium, otherwise he can’t be so clear. The reason why the hymn consortium wants the casino. Not all the wealth in the hands of the nobility is unseen, and this is only a very small number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
