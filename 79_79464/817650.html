			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Amp was calculating Du Lin, Kevin was also calculating Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneys and prosecutors are always dead, one is for money to go to hell, one is for their own justice can push others down to hell, say bad Who is more holy, anyway, is for what they think of "justice." Prosecutors want to send those rich people into jail, lawyers are the last line of defense of the rich, this is to thank the new party for coming to power, at least let the lawyers have a place to use, and no longer a fig leaf under the cover of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin has investigated Amp, and Amp has also investigated Kevin. After all, one of the two is a leading figure in the prosecutor, and the other is the lawyer industry. The star of tomorrow, the thorough understanding of the opponent, will be able to maintain their own record on the stage where they may face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin touched the smooth chin, and he stood in the room on the second floor with his arms, looking at the calm sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left a fairly perfect path for himself. He controlled a suicide by Juan and hid a suicide note in Juan’s stomach. The way to arrange the traps, let Amp return without success. As long as you have spent the last ten days, there will be new ideas on the emperor's side. This case is almost here. Kevin didn't know all of Doolin's plans, but he already felt the general idea of ​​Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the provisions of the Imperial Law, any crime can only be sued once for the same person, that is to say, if this financial fraud case, Amp filed a formal Litigation, then Du Lin just eluted his suspicion, even if he found new evidence in the future can not sue Du Lin through this case, Du Lin even if it is really out. But will Ampu do that? Will he directly sue Du Lin without sufficient evidence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin believes that this is impossible. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp is willing to hold the evidence in his hands, and will slowly collect Du Lin in the future when he slowly collects evidence that he can give Duolin a fatal blow. File a lawsuit and then hammer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what he has to do is to let Amp stand up and file a lawsuit against Du Lin, then he will file a counterclaim against Amp, and he is exempt from Du Lin’s crime. At the same time, he took Amp to court on charges of falling, shackling, persecution, and perjury. Once any complaint is established, Amp will be finished, and he will take another step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how do you let Amp think that he has mastered everything to accuse Doolin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence in his hand certainly did not form a complete chain of evidence, or Kevin’s understanding of Amp, he had already applied for the arrest of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are bright - concoct evidence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of perjury and concocting is strictly a bad crime, which is different from those of passionate crimes and sudden crimes. In the case of knowing the consequences, I still choose to trample on the law and know the behavior of good deeds. It can be said that it is not found to be okay. Once it is discovered, it is a felony. Kevin doesn't care. He is as proficient in all kinds of laws as Amp. He can even say that he knows more about what they are doing than the judges and the people who make the law, so he doesn't care about his behavior at all." Offended the boundaries of the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no, he didn't break the law, he is innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately contacted Doolin according to the contact information left by Dooling. "Hey, man, I have an idea, but I need you to give me some help." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking out, it’s best to be practical." The voice of Doolin in the receiver seemed a bit out of tune, and Kevin snickered, he knew this. The guy must be in a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin said his thoughts without any detail, "I intend to help our friend Amp, help him get a set that he thinks is a little risky." But it is worth the chain of evidence. As long as he sues you, he will be finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?", Kevin smiled. "Don't you have your own way out? And by then all the evidence will prove to be fraudulent, and the witness will also retract, plus you. Those things in your hand, what do you think people will see Amp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kevin said it, Doolin understood that this is a real The devil, like the people in the city of Tener, commented on him, he is the spokesperson of the devil! Once the evidence is falsified, once the witness confesses and adds clues to his own intelligence, others will think that Kevin has created a perjury attempt to frame Doolin for something he does not want to admit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of behavior may not be a problem for lawyers, and even many rich people like this kind of unscrupulous lawyer. But for the prosecutor, it is definitely a fatal blow. They are the spokespersons of justice, the justice and justice of the executors, but they actively use the extreme way of crime to control the principle of justice. His prosecutor career is not only It will end here and even be guilty of imprisonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Amp took off his shiny protective cover, he lived in prison for a month. Even if Doolin does not shoot, the gang leader, star politician, and the unscrupulous rich man who he was sent to prison will want to take his life to revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin this guy, really is not a thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin likes it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take my call to Jose, I will arrange it, and during the time before I return, he will listen to your instructions. But Kay Wen, I have to say to you before you start, if there are any mistakes that make you 'carelessly' throw me in...", Du Lin’s words did not say, and some words did not play any role. It is better to let Kevin think for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, if Du Lin is stuck, Kevin will definitely live for a month, and the 70 million in his hands can make seven thousand anytime, anywhere. A killer went to kill Kevin one after another, and even if Kevin was hiding in the palace, someone would take him out and send him on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin knows this too, he has no worries. "Do not worry, we are not the first time to cooperate. I don't know if you are a person." "", he said, he laughed. "I do the money, everything is for the customer service. For me, you are God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone Finally, he handed it to Jose’s hand. He listened to the phone and hung up the phone. He also had some smiles on his face. “Mr. Kevin, boss let me tell you, you can give me anything. Do, in Irian, there is no thing that boss can't do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin doesn't even bother to look at Jose's shoulder and walk toward the house. "That's great, I like your guarantee, this is proof of friendship between me and your boss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next ten minutes, Carter From the fifth district to the manor, Kevin hurriedly left after he explained a few things to him. After telling all the things that need to be done, Kevin let Jose drive the car and send him to the fifth district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote control in the manor, how can I see the amps in the first line? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning genius is bright, and the alarm in the room will wake Up. He blinked and sat up from the bed, squinting for a moment, then sighed to the window and opened the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn of winter is particularly late, the sun has risen in the summer, but at this time the whole city is still dark. The light from the sea has already allowed passers-by to see the scenery in the city. After grooming, he changed his clothes and just got out of the door. He accidentally saw a white envelope on the carpet behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately realized what he was doing and went back to the room to call the police officers and his team members. Under the gaze of everyone, he picked up the envelope with a scorpion and placed it on the table. He carefully opened the envelope and took a letter from it. There was a paragraph on the letter, and he read it in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know the truth behind Juan’s suicide, at ten o'clock in the evening, at the cemetery, waiting for you for ten minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then passed the letter to others and then took the evidence bag. He is not blindly optimistic, because they did not have a big fan when they came here. It can be said that only Du Lin and the official people in the whole city know their identity. But this person gave the most wanted thing for Amp, who is he? What is his purpose? What does he want? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is a mystery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arranged for people to fingerprint the envelopes and stationery, and told the team members to investigate the people they had contacted during this time. He decided to go to the writer of the letter, but he also had to figure out what identity the person had and what purpose he had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, this is the breakthrough of this case. I will go with my weapon at night. You will arrange two cars, don't rely too close. If I have anything If you have an accident, you will fire a warning shot. Don't come over until I have notified you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything starts to prepare for the evening, Amp goes to the police The bureau borrowed a bullet-proof vest and bought a large windbreaker. The investigation team's work almost completely stopped. In the predicament, everyone was quietly waiting for this sudden situation to give them directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
