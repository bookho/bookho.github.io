			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August, the long struggle between the Federation and the Empire’s tug-of-war was finally over. The Federation acknowledged the failure of the war and compensated the empire for a federal shield equivalent to 10 billion stars. Ten years of payment, before the full payment, the empire will control the tariff and trade rights between the federal and the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a replay of more than twenty years ago, but this time the loser became a federation. At the same time, the Empire and the Commonwealth reached a new agreement that many people could not understand after the ceasefire agreement. The Empire used interest-free loans and materials every year. The way of aid has “humanitarian” assistance to the federal government and has undertaken a large number of urban reconstruction efforts to help the federal government recover from the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just the latter one, it’s still clear that to help the federal reconstruction, then the federation must give money, and how to price sure the builders have the final say. But why did the empire win the war, but still give the federal money, to the federal things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of people who have always adhered to the tone of conspiracy theories. They believe that the spies of the empire must hide the spies from the federation, so the cabinet is deceived by deception. Only made such a faint decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, people will never understand that short-term politics will never be wrong, even long-term policies may be wrong, and wrong is not The purpose and policy of the policy, the mistake is the progress of the times, let the original plan deviate from the goal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room of Magus, Magus sits At the desk, watching Du Lin, who was lazy and squinting in the sun, some of the dissatisfied slammed the two desktops. "Do you understand what I said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;[#################################################################################################### He is always lazy in the afternoon, although Magus understands that young people need a long body, and it is normal to be sleepy in the afternoon, but they are not ordinary people and cannot enjoy everything that ordinary people can enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This society, this country has given them too much care and privilege, they must abandon these meaningless waste of time, to think about how to make this empire Become stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Ah!", Du Lin blinked and sat up straight. "I heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a bit late last night, originally I want to pursue the sublimation of the soul together with Ophelia, and let the frequency of the mind be synchronized before the engagement, but unfortunately, the little girl finally fled home. Then Kevin found him again. The two men drank together for a while. The wine became more and more spirited, listened to a midnight opera, and then exercised for a while before going to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some inexplicable now are sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus snorted, and there was a chill in the laughter that made Doolin feel a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the table and asked, "Have you heard? Very good, then talk about your views on aiding the federation, let alone those words!" He hasn't explained these things yet. Part of politics is based on personal ability to understand. The other part is that it needs to be taught and is indispensable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the elite education of the nobles able to cultivate more elites than ordinary social families? In fact, the truth is very short-answered, and the experience accumulated by each generation will be written. The way is instilled in the heads of these aristocratic young people. It seems that everyone is at the same starting line, but others are running, they are driving, and the finish line is slightly ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin lacks these accumulations, so Magus has been "making up the lessons" for Du Lin. When there are some new policies, he will use them as The case study gave Du Lin a hearing and let him understand why the cabinet would formulate policies that seem to contradict the mainstream values ​​of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assistance to the Federation is a good example, and it has not been done before. Magus believes that this is also what Du Lin needs to understand and understand. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that looking at Du Lin’s sleepy look, he’s not going to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh!", Du Lin scratched his head, patted his face and made himself a little spiritual, then thought for a while and gave an explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, it’s very simple, we have taken care of financial aid and material assistance." He ordered a cigarette in Magus’s frown. Then he went to the window sill and pushed open the window. He pulled the buttocks down on the window sill. His actions were really unrecognizable, but he didn't say anything. Some things can be easily reversed, and some things take longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said while smoking a cigarette. "Giving money is nothing more than raising the enemy's hatred against the empire by remnantly resisting the rebellion. It raises the war to the problem between the state and the country by increasing propaganda. It does not involve society and individuals. It uses financial aid to alleviate the hatred of the whole society. Secondly, after the money enters the federation, it will accelerate the circulation of stars in the federation, and change some federal people through silent currency invasion. The concept of deepening the degree of recognition of the federal people to the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"plus the necessary repayment period, can further effectively regulate the pressure and growth space of the federal economy "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, honestly, I think this is a very low level. The federal government should have effective countermeasures. They are very likely to take the money. As a margin for the issuance of the Federal Shield, rather than entering the market, unless in the next reconstruction work, all contractors are required to use the Imperial Star settlement, but I find it difficult."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Moreover, for most ordinary people in society, they are not exposed to too high-level things, perhaps for a short time they know that the empire will help them a year, But soon they will forget. The people who really know and enjoy the utility of this money are often the upper middle class of the federal society. They are the vested interests under the federal system, and they will not take these benefits. Spread out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recalling the issue of material assistance, in fact, this problem is the same as the above problem, achieving a silent invasion by exporting industry standards. The purpose. Even if only one-third of the cities are using the materials we provide, the industrial standards of these cities will be implemented in accordance with the industrial standards of the Empire, which means that there will be two standards in the federal industrial sector."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the context of an increasingly powerful national power and a more advanced industrial level, more companies will gradually begin to change their standard choices from the federal Quasi-advanced to the imperial standard and complete the standardization of industry. When the industrial development of the empire enters a new field, it is very likely to completely replace the federal standards, so that the federal industry is subject to the industrial development and technological scale of the empire." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether a country is strong, the industrial level is an important standard when the entire federal industrial environment is complying with imperial industrial standards..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spit a cigarette and glanced at Magus. "In the industrial sector, we have the final say." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus nodded with satisfaction, and he was somewhat curious. Is there really a god in this world? Or what other things like ghosts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s wisdom, his maturity, his point of view, his perspective on the problem and his understanding of the problem itself are not like a farmer’s country. Kid. It can be said that on many issues, he is more professional than some people who have received more professional and advanced education. He is like... knowing these things when he is born, it is inevitable to doubt his own understanding of the world. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people don’t have a clear understanding of this issue, as Du Lin said, when they aid federal supplies, industrial production machinery comes into play. At the time, when the federal industry began to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simplest example, what happens when a spindle with a value of one million machines breaks? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you spend thousands of dollars buying an empire-produced spindle, or do you have to take out one or two million to buy a new federal machine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the owner of the machine is a federal official, the comparison between thousands and one or two million can still tell how to make a choice of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where did Du Lin acquire these relatively partial knowledge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus couldn’t understand, but it didn’t prevent him from continuing to appreciate Doolin’s continued appreciation. A young man who was excellent in every aspect was born in the Empire, and It was discovered by him and then pulled into the circle of the nobility. This is a blessing for the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether Du Lin will be a highly sophisticated political talent trained by the federal or other countries, sent to lurk in the empire, Magus is not at all worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one day Doolin really did the Prime Minister, the first thing he had to do was to destroy everything that could affect him, including those illusory guesses. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undercovering is the biggest head, who sent him undercover, who is his biggest enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the investigation will continue to check, no matter how you always want to figure out, this little bastard knows exactly where it is from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
