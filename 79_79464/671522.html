			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You told me that no one has been in contact with my wife during this time. Is this your commitment to me?", Peter suppressed his anger, The eyes are slightly stunned, and the arrival of this letter will cause many things to lose control. The first sentence of the letter is equal to the name of the wild species in Vivienne's belly. The wild name is his "child". From now on, whether he admits or does not admit it, he must bow to reality and admit that the child is himself. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he must also carefully protect the wild species, not letting any threats approach him, and once he has encountered any danger to leave the world ahead of time, then he I am afraid that the mayor will be the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you haven’t touched the old man who is in power, you can’t understand an old man who can’t even sit up and have a terrible dominance over the state. . Perhaps the most important reason for supporting the Governor’s health to live to this day is the power in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only needs one sentence. In the mid-term election, Peter may have to bid farewell to the mayor, go to a more remote place to take care of something that is not important. A small official of power, such as a tax official. If he wants to keep his position and power and a decent life, he will bite his teeth and recognize the wild species in Vivienne's belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Vivian is free, and he has to step on the horse to protect her and the wild species in her belly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ones who caused this were the ones who came into contact with Vivian during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the question of the mayor’s suppression of anger, the housekeeper can only be treated with silence. He feels that his work is without any problems. Anyone who wants to contact a lady must first inform him, and no one has come to visit during this time. Even if two or three people come to the manor, they are all in his or the city. Growing up in the sight of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So who is in contact with Mrs. Vivian, and has passed some important news without God’s knowledge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler thought for a long time, there was no clue, and he couldn’t think of anyone who might exist to be able to reach Mrs. Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, the mayor, who had extremely strong emotional fluctuations, snorted and said: "The two policemen!" He was holding the housekeeper. The butler told him that it had a heavy rain that day. He gave two small things for sympathy and for some reason. The police entered the manor and rested in the manor for a moment. At this moment, no one knows whether the two little policemen are really resting, or secretly went to see Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person wants to make things he thinks more detailed and detailed, then all things that are subjectively impossible must be "probably" Consider it. There is no doubt that these two small police officers have all the conditions and a great chance of being "possible." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper’s lips moved, and if he wanted to defend, he did not say anything at the end. He did something wrong, even if there were some excuses that became meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter’s distracted screams and defenses, and the result is that he has put the “enemies” in. He reached out and took the stationery from the housekeeper's hand and continued to look at it. Except for the first sentence, which made him angry and attacked, the rest of the content was fairly peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to congratulations to Peter to be a father, the Governor also told him that if there is no accident, the old man will continue to support Peter in the mid-term election and will introduce some The important big man gave him a name. This is a typical slap in the face of a carrot, but it is also very useful. The big men in the Governor’s population may be the same as the big ones in Peter’s cognition, and they may be more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the network is a very simple and complicated thing, not to introduce someone to know you, it is equal to you and this person. Friends, built a network of contacts. There is still a need for more work for "leaders" so that everyone can have common interests and gradually take the people into their own interests. If there is an introduction by the Governor and the relationship between him and the Governor, I am sure that he will be able to get more support in the next election year, touch a higher level and get more power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade-off between pros and cons is nothing more than the addition of a wild son, and he is able to get so many heavyweight political returns, which he feels is not unacceptable. Anyway, the wild species will be "his own children" in the future. Appropriate discipline is also part of the father's love. Peter is much more frank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dinner is full, ask the two members and the family to come to the banquet, and...", Peter originally wanted the butler to inform Mrs. Vivian of the dinner. However, he thought about it and invited him in person. Waving his hand, the butler sighed and left the room immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to thank Peter for being a very self-controlling guy, otherwise he is not a letterhead, but something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor took a break and thought about some problems before going to the second floor and pushing the bedroom door. He looked at Vivian, who was sitting on the couch and reading, and walked over with a smile. "What book, so that you are so invested that you ignore my existence?" He picked up the only teacup on the table. Drink a small amount of tea tea soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne did not vent her hysterical after the husband’s violent beatings and shackles like ordinary women, she sat down in a dignified and elegant manner, fingers In the book page, the book was combined to reveal the cover of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a book about inspiring wisdom, called Confusion, written by a very famous philosopher who has been Pursue, until he began to inflate, began to slam the empire's political system and some administrative behavior, and then he disappeared into people's sight. Some mentally dark guys thought he said something that shouldn't be said, but the people wanted to hear it, so they were "cleaned up". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such conspiracy theories are happening almost every day, and as time goes by, this thing gradually fades from people's sight, leaving only A few hot books, as well as accounts that have not been used but have been injected every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you suddenly like to read this kind of book? If I remember correctly, art is what you are after, isn't it?", go aside In the hands of Peter, who was holding the teapot and coming back, he still had a fruit plate. The two men could not see the slightest anger, just like the ordinary couple in the ordinary family, conducting daily conversations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivian reopened the book and pondered for a while, saying: "Everyone has different ideas at each stage. There is a book in this book. It's very interesting to say that people's ideas are mostly based on their own desire for the world. When you need to eat, you will think of food. When you need to add water, you will think of water. In this way of explanation, Maybe I want to know more, so I want to read."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter patted the palm of his hand, "very straightforward explanation, it is also true. "He said that he paused and continued: "At night I invited parliamentarians and their families to have dinner here, you need to dress up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vivian nodded and said, "I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose has been reached, Peter patted his leg and stood up, "I went to work, there is something Let me know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Peter disappearing outside the door, and the door that was not closed, Mrs. Vivian’s mouth showed a little smile. She knew that she had won this round of competition and she was free. She will use freedom as the basis for all people to understand that she is not a ladder of power, nor is it a dispensable person, she will definitely become an important role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this state! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Delil walked into Doolin’s office in a veiled way. He was frightened during this time. He thought he would die. It may be buried in the suburbs, or it may drift on the agate river. When he got up this morning, he repeatedly thanked God for letting him live another day, until Mrs. Vivian appeared in front of him personally, and informed him that he was going to call the ladies, he was real. Take a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he did not forget Du Lin’s assignment to him. If Mrs. Vivian appeared in him, he must first inform Du Lin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, get a little reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is Mrs. Vivian's situation, mental state and physical condition, are there any injuries or being coerced?" Du Lin lowered his head in his hands. The banknote, one side, asks. His action on the banknotes also attracted Delier. Delier looked at the roll of money and couldn’t wait to grab it immediately, if he had the guts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is on, during this time Delier’s days are really bad, Mrs. Vivian’s did not hold a tea party, plus the listing of the director’s actions against him. The shadow caused, he has almost no income during this time. Delier, who had been focusing on the thick banknote of Du Lin’s hand, stunned and explained it immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Vivian's mental state is very good, I think she is better than her mental state for a while. Her temper is also good, when she speaks Very powerful, it was a person... Yes, she changed a new driver."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
