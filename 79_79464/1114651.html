			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis is not a place to govern, it has almost become the view of all the members of the old party, because the traces left by Doolin are too deep, any The newly appointed mayor can't change the style of the place here, unless he wants to move somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here is still a small city without hope as the end of the day, Du Lin has printed his own brand here. The city has given a new glory because of his existence, and has given birth to new vitality. There are rules that Du Lin has set for them in all walks of life. Whoever dares to break this rule is the enemy of all. Here, almost everyone's interests are entangled with the overall interests. It can even be said that even Du Lin wants to destroy the rules left by him. It is not an easy task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in the seven major casinos, this is also the economic pillar of the city of Otis, each shareholder’s shares are cross-shared with other shareholders. If you want to dig up a shareholder, it may involve the interests of four or eight other shareholders. If you want to settle the four or eight shareholders, then there are 16 or 32 shareholders who are affected by interest. Unless you are in full hands, you want to move the rules here, it is a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More trouble is that the town hall of the city of Otis is used, and the land used is the private land of Doolin, which is six percent of the city. The land of fourteen is owned by Doolin personally. Would you like to erase the brand of Doolin from this city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try it, but the ending is definitely not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I can’t resist Du Lin, I can only obey him. Today, with Doolin’s words, Mayor Webster wants to have a little bit of his own. The idea will not be unanimously opposed by everyone. He is like a hand-picked emperor... I don't know why this sentence is a bit ambiguous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking to Du Lin a few words, Webster got a very sensible side, and then the members of the business group of Otis City came to see you one by one. Du Lin, it may be wrong to see this word, but it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence continues to be remembered in Doolin’s ear. It took about ten minutes to stop. Doolin took the mayor's car and went to the largest and most luxurious hotel in the city. He needed to take a break here, chat with everyone, and then go to Nano Lindes tomorrow. . Of course, by the way, he has to turn around in some of his own industries, such as the token company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Otis City Tobacco Company has not yet been listed. The evaluation company of Xie Lisi Street has rated it more than one billion yuan of total assets, and this market value is still rising. This is the case, thanks to Otis. The overall development of the city is accelerating. To put it bluntly, it is more and more people who come to Otis to gamble, and more tourists, as a universal token in the city, has become an official currency of the city of Otis. In order to ensure the interests of the City Hall, Du Lin, who was also the mayor, established the token company to constrain the seven major casinos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casino gambling and shopping in the city’s business districts need to be settled in tokens, which are provided by the company, and finally these casinos and merchants take them The token is settled by the token company. The company collects tokens and pays cash, charging a one percent fee. Once any company or casino has broken the rules, the token company stops the settlement, which means they will have a huge loss in the settlement cycle. Initially, a settlement period was only three days. Now that everything is on track, and with the support of a more urban system, the settlement cycle has expanded from three days to twenty-one days, that is, three weeks to calculate a settlement cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any casino has more than a million chips per day. This is just the bottom line. It’s actually a better casino like Lucky Games. The daily token throughput is between 5 million and 10 million. Detaining funds for a billing cycle will make these shareholders scare their pants! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin has the safest trick, that is his land! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this city, Doolin is the king, the only king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, Du Lin also saw Buck, the younger brother of Dove, and Ernst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst’s expression is somewhat like the one that has been constipated for a long time. To be honest, he himself does not know whether this is the life he wants. The reason why he abandoned the mayor of Irian’s choice to follow Du Lin was because Hossington had promised to appoint Ernst to take over as the next mayor after he left, but Ernst is so good, let Hossington spent comfortably for eight years, so the bastard who did not comply with the agreement intends to leave Ilyan with Ernst and let him continue to be his secretary. This time, he angered Ernst. After he ran for so many years before running, wasn’t he just for his own party? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Hossington couldn't do it, he wouldn't have to continue to serve a person without credit, and then ran to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that you have a lot of power and wealth, even when Mayor Webster wants to make a new policy. Looking for him to discuss, and finally he agreed to the policy will be issued. It seems that he is similar to Webster's power, but it is worse, it is almost worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Ernst is the highest executive of the Otis Policy Research Office, and he has a major staff member called Buck. Obviously these two people were left idle, but Webster was very good at making people, but they could not find any reason and excuses to get angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin came back, Ernst wanted to ask if he had a chance to be a party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is already 37 years old this year. If he does not get a mayor’s quota after two years of general election, then this means the next opportunity will be It was only when he was 47 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years, can you wait for a few decades in your life? He has waited for Hosten for ten years, and everything has become a bubble. He does not want to wait another ten years, and he is still a future without any certainty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin, we have known for many years, can you tell me, do I have a chance to become a mayor in my life?", sitting in Doolin In the villa, Ernst did not say a little nonsense. When he came up, he threw out the core of the problem. "I am not too young. If there is no chance after two years, there may be no chance in this life." For this, Ernst saw it very clearly. At the age of forty-seven, he was not listed as a long-term director. Basically, he could say that he hoped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is here to fight Webster, he has no face to say this. Webster is very powerful. He always holds Ernst high, which gives Ernst a feeling of trepidation. Even if he sometimes has a chance to fight back, he will eventually give up after weighing the pros and cons. He feels that fighting here may not be able to fight this new mayor, and the idea of ​​changing a place is born in the heart, but it is not very easy to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin frowned slightly. "Are you dissatisfied with your current life? I heard that Weber cares and values ​​your opinion, those in the city." People also know that you represent my opinion to a certain extent. Isn't that enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am not the mayor." Ernst refuted the sentence, the power is bigger, the benefits are more, he is not the mayor, he is just an ordinary government official, not the mayor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin chuckled and shook his head. "Is a name so important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You can say that I am stupid, but for me, that is my pursuit and goal. Doolin, to be honest, do I have a chance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; If Ernst doesn't talk to Du Lin about these things, maybe he still has a chance, but he talks to Du Lin about this, but he has no chance. Du Lin is actually very optimistic about Ernst. At least during Irian, he was able to handle all the things properly, and people couldn’t pick up the problem. They also had their own ideas on the policy. Suddenly Du Lin found that this guy is a bit too quick and quick, is the mayor so good, or that he can't even fight with Webber, even if he is the mayor, he may not be more comfortable than now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his demon, this is very clear, but the constant growth of the demons is unconstrained, that is Ernst's own problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indulged for a moment and said, "If you believe me, when I am in the general election, I will give you a chance. I will not make sure that you will be able to Be the mayor of a city, but I will provide you with the best campaign team, sufficient funds, and a city without obvious camp bias. If you can complete the election and become the mayor, I will congratulate you. If you win No..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst suddenly became cheered up, and he smiled twice. "Then I will accept it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take two sentences to let Ernst leave, and Du Lin summoned Buck. Barker is much more mature than Ernst is not willing to be in the status quo. When Du Lin was here, Buck didn't feel that work was a difficult thing, but when Du Lin left, he gradually realized the difficulty of working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before people can see him on Du Lin’s face, after Du Lin’s departure, it may not be as tolerable as before, which makes Buck in the following I have suffered a lot in my work, and it has not happened once and for all. But in general, suffering is a necessity for life. Without suffering, there is no sharp blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
