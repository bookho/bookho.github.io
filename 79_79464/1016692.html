			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp finally said a few words and explained the tasks and went outside. He looked at the two men in plain clothes and thought of it for a moment. The military department, because these people have the "taste" of the military department. This kind of taste is not specific. You may not feel away from these people, but as long as you stay close to these people, you will feel the "taste" that they are constantly emitting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "taste" consisting of arrogance, suspicion, distrust, and other negative emotions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something?", Amp wiped the sweat from the palm of his hand with a handkerchief. At this time, it was already in early March, and spring also came, the temperature in the west. It rose to more than ten degrees, and the heating in the room made him feel hot in the process of assigning tasks and analyzing the case, and there was a lot of sweat in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two silently watched the sweat of his palms and said: "If it is convenient, I think it might be more appropriate for us to go to your office. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp hesitated, and finally nodded. There are people from the Security Council everywhere, and there are people from the military. He shouted that the two men could never leave the building alive. He reached out and invited. "Please come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three entered Amp After the office, the two men took off their hats and bowed their heads, which gave Ampton a sense of uneasiness. The subsequent words of the two confirmed that the anxiety in his heart was correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, Mr. Ampu, Ms. Anna was killed during her vacation. According to the letters left by her, we have put her relics in place. Downstairs, these are what she asked to be handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Amp heard and understood the contents of this sentence, it was black in front of him. For a moment, Anna is not good to him, but it is not bad. Both of them have their own ideas and pursuits, all have their own responsibilities and obligations, they will not bother each other, but often very tacit together. Anna unconditionally believes in Amp, this unconditional trust makes Amp himself particularly shocked, when did he have such ability? Although Anna’s trust is inexplicable, the feeling of being trusted is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time he was in the federation, or Anna went to bring him back... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it is only a matter of days and ten days. How can anyone die? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s hands are on the table, slowly sitting on the chair, his legs are shaking, he tries to control his emotions, and trembles with the same The lips spit out a few syllables, "How did she die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the officers in the military office put a portfolio on the table, Amp looked at the portfolio for a long time without moving, as if his gaze could penetrate the portfolio and see the documents inside. The officers of the two military departments looked at each other and could understand the impact of their own news on the news of Amp. One of them took the initiative to explain to Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Anna died of a knife wound. After forensic anatomy and simulation, she thought that the knife wound on Ms. Anna was thrown a very sharp dagger or knife. Caused by the waist and abdomen is the key, the internal organs rupture and bleeding, causing Ms. Anna to be seriously injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp has been taking a deep breath, between each breath The interval was very long, his chest slowly and vigorously undulating, and he slowly looked up at the talking officer. "Can you tell me where Anna died?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Northwest Small Town Tnel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of the name of Tyrn, Amp couldn’t help but think of Doolin, who is in the same city, he went to Tener for the first time. It left a stain that was not stained, and the gold robbery. Then his relationship with Doolin seemed to leave a "deaf" for him when he went to Tener. He studied Du Lin's family history. He thought that Turner was Doolin's nest. There are a large group of Tenells who are willing to die for him anytime and anywhere, and it is precisely because of this group that they have created the core members of the current Doolin interest group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo, Ellis, Jose, Savi, and the actress Freena and a large group of specialties around the surrounding of Doolin People. Amp has investigated these people. They are all from Tener without exception. It is enough to prove Du Lin’s influence in Tener. He even has a brother who is the police chief at the side of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Amp’s eyes lit up, what he thought of, then stood up and took the cane and shook hands with the two officers who sent things and sent them away. When he returned to the office, he immediately closed the door, opened the portfolio, and began reading each document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, outside the gates of the sunny Orodoro District Prison, an unshaven man walked out of the gate with a ruined travel bag. He covered the sun with his hands and walked out of the door slowly. At the moment he went out, he looked back at the slowly closed prison gate and felt that he had never been so good. He threw his travel bag on the ground, closed his eyes and looked up at the holy baptism of the sun, breathing a free air with a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in jail for three years, three years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was not because of his fault that he was in jail, because someone else’s fault became a scapegoat, and he was finally thrown into the cell by the group of bastards. After three years of suffering. In three years, he lost his dream, lost his hope, lost his family, and he lost everything! He used to think that all of his life had become a bubble from the moment the judge opened his mouth. He once wanted to commit suicide, but he supported it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also understood the truth in the past three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People should live for themselves and should not live for themselves in the eyes of others, so he no longer regrets everything he has lost. He thinks this prison is God's gift to him is to cleanse the soul of his soul, and to let him see the grace of the road ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he can live for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When standing on the side of the road waiting for the shuttle, he whistle and sit in the canopy of the station to rest, there will be three shifts every day from the city to the prison. Going back in a circle, more than half an hour before the next bus arrived, he asked the prison guard before leaving the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he enjoyed his new life, the corner of his eye saw the newspaper on the bench that he didn’t know who was not taken away. He took it with him. Come over, then widen your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw an acquaintance, a man named Du Lin, who read this report carefully. The more he reads, the more shocked he is, the more difficult he is to imagine. The young man who didn't dare to speak loudly in front of him actually became such a heavyweight in a short period of time. He read the newspaper over and over until the memory of the car's whistle was interrupted, and he took the bag to the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, he found a small hotel in Orodo, facing himself in the mirror completely different from the past. He picked up the razor and began to organize his own instruments. There were several newspapers at his hand. There are today, there are also previous ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was lying in bed after a shower, he sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has only seven dollars in total, he lost his job, lost his family, and lost his parents’ trust and love for him. Already have nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at this bastard, he actually mixed so well! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought appeared in his mind for a moment. At the beginning, his relationship with Du Lin was also good. Now Du Lin has become a celebrity, then Can't you find something to do for him? It is good to not give him a little money to start a new life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, he took the train to the west and took out more than half of his savings - five dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Du Lin has stood up from the hospital bed, and the injuries he suffered have basically recovered, but there is still a short way to go, but at least I am able to get out of bed. Thanks to the money in his pocket, the money gave the hospital the best medical plan and the best doctor, and the best medicine. They gave Dooling what they could do best because Du Lin had money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Dufo, Du Lin put on a suit, he is now leaving the hospital and going outside. Of course not here, in this city, he wants to go to his mining area, he wants to talk to the "Ten Warriors". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Front has already broken three mining camps in the west, and they are getting familiar with them. They have already mastered some tips. Some horses are said to have joined them. Of course, these horses are for money. They brought a more advanced fighting concept and siege experience, and now the Freedom Front is not a pure organization like some time ago. There are thieves, robbers, robbers, road tyrants, gold diggers, skilled women, fugitives, and shackles in the Freedom Front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people condensed together and turned the Freedom Front into a magnet, attracting all the "metal iron filings" in the west. It’s not good to do this well. The good thing is that the rapid expansion and expansion of the Freedom Front has brought great pressure to all the mine owners in the west. The mine owners who have these eyes on their heads feel the fear and feel the possibility of anytime, anywhere. The pressure of a bankruptcy and bankruptcy. The downside is that the addition of these people has made a pure "slavery liberation" organization a trash can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
