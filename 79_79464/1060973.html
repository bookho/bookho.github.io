			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took two outstanding lawyers when he left, waiting for him and the Imperial Bank and the Southern Commercial Bank to have a good two in the West. The lawyer helped him stabilize the situation. Once the Southern Commercial Bank began to intervene, the Imperial Bank will definitely react immediately. This is a huge opportunity and a huge miracle. The reason why people are not optimistic about the three-guarantee policy of the peasant is not only those reasons that are well known, but also that the peasant does not use the insurance money that he has received for urban construction. Ways to continue to produce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the detailed data of the three guarantee policies is presented to these people, with their professional ability and keen sense of smell, they will definitely bite and not let go, then it will be a It’s time to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon the next day, Du Lin has returned to the West, and he immediately launched a conference call – this is the advanced service provided by the Telegraph Office during this time. You can access no less than two at the same time, no more than fifteen users, and listen and communicate at the same time, just like face-to-face talking, except that you can't see each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Telegraph Office has a very good name for this service, called a conference call, and each time a conference call is initiated, it costs a very expensive fee. In addition to the sponsor's need to pay ten dollars at a time, each additional participant is required to pay an additional five dollars, and the duration of the conference call is only fifteen minutes. According to the telegraph office, the initiation of a conference call will occupy a separate connector in a short period of time, so it is inevitable that it is expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the call was connected, every incoming person expressed his or her identity. When the person was ready, Du Lin coughed a little, slightly The noisy meeting environment suddenly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have one thing that you need to do immediately, and, if you don't use illegal means as a condition, promote the company, as soon as possible, and Telling all the working class who participated in the policy of the three guarantees, I, Doolin Kerma, are willing to accept all the policies of the three guarantee policies from their hands with social responsibility. Tell them that the city and state governments are not willing to admit that these contracts are not related. I am willing to admit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From today, from now on, tell them as long as they give the contract to you and are willing to transfer the contract to me. The company, I will waive their two-month insurance premium and promise to do the most appropriate treatment within 24 hours of the contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Of course, the agreement they signed with the doorman no longer applies. I will send the new contract to you at the latest tomorrow. Remember, wait for the time and do it right away!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Du Lin launched a conference call to connect the presidents of the cities that were unable to participate in the conference due to the number of people, and issued the same task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you follow the usual path, he will contact the state government, contact the city halls of various places, and fight against the Imperial Bank and the Southern Commercial Bank. It wasn't Du Lin who looked at himself too much. With his current social status and energy, he couldn't fight either of them. Whether it is the Imperial Bank or the Southern Commercial Bank, they have unlimited resources in their hands, except for the funds that are so strong that they can only look up to sigh, from the cabinet to the ordinary citizens, they all have Ways to contact and let the other person help them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the regular battlefield, Doolin has no hope of a little bit of victory, then the sword goes astray and surprisingly wins! Let them go to the state government and the city hall to discuss how to accept the huge gold mine left by the Mennon. Du Lin himself took the mine and the basket to mine the ore. By the time their negotiations were almost the same, Du Lin had some of the contracts in his hands, and even if the next negotiation was not completed, at least he could ensure that some of his interests were not harmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there are things that can’t be planned, and there are ways to ensure that your plan can be implemented effectively. Without much consideration, Du Lin called Mr. Jack. "I have a very interesting sale, maybe the King and Queen will be very interested!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To drag more people into this undeveloped circle to dilute the proportion of Du Lin can think of, one of the best ways. The power and strength of the poker organization is enough for the Imperial Central Bank and the Southern Commercial Bank to sit at the negotiating table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that Du Lin’s arrogance, his current strength is not the opponent of the two major banks, even as an opponent can not do. Compared to these two behemoths, Du Lin is like a child around them. They can never let Du Lin sit at the negotiating table and go to a serious discussion about a huge market with an infinite future. They only He will kick Du Lin away and will not give him any chance. But with the involvement of Mr. Jack and the poker organization, at least Doolin has such an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the state government, the head of the imperial central bank's trip is preparing to see the second time with the governor. They have seen each other a few days ago, but the results discussed at the time were not very friendly. Popularly speaking, the imperialist central bank wants to eat at both ends, while asking the state government to give the imperial central bank certain assistance in terms of policies and funds. On the other hand, it is unwilling to bear too high a risk. Once the risk index exceeds the expected value, they ask The state government's finances need to intervene to help the imperialist central bank block the possible cracking of funds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These requirements are very excessive, the state government will certainly not be able to promise such rude demands, the central bank is not very anxious here. Anyway, the last bad luck is not necessarily the central bank, but the unlucky ones must have these officials of the state government. They intend to air the state government for a while, and finally find an intermediate point that both sides can accept, and then sign the agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But last night, one of the shareholders of Southern Commercial Bank, Perito, appeared in Villier and also took his personal assistant group. A meeting with the new mayor of Villier, Julio. What they are talking about is also a legacy of the three-guarantee policy. This made the central bank's delegation suddenly realize that there are some unusual things in this matter. They have also investigated the information about the three-guarantee policy of the farmers, and the conclusions reached are not satisfactory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years of the three-guarantee policy left only $9 million on the Kadima policy fund account, which is enough to scare off most of the investors, and the empire The central bank is also dealing with this as a trouble. However, when they began to carefully investigate the implementation process and results of all the three-guarantee policies, the chairman of the imperial central bank’s headquarters gave the delegation a call to tell them that they must follow the follow-up work of the three-guarantee policy and use this as a pilot. Explore all the content and operations of the insurance business, and then move to the whole society after maturity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also a message that adds a phone call to make the central bank’s delegations nervous and all they know, they also have a strong Opponent - Southern Commercial Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2:30 in the afternoon, the central bank delegation in the governor’s office met the governor, the head of the delegation, and one of the shareholders of the imperial central bank, Phyllis Proactively ushered in to the friendly handshake with the governor, his attitude is simply two people compared with the previous few days. A few days ago, Felice’s attitude was a bit arrogant. He placed himself in the identity of “Savior” and inevitably showed a sense of superiority. But today, he knows what he should do! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
