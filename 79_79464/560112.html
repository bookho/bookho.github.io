			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy, called Cod, didn't know how to offend Mrs. Vivian, Mrs. Vivian said she wanted to take him and his other two. A buddy, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Prando’s words, Codor suddenly felt that he was dressed up to make his body stuffy. Fever, he tore up the neckline and walked back and forth a few steps, the face of the deliberately kept smile has become a little embarrassing. There is an interesting saying in the city of Tener, that Mrs. Vivian is the mayor of the city. She decides that even the mayor has no ability to change. Many of the policies that have already been implemented are even Vivienne. After the lady nodded her consent, she began to implement it in the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement only exists between tycoons who can reach a little truth but are unclear, and Chowdor is still in a private banquet. Listen to the boss and talk about it. At that time, a reporter insinuated the accused Vivian’s father, although he had left his post due to illness, but he still had the power to hand over it. He also accused the city of Tener of having many “women’s politics”, its core purpose. Still the sword refers to the father of Vivienne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than three days, the reporter with extraordinarily sharp words was found floating on the agate river, and the body had begun to swell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say, it must be the hand of Vivienne’s father, and the person who directs the reporter is nothing more than the newly appointed governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s because there’s a lot of things to know, so when he heard Prando say that Mrs. Vivian’s name is like a magical moment, Become uneasy. A big man like that wants to deal with him. He doesn't need to do it himself. Just say hello and he will probably die, unless his boss is willing to protect him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but does he have this value? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he is not, it is not difficult to do dirty work, just find someone to do, so he must save himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed the bell on the table, and soon someone pushed the door out. He turned back and said with a sigh of relief: The guy from Germany is tied to me. If he dares to resist, interrupt his limbs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the comers had such a short doubt, they nodded and said that they were closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, he couldn’t finish the task that Godor gave him, because Cod is now in the hands of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the warehouse of the suburban farm, Cod and his two partners still don’t understand why they will fall into the hands of these young people, but they don’t know Why are these young people kidnapping them? They don't have money... Maybe they used to, but the money is wasted on women who are highly alcoholic and cheap. Cod is not married, has no family, and naturally has no need to save money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be happy to live every day is his greatest wish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bunch of weeping weeds in the mouth, and they were still strangled by a scarf, unable to spit out, and could not swallow. Because the mouth contains something, the body thought it was a lubricant that was secreted by eating, that is, the spit always slipped down the throat with grass clippings and bitterness, which made him miserable. He vowed that if he could leave here, he would bring someone to throw everyone here into the agate river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the door of the warehouse suddenly opened, and he squinted at the direction in which the sun was pouring in. There were several people in the dazzling white. After a few seconds, he passed the darkness to the light of the light, and adapted to the brightness at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ones who kidnapped him, his emotions suddenly became a little excited, struggling hard, making a "squeaky" voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teenager who is clearly different from other people came to him, his fingers hooked the scarf down, and he wowed the weeds in the mouth Spit it out. His eyes looked fiercely at the young man, and the muscles on his cheeks jumped, like a wild dog ready to fight for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cod?", the man put his hands in his waist pocket, looking at him with a condescending look, this feeling is terrible, so he twisted his face No sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a fist hit from one side, and his fist slammed his face in the opposite direction, and his brain was bursting. Ming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't like being offended when I talk. It's just a little lesson. If there is another time, I will cut your ears!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, cut my ears!", Codd's fierce hair, he raised his eyebrows and put his side face together, revealing his own auricle, "Come, cut now!", he licked his mouth and swollen The place where there is slight pain does not care about the threat of this young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other guy who looks like a girl really pulls a dagger from behind his back and grabs one hand in Cod’s struggle. His ears then went down with a knife. The blood didn't splash, just silently flowing, and an ear with some skin and muscle tissue fell into the hands of the handsome guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!", Cod actually resisted the pain and didn't call it out, but sneered. "Okay, good, come on, kill me, if Let me leave here alive, you all have to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head with a funny smile. "Do you think you have any value? I will not dare Killing you?", said that he took a pistol out of his pocket and pointed at Cod's head. Just as Cody was still arrogant, Du Lin shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet shattered Cod’s skull in a flash, and the recess between his temple and the eyebrow was in, and a white flower was sprinkled behind his head. With the bloody blood of the blood, a smell suddenly filled the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two guys who were tied up began to tremble. They are the people of Codor. In this city, except for the big guys and tycoons, they don’t have them. The crime of sin can not exist. But why are these people not afraid of them, but dare to do them? They don't understand and don't want to understand, but they don't want to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without pity, looking at the two eyes with a fierce struggle, Du Lin fired two more shots, and they were completely eternal. Silence to the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pisted his pistol and shrugged his shoulders. "Put it up here. I wanted to give it to Kodol, but it doesn't matter. In short, this one. "He can't go too far!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Du Lin can be said to have personally manipulated the entire plan, he makes people play Delier to count the money under the lights, then Cod "just happened" to meet, and let Cod successfully carried out a robbery. There are no fewer than five witnesses throughout the process. Then on a street without a streetlight - Doolin arranged for the person to break the light bulb in the evening and successfully kidnapped Cod and two others and brought them here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
