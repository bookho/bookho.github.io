			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis in winter does not have many tourists, and the whole city seems a bit deserted, which is also the low season that tourism cities need to bear. Except for one thing, the surrounding business districts with the seven major casinos as the core are still very lively. The gamblers from the empire and even the federation regard this place as a holy place. Every day they can see the birth of the miracle of wealth and madness. It will also ignore the infestations of more wealth black holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is convinced that when he was born, he was kissed by the forehead of God, but God sometimes does not kiss with his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a slightly remote place, a bar full of two months ago is empty, only five or six people are sitting on the barside, listening Relaxing music and drinking, enjoying a leisurely time. The women on the stage who couldn’t afford to wear clothes from the original tribes disappeared. The men who seemed to be the muscles of the orangutans were all gone. They went to the casino to seek for wealth. No one. I will choose to stay here and face the poverty of several dozens of guests who can't afford to wear clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the bar was suddenly pushed open, and the cold wind outside the door slid in. The city of Otis was in the Gobi, the wind in winter. Big people feel fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guests on the side of the bar wrapped their wraps and turned to look behind them. There was a guy in the trench coat and the hat was shaking. The snow on his body fell to the ground with the intense shaking of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his clothes and hat and handed it to the girl at the door who was responsible for storing things for the guests. The expression with a faint excitement came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender of the bar gave him a glance and while he was preparing a cocktail for him, it also hinted at the doorkeeper closing the door, the wind outside was too cold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are late!", sitting in the middle of the bar, the guy in a white suit smiled and patted the high stool next to him. "Is it not?" Last night, things were too late to let you go to bed?", several other guests laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late-night guest called two 17-99-year-old primitive tribe girls to his home to discuss the issue of financial assistance. This is a A very sacred thing, considering the backward social environment of the primitive tribes and their need to deal with natural disasters and nature, he not only assisted a valuable amount of money, but also tried to increase the population of the original tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrugged his shoulders, sat on the high stool and took a sip of the wine glass. The wine in the mouth was a little sweet and slightly acidic. After a variety of complex tastes, it was the strongest wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down the cup and raised his eyebrows. "Do you know? Doolin wants to leave the city of Otis!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment he finished the sentence, the jokes on the faces of the people around him suddenly solidified, and the time seemed to be suspended by a naughty God at this moment, even the bartender Stopped the work of wiping the glass in his hand and looked at him with a sly look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about twenty or thirty seconds, these talents came back, and their eyes were filled with an unspeakable luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... is it true? Doolin wants to leave the city of Otis? Where is he going? Is the city going to the state?" The guest sitting on one side hurried over, and he forgot his own glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late person showed a very proud expression. "Do you know? I spent three thousand pieces when I bought this news. You... don't need to show What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is very important, and 3,000 is not a big deal for the people here, the one sitting next to him at the bar The guest in the middle position, who is also the owner of the bar, immediately took the bar out of the counter's cashbox and placed it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have also come up with two hundred and three hundred to five hundred dollars, piled together. The late guy was very satisfied with the money and put it in his arms. He looked at the friends who had been surrounded by him and whispered: "He was removed from office. It is said that he will be hired again, but you I know, sometimes I can only listen to some words, you can't believe it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news makes people around them excited, they can be said to be Audi The beneficiaries of the city, but can also be said to be frustrated, because they are members of the Imperial Chamber of Commerce, not the member of the Otis Chamber of Commerce, this time Doolin intends to package the city of Otis in the plan There are no such people. They also tried to fight with Du Lin, and they all ended in failure. They knew that Du Lin was a man, so he could only regret to see the opportunity to make money slip away from his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the guy from Doolin is leaving, is the dark cloud covered in the city of Otis finally exhausted? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did turn the city into a golden cave, letting the money of tourists and gamblers flow into everyone’s pockets, but he also The same restrictions have made the city more "free". For some people who are excluded from the Doolin plan, they will feel that Doolin is not a qualified mayor because he discriminates against some people and limits the size and operation of this group in Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there’s no need to worry about these things anymore, because Du Lin is leaving, as long as he leaves, the city will get real Freedom and true freedom, that is what merchants are most willing to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This news is good, this cup is mys!", the bar owner took a slap after listening, he originally operated a bar in the middle of Lindels Also, by the way, they operate some economic emergency services that are full of love and human care. The bar can't make any money, but the loan can be, and all the money is made. He had thought that there were so many casinos in the city of Otis, and it would certainly be full of gamblers who urgently needed money to find their own dignity at the gambling table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the reality has given him a stick. These big casinos not only have counters that specialize in lending, but also have low interest rates so that people outside have no food to eat. He can only put all his attention on the bar. He believes that the interest on lending in the casino is definitely not the requirements of the merchants themselves. It must be that Du Lin forced them to lower the interest. Once Du Lin left, the interest on casino lending increased, and his humane care and rescue efforts could continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, Du Lin left, and they will join in the Otis market listing plan, which is the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always a couple of corners in the city. There will always be two or three people or three or five people discussing things about Doolin, like the political circles of the entire emperor. It is a big hole and a small eye sieve, which can't hide any secrets. However, it is also possible that this news was intentionally revealed. The purpose is to force Du Lin to leave as soon as possible as a loser, thus eluting the city's invincible brand of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, standing on the second floor window, looking at the flashing neon lights around, Doolin’s hand holds a tray, and the other hand holds a cup of coffee. The ear, he looked at the heavy snow outside the house through the glass window, and stopped for a long time before turning around. "In the past few days, let everyone not leave the police for a while, give them a good rest. Before I leave, these people will definitely be honest. Waiting for the moment they think the sun is coming out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea nodded and said that he knew that the Buddha on the side was holding a sharp knife and fixing his nails. He couldn’t help but smile and said: "I have only been to the farthest place before I met you. Prison, but after I met you, I have been to too many places, where are we going this time? South, North, or to the Federation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also followed Laughing, he thought about it really, and these people and him fought around, especially in the past three years, they have not been in a place for more than two years. Most of the time they did something, then they changed one. local. He put the saucer and the cup down, sat across from them, and lifted his legs. He took out a box of cigarettes from the extra-colored gray vest jacket and took out one. Someone lit the cigarette for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and spit out, "This time we go to the west!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South He will not go, because it is useless to go. As the region with the strongest capital power and the most open vision of the people, the South is consistently occupied by some large consortia and capitalists. They have already accumulated enough deep depths in the past ten years, and will never tolerate a new player who may shake their own within their sphere of influence. When Du Lin went to the South, he would definitely receive the best reception and then send him back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not likely to go to the north, the Cape family and his new hatred are still not clear, now everyone is busy with their own affairs Each other, if they run under their eyelids, the Cape family will definitely regard this as a provocation, and the next day will only have war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is very valuable, Du Lin needs development, growth, not a fight, so after choosing a circle, finally put yourself this time The location of the landing is placed in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the west is relatively backward. There are no capitalists and concerns other than the wilderness, desert, and mountains. The social structure there is relatively simple, but it also has Adequate development potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of gold diggers, miners, ethnic minorities, and barbarians in the mountains are all objects of development, and more importantly, thousands of those in Doolin’s hands. Ten thousand dollars of funds need to be moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, you can also find the troubles of the doorman, wearing a mask in front of him to say those embarrassing dialogues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
