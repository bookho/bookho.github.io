			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Wood...", the office door was suddenly pushed open, and Colt looked at the murderously sullenly, just preparing to say something ugly. At the time, one of the two people who came in took off the bowler hat, revealing a trace of shiny hair. As long as he saw this hair, Colt knew who the person was, because he was so familiar with this head. Quickly stood up, by the way, showing a respectful appearance, and quickly walked over to take over Wood's hat and windbreaker, hanging on one side of the hanger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Wood doesn’t like this cheap guilt, he has to admit that even if you show his disgusting color to him, he can shake his head. The appendix of the appendix is ​​turning around by your side. This shameless guy has reached the highest level of shameless people. His face was slightly relieved and he looked at Colt's office. Since becoming a decent person, Wood has always dressed himself like a gentleman, and as a gentleman has strict requirements for the life of himself and the people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two bookcases with glass windows in the office, filled with books, which is good. Books are the step of human progress, and reading more books is good for people. The specimen of the male antelope is still hung on the wall. The huge horns are horrible. Even in the nature, it is a beast of meat and meat. When you see the majestic ram, you must avoid it. However, it hangs here, which means that in nature, for people, it is still weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairly elegant office made Wood nod to satisfaction. He went straight to the desk and sat down. Colt greeted the followers of Wood. While grinding the coffee beans for Wood, "You can't get it once. Is there anything I need to do? If you open it, it must be a one-word thing, I will definitely do it." As for the effort, can you do it? When it comes, that is another matter. In many cases, it may not be rewarded to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Colt, this kind of swindling habit, Wood has long been accustomed to, if not his wife likes this guilt very much, he has already sent Colt to the meat Factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have first love and snow elves here?", Wood hands on the table, looking at Colt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colt did not shirk and shouted and said: "Yes, I recently bought a batch and almost used all my savings!", He looked a little lamentable. "Things are expensive, but the sales are not bad. How do you know about this newly listed wine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood's temper is already very good. If he is ten years younger, he will immediately pick up the crystal ashtray of more than ten kilograms on the table. It’s not to find you to pay back, it’s even more impossible to find you to borrow money. What do you mean by saying that you have no money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep breath, these are small things, not worthy of his anger, he asked: "Do you know the guar named Graf? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wood asked about Graf, Colt understood that Wood had nothing to do with himself, and the smile on his face became really awkward. While putting the coffee pot on the fire, I walked down to the chair on the side and sat down. "Of course I know that Graf is a little famous among the Guarts. It is a warm-hearted person. The business of first love and snow elves is now He is doing the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wood looks at Colt, "Very good, you can tell him, the first love and the snow elf have been sold out, let him send again." A group came over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colt, a quick understanding of what happened, he was very clear about the business that Wood did, all from him. The aunt heard that he and Wood also dealt. It is because he knows what Wood is doing, so he is not worried that this war will involve him. Wood's connections and means are enough to make the people behind Graf honestly bow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Colt’s heart became hot. He moved his chair forward and asked for it. He asked with curiosity and pleading: “He Did you offend you? It’s a damn guar, the country’s kind!” He cursed a few Graffs and continued: “You have no opinion on Graf... but what about him? After that, can the agent of this new product let me do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original mind that went out is up again, stronger than before, this time if you can get With the support of Wood, he can rely on these two wines to become the new player in the city of Tener, second only to the Big Three, which is very attractive to him. But when he saw Wood look at him with a look, he shook his head and knew that there was no play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some lazy, leaning on the chair, said with a look of anger: "Uncle Wood, I don't want to help you, you should listen to me just now." Say, my liquidity is on the goods, so there is no money to pay for the new batch of wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't have the big benefit, you should drink some soup first, and then you will have to pay a lot of money to enter the goods. As for the previous one, although only one-third of the deposit was given, it is not a small number! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Wood’s eyes twitched twice, and the checkbook looked up at Colt, and the expression on his face showed how much he hated Colt. How much do you hate Colt. Colt did not care, smirking, "15,000!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you talk to me like this?", Wood frowned. A drop of ink drops on the checkbook. He only heard that it seems to be a bottle of a dozen dollars, but how can it be impossible to get 15,000? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colt’s innocent expression, “One hundred boxes... and uncle, maybe you can earn this money back!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money is not too small, but what Carter said is no problem. The money was given to Graf. As long as he touched his home, he would not need to continue to live with Graf and his family. The money would naturally return to his pocket. He changed a checkbook with a large denomination, wrote a cheque for six thousand pieces, and threw it to Colt. "This is a deposit. Do you think I have not done business myself?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colt laughed and didn't dare to quit, he took the check and bounced, and smiled into his pocket. At the same time, he went to the hallway outside the office door and pulled it with a rope. The other end of the rope is behind the bar. Every time he pulls the rope, the bell hanging on it will be remembered. The staff in the bar will come over after hearing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, a short boy ran over with a towel and wiped his hands, "Mr. Colt!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's find a gult on the road, tell them to tell Graf, let him bring a hundred boxes of wine, I will give enough deposit.", said Ke Erte took two fifty-five coins out of his pocket. He put one into the big boy's hand. "This is the benefit of letting you run your legs." Then I put another one. Go in, "This is for you to give those Guartes, they will not run for you if they don't get anything, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;大The boy immediately nodded excitedly and tightened the two coins and ran out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
