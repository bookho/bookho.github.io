			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin stepped into the confinement, he didn’t know that, thousands of miles away, something that could affect all the private wine industry in the entire empire was Quietly happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is the matter?", after the new party’s leader signed his name, he took the glasses off the temple and placed them on the table. He is only in his forties in appearance. In fact, he is already fifty-four years old. He has always maintained good maintenance, so he does not look old. He has a slightly curly blond hair, and his white face has only some wrinkles in his eyes. The tall nose and full lips make his facial features very three-dimensional. Coupled with the long-standing work of presiding over the new party and the empire, he has no expression of calmness, and there is still a very aggressive and majestic desire to come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all fathers, he is also very concerned about his next generation, his own heirs. His son is not a good son, at least not good enough to play the role of a son. Perhaps most of the high-powered big men have such awkward things. His son is very wasteful. He has never done a few correct things since he was a child, and spent all his time on pleasure and disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman, alcohol, chaotic private life has already made him feel bad, he has tried his best to supervise the mixed ball, but still has an accident. Just now, his secretary-general told him that his son had a car accident and the injury was serious. He hoped that he could go to the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that I have already installed a speed limiter on his car, and he told me that he didn't go anywhere at home yesterday.", he Put the glasses in his pocket and look at the beautiful pocket watch. He will have about twenty minutes. Twenty minutes later, the heads of several institutions in the Imperial Center will come over to a brief meeting to discuss some of the policies to be enacted before the mid-term election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary-General’s arrogant words, the leader’s son’s latest sports car from the Federation did install the speed limiter, the principle of the speed limiter and Not so complicated, there are two main types. One is a physical speed limiter that reduces engine efficiency by reducing the ultra-high compression steam entering the engine from the kinetic energy bin. The second is a chemical method that achieves a speed limit for the vehicle by adding a special substance to the kinetic energy chamber to reduce the reaction speed between the twin and the catalyst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both methods are used in the sports car of the leader's son. But all the things in this world are opposite to each other. You can put all these things on him, and he can remove them all by some means. The speed limiter was installed by the Secretary-General himself, and the same speed limiter was unloaded by the Secretary-General. He thought that there would be no accident, but it was still an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that deserves his luck is that the mixed ball has fallen into a deep coma. The doctor said that even if he can wake up, he will encounter some functional obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the word is unclear and becomes a sequela of mental retardation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God, didn't abandon me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary-General followed the new party’s leader, Magus, to leave Magus’s house, which is not far from the best hospital, only three minutes. Maggs kept silent on the way, his face was a bit gloomy and a little awkward, and it was not until after the hospital that he showed some anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital knows that the very injured teenager is the son of the new party leader, Magus, who also sent all the most famous doctors to form a group of experts on the situation of teenagers. Analyze. But the situation is very bad, the mixed ball hits a wall at a very high speed, and it is necessary to thank God for the long-lasting life. As for whether he can save him completely, everyone has no such confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think we need to open his skull to find out why he is still in a coma." A surgeon put forward his own opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical trauma of Magus’s son has basically been treated, but he is still unconscious. In fact, there are counts in the doctor’s mind. On his brain. If the brain is not crushed by inertia under the violent impact, it may be that there is a hematoma and a blood clot that oppresses the brain. But until now, only this doctor has put forward this view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era when there is no way to find the condition inside the skull through the skull, all craniotomy is actually a gamble, because the window you may open is just right. No longer on the lesion, so many times when the craniotomy is confirmed, the head to be cut is not a bone, but six bones. All people who have undergone craniotomy can not exercise vigorously for the rest of their lives. They should not be exposed to water for a long time. They must also wash their hair with special disinfectant with disinfectant water every day to avoid infection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, in the case of a craniotomy, the longest surviving is an old man who lived for seventeen years, then sneaked in a sneeze and quickly left the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of pressure on the surgery of Magus’s son. Therefore, these doctors who are unwilling to take responsibility do not mention the craniotomy. They always look for problems in several injured areas that have already been handled, such as his fracture of the tibia. God is on the top. If the fracture of the tibia is directly related to the deep coma, perhaps the doctor who has this idea can win a prize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence of this group of doctors, the ward door opened, and several bodyguards cleaned up the room first, confirming that there was no danger, and Magus strode forward. Going in. At first glance, he fell on his bed and even his son, who needed mechanical coordination to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My time is limited, please make a long story short." He quickly turned his attention to this group of senior doctors, here he and his The son is not the protagonist, these doctors are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor who had previously proposed to do craniotomy had a few words, and finally closed his mouth, and the relationship was too big! Although conservative treatment may make Magus's son maintain his current state or even death, they do not need to pay any price for it. However, if a craniotomy with a risk fails, it will inevitably become the main responsible party - perhaps he will not die if he does not open the skull, even if he is unconscious, he is better than dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many family members have this idea, especially after the event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the silent expert group Magus snorted, he just prepared to explain that they don’t need the doctor’s responsibility, suddenly several doctor’s faces are Twisted, Magus followed their eyes and looked at the son lying on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, all the doctors rushed over, just now they found that the alarm device was triggered, it was a very small thing, a similar gasket The thing is pressed on a bare artery. There is a long electric needle on the gasket. When the heart beats, the gasket will shake, and the long needle will also shake with it, and the other conductor will be separated, so that the bee is always ringing. The sounder produces a moment of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, the silence disappeared, which meant that the guy’s heartbeat on the bed was terminated. The doctors began to rescue quickly, and Magus stood aside. He frowned and watched the doctors try various efforts on his son. His hands were in his pockets and his glasses were tight. He told many people that he didn't like his son. It was a waste, but when he saw that his son couldn't do it with his heartbeat, his heart seemed to be about to stop beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About ten minutes later, when the doctor's rescue action came to an abrupt end, his hand crushed the glasses in his pocket, and the lens stabbed his palm, but he did not feel even a trace of pain. Because of the death of his son, he has already caused him to numb. He walked quietly, standing calmly on the bed of the bed, and the doctors and others retired and left the room to the father and son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the child whose face had been deformed and filled with sutured wounds. He couldn’t find a similar look in his memory for a long time. He shook his head and sighed, reaching out and smashing the thinness from his feet, covering his legs, covering his chest, and when he was about to cover his face, Magma Si looked at this son who had been a headache for him. He wanted to keep the damn and deadly mixed ball in his heart forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin white was slowly pressed against the distorted face, and Magus raised his head and rubbed his eyes, calmly turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, when all the heads of the various departments sitting together sat together, they already knew everything that Magus had encountered. When they had not had time to comfort the second man in the empire who lost his child in the middle and old age, Maggs spoke first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell the truth, I never thought that I would have experienced such a sad day, yes, he left. But the problem is not here, but lies in Why did he leave me.", Magus opened his notebook, took out the pen, and put on his eyes. "I carefully collected the details about his accident, causing the real cause of his death. It’s not that he hit the wall, but three other things.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“First, wine!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He drunk a lot of smuggled high-alcohol before driving, and those wines were ignited when they hit the fire, and the wine made him lose his ability to respond to the outside world."<br /><br />&nbsp "Second, he abused the anesthetic, and the anesthetic was enough to keep his muscles out of his body. Even if he realized that he would hit the wall, he couldn't order himself." The body lets the car change direction or stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third, too high Speed, I believe that if he had not disassemble off those damn governor, even if the accident he would not leave me "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
