			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I noticed that I came in for a while in our west, and there was a very good gentleman in our Vanlier who saved tens of thousands of lives, even more Uncovering countless farms, more unemployed people who have lost their livelihoods have returned to work, and even the church has to award him medals. I knew him before I came, I almost never saw such outstanding young people. Man...", Julio looked at Doolin, "Mr. Doolin, if you don't mind, I hope we can sit down and have a chat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sitting down and talking is not about the future, nor is it a more intimate chat. It is actually today, now, here, next to Julio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a meeting, but a "symposium" like a salon or conversation. Julio’s personal team made several plans for him to take over the work of Vanlier before he came. Among them, there is such a scheme. According to the habits of the South, it shows an easy-to-reach, good-talking attitude. Several influential celebrities in the west cooperated and slowly regained the power of the city of Villiil into their own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His personal team believes that Julio, who lacks the foundation in the West, is best not to show a tough side, because the simple westerners are soft and not hard. People, you are tough, others will behave more tough than you, and finally there will always be one party who will admit defeat, but also pay for the consequences of their previous toughness. Julio can be ninety-nine times successful, but as long as he fails, all his efforts and efforts will become a smash. Therefore, those people gave him the advice of using gentle means to fully control Van Lill in the period of no more than half a year, and to make friends with the great men in the west to maintain a very good personal relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a person chosen by Julio himself, perhaps because he feels that he has been met by Magus and has served the same treatment as himself. Du Lin, who is the mayor of Otis, may have a better touch, and Du Lin’s power in the west is definitely not small. Pulling Doolin into his own circle is a great help to Julio in controlling his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen Du Lin’s resume and knows what happened in recent times. He is confident that he can become a good friend with Du Lin, as long as he can be with Du Lin. On some issues, the radicals led by Du Lin will come together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Doolin was rated as a representative figure of the Western radicals in Julio’s personal class, and the turmoil in the west was also after Doolin’s arrival in the West. It started to happen gradually. First of all, Du Lin promoted the all-round development of agriculture in the west. Perhaps the economic benefits of agriculture and animal husbandry cannot be compared with mining. However, from the perspective of providing local stability and maintaining local security, agriculture and animal husbandry are more suitable for the western region. Development trend requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many people with simple personality, local cowboys, miners, mine protection teams, foreign gold diggers and robbers in the wilderness. The biggest problem facing the west is not in economic construction, but in law and order. Only a stable social environment and good law and order can attract more businessmen to the west, and the benefits of cheap worker labor far exceed the benefits of mining for the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of the development of the West in the southern political arena is different from that of the locals, including the doormen. When the farmers dominate the west, the big Capitalists and mine owners are the main beneficiaries. From the annual financial report, the economic development of the western region does not drag the empire's hind legs. Although it is still in the countdown, it has not fallen too much. But in fact, the benefits brought by this kind of economic construction are not real construction, but a kind of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many economists at home and abroad have a common view. If wealth is only in the hands of a few people, then wealth is not wealth, but poison. . Only when everyone has mastered a certain amount of wealth can they be truly rich and strong. The western part of the country has formed a strong contrast with this mainstream view. Almost all wealth is in the hands of a few people, and citizens in the west are not rich or even poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this situation is not changed, the government’s right to speak will first fall into the hands of the big capitalists. Because they have money, each of their actions can have a great social effect, forcing the government to give in to them. Secondly, except for a few people who have a stable job, most people rely on “opportunities” to make a living. This kind of uncertainty has a very risky way of returning income, which will bring too many uncertain factors to the society. One side, but more is the bad side. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Julio does not like the big capitalists in the South to control the people to wrap the government, but have to say that these big capitalists fully demonstrate the uniqueness of the capitalists. The amazing results achieved by the means. A large number of job opportunities and positions bring unparalleled stability to the society. People have jobs to do, no need to consider unemployment, and the social environment and law and order will naturally stabilize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has brought a very positive side to the government's management of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farm industry that Du Lin admired is very good. He provides a lot of job opportunities to each city. After these jobs are filled, the number of miners and The number of gold digger will be reduced, and it will provide a stable foundation for cracking down on various crimes. Although Julio is now only a mayor, he believes that he can never stop at the level of the mayor. He is willing to come to the west, just to run for the governor here. If you want to do this, someone must help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is the person Julio is looking at. Of course, Du Lin himself also has certain threats. He turned out to be the mayor of Otis, and the city of Otis has undergone a leap-forward development under his construction. But Dulin is not a threat, because he is exempt from all duties, even if he wants to start again, it only starts at the level of the mayor. When he can threaten himself, it may be the next eight years. . In addition, there are three states in the west. If Dolin is not willing to give in, he will make his own concessions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not think about finishing the personal dress and went to Julio’s side. The two men shook hands and sat down, “I’m surrounded by Mr. Dooling, I believe everyone knows him. After all, I opened the first page of the newspaper every day for a while, always have this guy...", Julio showed a very annoying look, but his mouth was smiling. "I often complain to my secretary, damn, why is this guy in every issue, when will my photo be on the front page, is your job not done well, or is I not spending enough?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene sounded a moment of laughter, humorous people can always get people's goodwill, Julio's statement is really interesting, and bluntly talk about money This topic. It is well known that many officials have no longer dared to say the word "money" casually since the proposal of "employment crime" passed by the imperial parliament. It's easy to make people think of corruption and a series of problems, and quickly form negative news. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people think that the existence of the so-called anti-obligation bill is to facilitate the cabinet to give the black pot to the local officials, the local matter, investigate the official, the official exists In the case of duty crimes, then everything is not the fault of the cabinet, it is the fault of the officials, and people recognize this situation. Many officials complain that the cabinet does not consider the actual situation at the grassroots level, although it makes no sense to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can now say that Julio is not daring to spend enough money, but the Westerners eat this set, he is already in people’s A better impression was obtained from the initial impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people laughed enough, he waved his hand and smiled. "Is it wrong? Ok, let me be wrong." ......", the laughter again gives a very strange feeling, just like Julio is not an official, a star or an actor, he is too easy to make people laugh, "but when I learned about Mr. Doolin After doing everything, I found out that I was really wrong. Mr. Doolin was a good person, even the bishop of the church said so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
