			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s whimsical way of saying and the little humor hidden in some languages ​​is the most lethal weapon for girls, and some people have said that they want to A girl must first make her feel happy when she is with you. Girls and older women belong to women. Women are emotional creatures. The only criterion for them to choose a partner is whether they can feel happiness and whether they can feel happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very good at using her own way to make Alisa feel happy, being happy is really a happy thing, this Along the way, the laughter and laughter in the car didn't stop. Alisa felt that she might use a real smile of one month or even half a year on this short journey. It wasn't until she got off the bus that she felt that the gang was sour, and then she naturally took Du Lin's arms. Maybe she didn't understand why she would do this, but there was something that women had called "inspiration". Tell her that doing this will not make her uncomfortable, but will make her feel more relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a very gentleman, at least in the eyes of Alisa, he is very funny and humorous, knows a lot of things, always Can say some funny words to please their own favor. Alisa, who has never talked about her love for a lifetime, has encountered a stranger who has made her heart stunned in this rebellious age. She feels that this is the greatest gift that God has given her. She held Duolin's arm tightly and they walked into a restaurant, a more upscale restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing into the spotless white dome and golden strokes with a red carpet, the restaurant’s grades are elevated to two levels. The waiters wore white tops, black trousers, and walked between the tables with a smile, one by one like the upper class, sitting on a table and whispering a conversation. This scene makes Ali Shake’s thinking was frozen for a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had a short guess on the road, she wondered if Du Lin was a child of a wealthy family, and there was still a discussion before, now it seems that there should be no The problem is. She felt a little sad in her heart and felt a sense of guilt for her "snobbish" thoughts. At the same time, she felt a relaxed feeling. If Du Lin was a rich child or a child of right, then at least she Parents who are far away from Orodo will not interfere with her relationship with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the main reason why she has to escape from Ordo, because she does not want to be the only bystander in this life’s life. She needs to resist, only in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating a meal for 120 yuan, Du Lin was able to leave after signing his name on the bill. Alisa's "energy" to Du Lin was once again refreshed. She spit out her tongue, and under the influence of the red wine, some of her super relatives held Duolin's arm, and the two were almost stuck together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is dinner still satisfied?", Du Lin opened the door for Alisa like a gentleman, no, he is a gentleman at this moment, in A In the eyes of Lisa, Du Lin’s smile was so glaring, like looking at the sun in the sky during the summer, giving her a dazzling illusion. She nodded her face with blushing face. I don't know if it was because of the role of alcohol or Du Lin's performance. "You are satisfied that it is undoubtedly the biggest award for me. Please sit down, please let me go!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went around the cab and sat in the door, this time at the request of Alisa, she sat in the position of the co-pilot, he looked at Ali Sha, "It’s not early, I should send you home. Where are you living now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No.42, No.6 Street... "Alisa spoke out the place where she lived, and at the same time, she gave birth to an idea that she was scared. She didn't want to go home now!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that in her entire life from birth to the present, she has always played the role of a prostitute. When I was a child, I listened to my parents at home. After I went to school, I heard the teacher’s words. She was able to advance to the university and continue her studies. She also gave up her eagerness under the fallacies of her parents, “Girls are not used in college.” They became the central bank under the arrangement of their parents. staff of. She has been obsessed with everything her parents have told her, girls have to be reserved, girls want to be self-love, girls want to...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but at this moment, This second, she suddenly had a strong desire to break the imprisonment imposed on her by her parents in the past 19 years. She wanted to quietly violate the rules in this place away from her parents' eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she still has a little hesitation because it’s “a bad thing” for her, a kind of damage to the establishment of complete values ​​in the past. Just in the hesitation of her ideological struggle, the car slowly stopped. She looked at the window at this time, and when she looked familiar with the door that had become clear without having to identify it, she stunned. As long as she left the car, and said goodbye to Doolin, after returning home to wash and lie on the bed, she is still the baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if she does not leave the car and leave this place, then she is a bad girl in the eyes of her parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good boy has been doing for 19 years, not tired? She asked herself this way, sniffing the faint breath of males in the air inside the car. Her heart was a little chaotic, and Du Lin’s concern sounded in a timely manner. “What?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa suddenly took a sigh of relief and showed a big smile. "I think it's still early, how about going out for a walk? Or going to the bar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar, in Alisa’s cognition is a place full of mystery, her classmates and colleagues are full of praise for the place, but in the parents and elders In the mouth, there is a place to hide dirt and devils. She is very curious, curiosity is one of the greatest motivations of mankind, and the desire to detect is deeply engraved in the depths of human soul, so she always wants to see what the bar is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is not alone, but now has Du Lin, she is inexplicably full of courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is as considerate and gentle as he has shown, he said "After you wish", driving the car to the nearest grade It is also the best bar to drive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinking neon lights and quirky smells make Alisa, who just got off the bus, have a feeling of not being able to say, just like something is jumping in the chest, taking root germination. She was somewhat timid and holding Duolin's arm tightly, and entered the bar under the surveillance of two strong men who didn't look like a good man. The dark walkway is very dark, with a small window on one side of the walkway. Alisa whispered in a curious voice: "Is there a ticket to enter the bar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in her opinion, the small window on the side of the walkway and a lot The local ticket window was exactly the same. Du Lin smiled and shook his head, and said to her sideways face: "That is the place to change the change. You can exchange the large-value banknotes with fifty-dollar and one-piece, two-face denominations. "Almost all bars have such a place. The bar is not a symbol of elegant culture. On the contrary, in the eyes of Alisa parents and more social elites and upper-class people, the bar is full of filth. Places, for example, some women who are very afraid of heat often appear here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these women, it is impossible to use ten, fifty, and one hundred denominations, most of which are fifty cents and one Banknotes, plus some other small games, so change is the basic item for every bar to have fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
