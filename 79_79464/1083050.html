			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin wants to borrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angrio’s brain immediately started to work at the speed of light, and a squeaking sound in his head produced a super black hole in the middle of the rotating brain. All his thoughts were swallowed up and processed and spit out from the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who just got 100 million in cash, has to borrow, and with the assessment of Du Lin’s assets by Southcomer, he is now able to draw funds about eight. Between ten and two hundred million. With so much liquidity, it still needs to be borrowed from the bank. What does Dolin want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many big consortiums are unable to allocate so much money at a time, and there are still business plans that can be used more than 200 million and cannot be paid in installments. Huge amount of cash? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angrio replied while meditating, "This is very simple. When you need it, please call me and I will notify you." At the headquarters, the approval...", he suddenly came back to God, "Yes, how much do you plan to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders," The more the better, as long as you dare to borrow, I dare to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to roll the money abroad?", Anglio A joke, and at the same time I can't figure out what my heart is like being scratched by a cat. "Can you tell me what big plans are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin crossed his door to the garden leading to the manor. "I am very interested to tell you, but it seems that our lawyers have already got things done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Anglio also looked back and could only give up this opportunity for the time being. Obviously Du Lin would not tell him, otherwise it would be a long way from here to the manor’s room. The little things say clearly. But the more confidential Du Lin is, the more he does not tell him, the more he is curious. Just completed a "big sale" to make his heart somewhat inflated. He thinks this is also an opportunity. If the family's assets can be significantly improved again, he may be able to become Mr. Di Plessi directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for his father and uncle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not a problem, the family will always need only one, the best one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the two signed their names on the contract, the contract came into effect and Du Lin transferred part of the patent to the Southern Business. Bank, Angelo also guarantees that within a week, all the money will be credited to Doolin's account in the South Commercial Bank, and there will be no restrictions on the contract, which is also marked on the contract. After sending away Anglio and his lawyers, Doolin returned to the manor and sat under the umbrella. Natiya was obviously a little nervous. Yesterday, Du Lin spent so much money to "buy" her to make her very moved, but at the same time there is a hint of security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone has given up so much interest just for something that doesn’t seem to have any value, then he must have other purposes. Natiya touched her wedding ring and poured a cup of tea for Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just talked to Angelo. He said that your contract has not been renewed. Does this mean that you can work for me at any time? "Du Lin took a sip of tea and put it back and looked at Natiya." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya nodded and said, "This is indeed the case. They pay me every month, but they don’t sign the contract. They told me because I am senior. Partner, so I don't need to sign any employment agreement. I consulted a lawyer and the lawyer told me that it was wrong, but I can't ask the board for this guaranteed contract, especially after they refused me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I still need to go back and tell my family that my work has changed. I may come with them and may need to sell some industries..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she and her family come to the emperor or other places, then Styley’s villa, house and car may need to be disposed of, she does not need those things It is. Although the real estate industry has begun to heat up, the massive influx of people in the city requires the city to have more homes to meet these needs, but it is not the most appropriate time. There will also be a long climb phase, and she will need a fee to set up a place to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded very well. "It doesn't matter. You have a long time to do what you want to do. You are all before September. It is free. You may have to go to the Commonwealth with me after September. This time will be very long and will not come back until next year, so you need to make advance arrangements."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, starting today, I am your official job, personal assistant, I hope you can enjoy the new job...", Du Lin suddenly thought of something, "Yes, what is your income in the South Commercial Bank?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After suddenly becoming a personal assistant, Natiya is still somewhat uncomfortable. She has not done a similar job, although she knows what she is going to do, "Partner The identity allows me to get 48,000 pieces from the bank every year, and they will give me a fixed salary of 220 yuan each month." The income of about 50,000 yuan is not a small amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately equals the savings of a common working-class family for ten years. This is this society, simple and real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly had a new problem. "I am very eager to ask, I heard that you still have a loan, such a high income should not require a loan." Can you cope with life?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya wants to laugh at Doolin’s unexpected work-independent problem, she knows that this is purely a young man’s Curiosity, she explained it patiently. In fact, the more glamorous people, the more they spend on their daily expenses. In order to guarantee her image, Natiya spends a lot of money every month on luxury goods, such as various types of women's products. This is the only way she can be decent in advanced situations. In addition, she still needs to pay an expensive tuition fee for her daughter attending a noble school, as well as money for her husband, so she is not too wealthy at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to have more money than the average person, but it is far worse than the real rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dullin who satisfies curiosity doesn’t know, in fact, his daily consumption is not as simple as buying a pack of cigarettes, whether he is in the west or elsewhere. Every month, even if he doesn't need the cost, it is also on the order of thousands. For example, the management team hired by this estate has 3,000 yuan per month, plus clothes and luxury goods. He may only come once or twice a year in the capital, and he will swallow him fifty or six thousand a year. Blocks are not limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since talking about the salary problem, Natiya has some embarrassment in her heart, she does not know what kind of salary Du Lin can give her, this is her concern Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will sign a long-term employment contract for at least ten years, and I hope that you can understand this..." Natiya nodded. Du Lin spent a lot of money to dig her, she must also pay a certain price in a certain aspect, long-term contract is one of them, "I will give you 60,000 annual salary every year, pay quarterly, does not include all kinds of bonuses and Welfare, I will provide the accommodation. If you have any requirements, you can say it now. The lawyers are there, and I hope that we can implement the matter as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
