			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was still a little uncertain after hanging up the phone. He picked up the phone and personally called the Bank of the Imperial Bank of the Muriel region. The call soon Was connected, the telephone is the customer service operator of the bank, is a girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, dear user, here is the traffic service of the bank of the Venus area of ​​the Yaoxing Empire. What can I do for you?", girl The voice is very sweet, and the girls who do the traffic service have strict standards in their voices. First, they must have a fluent general language and a fluent imperial language. Even though 99% of the people today use the Pan-Continental common language exchange, there are always some fucking guests who like to use the Ogdin language, which is the imperial language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps these people just want to hear the traffic girls are overwhelmed, and then humiliate them to get some kind of distorted pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his mouth and turned and relied on a cigarette on the edge of the window. "Hey...call... I want to check my account." In the current situation, my account is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic girl immediately started to reverse some of the documents on the table and found the Dulin in the account freeze category. The account, after carefully reading the freezing notice, she replied, "Hello, dear user, I have already checked your account for you, and your account is now frozen."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you ask me why my account is frozen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good ten minutes without the voice of the operator, and then changed someone to answer the phone, the person who answered the phone, Du Lin knows, is the president of the Bank of the Muriel region This guy also asked him to eat. The reason for asking him to eat was that Du Lin transferred a large amount of funds of more than 60 million yuan from other places to the bank of the Vanlier area, which made the bank president excitedly break through his limits. He has been abstinent for more than a decade. Because of his age and pressure, his work is very diverse. So long ago, there was no passion for war between husband and wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that night, he was like when he was just married in his twenties, the horn of the war blew all night, so that he went to work the next day. I also slept asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor is holding the phone, and the earpiece that is less than one pound is still in the hands of thousands of tons. He took a long time to bring the receiver to his ear. "Mr. Doolin, it is me. I apologize for what you have encountered now. After the signing of a confirmation letter from Mr. Phillips, the director of the central bank's head office, I took over the responsibility of freezing my account. I am very sorry about this and I am not able to do anything for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the President, Doolin understood in his heart that Felice knew that he was secretly buying the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in many people's view, there is little difference between acquiring a contract and developing a new user. Why do you need to take the risk of offending others to buy these contracts, why is Phyllis? It is also necessary to prevent him from acquiring these contracts on the premise of offending Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s very simple. It takes too long to develop new users to promote the benefits of participating in insurance, and then need a lot of salesmen to encourage those people to spend money. Buying insurance takes too much time. Whether it is the training of salesmen, the slogans, promotional and textbook content used to promote operations, and finally the full spread of the business, it takes a long time. Months, even a year, and not necessarily can achieve eye-catching results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, letting someone pay for a thing that they have never heard of is not a simple matter. If you blow it well, some people believe that it is not ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the acquisition of these contracts is much simpler. These people themselves are the "problems" left over by the three-guarantee policy. They have a mature experience in insurance. There is probably something about the insurance, how to implement it, and it is not against the insurance. These people can become the most solid cornerstone of an insurance company. Only by having these people can they make more attempts in the insurance business and promote it to the society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An insurance company with millions of people participating in insurance is far superior to an insurance company that no insured has, and who can Striving for the insureds in the west and the contracts in their hands means that anyone can take a step ahead of others in the insurance business, even 2345 5667. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are important to Phyllis, to Perito, to Dulin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bellito and Phyllis were thinking about swallowing all the insured and the contract in an official form, Doolin had already begun. The action of the acquisition is not waiting for me. It is a bit of a fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who had been fascinated, chuckled a few times. "You don't apologize to me for the troubles of others. I think I already know. If there is any need, I will call you directly." After hanging up the phone Dooling gave Mr. Jack a call, said something about his bank account being frozen, and then asked Mr. Jack to support him with two or three fund accounts. Mr. Jack did not have any objection to this, and directly gave Du Lin three fund accounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum number of these funds accounts is 3 million, and the number is more than 10 million. This money is enough for him to carry out the matter urgently. Moreover, with the familiarity of Mr. Jack and the imperial central bank, even without the approval of the board of directors, even if Philis has no right to freeze these accounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Mr. Jack’s support, Doolin’s man helped the unlucky person to change a check and let him cash in for eighty-five dollars from the bank. Some people who would have been suspicious of the letter also began to queue up to replace the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice didn’t know that Du Lin had solved the problem in just half an hour, when he sat in the restaurant and met with Perito, and Hu. Mayor Leo, he must talk to these two people. The competition between pure and southern commercial banks can be understood no matter who wins or loses. After all, they are powerful and powerful economies. It is understandable to lose, but you should not join more spoilers. A guy like Du Lin should kick him out early and not let him continue to mess around here. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the end, whether it is the victory of the Southern Commercial Bank or the victory of the Imperial Central Bank, the commonality and cooperation between them is the same. Those who have lost can learn mature management and operational experience directly from the winners, and help to directly open up this market. Moreover, in the view of Phyllis, it is enough for the two big banks in this market to do so, and no more participants are needed. He must show his vision and determination to Perito to help him with the work he is going to do in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:40, Perito and Julio were late, and it was not unexpected for the two to come to Felice. He was early. Knowing the relationship between Perito and Julio, the two bastards worked very well in the South, and the cooperation between them led to a new development model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice stood up and greeted him, "Mr. Julio, I have heard of you, even our directors often say, We should have more of the mayor of Julio who cares about urban development, and the mayor who is more willing to accept new things leads the empire to a stronger one." The two shook hands and let go, Julio gave the position to Perito. . Faced with this opponent in the west, and also a very famous banker, Phyllis smiled and sighed. "Peleto President, I am very happy to see you, but I have seen a lot about it. The cooperation between you and the mayor of Julio is very exciting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
