			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group did not disband, but was kicked by the administrator "Bit Milk Girl". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is not complicated. The management called "Bit Milk Girl" is one of the earliest readers to join the readership, and it is quite active, so I gave him the location of the administrator and hoped to help me manage my readership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I still had a job, I couldn’t see anything in the readership anytime, anywhere, so someone needed to maintain a "12" readership. order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a growing number of readers, and the book’s grades are slightly better, the “Bit Milk Girl” administrator The identity of management has a sense of honor, a sense of belonging, wants to be responsible for more things, constantly appealing to me, and hopes that I can carry out his ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand this. After all, he really likes this book. Every reader who likes this book is my most valuable asset! Even if the suggestions and appeals made are not so suitable for me, I have not said anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reasonable to adopt, but I have to insist on my position because of unreasonable things, because I am not responsible for a certain person, I need to be responsible for my work, Responsible to all readers who like this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that there are a thousand Hamlet in a thousand people, but there is only one author. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a reader, no matter what power he has in the readership, I personally think that it should not interfere excessively with the author's creation in the plot. When "Bit Milk Girl" proposed to interfere with the plot, when I asked for creation and creation, I dealt with it coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand that the starting point of this group management is good. His purpose is to hope that the book will perform better and the readers will be more united and friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I personally think that things that are not related to creation, we can negotiate, but interfere with the things I create, can not compromise. Everyone can come together, not because of a hodgepodge, but because of the book I wrote. When my book is no longer what I want to write, or even when I am not writing, who is willing to read it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
