			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word from Marquez made Du Lin realize that although he had left the whirlpool of the empire's hinterland, the old man's attention was always on his own. He is very aware of some of the responsibilities that he currently carries, but the attention of Magus is clearly beyond the level of attention he deserves. When a person pays attention to you all the time, there are only two possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first possibility, he values ​​you very much, I hope to see your growth every day, know what you have done recently, what have you gained, whether you made mistakes And have you summarized any lessons? This is a kind of love that the elders love for their favorite juniors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second possibility, he is watching out for you, he doesn’t want to give him a knife from behind when he is fighting, so he has to keep his time. Keep your mind awake, lock your actions with your eyes, and beware of any behavior that might harm you. He doesn't trust you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin does not naively think that he is doing something and promises some good prospects. Magus will regard himself as his true successor. Come to pay attention. What Du Lin did at his level is indeed a great thing, and even some things have risen to the big level of national strategy. But Du Lin is also very clear that the old man sitting opposite him personally took the royal family of his ancestors' loyalty from the throne of power. In the 20 years he took over the military, politics, culture and all aspects of the empire, It can be said that it is the right to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more people in the empire who have more power than him, Du Lin or the big aristocratic capitalists outside, what they have Resources are a joke for Magus. When people are still satisfied with tens of millions of billions of wealth, the state finances that Magus can control at his disposal have long been calculated with billions of settlement units. The resources he has in his possession can cover every corner of the empire, and all the material they possess will not be seen by Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what else can Du Lin achieve? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did these things, came up with these ideas, his brain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a dangerous brain, and he is very clear about himself, so he can clearly understand that Magus’s concern for himself is definitely not love, and It is a kind of surveillance, a kind of guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled on his face without changing his color, just as he had never thought of so many things at this moment. It was very natural to follow the words of Magus. "I got some mines and some land." When the mayor was busy, I couldn’t help but be lonely. I just heard that the West is working on a green home development plan. In order to show my lofty patriotic sentiments, I found something there. Do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus has a confused mind, what green home development plan, he simply does not know this thing, there is no one in the cabinet can dare Look at him. But he quickly reacted, and this must be the doorman's handwriting. The damn horse dealer is really very annoying. If it wasn't for Magus to have his own ideas and plans, he would have to let the Mennon completely disappear into the world. Who would marry him so much? Things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody dawn embers he led have been chaotic in the sparsely populated areas of the west, before the armed uprising was launched to break the entire west, after being suppressed I fled abroad. Later, he changed and formed the Kadima Party and won the sphere of influence in the west. According to the average person, the doormen may be killed before they do these things, but Magus is not an ordinary person. Even if you kill the doormen, there are window farmers and chimney farmers, these endless characters will continue to challenge the nerves of the imperial ruling party. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of letting them continue to evolve in battles again and again, mastering more advanced and superior means, it is better to let the clowns climb to the table and let They stood in the spotlight and then let the world naturally eliminate this group of deformed and twisted bugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the policies that the doorman made, Magus had already foreseen his end, he would not have any good end, he colluded with the capitalist to see Going up in the early stages of development will have a very outstanding performance, but he lacks a solid foundation. Once the accident capitalists will immediately abandon the loser, it is the best time to start this group of people after losing the support of the capitalists and the soil for local survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time may have to wait a few years or longer, and Magus may not even see the day, but Du Lin suddenly went. The West let Magus see the dawn. If Du Lin’s scourge goes to the west, can it catalyze the speed at which the Kadima Party will fall, let this day come earlier? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very likely because Du Lin’s ambition is great. He simply couldn't help but want to go to the west, but went to the west to look for "opportunities." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart people always like it, but they are also afraid to stay with smart people. Because smart people can understand the ideas of smart people, it seems that the word "smart" is common and common, but in fact the word can make the whole society The ninety-nine-nine-nine-nine people are completely screened out, leaving only one in ten thousand people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin wants to go to the west, Magnus’s first thought at the time was that Doolin was going to jump out, because now the situation in the empire is only the best in the West. Start at zero." Although Magus does not want to admit this, he must admit that in the eyes of the simple cowboys in the west, the empire is only a very general term. Many people have never left the West for a lifetime, and they rarely enjoy the help and inclination of various policies from the Empire, so these people cannot always put the concept of the Empire in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever gives them benefits, they will laugh at who they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever let them eat their stomachs, they will let the other party see their "sense"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knew that he could not do what he wanted in the New Party, so he had to jump out. After Magus realized that there was a corresponding response, he could not let such a man with ambition and dangerous thoughts grow up in the empire day by day unless he was willing to accept a rope on his neck. But he will never agree, just as Maggs will not agree. He smiled and nodded. "The west is the next place where the empire is in urgent need of development. There are large areas of land and abundant resources, but economic construction has always been It is the last place where the empire fell. Is there any interest in finding a place to be a mayor in the west? Is this compensation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus’s thinking has always been In the midst of being active, he can think while talking, and even change his mind. He quickly denied the previous thoughts, if he could pull Doolin back to the camp of the New Party, even if it was only superficial. Then he wants to achieve his ambitions and desires, he must do it a little - let the western economy develop rapidly and vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west is not the city of Otis, and there is no longer a miracle in the city of Otis. It takes at least twenty years to transform the entire west. Twenty years later, Du Lin, in his forties, arrived at that time when he wanted to start from scratch, fearing that it would be impossible to wait for the day of his death. Of course, the guard should still be on guard, and the remaining back hand should still be left behind. Magus is really reluctant to give up Doolin and his magical brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and Magus looked at each other for a short few seconds. Du Lin just shook his head and said: "No, my current status is a bit special, it is not convenient to re-govern in a short time. Waiting for the next election year. Let's talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus's pupil narrowed slightly, and he smiled and nodded. As for whether he agreed with Doolin, that is another It’s all about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly pulled the topic back from Doolin’s personal affairs to the question they had talked about before, and Magus put the pieces on the board neatly. The meticulous attitude and the focused look are as important as the one he is doing. "The Cape family will be in a hurry soon. By then, the pressure on your side will be heavier. He has a lot of connections. Every aspect will bring you a lot of pressure and threats. What you have to do is to protect yourself and show them their persecution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "These people have a net and are entangled with each other. As long as the problem of the Cape family becomes a social problem, we can start to attack him." Magus picked up a piece representing the soldier. Put it in the position where it should be, "Cape family...", then pick up a few other ones, put them neatly, "The sacred consortium...", then the horses and siege equipment," The relationship chain of the northern nobility..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Finally, when I picked up the "king" and put it back in the last position, I looked up at Du Lin, "The Noble Capitalist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a request, I hope that you can do it for me. I know that you have paid a lot, and I have not given you anything, but I think our goals and ideals are the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When Du Lin returned home from Magus's villa, Freina had curled up on the sofa and watched the new tape. The Royal Academy had no equipment like a TV to let the students spend time. Strictly known schools can't wait to tear students into two halves, half learning, half rest, waiting for the time to change the two halves, and learn forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at Du Lin, and she regained her gaze and continued to concentrate on watching the darker pictures on the TV screen, laughing from time to time. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took off his jacket and went to the edge of the sofa to sit down and asked, "How come you want to come today?", he gave Freina here. Key, but I heard that she has not been alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
