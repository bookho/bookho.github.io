			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin talked with the four federal parliamentarians for a short time. He also changed the situation of the empire a little and used it in his own conversational strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must have a very good understanding of the empire. After all, we have been with us for a long time, dating back hundreds of years.", Du Lin’s sentence got Everyone recognized, they nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of the existence of the Federation is not short-lived, but it has not formed a concept similar to "the country" for many years, more like a large group of businessmen living together, And build some fairs in some convenient places. Gradually these places became more and more prosperous because of the existence of merchants. Finally, they changed from a market to a township, and they have evolved into a city. After a long period of time in a city without a national concept, these speakers, that is, the founding of the nationality The ancestors thought why not join together and turn a loose business alliance into a country? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country has the advantage of the country, the regulation and utilization of goods and management is more convenient, and it is also very helpful to manage the entire business alliance, so the commercial federation is finally formed. This unique country. In some policies and systems, the federal government also directly copied the empire's system, but not all. They feel good and use it. If they feel bad, they don't need it. After all, there is still a big gap between the federation and the empire, whether it is the country. The system, or the social stratum composition, is almost completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Du Lin’s question is to tell them that they are actually going wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The decentralization of power will bring a lot of danger, people will not fear authority, they are free to use it, and even breed a dangerous idea." "There are some similar problems in the Empire and the Commonwealth. For example, capital forces erode the interference of political power. Many large consortia and capitalists in the empire are looking to train themselves." Political spokespersons, by helping these political spokespersons continue to improve their political status, and finally profit from policy tilt. But this is not the same as the federal, no matter what strengths these big consortia and capitalists have, what kind of social influence they have, they They must all play 'games' within the framework set by the cabinet. If they cross the line, they will have serious consequences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People will always fear The full power of power is also fully understood. This is not obvious in the Federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin leaned on the sofa and changed his sitting position. "I checked back some information after I went back and learned that there are two very serious sports in the history of the Federation that can be called 'rebellion'. The first time is more than 70. Years ago, the 'retro sport' initiated by several big capitals, and the 'parliamentary reform movement' more than 30 years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a "retro The movement was initiated by several big capitalists and believed that the founding of the nationality was plundering the interests of all merchants. The country did not exist in the form of a country at the beginning. This is a loosely-structured alliance. Each big businessman has a piece of his own. In the territories, they trade in their own territory, and there is no behavior or nature of any country. The alliance has gradually become more and more prosperous, and more and more businessmen have appeared here to trade, so that these so-called "building a national family" feel a huge crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they used their unprecedented influence and the power from others to forcefully turn this loose alliance into a country, by controlling the plunder The interests of other businessmen to stabilize their power and wealth. This kind of behavior is as shameless as a bandit thief. What is even more shameless is that they have made a life-like system of such decaying feudal rule for their own status, to persecute businessmen in the Federation. For the future of the federation, for the benefit of all merchants, these big capitalists have launched this great action known as the “retro sport”. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They advocated the federal referendum, privately connected the consortium and the big capitalists in the federation, and wanted to fundamentally disintegrate the president’s lifelong system and build these powers from the national family. Freed up in your hands. For this reason, of course, they need to have some excuses to get their hands. For example, let the country restore its true form, liberate power from a few people, and so on, so it is called "retro sport." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence of this movement is that the ruling system is completely divided into two systems, when a large number of government officials joined the massive movement, especially It is the government officials who are second only to the speaker. They will never be able to win the highest power. Therefore, some people are more willing to try to break through this layer of embarrassment. Maybe they will be able to win the peak of power in their lifetime. These people have been completely eroded by capital power, and some of them are capitalists themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that movement, the joint parliament and the nation-building were almost overturned, but they came over with their resources and strength, and the federal system of governance also There has been a change. The big capitalists who launched this movement have already fled overseas. Of course, this is an official statement. They will not admit that they are cruel and do not accept the corrupt rulers of opposition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
