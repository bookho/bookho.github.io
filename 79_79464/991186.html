			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus put a hand in his hand on the table and pushed it to the other side of the table with his index finger. "You listened these days." What interesting things are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace nodded and replied: "I heard the new mayor of Otis, Mr. Donald and the Cape family. The members conspired to attempt to assassinate the former mayor, Mr. Du Lin, and the final assassination failed. Mr. Du Lin was also injured. Later, I did not know why the matter temporarily subsided for some time. Until this morning, I heard from the Ministry of Justice. Mr. Lin took the two parties to court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus raised his hand and the index finger left the document on the desk. He pointed to Wallace. "Very good, this time I issued a special permit order that you need to investigate is this thing, we should not tolerate such a person who breaks the rules, and you are the defender of the rules. To investigate Mr. Donald and Cape Is there any collusion or other relationship between the families? If the situation is true Hold the evidence to find me, you know how to do it!", his fingers curled up and buckled on the table, "You can do something!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Wallace slightly succumbed to the ceremony, took the special license issued by Magus himself in the first two steps, carefully folded into the pocket of his shirt, and then retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past or in the present, the empire has the same attitude towards the nobility to the nobility, that is, to try not to investigate these people as much as possible. Let them have a foundation that is fully trusted. In the past, this was the necessary means for the royal family and the emperor to defend their rights and interests. If you always doubt the character of the nobles and whether they betrayed themselves, then they will inevitably lose the support of these nobles, and may thus break out the civil war and even cause the imperial power to shake. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the new era, the ruling party will not arbitrarily investigate any party within the party in order to gain more supporters. The composition of the new party is very complicated. It consists of a multi-class class member such as aristocrats, capitalists, and civilians. Once it touches the nerves of a certain class, it is very likely to cause a series of problems. Powell is one of them. Magnus knows that Powell is now standing opposite to himself, but he still hasn't made any move to Powell, just to prevent the new party from climbing up the new party. Members of the civilian class panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the internal investigation department rarely takes the initiative to do anything, most of the time they are idle and have nothing to do, cooperate with this department to do something, or help the department to do Something. Only after Maggs signed a special permit, the internal affairs department will begin a full-scale forensic investigation of members of the party. Magus also recognized some problems in the party's investigation department, so he proposed to set up a brand new department to deal with official crimes. This department has not yet been established and is still being planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hopes to replace the internal affairs departments within the old and new parties with this neutral and relatively moderate department and achieve more progress and achievements in anti-official crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why Magus will issue this special permit after the Cape family entered the market for two reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that he intends to use the Cape family as a springboard, allowing them to pull more noble capitalists into the case, involving more nobles. Capitalists, then crush them all. This may be able to satisfy the hypothesis that the sociologist has made power and redistribution of the smashing class. And these people really should be transformed, so only after the Cape family enters the market can they start planning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Magus also left a last hesitation to Donald. If he chooses to compromise, he may be transferred to a remote city as mayor. Job. But four years later, when Magnus is about to step down, he will definitely return Donald. Even if you can't go to a SAR like the city of Otis or the bustling city as the mayor, an ordinary city is still possible. Because he is a chess piece, he can be said to be an "innocent" piece in the whole plan. He has endured something he should not bear, and he has adhered to his own principles and should give him certain compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan was to use the sacred consortium to operate a person to become the mayor of Otis, with the captain of the Cape family, Cape The family will definitely invest heavily in the city of Otis, and this will become the grave they have dug for themselves. But what I didn't expect was that the Cape family put their energy into the new special zone in the south. It seemed that the mayor of Otis, who was vacant in front of him, seemed indifferent, and made a small deviation in the plan of Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this deviation is, in the final analysis, still in Du Lin. Because he killed Solo, there is no such person in the Cape family. One lost his face in the city of Otis, and he is still in the position of a competitor. He urgently needs to retrieve his face from the city of Otis with certain family rights. character! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Soro is not dead, Du Lin will definitely persuade the family to use certain resources to operate a freshly baked mayor of Otis. The problem is that he was killed by Doolin and the main members of the Cape family are well aware. Although there is no evidence to link Soro's disappearance with Doolin, everyone agrees that people must be done by Doolin. At this time, I will stimulate the madman who just lost the official position to tear away the interests he left in the city of Otis. Will he make crazy things again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Cape family directly ignored the city of Otis on the edge of their mouths, so they gave up the Otis in order to seize the opportunity in the South as soon as possible. city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the appearance of Donald, his appearance attracted firepower to the Cape family, perhaps before that, old Cape was unwilling to miss the battle with Doolin. The opportunity of the South. But now that the opportunity in the South can be seized, the Mayor of Otis takes the initiative to send the meat to their mouths, and they have no reason not to bite. If Doolin really ran away and went crazy for this thing, he would definitely bite Donald. When he killed Donald, there was enough evidence for the Cape family to directly defeat Du Lin on the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the law is still a bit useful, especially when certain big people who take advantage of the law take the edge of the law, the law is considered "fair" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a series of coincidences, mutual influence, things have become more complicated, but in the end, they still follow the script to the end that should be headed, Cape The family has entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a coincidence in the whole process, and there is deliberate, can only say that the world is really a horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for this was that Donald fell to the rotten aristocratic capital camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon that day, the Supreme Court of the Imperial Capital announced the investigation of the allegations made by Mr. Doolin and entered the stage of collecting evidence, while also issuing to Doolin, Donald and The order of the Polly trio. Before the end of the case, the three were not allowed to leave the empire, otherwise they would face very serious consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Du Lin invited the main partner of the law firm where Kevin had worked to form a gorgeous team of lawyers to fight for him. From the beginning of the work to the end of the final trial of the case, Du Lin will have to pay at least the lawyer’s fee of no less than 800,000. In fact, he can let Kevin help himself, but Kevin will soon be promoted to the prosecutor. He is also in a sensitive period, and it is not convenient to use him for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, even if he can’t appear in court, it doesn’t mean he can’t appear in the lawyers’ group. It’s normal to have a private gathering after work. Some business experiences are not illegal. Everyone is a barrister, how to drill a hole is more clear than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
