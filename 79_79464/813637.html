			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Du Lin suddenly grabbed Sebreu’s wrist, and the right hand grabbed the fork and picked it up, and he inserted it into his palm. In the middle, the faint can hear the sound of "咚", the fork has been deeply immersed in the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebble was a dull one second before it broke out with amazing screams, letting him struggle, the forks did not move. At the same time, both Buddha and Ellis took out their pistols and took control of the people that Sebray brought. Sudden changes made all the people present stunned, and the waiter's body began to tremble, standing at the door and thinking about going out and dare not open the door, shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin picked up the pure white napkin and slowly wiped the blood stains on his right hand and placed it on the corner of the table. He walked to the locker next to him, took a new fork, and returned to his seat, pulling the seat forward and leaning back, continuing to break down the steak in the plate. The steak is roasting well, there are six matures, the appearance is slightly slight, and there is a pink color inside. The entrance is very tender and the taste is very good. This hotel has a good chef.赛 布雷 布雷 布雷 布雷 布雷 布雷 布雷 布雷 布雷Up, hold down the other hand of Sebray and insert the second fork into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a violent spurt in his eyes, and Sabres made a chill. Finally, he snorted and sorted out the clothes that had gotten too fast and the movements were too big and messed up, and sat back again. The cold expression on his face remained unchanged, and another knife was placed in the right hand, replacing the role of the fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebray did not make a loud scream again this time. Once people are psychologically prepared, they will naturally enhance the recipients in the next few things. ability. He looked at Du Lin with a cold look, and he couldn't wait for the beast to tear Du Lin into pieces. After living for so many years, when did he try such pain? Whether it is before or now, he is a respected "Mr. Sebble" by the Guarts. He is a decent figure with a face and a face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time it was already cold, and the sweat of the beans on the face of Sai Berry rolled down. He swallowed a bite of spit and moistened some torn scorpions. Looking at Du Lin, "Why, what am I doing wrong? Why are you doing this to me?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin ignored him. He split the last small piece of steak and swallowed it in the mouth. He took the napkin and dipped his lips, and dropped it on the table. He leaned back, tilted his leg, took a box of cigarettes out of his pocket, and tapped one. The blue smoke rises and there is an indescribable beauty. Through this layer of smoke, the eyes of the two meet. An anger, fear, cruelty, a calm, but a surging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat slightly sideways, calmly watching Sebble, letting his angry roar, all indifferent. For a while, Du Lin bounced the ash and asked softly: "I know that many people see my young appearance and feel that I am very fooled, I feel Even if I have seen it, I can fool the past. Many people think so and do it, but I forgive them and send them to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sebray, what about my people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebeira suffered a pain, his face paled, or the previous rhetoric, "They are helping in the North City." I did..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up again, and he took the bottle of red wine on the table and leaned forward to face the head of Sebray. The past. A thick bottle of wine smashed from it, and the red wine drenched him, and two pieces of glass also scratched his cheek. Sebble’s eyes were black in the blink of an eye, and there was only a squeaky voice in his head. Everything in front of him became a ghost. He has a feeling of wanting to vomit, and his chest is a bit dull, and it will take a while to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Sebray, Du Lin is the kind of child with a wealthy fantasy, he does not know that in this world want to be Guart How difficult is it to raise the status of the people, the kingdom of Guart has died, and there are no more shit kings and gods who protect the Guartes. If the first king and the gods are really eternal, why haven’t they ignored their children and grandchildren these years? It is just a lie of the ignorant fool's self-consolation. Instead of imagining those unrealistic and ridiculous ideals, it is better to make more money on the ground. Isn't it better to have money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who can care for other people in this era? It’s really important to live your life first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time Du Lin left, he asked the people who stayed in Doolin to have a meal, and at the dinner table, the five young people People drink. He is bullying those young people, have not seen any market, and soon drank too much in people's compliments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebray hadn't figured out the details of Doolin, so he didn't really dare to kill the five people. He tied them up at the beginning, held them in the suburban warehouse, and arranged people there. Watching them, giving them food and drink, not letting them die. Then he found the big leader of the local smuggling gang, saying that he had some private wine in his hand and was willing to sell the wine in his hand to the group of desperados. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the smuggling gang, what they did was this sale, although it’s not clear what kind of tricks Sebble wants to play, but if the money is sent to the door, it’s not true. Sorry, they may be able to eat the gun's head at any time. After seeing Sebray’s piles of private wine stored in the dock warehouse, the leader of the smuggling gang, a guy named Jerez, immediately made a decision and was willing to eat the goods at a relatively low price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerez thought it was actually very simple, this is an unexpected wind. You don't need to risk taking the wine from other places, you can realize it when you change hands. Isn't that awkward money? At the same time, he also left a heart in his heart. As a member of the bustling city of Montreux, the underground world has already had their own sites. This sudden appearance of a large number of private wines indicates that someone is invading the private liquor market in Montreux. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This behavior is a provocation to Jerez and other smuggling gangs. After he bought the wine of Sebray, he made another request. Know who is supplying 赛布雷. How can this group of people with bloody mouths be the past that Sebble can cope with? He explained that not only did he not appease Jerez for a long time, but he almost started to move his hand. In order to avoid his own suffering, Sebble handed over all five people in Du Lin’s hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a relationship, Jerez thinks that Sebble is "harmless" and that it is harmful to the private wine supply that wants to invade the Montreux market. Business. He told Sebray that when the other party gave him the wine, he could take it, and then pass the news to him as soon as possible. He will come to the provocate who is called Du Lin, let him know that some money is not so good, is Will kill people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this requirement has been promised by Sebble, but it has not been implemented. No matter whether Du Lin is really a smuggler or a rich man, he is not able to deal with it. Instead of offending Dolin, who doesn't know the roots, it's better to fool Jerez. After he had made a few sales, he had money, and Jerez did not dare to deal with him. When it is time, I will leave Monter. If I have hundreds of thousands of dollars to go anywhere, I can’t live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is very good, he even thought of how to deal with Doolin, but he did not think that Du Lin looked young, but not a new debut, but a person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took off the cigarette on his mouth and reached out to crush the cigarette in the palm of Sebble. He wrapped his wrapper and suddenly sprinkled it. A smile, "Sebray, do you know? One of the ancient customs of our Guars is to deal with the traitors, you will be judged!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Sebray suddenly rounded up, how could he not know this custom? These customs have long been integrated with ethnic myths and legends, and have become the "education" that every guar must accept when he was young. His whole person began to tremble, and this time he realized how stupid he was doing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no... Mr. Doolin, you listen to me...", watching Du Lin walk around the table and walk to the door, Sebble stood in horror. stand up. He forgot that his hands were nailed to the table, suddenly got up and didn't get to the fork, and after a scream, he sat back. As I watched Du Lin go further and further, his heart is getting colder and colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Guart tradition, all betrayers are peeled alive and then hanged in the sun for three days. If the first king and the gods think that the sentenced person is not guilty, he will let him go and let him live. If the person who feels the victim is guilty, he will take the life of the victim in three days. Among the many rumors and real people, many of the prisoners who were tried have died in three days. Until now, only one person has survived, and this person is still only living in the story. No one knows whether he is Who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking that he was going to be tortured and treated like this, Sebray’s brains were all blown up. He was half-squatting and pushed the table to chase Du Lin, loud. Asking for Doolin's forgiveness, this time he seems to finally think of using the honorific words for Doolin, but at this point, it has been useless, no one can save him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sebray was about to catch up with Doolin, he rushed over the table and Sabre again made a fierce cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked to the door and watched the three compatriots who were pointed at by Ellis with a gun and did not dare to take any action, and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember, the first king and the gods are eternal, as long as there is any descendant in the world that circulates the blood of the first king, they will never be shattered! "When he finished talking, he smiled. "The rest of the way, you choose, I don't like to help people make decisions. It's a very cruel thing.", he said that he pushed the door out, long before the door. There were several hotel managers, and the screams of Sebray had already alarmed them, but they didn't dare to go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
