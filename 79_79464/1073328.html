			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do now?", looking at the back of Du Lin's back, Taylor touched and had a bit of a stinging cheek, surprisingly calm down. He sat back in his seat and looked at Perito sideways. "Is there any way to resolve the current situation?" Now his brain is in chaos, the plan is completely overturned, and even more terrible is Du Lin’s last say. The few words made him unable to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin very viciously led the contradiction to two branches, and handed the choice to the hands of the two major banks, he did not name it, this is personal behavior Or collective behavior, which left everyone with ample room for reversal, and it is a pity that Taylor is not here. Now he is also facing the two roads of this road. The first one, his future life and present will not change much, because all the problems are not on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully read the file that hit his face, perhaps because he was sucked a bit, so he wanted to find some holes. And the wrong, then humiliating back. He overestimated his knowledge of the law and underestimated the professionalism of a rogue lawyer headed by Adams. He did not find any useful things, but he was not completely unproductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the date of these patent certificate applications, which was close to two months ago, when the cabinet and the emperor had just finished negotiating this matter, he also It’s not his problem to fight for the quasi-retired employees who want to leave the empires to withdraw blood from the imperial central bank. He will not take any responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not looking for an individual to be responsible, maybe Phillips is more suitable, who asked him to not find the seriousness of the problem at the time, and did not consider more The problem of the countermeasures, and the search for a mating object in the west like a stallion with a hairy love? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also the leader of the central bank, Taylor, who is still a partner of the Imperial Bank, and also has the opportunity to enter the top of the central bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it really that simple? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few words of Doolin are trying to take away everything, this is the second way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware of the importance attached by the senior officials of the Imperial Bank to the insurance business. If Du Lin said that he died, perhaps the central bank’s top management can only extinguish this mentality, but now Du Lin did not say anything, but left a chance to turn around. He completely imagined that those in the board would abandon him ruthlessly in order to take a bite in the insurance business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is just an employee. Excellent talents line up every year to hand over their resumes to the personnel department of the Imperial Bank. Every year, the personnel in the personnel department must be from thousands. Some of the tens of thousands of talents among the empire are selected and included in the central bank's personnel system. With one more, the imperialist central bank will not become the most powerful economy in the world. But if one is missing him... maybe the council can find the balance between them and Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the question is coming, how much is Taylor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor wants to get through this problem, and Perito also wants to have this problem, but Perito’s situation is much better than Taylor’s, except he Beyond the branch president, it is a shareholder of the Southern Commercial Bank and a true banker. Even if the Southern Commercial Bank wants to throw him out of Du Lin for a ticket, it is not that easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has his own personal connections, there are many good friends, and friends who have interests, want him to quit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem, as long as the Southern Commercial Bank can get enough satisfaction, let him pay the price, and let his friends be satisfied with the price, then Why doesn't he quit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that he may have been able to get in his life are so simple. Why do you have to take shortcuts to challenge your abilities and prove that you are actually A stupid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what a mature banker should do to get the highest returns at the least cost. This is the truth that every banker and capitalist pursues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellito’s silence made Taylor more annoyed, and the guests who left behind were moving very fast, and they couldn’t wait to make this joke and their own good. Friends share. It is a very happy thing for the imperialist central bank to suffer. In the past few years, as long as the money is made, the imperial central bank will intervene in any business. Of course, they do not have to operate by themselves. Most of the time they join the capital competition by means of shareholding. In the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very disgusting. Inexplicably, I will give a part of the shares to the imperial central bank. I also want to show a smile and say that you can buy the shares of our company is my greatest recognition. Thank you for your help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of people who are dissatisfied with the imperialist central bank, but at the same time they have the need for the imperial central bank. When the liquidity is insufficient, the imperial central bank is the most lovely. The attitude of the imperial central bank when people, or in the face of hostile takeovers, also plays a decisive role. It is precisely because of various factors that have been mixed together to form a complex business circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound in the entire conference hall after these people left quickly. Perito’s elbow pressed against the table and covered his face with both hands, unable to see him. expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting for a moment, Taylor’s fierce kicked the table in front of him, and the hysterical stood up and turned to pick up the chair, squatting Everything that can be seen around. He needs to vent now, venting his anger, and alleviating the emotions of anger, fear, timidity, and anxiety in his heart. Bellito let go of Taylor and stunned for a while until he gasped and gasped and didn't have the strength to continue. Then he packed up the things on the table and stood up. "Go, go back, in Here we can't have any good way to solve the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor twisted his neck and put together his clothes and picked up the bag on the table with Perito. Going outside the door. Before the spiral staircase, Taylor saw two petals on the ground. I don't know why there was a sinister fire in my heart. I stepped on it and smashed it, then kicked it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kailemen Hotel has the best items, including renovations and maintenance, as well as the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carpet that comes up from this spiral staircase is hand-woven from a few ethnic groups in the federal government that have abandoned the residence. It looks like there is no amazing sight. The effect is not enough, but such a carpet requires at least eighty dollars of Imperial Stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carpet is also processed after a complicated process to ensure that the back of the carpet can fit the marble floor more, without slipping or bulging. . They put a special layer of resin on the back of the carpet to do this. They are also non-slip and can be well fitted to the ground, with a certain sealing effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the accident still happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Taylor uses his toes to crush the petals on the ground, a small amount of torque on the carpet causes the back of the semi-adsorbed marble mirror to protrude. Then Taylor kicked it up again. The movement of his kicking leg could not affect the grip of a whole piece of carpet. To put it simply, he overestimated his strength and lost his center of gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belito looked at Taylor’s whole person and dumped it. When he had already rolled down the third step, he reacted to catch him, but It is too late. He turned his eyes and turned around and couldn't bear to look at the guy who was screaming. For a while, when the screams gradually weakened, he saw Taylor lying on the first and second floor steps. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Taylor couldn’t do anything but faint mourning. He rolled over and made him make many intimate contacts with the steps. He even lifted it. You can't do an arm. The pain, and the feeling of losing strength, is terrible, and all this is Du Lin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin was outside the hotel. It was impossible for the hotel to report such a big thing to the police station and the investigation bureau. The news was also introduced to Kay. Mr. Le’s ear is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes someone had troubled in Kailemen, not everyone thought that a federal who had invaded the empire opened a hotel in the core of the empire. What a great deal, even think that this is the provocation of the federal people to the imperial people, want to find trouble. Every time Mr. Kay does not have to come out personally, he only needs to make a phone call, and the investigation bureau will solve these things. But this time, the call didn't work. The director of the General Administration of Investigation told Mr. Kaile that it would be best for him to go there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words in the hotel’s door have been thoroughly spread under the propaganda of the people. If you go to Duolin at this time, you may not be able to eat meat. To get rid of the slogan, it is best to solve it yourself. Although there are still three years to leave the next general election, but in the opposite direction, it will become only three years left. Some things can not be seen, it is best not to be in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning about Du Lin, Mr. Kaile and the friend who was chatting sinned and came to deal with the problem here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just got on the bus, just as Mr. Kayle just got out of the car, his driver saw Du Lin at a glance and reminded him. He glanced at the mess in the hotel, and he couldn't see any angry expression on his face. He took the initiative to walk to Doolin's car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
