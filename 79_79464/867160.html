			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hung up the phone. When Merlin told him that someone was going to kill himself, he first had a ridiculousness that couldn’t be said, and then he was dumbfounded. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, the number of big people who want to kill him is not enough, for example, Bowworth, for example, those in the Imperial Bank’s Board of Governors, for example Say that thousands of investors who have suffered losses, when can a small person think about killing themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn’t know the head and tail of the matter, but he believes that this little person’s attitude towards himself and the context before and after the sentence are more like a bragging Or gibberish. Everyone can be forgiven, and Doolin decides to forgive his gibberish, but he will not forgive the guy on the street who is saying the words in an instant. Thought is a terrible thing. From ancient times to now, rulers are watching for changes in their thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like feeling like a stone on the roadside when you leave home every day. Maybe the first day is just passing by, maybe the next day is just passing by, but One day, after a long period of time, this kind of emotion that can be ignored by myself broke out, so when I passed the place next time, I lifted it up and kicked the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like some people laughing and saying that I want to be an emperor. If he always repeats this sentence, maybe one day he will really aim for this goal. And work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the little person may be emotionally fluctuating, he said that he wants to kill himself. Of course he did not put into action, but one day he will Suddenly, it may be a good idea to get rid of Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-micro-duration, this is the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin didn't know what the man called, but Du Lin had his own way to find out, he remembered that Merlin said that he had just left the station, this message It is enough to find this person. He called Mr. Jack a phone call. It didn't take long, about ten minutes, and a call from Nano Lindes was picked up by Doolin. The opposite person did not say his identity. He only told Du Lin that something happened at the time and place he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy brothers killed Abel and his confidants, and now Chester took over Abel service company, Chester had previously with Andy brothers I have seen one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person on the phone hangs up after saying this. Although he didn't say his own guess, Du Lin was able to speculate on something through the other's tone. For example, it is very likely that Chester commissioned Andy. The brothers created this gang vendetta, and the purpose is likely to be the public transport operation rights of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who said the sentence and had the idea, is estimated to be the Andy brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chester Doolin has seen that a smart person will always pay attention to his words and deeds, and in many cases may not be a malicious sentence, it will lead to contradictions and Conflicts broke out, so smart people can manage their own, and the only remaining possibility is the Andy brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo is not in Otis now, which makes Du Lin feel that he or she is still missing one or two people who can stand it. He called Hite up. And he told me: "You take someone to go to Nano Lindes and send the Andy brothers to the road!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite did not ask why, did not ask how to do it , left the office of Doolin directly. Du Lin took a deep breath and spit out, and there were still a lot of troubles that he needed to do. There are already two Big Mac organizations planning to enter Otis, and they are actively contacting Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is called the Yaoxing Empire Commercial Association, which is one of the largest economies in the empire. They control most of the empire’s trade behavior. The empire has replaced the empire as an "official" organization. Many merchants register companies, or other business activities, do not need to go to the Imperial Ministry of Commerce to register, but to the Chamber of Commerce and the club registration. The information registered in these organizations is also recognized and protected by imperial law, showing the horrible status of the Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top level of the empire, that is, Magus and the Cabinet have more than once wanted to take back the power of the Chamber of Commerce, but so far it’s hard to say that it’s hard to make a step. Can't see. According to unofficial statistics, members of the entire Imperial Chamber of Commerce have provided more than 50 million jobs. Once they feel that their power is being stripped, it is very likely that the empire will fall into turmoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These jobs and the imperial citizens who depend on the members of the Chamber of Commerce to eat are their most powerful weapons and are strategic weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strike of the workers’ class is not terrible, and the strike of the mainstream class in society is really terrible, because it takes only a short time to sweep the whole society! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus has been trying to get rid of the power that these people have in their hands, but unfortunately, nothing has been found to be effective and feasible. These businessmen are not politicians, politicians will have some concerns, and businessmen have no concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second Big Mac to enter the city of Otis is the Workers’ Union. The development of Otis in a short period of time is obvious to all, and it has attracted a lot of people. The people looking for work opportunities, so the workers' union also came here. They intend to establish the Otis City Workers' Union with the aim of “assisting” the City Hall to manage workers and protect the legitimate rights and interests of the working class. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers’ unions are never the object of power and the capitalists’ favorite objects. The challenge capitalists and the ruling class seem to have become the reserved programs of the workers’ unions, each time because of various Fair treatment of the court will always attract a lot of people's attention, it seems that people's entertainment focus has been placed on those who challenge authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge of the workers’ union is called Bujo, who is said to be a non-partisan member. He used to be the president of the Workers’ Union Branch in another city. Now Driven by an unknown force, I came to the city of Otis. And there is also a lawyer group, Du Lin always feels that these people came here to do things, they must have any ulterior secrets, otherwise they will not move Bucho. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked someone to understand this guy. This guy’s combat power is very embarrassing. During his tenure as the president of the workers’ club, he has fought in three cities. Completed a hundred and forty rights defense suits, helping more than a thousand workers to get back their belongings, and also let many capitalists and rulers face their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the city still has a lot of infrastructure to be completed, Du Lin licked his temples, it’s a matter of stepping on horses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, without any notice, an unexpected guest visited Doolin, and he was also the 36th of the Chamber of Commerce. One of the members of the parliament is also a Guart - Heidler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler’s appearance is not within Dulin’s expectations. He wants to come here. This guy should still be in the place of Tyne, but he didn’t expect a blink of an eye. But came to the city of Otis. As the mayor of Otis, Du Lin personally received this guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you not think that I will be here?" Heidler looks younger than he was last time, and he can see that he is in a good mood. So his spirit is very good. He laughed and took out the music and sighed on his lips. "In fact, I did not expect that the internal meeting of the General Assembly decided that I would temporarily transfer to the city of Otis for three years."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of 36 members of the Chamber of Commerce. These 36 people form the ruling class of the Chamber of Commerce, but not all things will be decided by these 36 people. Every six years is a rotation, eight members will stay at the headquarters of the Imperial Capital, and another 28 will be assigned to different states to attend the branch. The eight people who stayed behind were responsible for the day-to-day operation and management of the Chamber of Commerce. They were able to decide if they voted for eight people. If something is happening, you need to inform all members of the final vote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last round of Hite, and after three years, he will return to the headquarters of the emperor to stay. The original plan was that he stayed in Cannes in the last three years. Who knows that there will be a notice from there some time ago. He and the members here have changed their position. He is responsible for the affairs here and is stationed. The point is set in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler was reluctant at first, and he felt that someone was fixing himself. Although the situation at Cannes is not very good, it can be won. Every day, every day, or obsessed with gardening flowers and birds, the days are very relaxed and very leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation here is indeed much better than that of Kansas, but there are also many problems to deal with, especially since there are too many smugglers here. Damage to the interests of regular businessmen. Although the General Chamber of Commerce is an "official" organization, they do not have the power to enforce the law. If a resolution is required, the cooperation of the city hall is still needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit embarrassing. You feel that your union’s members are suffering and ask the City Hall to come forward. The City Hall feels that this little thing is not necessary. There are often some situations. Even more, he couldn't understand why he didn't go to the bustling city of Nano Lindes, but let him go to the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows Otis, an empire garbage dump, an ideal grave... until he knows that the mayor of Otis is Doolin, he is conscious Why do you appear here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will always be a need for him to get through the relationship here, and by the way, see if there is anything to be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the city of Otis has been tentatively designated as the "Special Zone" on informal occasions. Since the SAR is sure to have some distinctive places, Instead of getting a person that Du Lin doesn't know, it's better to get a Du Lin's compatriots in the past, maybe it can still be a miraculous effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
