			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier touched his butt when he came down from the car. He suspected that his ass had been split by the bumps. He has never seen a road with such bad road conditions. In addition to successive pits, there are stones of all sizes on the road. The police car may be strong, but the comfort may not be satisfactory enough. Is it necessary for the car to fly so that Delier feels that he is taking a path to hell. When he looked at Prando, Prando just smiled and didn't say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are taking a small path, the path is farther, more bumpy, and more difficult to walk. The purpose of doing this is to make Delier feel uncomfortable. When people feel uncomfortable, the first thing they think of is their own home. Even if they break again, the meaning given by the family is totally different. Comfort, warmth, full of warmth seems to be the definition of people's home. After a rough comparison, Delier may have seen the three unspeakable guys, and immediately thought about leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warden is a fat man like Delier’s imagination, holding a stomach, bald, and the skin on his face is greasy and makes him feel Some disgusting. In particular, the nose hair in the nose of the warden can be clearly seen, and even one of them protrudes out of the nostrils, and his breathing and talking are awkward. Jean Delil had an impulse to build a nose for him with scissors, but he was an elegant person who liked to be clean and arty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warden is a very kind person, very polite to speak, not at all as unreasonable as Prando described before, even in his There is something like coffee in the office. Delier also thought that the warden had only alcoholism in addition to alcoholism, so he had to apologize to the warden - in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiting time was long, and the governor told Prando and Delil that the three prisoners in Cordena had not been escorted. Listening to the vulgar joke between Prando and the warden, Delier feels that he is going crazy, how can these men be so shameless to joke with the organs of the human body? Don't they have a little shame? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Delier endured being too hard to bear, the hour hand of the wall clock pointed to twelve, and finally someone came to report the work, and Cod had his friend Perform the prison procedure. Delier breathed a sigh of relief and he finally fulfilled his "program". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he came, Du Lin told him that no matter who he saw anyone who might be Cod, he was definitely not Cod, because Cod was in his hands and had been intimately in contact with the soil. He had to bite the three people he had seen as being impersonated and to feed the news back to Mrs. Vivian. For this reason, Rennes will pay him a thousand dollars, and promise not to beat him again in the next month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, if he can’t do it, he will lose the benefit of a thousand dollars, and it will also be every weekend in the next month, and Dooling had a friendly and friendly interview. Whether for the benefit of a thousand dollars or for not beating, Delier decided that even if the three people he saw were the three people who robbed him of his money and beat him, he would lie and lie and smack. Not these three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he ignores it. Du Lin’s meaning is to let him tell Mrs. Vivian, that the person he sees is not the one he wants to find. Instead of letting him say it here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw three guys who were difficult to stand up and supported each other, he didn’t feel any excitement, only feeling To the fear, the shudder, the cold from the depths of the soul! At this time, he realized that the characters he influenced about Mrs. Vivian’s words were definitely not just a person from Codor, but also the director of Prando’s regional police station, and even implicated in the code. The prison director. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has to do this, even if he knows what consequences he will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are not the people who robbed me, absolutely not!", Delier said this sentence when the voice is very cold, very "arrogant", like It is an independent flower in the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando and the Warden have been silent for a while. Let them go and see, from the faces of the three guys, they can’t find anything similar to “human”. They can’t even say that they look like humans. How does this sissy distinguish the three? Not the three people he was looking for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer’s eyes flashed a savage light, as an independent king in prison, it can be said that as long as he enters the prison, life does not belong to himself. And belong to him. If you want to kill Delier, he doesn't even have to say it. As long as he shows his eyes, the following people will let a prisoner break free of control because of the "mistakes" in his work, hold Delier, and finally he can't satisfy himself. The choice to be decided after the proposed request "deaths with the hostages." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
