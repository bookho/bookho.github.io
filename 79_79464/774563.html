			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?", the old Fowlers who got up from the ground didn't yell, he sorted out his clothes and wiped them off. The blood beneath the nose, holding his chin in front of the man, mocked the man with a condescending arrogant tone. "My son killed your daughter, I killed your wife, and now you want to do it." What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Kill me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze in his eyes is like him Like countless times to treat the poor, Old Forrest believes that this man does not dare to hurt him, because he is a rich man, a rich man, has a great reputation and a high status in Irian, he has a very broad personal relationship, No one can hurt him and his family does not pay the price. And he thinks that this man in front of him will not hurt him, and will not kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you still have a son who told me that it was a very cute little boy..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Forrest’s words were not finished, the man put his scissors into his mouth and forced his tongue to cut from the middle. Old Fleiss screamed in pain, his hands continually rubbing the blood out of his mouth, and did not realize that when he did those things, after saying those words, he and the man did not turn back. He was so frightened that he wanted to escape. He did not think that this group of madmen actually dared to hurt him and even killed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a rich man, a celebrity in society, many people want to see his face live, even the City Hall sometimes needs to ask him for governance. Views. Until this moment, he suddenly found that he was not as strong as he had imagined, and he did not lose confidence in life as he did two days ago. He did not want to die. He still had a lot of things that he did not enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No descendants to inherit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a good time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever knows if the child is born, and there seems to be more advanced medical technology on the federal side, maybe there is a turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really didn’t want to die, so his first thought was to rush out, but all Buddhas took him back and his heart was at that moment. Fall into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling did not allow Old Forrest to see the sun the next day. In a very fashionable way, he knew too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with a pair of scissors bent over to him was a slap in the face, the stabbing old Fuller’s hands were bloody, and his arms were many more than an inch. Yu Chang’s mouth. His body trembled and held his hands that had been pierced many times, his body continually squirming backwards, and he only wanted to be farther away from the man. The man looked at the old Folly, who was constantly screaming on the ground, wiped the sweat from his head. He lost the scissors and picked up the stick that had his wife's life. He slowly walked back, standing in front of the old Fowlers, shaking his arms and pleading, lifting his stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beng’s muffled sound, the wooden stick in the man’s hand was almost shaken. The old Fowlers' body was fierce and stretched, and it trembled fiercely, and no more shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is constantly waving the sticks, lifting them up again and again, and falling again, from the initial tremors of percussion to the last licking of garlic The man, the man who repeated the action like a machine, lost his mind for a moment. He lost his stick and stood there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fuller is dead, his head is smashed into a mud, and the butler has been squatting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted, no matter who he was, after he died, everything he was proud of during his lifetime would become worthless. He took out a pistol and placed it in the man's hand. "If the flame of hatred in your heart has not been extinguished, there is still outside, in the next room, in the yard, you can find many people."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If everything you take can be satisfied with this life, then we will leave now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The choice is in you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not worry about any changes in your life tomorrow morning, you just need to live well and look at you The children grow up, this is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rest of the things I will help you settle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked down at the pistol in his hand, and his heart was in an infinite struggle. Just before Du Lin appeared, he thought that if he had the opportunity to leave here alive, he would kill all the people here. But the moment he killed Old Fuller, the anger that suffocated him was gone. Now he is very upset, because he just killed a local celebrity, he does not know what his future days will be, what the children will be, everything is uncertain, do not know, lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin seemed to understand his heart at the moment, went forward and hugged him, patted his back. "Everything is gone, go back to take a bath, sleep well, don't forget sadness, don't forget Hate, then live bravely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man still took the pistol from his hand without any blocking, he looked up Looking at Du Lin, "Can I still?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled with a relaxed face, "Why not?", he patted the man's shoulder. "Go, go home, give it to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They watched the man leave the villa and moved slowly towards the fifth zone. It’s like a walking dead, not much angry. In just a few days, this family has undergone tremendous changes. Whose fault is this? He didn't know, but it wasn't him who was wrong. Perhaps this world is like this. There are always people who can trample on the law for some reason. There is a price for doing anything. Maybe the price will not come today, but one day it will come back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sighed, maybe this is the best ending, he hopes that the man can put down hatred... well, stand up and talk without backache . He smiled self-deprecatingly, turned his hand and raised his hand to trigger the trigger on the head of the butler. "It should work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day The sun rises slowly from the sea level as in countless years. The first golden sunlight penetrates the statue of the dawn boulevard in the park, and the whole city falls from carnival to silence. There are still traces left on the road after last night's carnival. The cleaners on the beach have begun to clean up the sand, and the whole city has fallen into such a strange contradiction. Some people rest because they are happy, and some people are happy because of work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., your coffee!", the waiter placed the coffee and burritos on the table, owed a few steps back and left. He squinted back to the store and squatted on the counter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sip of the coffee, the coffee cup was just put down, and the newsboy came here on time as usual every morning, putting the latest newspapers On the table of Dooling. The newsboy took off his hat and watched Du Lin put a piece of money in his cap. His face showed the same color as before. "If you have nothing else to do, I will send it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand, and the newsboy clasped his hat tightly on his head and rushed to the intersection to start the work that he had to do every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the first page of the newspaper, the front page headline is the Ilyan Food Festival, and the first food festival will be held in the Irian area next month. In the picture, Alexander is as eye-catching as his stomach, and this guy has spent a lot of time to promote this. Of course, he also brought Duolin a profit of 50,000 yuan. After turning over the first page and turning a few more pages, Du Lin found what he wanted to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a news related to Dooling. A company listed on Xie Lisi Street was purchased by a local company. The reporter believes that this is in the Irian area. In addition to tourism and entertainment, I also think about a temptation to develop finance. The whole article actually talks about how the special geographical environment and financial environment of the Irian area is suitable for the development of financial business. It has never been mentioned in the first place after mentioning this acquisition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter, what Du Lin needs is this information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This company was acquired by Doolin, with the aim of listing on the backdoor, which is related to his next plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed the newspaper, ate a few burritos, and Du Lin dropped five dollars and left with a newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is as calm and serene as before, no one knows what happened last night, no one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just when she returned home that Freina was ready to go out. She saw Du Lin hesitated after she came back and walked back to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to talk to you a bit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked a little strange This woman, he went to the partial hall, and when Freena came in, she closed the door. "Say, what is the money that is not enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Freena shook her head. "There is still a lot of money. Actually... Du Lin, I don't know what to say. I am worried recently because I don't know if there is a market for what we have shot. If it is ruined." If you lose a lot of money! I am a little uneasy, but I can't talk to the crew, I have tried to save money, but I still worry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She is under a lot of pressure and can't show it. She feels that she may be depressed if she doesn't say it again. 500,000, this is a money she can't afford for a lifetime! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
