			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey doesn’t know that not everyone’s mouth in this world can be as strict as he imagined. He just took two pistols from here, not In half an hour, there was a message about Mickey in the underground world of the Fifth District - he had to do something big! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This information is sold at a three-level demolition house. The "information splitter" who bought this information wholesaled the news at a price of twenty dollars. More than 20 intelligence dealers of the size of Irian, and then the information was sold in the intelligence organization at the price of five dollars. Everyone in the link earned money. As for the guy who was sold, he was not happy. Not within the scope of their consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On just over an hour, some of the rich have come and go with bodyguards. They don’t know what the guy who suddenly bought two guns wants to do. But maximizing your own safety is one of the most important things for every rich man. Therefore, the addition of bodyguards and the replacement of bulletproof vehicles have become a thing that the rich are doing today. For those who actively provide information to them, they do not care about the money in their pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complete intelligence chain, from the birth of intelligence to sales, every link is as mechanically sophisticated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the guy sold Mickey, it may be that he thinks that Mickey, who wants to do big things, can’t live for a few days, instead of waiting for him to die. Value garbage, it is better to make as much money as possible from him when he is worth more money, nothing more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey still doesn’t know that he has become a target for some people. When he is holding two pistols in his pocket, he feels that there is an unspeakable power in his own hands. The body constantly breeds and expands. In the past, when he was walking on the road, he was able to make less troubles and try to make trouble. He was now brave and brave, and when the guys who were engaged in illegal transactions in the streets and lanes looked at him, he dared to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is really good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the pistol in his pocket, and then gathered the companions to do the big things and discussed the next plan. Originally his plan was based on him and the gray dog. After all, the guy was also mixed with gangs. He is still selling anesthetics, and his courage is relatively large. He is said to have been rushing with others. Such people have a wealth of experience, can avoid him making mistakes on some strain problems, but the plan is always a plan, and can never keep up with changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the gray dog?", a provincial sage named Finney raised his hand and said hello to everyone. This guy was jailed for five times for robbery and theft. Fortunately, the place where he committed crimes is the fifth and fourth districts. If he commits crimes in the first district, he has not come out yet. Irian's judiciary is called by many people as "a law with class discrimination." If criminals with criminal cases commit crimes in the first district and are caught, they may face imprisonment for up to 20 years. But if it is caught in other areas, it may come out in three or five months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also why people like to travel to Irian, just like the city’s publicity, forever stable, without having to consider any security issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey looked sullen, sucking a cigarette and sullenly slamming the cigarette on the floor. "Don't mention, the guy was detained." After he finished watching Finney ask: "Finney, have you used a pistol?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finney snorted and nodded, "Of course I used to fire a few shots when I was fighting with another community. You mean..." His eyes suddenly widened and pointed at his nose. "You won't want me and you." Go in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the greyhound is not here, only you are the oldest, and you have used a gun. You don't follow me, can I be alone? "Going?", said that he went to Finney and glared at his shoulder, whispered: "The thing became the two dogs after the gray dog, at least a few hundred thousand. If you don't do it, I believe other People will do it too, don't say that I don't care for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finney didn't even think about it, for a hundred and hundreds of thousands of Insurance is necessary, the next Mickey began distribution of work in small groups. Considering that there are probably a few people who can enter the manor, there are a lot of details they need to consider. This discussion is a whole day and a set of plans is also in place. Including how to get out after successful kidnapping, how to leave without abduction, have made a very detailed plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Mickey also told everyone not to disclose this matter like anyone else, and wait for the police to pursue after the success of the matter and then consider whether it is to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he also asked everyone to try to launch the provincial people they know, and strive to make the momentum a lot, so that they can enter the manor as a representative. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Mickey doesn’t know that people who have a little energy in the whole city already know that he has to do something big, only he doesn’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days passed by, and Du Lin was making final preparations for the evening charity party. He stood in front of the mirror and arranged his neckline. I looked at the mirror and looked at it from two angles. I didn't find any missing places to transfer my sight from the mirror to Dove's body. In the evening, he was going to attend a charity party. The cardinal of the church personally went to Irian. In addition to raising funds for the church, he also contacted the local rich and politicians. This time it was a relatively rigorous party, so there weren't too many accessories on the clothes, and everything seemed so solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devo changed a relatively conservative black evening gown, without any accessories, very simple and beautiful. The church may have certain bans on certain things to some extent, but this natural thing can not be prevented even by God, let alone the cardinal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his arm, and Dove was a little nervous and took Du Lin’s arm and followed his footsteps to leave the cloakroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening's banquet is definitely a very special banquet for Dove, she is very nervous, because she and her family are all believers. It is said that Dove is not a pure blood Guar, her father is Og Ding, the mother is a Guar, it is a mixed-race. Her father and her brother included himself as a believer in God. The biggest priest he usually saw was probably the priest in the cathedral of Irian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never thought that she would see a big man like a cardinal one day, but it was second only to the pope, the closest person to God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about seeing the cardinal himself, she is both excited and nervous. It’s hard to describe her kind of uneasiness and a little restlessness. Emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, do you say that the Cardinal Church is talking to me?", the girl’s face is red. "I mean we can get close Are you in contact with the cardinal? I want to talk to him a few words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pulled the door and smiled and nodded. "Of course no problem, Mad Stella Irian wants to harvest a piece of wool from the hands of the people. If he has enough money, he will even come and kiss your forehead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;I heard that Du Lin said that Dove was a little unhappy. She is a devout believer. How can she say that the cardinal is so popular? And should not directly call the name of the cardinal adult. She can understand where Du Lin's attitude comes from, but understanding does not mean acceptance. Duff, who closed his mouth, got into the car and Du Lin then closed the door. As for Dove's thoughts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t care, that’s not who he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car was about to leave the manor when it stopped at the gate. The Buddha who leaned on the wall of the courtyard walked toward the car. He bent and knocked. After knocking on the window, the window slowly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at him and corrected his sight. He moved his bow tie a little and said in a very light voice: "You can send them away." After saying this, he shook the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that because of the visit of the cardinal, the first district is more lively than any other time, and there is no time for the evening carnival. There have been many rave parties. The hordes of women wore simple clothes and jogged on the stalls, or played some games. The entire beach is like a heaven in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car was parked outside the hotel's door, and the second time the red carpet of Dove was a lot more natural, she also learned to those The reporters who played with the camera and magnesium powder waved their hands. After signing his name on the check-in book, Du Lin took Dove into the last banquet hall. There was a cold meal before the charity party, which was an early hot spot, and many people might need to communicate with Cardinal Madsted, so there was such a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just came in. Scott found him and pulled him to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you forgetting about that thing, or didn't you mind?" Scott looked a little awkward. Before he came, the mayor told him that he must ask clearly. If Doolin doesn't do it, the City Hall will act decisively early in the morning, and Du Lin will inevitably have to compromise a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin asked with a curious look at the wine glass: "What is your story?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
