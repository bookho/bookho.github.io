			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald, who hangs up, immediately walks behind Polly and is just about to remind him of a problem. When the two have not had time to communicate, a reporter station It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Polly, Mayor Donald, for the former Otis City Mayor Dooling in the emperor to prosecute two conspirators to assassinate and to seize his power, What do the two think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter’s speech made the entire press conference room silent, all the shackles fell into silence at this moment, even those The reporter who took the photo forgot to take a photo, instead of standing there looking at the reporter stupidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald’s face is ugly, and Polly’s face is not good. It should have been a day full of excitement and joy. I didn’t expect it because of one’s speech. The trend of the whole thing has gone to an abyss. There is no doubt that this reporter must have been invited by Du Lin, and at least has a certain relationship with Du Lin. His words finally played an amazing role in half a minute, and the reporters whose thoughts were paused stood up in excitement and raised their own questions loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is so hot that Du Lin actually broke the face with the two men and brought things to court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, those photos and reports that tend to be Doolin’s position have brought haze to the city of Otis, but many people who have a certain understanding of politics. I understand that this incident can only cause confusion and will not cause too much ruling influence on Donald. Because the top empire, the Imperial Cabinet and the ruling party, did not send an internal investigation team to investigate Donald. In other words, the empire’s top executives may think that this is ordinary dirty water. Without exact evidence, they will not launch the investigation procedure without authorization. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only during this time, the parade in Otis was Donald’s brains, and the appearance of the hymn consortium saved him who almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is unexpected is that Du Lin actually brought the Donald and Cape family to court at this time, and the nature instantly became different. Lin must have the key evidence, otherwise he could not bring this to court. Once he can't get substantial evidence to accuse Donald of collaborating with the Cape family to murder him to gain the actual power of the city of Otis, then Doolin will be defeated, and Donald's siege will be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is far more popular than the second phase of the development of the city of Otis, and even more popular than the general election - anyway, everyone knows what is going on in the election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Polly, how do you view the allegations made by the former mayor, Mr. Doolin, about you and the current mayor, do you think the allegations of the former mayor, Mr. Doolin? Can you set up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mayor of Donald, I heard that there has been a gap between you and Doolin. Mr. Doolin did not give you any Power, so do you hate to decide to retaliate against him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May Donald, can you talk about the difference between you and the killer and Mr. Soro? "Is the relationship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Polly, was the last photo of Mr. Doolin directly related to your premeditated assassination? Can it be direct? Evidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reporter screamed with a tape recorder At the signing table, Polly's face was immediately reincarnation and went outside, and Donald followed. The bodyguards from the Cape family and the police at the Otis City Police Department blocked these crazy journalists, but they could not stop the headlines of the entire empire tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big news has touched many people’s hearts. These reporters have already made up more than a dozen press releases in their minds to discuss this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, what happened to the mad dog? It’s my uncle who offended him. He also avenged, why should you bite us?" Polly whispered as he walked, and Soro’s disappearance was no longer news in the family. There was no news for more than two months. I couldn’t see anyone dead or dead. Many family members had already guessed that Soro had something wrong. There is no other controllable object other than Du Lin who has the potential to become a murderer and Sorrow has a life and death relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Old Cape did not find Du Lin’s revenge, but instead focused on continuing to develop the family business. At present, it is the most crucial moment for the Cape family. If they can win the import and export SAR, they will thaw a lot of money in their hands, and the strength of the family will increase significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is there, as long as he does not leave the empire a day, want to find him trouble anytime, anywhere. But the opportunity won't always be there, so taking the opportunity is the most important thing compared to revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Polly and his cousins ​​have received a request from the old Cape, no matter who succeeded in becoming the next owner of the family, the first thing is to let Du Lin, who has made the family shame, disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poly felt that he was not looking for Du Lin. It was a special gift to him. Why did this mad dog actually take the initiative to bite? Once the investment in Otis City has a huge problem, it is very likely that he will be defeated in the final of the final home battle, completely missing the home of the throne. This is the most unbearable thing for him, which is more important than the need to kill him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Donald, who was silent and bowed his head, was stunned by Polly’s whisper, if he had not heard anything wrong, just now Polly said that "revenge". He actually knows about the inside story of Du Lin's assassination. He knows that it is made by Soro's grandson, but it is absolutely inspired by Soro. The rules and regulations of the big family are very strict, and any violation of the duty will be severely punished. To say that the assassin did not get Solo's nod, anyone who has a noble background will not believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what Polly said about revenge... Does it mean that Soro is finished? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought of this possibility Donald was chilly, this time he realized that he had provoked a confusing thing, even the heirs of the big aristocracy dare kill? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was because he knew the news, he realized that he dared to "challengate" the foundation of the Doolin rule from where he came from - he believed that Du Lin A compromise to the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cape family sent a killer to assassinate him. He also knew who the other was, but after Magus made the middleman to resolve the matter, he ate it. The loss of Du Lin is no longer noisy. This makes Donald have a disdain for Doolin in the subconscious. He is actually like everyone else. He is as powerless as the person who is stronger than himself and the majority. He can only accept the grievances and compromise the matter. It is precisely because this "common sense" has unwittingly implanted Donald's subconscious mind, so he made a slight adjustment to Doolin's law after he took the post and thought it was a reasonable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now it seems that things are not exactly what he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a grievance and a temporary compromise was not Doolin, but the Cape family, they died, a heir did not say anything, did not find Du Lin, this shows The real winner of the event is Du Lin! He is simply a madman, no, it is a mad dog, actually really killed Soro! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the thought of the cold sweat behind Donald, it made him feel uncomfortable, and at the same time, his feelings seemed to become sensitive, as if there were people around him who were watching secretly, watching their heads and necks. The heart...etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, he followed Polly to the mayor’s office, and Polly sat directly in the position where the mayor could sit, screaming When I got to the table, I stood up and picked up the phone, dialed a number, and then stared at Donald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald’s brain was blank, but his gaze naturally greeted Polly’s gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the two were an angry anger, and they were all empty. After watching for a while, Polley raised the earpiece in his hand. "I can't see me." Are you on the phone? Go out!" He pointed his finger at the door, and Donald walked out and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound of closing the door awakened him from his thoughts, he subconsciously looked back at the door of the office, belonging to the door of his office. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that he has been driven out, a shame is rising, and a younger younger than him has let him get out of his office. Although Polly did not use the word "roll", but his tone, his demeanor, his actions, none of them did not Donald as a subordinate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is normal. For these big aristocrats in the north, there is not much difference between Donald’s little aristocrats and the inferior, and Donald’s Trusted the Cape family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangard, who had regained his gaze, walked to the window and looked at the ongoing parade in the square. For the first time, there was a fog in his heart that he could not see. The clear future is getting stricter from him, and the thick fog masks the way forward. He is now particularly confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only hope that the Cape family can stand it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin accused Donald of collaborating with the Cape family to assassinate him. The news was immediately spread throughout the empire, and the emperor, next to Otis, also began. Spread this message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus had just entered the cabinet. After receiving a call, he asked the secretary to invite the team leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
