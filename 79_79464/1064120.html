			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a good-tempered man, at least with people he is familiar with, including Mr. Kesma and Mrs. Mason, Mason and Merlin Brother, and his sister and brothers and sisters. He was the most honest one in Ziwei Town, and he was not very courageous. Everyone said that Du Lin was a good boy and he must be a good husband and a good husband in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes Doolin’s temper is not so good, people living in this world can’t be everything, it’s inevitable that it’s because of some inner or outer The reason for being angry is that he is obviously angry now. He slowly turned and looked at the young man who came over. Du Lin stopped his eyes when he was just preparing to do something. Some things he could do by someone else's hand, but some things must be done by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, keep talking!", Du Lin took out a cigarette and he took a sip and gently spit towards the younger brother. Go, eyes filled with contempt that can't be said. He leaned his head slightly, looked at the sturdy young man with his chin, and his eyebrows made the young people very disgusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The deaf person will only be with the deaf!", the young man continued to say as Dulin wished, and the things in the school made the young The college student has become extremely violent, he managed to talk about a girlfriend, and finally because of the rumors that their relationship broke down. No one wants his boyfriend to have a female-like sister, which will only lower his lower limit. In addition to the unsuccessful academics and various reasons, he eventually pushed all the questions to Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a sister like Alisa, if it’s not Alisa who always makes things that are irritating and shameful, he’s at school. Will not be laughed at, be rejected, be ridiculed. His college career should be more interesting, he will not be the laughing stock of his friends, and his girlfriend will not leave him. It’s all the fault of this monk, it’s the fault of these two monks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the front of Doolin, facing Du Lin, with a fierce gaze in his eyes, raised his finger and said to Du Lin, "From my home." Get out...", then he reached out and grabbed Du Lin’s cigarette on his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain is still thinking about why Du Lin will suddenly visit, and when he was alarmed by his son’s roar, he only shouted his son’s name. Even the block is too late. His wife was a happy face, and I very much hope that the guy named Du Lin can be unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all happened too fast, too fast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bain and his wife are not responding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin faced the hand that was caught in front of his face and leaned back slightly to hide at the same time, while holding back the table and only half of it The bottle of red wine did not hesitate to smash toward the stupid head. In less than a second, the glass bottle shattered, the red wine splashed everywhere, and the younger brother leaned back with his head. The blood flowed down his forehead, mixed with the red wine, and there was a trace of bright red in the dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stopped in front of Alisa, he didn’t want the splash of red wine and glass shards to hurt his little angel, at this time he reached out and grabbed I grabbed the wrist of the younger brother and forced myself to face it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger brother’s body lost his weight. When he stepped forward, Du Lin grabbed his wrist and pressed his right hand on the table, his right hand. There was only a bottleneck in the red wine bottle and a small circle of broken glass. His palms were slightly loose, and the bottlenecks like the daggers were turned upside down. Once again, they rushed toward the younger brother's back, and the screams of screams rang through the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One foot took the younger brother to the side, Du Lin patted the clothes, smacked with smoke and smiled sideways and looked back at Alisa, "My collar Are you confused?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa didn’t understand why she actually wanted to laugh at this time. Her mother told her that her brother was at home. hope. At that time, Mr. Bain’s work was not good, and the income was not a lot. What is delicious, the fun things must first meet the needs of the younger brother. Many times she sat at the table watching her brother eat the delicious food, but she could only eat scraps and hard meal bags. She even wondered if she was coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This life has been fully integrated into her life, the obvious differential treatment has made her numb, and even began to accept and recognize, perhaps this is her own destiny . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, she looks at her own for more than 20 years, and the younger brother fell to the ground, and was pricked in the drunken wine and blood. When the palm of her hand burst into tears, she actually felt a hint of inexplicable happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded slightly, took a hand and tidyed Dulin's messy collar, and patted it, and Du Lin returned with a gentle smile. It was like... In that damn winter, in Irian, when she sat in Doolin and asked him about his smile, the sun shone on his face, making him look so dazzling, Even the heart has become warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn, nowhere to put a bright smile! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Bain, who has been fascinated, rushed to Doolin, but was inserted between her and Du Lin. , blocked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin turned back and glanced at Mrs. Bain, wraps her wrapper, smiles and walks to the younger brother, lifts her foot and steps on it. On the face of my younger brother, I ran hard. "What happened? Ladies? Anything you want to say?", the younger brother who felt that his head was going to blow up, shouted more vigorously, but soon looked down on Doolin. Closed in the eyes filled with indifference to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Bain calmed down unexpectedly, her chest violently undulating, her eyes shifted from Doolin to Alisa, taking a deep breath. I kept my reason and said in a trembling voice, "Alisa, let your friend let go of your brother... please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain, who also reacted, chose silence. He suddenly felt very sad, not because his son was hurt by all the former, nor that Du Lin was teaching him in his home. His son, but he realized that this home seems to have been scattered at this moment. There is no doubt that Alisa will definitely leave here, leave forever, will not come back, there will be one person forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him feel sad is that he can’t do anything. He can’t stop everything that happens. Why, why is it not strong enough when facing family members, not strong enough to face the eccentric wife of the city, not strong enough to face hostility or even hate your sister's children, and not strong enough to face some weak ones? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed, did not care about the things between his wife and Du Lin, Dudu, and did not care about the screams that dare not speak. The son, but calmly came to Alisa. At this moment, he saw from the face of Alisa that he had never seen him in his life, full of sunshine, and a smile from the heart. He had such a moment of disappointment, this smile is the biggest irony and ridicule in his life for him at this moment. He slowly lowered his head and forced himself to cheer up and look at his daughter. "Are you sure to leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa nodded. She glanced at the younger brother on the ground and glanced at the man who once thought he was crazy. He nodded hard and grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain’s expression was very complicated. His lips moved and he said after a moment, “Wait to eat this last meal and then go... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you crazy? What are you talking to that monk, have you not seen your son dying?", Mrs. Bain sharp The screams pierced the tranquility of the community. She wanted to beat the Buddha like a madman. They all looked back, and Du Lin nodded, followed by the Buddha’s arm, and Mrs. Bain’s scream. The sound came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She touched her cheek, her fingers were stained with a trace of blood, and her cheeks began to feel a little pain. A trace of fear began to spread in her heart, these people are crazy, they actually dare to start, she turned and ran outside the door, took the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin kicked a kick in the waist and abdomen of the younger brother at this time, and the younger brother who was kicking snorted and curled up on the ground. Trembling. He crouched down to look at the painful younger brother and patted his cheek. "Learn how to be a man?" The younger brother was full of humiliation and nodded, not looking at Doolin's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and stood up, shaking his sword and walking, and went to Alisa’s side, looking at Mr. Bain, “I think we It is better to leave first. Please rest assured that I will properly settle Alisa and will not let her suffer any grievances. There is another thing that the child has found."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin still had a bit of a sham when he said this sentence. After all, this thing was done by Mr. Zema, and he also knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa’s original smile suddenly solidified, and she grabbed a blue vein on the back of Du Lin’s arm. “Really...found "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me, I want Go see my child and take me away..." Alisa didn't even want to pack up and walked outside the door, and Du Lin could only drag on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he did not forget that Mr. Bain’s guarantee would definitely take care of Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
