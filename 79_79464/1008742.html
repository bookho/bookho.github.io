			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any other way? You know that we have been working together for so many years, do you want to see me and the Kadima party because of our philosophy? Disagreement and break into the abyss?", the doorman is still doing the last save, he is not willing to turn everything into this way, "We both step back, three years, three years later, if I can't do what I said If you can't bring some changes to the west, I will take the initiative to resign."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirteen years and nine months, twenty-two days ago, you were also So sure to assure everyone that we will succeed and turn this world into our ideals. But you have failed, the Mennon, you have left more than 7,000 brave warriors with people running, I left the battlefield shamefully, and now I think I should die there. So don't deceive me with rhetoric, I won't believe you anymore"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Thirteen years ago, the doorman brought a group of young people with ideal blood and blood in the west After an armed change, they succeeded in laying down seven cities in three days, and then the doormen demanded to concentrate on the active forces to attack the Imperial Army stationed in the Western Army Base, and vowed to ensure that the other party may not know they already Left the city to go to their nest. As long as he can lay down the army base, the Mennon dare to say that he can definitely sit firmly in the west, and that countless weapons and resources are sufficient to support them in the West and create a confrontation with the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal is very full, the doorman has found countless reasons to support his argument, plus the sudden attack of the armed uprising won seven cities , brought a high personal prestige to the doorman. Under the arbitrariness, he decided the next step of the war, and finally left more than 7,000 brave soldiers in the Gobi Desert outside the Imperial Army base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the idea of ​​the Mennon was that the seven western cities were lost. The Imperial Army Base in the west will send several troops to seven places to suppress the armed uprising. This is also the Army. When the base is the most empty. They must not think that the insurgents would actually give up the city and concentrate their superior strength to make a time difference. As long as the Army base can be laid down, all the plans of the Mennon can basically be said to be stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what really didn’t come to mind was the Mennon. They never thought that the Western Army of the Empire did not immediately dispatch the news immediately. They stopped to take the West. What happened was conveyed to the Emperor by telegraph. The news of the Imperial Capital has not yet been returned. This group of people who were later called the "red tide" took the initiative to concentrate outside the base. It seems that they are coming to battle with the Imperial Army. Then an unfair war broke out. With the help of a large amount of military equipment, the Imperial Army easily defeated the main force of the red tide and let another group disappear into the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门 门;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, the anxiety on the face of Mennon was gradually replaced by a hazy expression. He sat alone in the office for a long time, and then recruited a real confidant, a previously inconspicuous guy. "There is no possibility between Shapk and us. I will give you two tasks now." The people standing in the office did not say a word, listening quietly to the instructions of the Mennon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person belongs to the Kadima Party’s internal guard and only obeys the orders of the party leaders. The doormen ask them to first grab all the Shapk’s family members, but they cannot Die them. Then let them force Shapk to admit that he bought the gunman and attacked the doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the western region has become a porridge, and the doormen are not afraid of this ghost place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arranged these things and waited until the evening to get off work, wearing a bullet-proof vest to leave the City Hall building. When he stepped on the last step of the ladder, suddenly a gunman ran out in the night, facing the doorman was a "small shot." The gunshots alarmed the guards of the Mennon. They had done their duty to protect the doormen behind themselves, but they still couldn’t stop the bullets from penetrating the shoulders and thighs of the doorman. He fell into a pool of blood like Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that he played a self-directed play during the assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall then sounded the city alarm, the entire city entered a state of control, and the reasons were announced - someone bought a gunman to assassinate the mayor of Mennon, the door The farmer's mayor has been taken to the hospital for rescue. In this assassination case, the mayor of Mennon was seriously injured and the situation is unknown. His guards died three times, and two others were injured, one of whom was seriously injured. The assassin who assassinated the doorman was killed on the spot, but did not leave any useful clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole west has become more chaotic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No politician who can scream his voice on the political stage is so easily overturned, when the doorman discovers that "the assassination" is eluting When he is suspected of the best way, he is considering how to use this means to find the right opportunity to pick himself up. There is no doubt that Shapke will be a scapegoat. As long as he admits that he has bought a murderous assassin, the momentum created by Shapke will be wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will not trust Shapuke’s embarrassing people who can go to their friends. They will look at the image of the tenant in the face of the three-guarantee policy. In addition, the Mennon people paid the compensation for the victims of the mine disaster, and paid an additional compensation for the families of the mine victims who were injured in the attack. They have already recovered their image. People are so complicated that when they do not fulfill their wishes, they will apply all the worst conditions to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the wishes are fulfilled, these people will begin to explain to each other in a satisfactory state. After all, this is a huge sum of more than 2.5 million. The Mayor of Mennon always needs a period of time to raise funds and investigate the truth of the mine disaster. Hey, he didn't pay the bill, he paid the money he should pay, which is the best proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turmoil in the west has produced a series of effects, and many people have chosen to leave the West temporarily. The miners who often appear in various prosperous cities are also shrinking themselves. The mining area is no longer free to come out. Up to now, five members of the Western Mining Association have been assassinated on the street, including two executive members and three mine owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabinet was also particularly angered by the turmoil in the west. On the second day of the assassination of the Mennon, the Western Military Region announced that all cities had entered military control, and a large number of soldiers were driving. Armored vehicles appeared on the streets, investigating and even arresting all past personnel they thought were suspicious. The Western Military Region has also officially announced to the outside world that there are a number of extremely vicious terrorists hiding in the west. It is hoped that all tourists who plan to travel to the west temporarily stop their plans and the armed terrorist organization claiming to be the "Freedom Front". It was wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a suffocating atmosphere, Doolin woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel?", Apple is in the hands of the Buddha, just like in the hands of the magician, the thin skin quickly disappears, he cuts it At the moment when the apple was placed on the plate, the apple suddenly split from the middle and became eight. "The doctor said that you are lucky, but you may have to change a hairstyle later."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bullet was almost shot from the top of his ear against Doolin’s scalp. Although the bullet did not hit Du Lin’s head, he left a piece above his left ear. scar. The injury is not very heavy. The doctor said that he will not leave any scars after healed, but one thing may be slightly regrettable. That is, the trace will always exist, the hair follicles on the skin will be destroyed, and it will be difficult to grow in the future. Hair out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
