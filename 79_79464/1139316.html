			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little stories about Doolin’s blushing heartbeat quickly became the subject of people’s chat after dinner, and the discussion about Doolin became hot again. This also makes people discover this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time, when Duin’s public opinion is about to subside, this person will firmly occupy the forefront of the topic list, and his body seems to have Content that can never be said, waiting for people to dig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s good or bad, in short, it always makes him appear in the most eye-catching place in the newspaper, the top page, and then let people know him. Learn more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These various stories interspersed with some negative content did not seriously damage the image of Doolin, of course not so glamorous is definitely But people don't hate him because of this. Instead, they feel that this is a living person, a person who lives around us and is within reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Du Lin made his image too perfect, he had almost no bad habits, and spent seven years completing the famous entrepreneur from the farmer to the empire. And the transformation of star politicians, every step is stepping on the most accurate node of the times, he never makes mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such people should appear in the story, in the opera, but should not appear in real life, people’s longing for Doolin in a short time and After the craze of worship has retreated, I will feel that I am being fooled. How can there be a perfect person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Du Lin’s perfect golden body has been broken, but it’s also a bit more human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially after he and a little king, the love affair was almost passed down, even in the process of people’s continuous sharing and discussion, it evolved more More versions. In these versions, not only the queen fell in love, but even the princess of the princess was "fatal of Dukou." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This favorite story promotes a great advancement in Doolin’s popularity, at 9:30 on Saturday night, this very golden moment, Doolin Together with the two imperial female stars, they appeared in the current hottest "Heise everyone said" to block the gold show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is very hot. It is not a program that is biased towards politics or a program in a certain field. What is hot in public opinion today, what does this program do? Seize the market and attract a lot of viewers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 37-year-old Heather wore very casual clothes. At the moment of appearance, a large number of audiences began to applaud. She nodded slightly to the camera. After greeting everyone good night, sitting on the host's sofa, facing the camera, she raised a very interesting question, "Who can tell me, what are people talking about now?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the opening remark of the show, which is said to have been registered as a trademark by Nasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the hidden people in the audience began to drive everyone's rhythm and shouted the word Doolin. It may not be neat at first, there are other things, but soon people's voices have become neat, leaving only the name Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather's mouth is a hook, "Yes, Du Lin, then please let us lead today, Mr. Doolin, Ms. Freina, and Kinsale Ms.!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the applause and screams of the people, the two ladies took Du Lin’s arm out of the background. Compared to other politicians who are wary of entertainment, Du Lin seems to like to participate in entertainment, which is why he is called "star politician". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star, not his performance on the political stage, of course, he also performed very well, which means that he has a "star" Characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy to create topics that attract people’s attention, will it appear in the newspapers and trigger some people’s arguments, he is a combination of stars and politicians, too People who like people, especially recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three just sat down, the butt was not hot, and Heather asked a very special question as soon as he spoke. "You and the queen and the princess have No...", she made a bit awkward and a bit sloppy gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled at the camera and shrugged. "The more formal statement is that I refused to answer this question...", and there was a lot of buzzing on the scene. Du Lin smiled carelessly. Then I pressed these buzz with my own voice, "But from my personal point of view, it is a journey worth remembering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘘声还Not completely finished, the scene whistled again, even the audience sitting in front of the TV could not help but whistle, Du Lin is too bold to step on the horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know the heroine in his concealed story, but the queen and princess of a country, even if it is only a small country, their diplomatic status is also Very high, but Du Lin actually admitted, really a damn good luck bastard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of so many versions of the exotic queen and the princess, you can’t wait to replace it. It’s said that the latest version of Du Lin has It’s really embarrassing to unlock the achievements of the Happy Family Barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Jinsel, sitting next to Du Lin, suddenly inserted a sentence, "You never told me that we might have a royal family." The scorpion of bloodlines!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the sneer of the crowd, Du Lin screamed helplessly. "This may be a good thing, you say it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather smiled and introduced Jinsel to everyone. "Everyone knows that Ms. Kinsale is firmly on the big screen of these two years. Occupying a dominant position, she is represented in most of the big-production movies. Of course, in the recent rumors about Mr. Doolin, Ms. Kinsale is also one of the protagonists."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, you may not know, Ms. Kinsale is not Doolin's..." Heather said that he generally did not continue to talk about it. On the one hand, these contents are not convenient. Said export, and secondly, it gave everyone a reaction time. After three or five seconds, she continued, "According to our investigation We found that Ms. Kinsale is actually Du Lin’s sister, the same mother’s sister!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rumor circulating outside, Kinsale The success was because she climbed onto Doolin's bed and evolved a series of inferior content, which is as rumored as the market, or very marketable. Especially in the film industry, some people have also criticized Kinsale for thinking that a woman's watch can not become a representative of mainstream movies and filmmakers, appearing at major ceremonies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the truth has been revealed, and it has indeed shocked many people. Their relationship is more intimate than the story. They are originally a family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While knowing the truth, they don’t hate Kinsale or Dooling, but instead create a rumor maker who fabricated these lies to deceive their emotions. Aversion and hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who share, process, and try to spread the "truth" in their hands are more intense. They always thought that they knew the "truth" of some things, and spread these "truths" out, using a salvation mentality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now they realize that they have been deceived, and that these rumor makers have cheated on them to hurt their friends because they put the wrong The "truth" spread, people know what the real truth regrets? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first feeling is that they have been deceived by some people. The second thought is that those people are really fucking stupid, even true and false can not tell. , although in reality most people can't tell the truth before the results appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin used this not strong way to clarify the situation and then counterattack, far more operational and useful than Hellsmann’s plan Sex. He doesn't even need to let those small apologies, he can do a hundred times more than that way, so Hellsman is old, and his thinking can't keep up with the pulse of the mainstream society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jinsaier face kissed Du Lin’s face in front of the camera and then messed up his hair. “We lived together from birth, for Those malicious rumors, I think they are not hurting me, but more viewers who want to know something. Just because we are brothers and sisters, sometimes they will gather together, just as I did to him just now. Some intimate actions can't prove anything, because we are brothers and sisters, this is a way for us to express love and care for our family, but those people take these wonderful things to deceive others."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
