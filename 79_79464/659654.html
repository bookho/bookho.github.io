			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, this young gentleman is bidding for two thousand, is anyone willing to pay a higher price?", the staff has already appeared on the face The stock is not healthy, maybe some people will be very surprised, and the sale of an auction item is no good, it has nothing to do with you. What are you excited about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this statement is wrong. As the organizer, the Te Nel Theatre closed for five days for this charity dinner, and arranged the venue for the first four days. Arrange the seats and start the auction and dinner on the last day. Every job requires a lot of time and effort from the staff. At the same time, at least two performances are delayed in five days. The Grand Theatre of Teruel is definitely not a charity. They are charged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, they will say that hosting such activities is free and supports charity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the money received will not be less than one point. The amount of remuneration comes from the final turnover, and one percent of it belongs to the Grand Theatre. Just like the innumerable rules of the game that make up the city's normal functioning, this is part of the rules of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the total transaction price during the auction period, the higher the income the Grand Theatre will receive, and the staff who host the auction will naturally have a small bonus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of gaze immediately followed the direction of the staff's gaze, looking back at Du Lin sitting on the edge of the ninth row. Dooling smiled and nodded and greeted him. Soon he noticed that an old man sitting on the right side of the middle of the first row turned slowly and looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s hair is already gray, his body looks awkward, he is squinting, maybe his eyes are not very good, his suit is decent and others are against him. Respect and his agents show that this old man should be the provider of this grass, one of the two members of the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up at this moment, grabbing the hem of his clothes with one hand and bowing his body. The old man's face was filled with a kind smile and he nodded to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be in the heart of the old man that Du Lin is an idiot, for the purpose of this morning he deliberately dug a piece of grass with a weed from the roadside and paid two thousand Blocking such amazing prices, isn't that stupid? At least at this time his mood is pleasant, and happiness is also from the heart. The reason is very simple. Tomorrow's newspaper will cover the charity dinner this evening. It will also mention him and his donation – two thousand. As for who pays for him, the newspaper will not report it, unless the reporter, editor-in-chief, editor-in-chief, including the boss of the newspaper, do not want to stay in the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His good name will spread to more people's ears, and he will continue to be the great "philanthropist" of the city of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand pieces, bought a pot of weeds at an amazing price, celebrities and officials may feel that Du Lin is very popular, very vulgar and stupid. But those tycoons would envy him, because of this pot of weeds, Doolin had the power to meet a member of Parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this is one of the rules of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some auctions of celebrities that have already been sold at relatively high prices, and even Prando has contributed a box of "Happy Land" to a premium percentage. The price of two hundred was bought by a rich man. Then, the auction items donated by the second member of the parliament were put on the auction floor. But this time, the same time that Du Lin’s bid was successful, his auction was in a cold reception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is actually very simple. According to the requirements of imperial law, each city must have at least two members of the state legislature, one of whom belongs to the old party, and the other One belongs to the new party. If the city has a large population, then there will be a third place or a fifth member. The parliamentarians of each city finally sat together and were the overall members of the state legislature. They voted to determine a state's next development blueprint and policies. Among these people, four will become one of the members of the Imperial Parliament, including two new parties and two old parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that the city of Tener is the sphere of influence of the old party. The important organs and institutions of the whole city are firmly controlled by the old party, in a group of old parties. There is a new party member in the middle, which shows how much he should be suffering here. Anyone who dares to bid means that he has turned to the embrace of the new party. In the sphere of influence of the old party, he is relying on the new party. Isn’t that looking for death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if the new party member came up with a pretty good silk watch, there is still no one raising his hand to bid, and the entire Grand Theatre is here. It became extremely quiet in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member’s face was indescribably raised and raised his hand with his hand facing out and a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff standing on the stage suddenly smiled. "This gentleman is willing to pay a thousand dollars to bid for this luxurious silk watch, this pocket watch comes from The hand of the famous watch master of Orodo is definitely one of the most worthwhile items to collect, so is there anyone still going to have a higher price?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;In the three lightning-fast inquiries, it may be the only exception to the entire city. The Honourable Member himself paid for his own pocket watch. However, he only looked ugly and did not have the appearance of anger. This kind of thing, in the past two years, he has experienced more than once! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, no one will discuss this strange process. New Party members may be rejected by many parties in the city of Tener, but at the same time the mayor and the city The main official will not bother him, and even create a comfortable working environment and living environment for him to maximize his enjoyment and living standards. Because according to imperial law, when a city submits a bill to the state legislature, it must be signed by at least two members of different camps to be valid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, if he doesn’t sign his teeth, the city won’t get any substantial development in four or even eight years. . So people rejected him and had to wait for him to be comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short silence soon passed, the theater became bustling again, and soon reached the climax of the auction stage – donations from Mayor Peter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a painting. If Delil is here at this time, he will definitely cry for his own knowledge of art, and it’s worthless oil painting. Why can I shoot high prices every time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is the oil painting that Delier "sold" to Mrs. Vivian, a worthless painting, but at this special time, in this On special occasions, its value is definitely higher than that of some famous artists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This oil painting, which represents the spring but is covered with green and yellow spots, was screamed for two thousand. Those who have silenced the whole tycoon And the rich are like recovering from hibernation, money is really just a number at this time. In just a few minutes, the auction price of this painting has reached 4,600. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no obvious emotional change on Peter’s face, as always, calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dullin sitting in the ninth row looked at fewer and fewer people, and he raised his fist, and everyone started to fall. Breathing cool air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10,000 yuan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shocking price has made everyone look at the young people on the edge of the ninth row again. Is he crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar charity evening party is often held once a month, almost every month, and less often in two or three months. So many activities make it difficult for the auction to break through 5,000, because this game missed the next game not a year later or a few years later, it may only have to wait for more than 20 days to have the next game, so Everyone is in a state of restraint, and basically recycles hands when they reach 5,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tycoons and the rich are also very clear that once the price is raised too high, it is difficult to fall down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The donated goods offered by Peter have sold at most 6,000 blocks, but at the low price, there are only 3,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly shouting 10,000 pieces like this, it’s the first time in the city of Tener! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I have never said anything, and Peter, who is over-the-spot, stood up. He went straight to the stage. "I can ask, young people. His name?", his voice is a bit low, but full of the magnetism that men should have, the voice is sexy and charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also stood up again, bowed and bowed, and replied loudly: "My name is Doolin, sir."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people were present with a stunned look, and Peter’s brow was slightly lifted. He also heard the name. At this point, many people think that Du Lin is crazy, but there is no interest in recourse for his squandering behavior. Everyone knows that the profits of private liquor are very high, and I have heard about the rising new in the city of Tener. The giants, most people have revealed a clear look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter nodded hard and pointed to Doolin, "I heard about you!", people's eyes moved from Doolin to the mayor. On the body, "I don't evaluate what you are doing right now or wrong, nor refer to others' comments on you. At this moment, on this occasion, I will affirm your behavior. I understand that like many people here. I understand that your purpose may not be simple, but you can't just ignore the effect of this 10,000 yuan on the urgent need for poor families because your purpose is not simple!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be dozens of families, hundreds of families because your current behavior has improved, you let them have clothes to wear, you let them fill their stomachs, and this is exactly today The purpose of the charity dinner!", his voice gradually became red, "That is to help those who need help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
