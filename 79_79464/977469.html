			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that I will have some problems when I acquired the mine?" Du Lin quickly realized what Mr. Federley meant. However, Mr. Federley took care of his face and did not say anything straightforward. At the same time, this is the second time he heard someone telling him that there is something about the outside of the set to get to the west. It seems that the west is indeed self-contained and has a very different performance from other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Federley nodded. "You can understand that this is of course the best thing, more valuable than I told you. The biggest in the west." The problem is that the population is scarce, but the area is quite large. The number of deaths in the murders in the western police last year was more than 3,400. In addition, those who did not report and found no bodies, this number will increase exponentially. In other words, about ten people die every day here, and even people die every hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are in other places Identity, status, and prestige are not used here, unless you can let people know that you are not irritating and afraid of you, otherwise you may not be successful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; as Mr. Federley said, the biggest problem in the west is that the land is sparsely populated. The ecological environment here is rather harsh. Each city has been actively promoting the expansion of agriculture and animal husbandry. The thing that can get the hand may be the tobacco field. Plus. Tobacco leaves are also considered crops, and the sales of Imperial finished cigarettes are rising. Many tobacco companies have taken a lot of land in the west to hire this area to plant tobacco leaves in order to meet this high-speed and sustained growth. The government will also give appropriate tax rebates as a reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greening and poor weather and other issues have restricted the enthusiasm of foreigners to invest here, coupled with the chaotic and dangerous security issues, the investment promotion in the west has entered a vicious circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors saw a corrupt public security environment and ecological environment, and hesitated and even changed their minds about investing here. Lack of money in the pockets of these investors as the necessary funds for urban development, the city will not develop, the city will lack sufficient jobs if it lacks development, and there will be no opportunities for work. The large number of unemployed people will start to have a very bad situation in law and order under the pressure of life. The influence has become a "gold digger" who is lawless. The whole west is a muddy lake. Not everyone can manage it well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the New Party’s ruling and innovation, it has been more than 20 years. In the past 20 years, the three western states have changed at least fourteen governors, but today’s western and There is not much difference in the west more than 20 years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s heart nodded and he looked around. “I want to make a call...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Federley immediately pointed to another door. "The phone is in my study, you can use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lindao thanked Mr. Federley’s study, and most people’s study The difference is that in Mr. Federley's study, there are no books that can't be filled with almost all the books. All the bookcases are displayed in a beautiful ore, with gold, silver, gemstone and crystal mines. It is a place full of wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attention quickly came back from those ores. He dialed the phone number of the temporary rented place in the city. Lin, Ellis, they haven't returned yet, but Mr. Andorra made a phone call and told him that if Doolin went back, let Du Lin call him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin ordered a few sentences and then hung up the phone, and then dialed the Andorran number, after a brief two busy calls in the handset, Raised up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is Andorra Mining..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Doolin, help me turn Thank you Mr. Andorra himself, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a little while, the receiver suddenly remembered a footstep, followed by a hearty laughter. Far and near, in the earpiece, "I am Andorra, Mr. Doolin looks very busy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stunned, he frowned Turned one body, walked to the edge of the window and looked at the hole where the mine car pulled the ore out of the hole. The black paint was like a monster's mouth. "Hello, Mr. Andorra, very embarrassing question. In a sentence, has our agreement been signed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds of silence, Mr. Andorra replied: "Maybe my answer will make you very Disappointment, because only my signature is on our agreement, without the signature of your person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andao Laughed, "some details of the problem still need to discuss the discussion, your one...", someone whispered something next to it, Andorra continued to say: "There is no way for Ellis to be the master, not signed for the time being. My personal opinion is that you can come to see for yourself. We will decide to discuss it in person and then solve it once. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, I am in a hurry outside, I will return to you at noon the day after tomorrow." Du Lin said that he hanged up after saying these words, as if he had forgotten that the purpose of making this call was to ask Ayr. The people of Liss went there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he forget? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not, he knows very well that the words that Andorra invited him to personally interview, that means that Ellis is very good. It may be in the hands of Andorra. What details of the shit need to be discussed. Du Lin can imagine that this Andorra does not want to sell mine at all. All his performances are an illusion. What he really wants to do is to let Du Lin personally pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to Du Lin’s personal past? Nothing was kidnapped, blackmailed for a ransom enough to satisfy Andorra and then disappeared into the Gobi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Federley’s words were fulfilled immediately, which made Du Lin somewhat arrogant and also blamed Mr. Jack. Being able to do is to be able to do it, not to do it, or to do it. To be like this, Mr. Jack also needs to bear some of the responsibilities. Of course, this is not a good time to mention it. After he has cleaned Andorra, he will talk to Mr. Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left the study for a while, and Mr. Federley, who was smoking, heard the footsteps sitting on the sofa and looked back, sharp observation. Immediately I noticed that Doolin was a little emotional. "What's wrong? Bad news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin licked his cheek and sat back again, he picked up the table. A box of cigarettes sucked up, and then he nodded heavily. "My man was trapped in a mine called Andorra Mining, and the other party wanted to lie to me."<br /><br />&nbsp "Andorra?", Mr. Federley is a bit strange. He knows Andorra. Even if the western mine owners have not said anything, they will all know each other because there is a Western mine. The West Mine will hold two cocktail parties each year, and most of the mine owners will be present and will not meet and talk. Regarding Andorra, this person is still relatively low-key according to Mr. Federley's understanding. Apart from his rumors of slave abuse, there is no other negative information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon Mr. Federley glanced at Doolin, and if Andorra did this, then the problem was actually in Doolin’s body – He is too rich! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Federley, who is in the west, has seen reports about Doolin in several newspapers in the west. With the rapid spread of the phone, it is not very difficult to investigate and ask for information from a famous person. Du Lin’s previous industries were not counted. The profitability of the city of Otis alone was shocking. It must be known that the current 50% of the land in the city of Otis was owned by Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this concept? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He simply relies on these land sales and rental expenses, which is enough to get a huge bonus every month, and will continue to get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rich man comes to the west, just like a golden gold ingot appears in a thief’s nest, no matter who has the strength, he will consider it. Can you grab this gold ingot in your own hands? The only difference now is that some people are still thinking about it, but Andorra has already started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few people who are willing to open mines in the west, including Mr. Federley. He has had such a little bit of action, but he quickly dismissed it. It is. Because his family lives in the South, he is fifty years old and may not be able to regenerate his children, so he gave up on this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at Du Lin. "What are you going to do, do you need me to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"No, thank you, this is just a small thing. It makes me feel that some trouble is that my plan for the west may have to be redone. This is the most nerve-racking!", Du Lin’s idea at the beginning was simple and rude. With money to shake the entire western region, it is not that he is too confident, but that he has such strength. Compared with other regions with more developed economies and higher population densities, one or two million per month will be invisible in those places, but in the west, it is definitely not weaker than a thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large land, rare population, distressed economic model, simple folk customs, with the help of large sums of money, can definitely mix these elements in Together, a qualitative change occurs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Du Lin’s original idea. Now he understands that money is important, but not the most important, the most important thing is the fist! There are no fists that everyone can fear, they may not be so obedient, bad children can only become good children through the education of fatherly love, this is the truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
