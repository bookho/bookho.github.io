			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon Mrs. Mamma appeared in Doolin’s sight to save this somewhat stalemate. She rubbed her hands on the apron and ran to Du Lin carefully looked around and patted his set of 360 pieces of clothes to leave some slight traces, then pulled his hand and pulled him into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter, say after dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Doolin in the last two years The first time I was eating at home, he had been running outside for the past two years, and even did not return to Ziwei Town during the New Year. In the past, Mr. Kesma would also say a few words to him, let him come back for the New Year, and now he will not say it. Even if Du Lin is said, he may not be able to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting at the table, the family is there, except for Mason and Merlin, but there is one more Buddha, a little strange feeling. He glanced at the two children and looked at Alisa again. He decided not to talk and only to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Mr. Xmasma wants to say something, she was stunned by Mrs. Xerma’s eyes and had to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, the women are packing the table, Mr. Xema and Du Lin went to Mr. Xerma’s room, for the old gentleman. He, the kind of nobles in the study, will be disdainful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to marry the daughter of the nobility?" Mr. Kesma took a dried tobacco from the smoke ribbon in his waist and stuffed it into the pipe. I got a fire and even sucked two. I asked, "I have been fighting with the nobles for more than ten years. You are now licking the daughter of the nobles. This will make people laugh at me. The father is a hero, but the son becomes The running dog...", Mr. Kesma will never be soft on the fallen child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin threw the clothes on the bed, untied the cufflinks and pushed open the window, half sitting on the window sill and ordered a cigarette, replied with a smile "I won't be a running dog of the nobility, but the times are different. Some roads are not going to work. You have used more than ten years to prove that this road is not going to work. Then why should I use more time to repeat? "Failed?", he stressed the rebuttal, "Is it just because you can't make you lose face, so I have to repeat the failure? Just because I am your son?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kema’s eyebrows picked and picked, and some hands were itchy. Perhaps it is because Du Lin's two little bastards are brought up by him, or they may be a lot older. He is not so fond of it now. Let’s take a few cigarettes and lick Du Lin’s eyes, which means let him continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think that if one day, people call me "Prime Minister", will it be more effective than your method?" This is the first time that Doolin confided to Mr. Zema, he never told me. Mr. Sma wants to be the ruler of this empire, and even Kevin said that he wants to be a prime minister with a certain joke. This idea is currently only known to a very small number of people, such as the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every boy, or man, rarely confides in the face of his father, in every child’s psychology no matter what his father is doing , what kind of achievements or no achievements, will be the hero of the child's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the greatest hero in my life, even if the children have a magnificent dream, it is difficult to say, perhaps because of worship, so feel their ideals and Not great, but when they start to express their thoughts in their hearts, they will become arrogant and think about being in front of the most important and greatest people in their lives, telling their own ideals and pursuits, showing their own wonderfulness. Life, hope to be recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin straightened his spine forward and stood up. He walked back and forth a few steps and said, "Give people happiness and let people The power to live freely, without oppression, without exploitation, is something that could not have been done, but I will still do it seriously, and work hard for this impossible goal, but this is definitely not to destroy. The progress of civilization can only bring destruction to make society more barbaric. History has proved this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Becoming the Prime Minister is only my first step. I still have a lot of things to do, and there are more ambitious ambitions and ideals, but no matter which one you want to achieve, you need to have a stable foundation. This foundation is the support of the mainstream society."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The marriage with the daughter of the nobles can make me overcome the most difficult obstacles that are currently insurmountable. It will save me from the efforts of more than ten years and have more time to prepare to change this. The world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "The times are different. Fathers, people may be afraid of violence, but they will not surrender to the rule of violence. They will be afraid, but they will hate. When hatred is fermented to a certain extent, it will erupt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if you have heard of a sentence, the strongest castles are always framed from the inside, they built by various means. A castle that cannot be conquered, then what I am doing now is to mix in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
