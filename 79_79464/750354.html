			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Scott’s words, Doolin was not very concerned, not that he could not hear the complicated information in this sentence, nor did he feel that he had the three Tens of millions... No, according to the current operation of the jewelry store, the gold can sell at least 40 million! He is very rich, but he also knows that there are more people in the world who have more money than themselves. The real big men of the Chamber of Commerce, the generations are the super rich who have accumulated endless wealth, and gathered more than a dozen. Even a super consortium of dozens of family wealth... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who have more money than him, more people than he has, but he is not worried at all, because here is Irian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a bit confusing. To put it simply, on a project, these people can’t invest 100% of their energy. Du Lin’s opponents are not those horrible. The head of the economy, but a slender tentacles. He can't fight against the big consortia, but it can be done easily to break their tentacles, and there is no need to worry about being retaliated. If every successful business investment fails to expel those winners, the world has long since not turned, and the empire has long since died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin wasn’t worried at all. He patted Scott’s arm and squeezed it a little hard. “I have a few hearts.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott sees Doolin saying this, and then persuaded him to have a bit of a deep meaning, he closed his mouth in a timely manner, and the two went to the living room again. The center sat down. The next step is to enhance each other's understanding of the process, gossip and questions and answers from both sides. An hour later, Jose sent the three Guar representatives on behalf of Du Lin and asked Dufo to send Scott back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-sitting on the largest sofa in the middle of the living room, Savi walked down from the second floor. "I have already done everything according to the boss. Everything has already been sent." He sat on the side of Doolin and grabbed an apple from the fruit basket and picked it up. Since the first kill, Savi has been very comfortable with the assassination. Plus he is still a child who is less likely to cause people's doubts. If the body is stronger and better, you can specialize for Doolin. Handle similar things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Give you a few more days off, go around and go around, work hard, play with arrogance. After playing, I want to ask some Tutors and some other people come to teach you classes!", in the first half of the sentence, Savi is still excited, how can such a bustling city that never sleeps be a remote town like Tern? Even if you go to the streets in the middle of the night, the first district is still brightly lit, and there are crowds of singing and dancing everywhere. Only such a city is called the city that never sleeps. It is called the metropolis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only Du Lin’s second half that made him completely smashed down. The word school was once what he dreamed of, but for Savi now he wants to do big things instead of wasting time on learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who was aware of Savy’s dissatisfaction, smiled and slapped his head on his head, not heavy, not too light, "idiot, I hope You and your children can share more things for me in the future, then learning is inevitably the most important thing. You can not learn, I will not force you, nor will you force anyone, but if One day your little friends have become your superiors. When they ask you to do something in a commanding tone, I hope that you will not forget your current choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Savy pinched his fist under one sigh, and when he thought of the "big brother" who was arrogant, he became the object of the men, and he felt uncomfortable. He doesn't understand Du Lin's words very much. Is it really necessary for such people to take such a mission? Is learning really necessary? But Savi, who has always been obedient, decided to follow Doolin’s arrangements, at least Doolin would not harm him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not know that, besides the two teachers who teach knowledge, others are not the most sinister criminals, but the veterans from elite troops. Even if it is a gray society, Du Lin will turn this club into a combative steel bomb, not a clod that will be broken. More military training, in addition to facilitating future management, is also to strengthen their own "business level". He can hope that anyone who can perform the task will not come back. At this time, everyone is the most trustworthy. The most reliable people are precious treasures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the Buddha came back from the outside, and he glanced at Savi, who was sitting next to Doolin, and said nothing. forest. In the non-"work" time, Du Lin really is like his brother, his family, and there is no shelf for the leader. He is joking with him, even if he is not angry, he will not be annoyed, but will smile at the way of expressing these affection and friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the "work" time, he is the leader, his temperament, his eyes, he is the most prominent one. Dudu sometimes laughs and asks himself why there are so many clubs in the prison to recruit him. He didn't participate. Is he mixed with a guy named Du Lin? He thought about it many times, and there is only one answer at a time, that is the feeling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a family feeling that makes him happy and happy. He grabbed an apple and smashed it up. The brothers looked at each other and smiled. No one spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s fingers slammed twice on the arm of the golden grain sofa. “Go ask Eric, what is the situation in the eighth district? There is something in Scott’s words. The project in the eighth district seems to have been It’s not what I want to see. If there is no fair environment for us to compete, then we will create a fair environment for ourselves!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doo After a moment, he and Savy waved his hand and immediately got up and left, and Ellis was still staring at Eric. When returning to East Coast Entertainment, Airlis was smoking in the lobby. He pointed to the upstairs and the latter nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric has been locked up in the office these days, and he will be released when he needs to come out. If he is not afraid of breaking his leg, he can also consider it. Jumping from the window on the third floor, but even if he has that courage, it makes no sense, because the position to jump is just outside the gate on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the room was opened on the third floor, the swelling on Eric's face had faded a lot. When he came in, he was half-sleeping and half-awake. I suddenly rolled over and sat up. After seeing the hands of both the people and the Buddha, he licked his face and looked down with some tiredness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss let me ask you if you know the situation in the eighth district."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eric looked at him with his head tilted and asked him, "Is there smoke?", a guy who has never been exposed to cigarettes. It took only four days to learn how to smoke and use cigarettes. reduce stress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha lost most of the box of cigarettes, and Eric skillfully took out a slap in his mouth and lit a fire, he enjoyed it. Squinting with the smoke from the lungs, a little dizzy, this is a normal phenomenon for novices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation in the eighth district is a bit complicated, because the amount of work in the planning of the town hall is very large, and relying solely on the city hall to build it is simply impossible. Therefore, the City Hall contacted a number of large consortia and wealthy individuals to let them invest in the construction of the 8th District, and verbally guaranteed their rights to invest in Yili. Now most of the projects in the 8th district already have contractors. It is said that it is the eighth district of Irian. It is better to say that they are the eighth district of these rich people!" Eric blinked and his eyes were a little uncomfortable. "Bos also wants to invest in the eighth district?" The threshold for the eighth district is at least 10 million, and it is cash that can be obtained anytime, anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
