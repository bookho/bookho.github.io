			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mayor, you have to manage this thing!" Ernst and Karur sat in the office of the mayor. Pour out the inner grievances to the mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor, who was called the executive before the new party’s reform, is now called the mayor. The mayor's power is very large. Basically, except for the army, he has no power to mobilize. All the big things in the whole city of Tener, he is qualified to take charge of the tube and give the final implementation opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter looked calmly at Ernst and Carol, and did not show any tendency to attitude. After listening to Karur’s remarks, Basically smooth things down. To put it simply, Du Lin’s private liquor succeeded in blocking the private wine business of Karur and Ernst, and their income dropped sharply. Now they are here for help. There is no sympathy for Peter, and there is some happiness in the depths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever outsiders talk about the "Big Three" of the Tener, Peter will never be happy, but there will be some concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was the feudal imperial dynasty overthrown by the New Party? It was nothing more than a disappointment after the defeat, and the new party that had accumulated enough power had the upper hand, and then ended the long imperial dynasty. Using a country's transformation to describe three incompetent guys in a small city may be too flattering, but the situation is the same. The Big Three already have enough tacit understanding, and they will not make concessions while adhering to their own bottom line, and they will never cross the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years of getting along, the "war" tends to be peaceful, especially in the past two years, whether it is Wood, Carroll or Ernst. There have been no small-scale wars that have erupted. This is a dangerous signal, which means that the three parties have reached a certain degree of tacit understanding and a high degree of harmonization. Just as all the power-owners are most reluctant to see is that the people under their hands are partisans, and Peter does not want to see these three giants who can master wealth and connections, and attack and defend the alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This signal is dangerous. Once they have accumulated enough power and have the same "outward" aggression, maybe they will make a change to the current special The matter of the pattern of the city is coming. So even if Wood didn't die outside the estate of Gothor, Peter would find an opportunity to attack one of the Big Three and then change one person to the stage. Only by giving them enough pressure to maintain a certain competitive position between them, it is convenient for the upper class to intervene in the underlying society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he hasn’t had time to make a compromise. Wood is dead. A new giant is starting to appear. This is a good thing, just like it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about it, Karur or Ernst has been here for a long time and has not come here to ask for help. He wants to thank him. Du Lin, Du Lin injected new vitality into the private wine market that has begun to gradually lose control, and brought positive changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how Peter feels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say it, just say Wood that has died. Every year, he spends most of his own money as a political contribution to the big man above. His purpose is self-evident, in order to obtain a real "place." Once Wood, Carroll, and Ernst got what they wanted, they would occupy a large enough place in the political ecosystem of the city of Tener, forming a new old party, with existing factions. It is not a good thing to stand up against the court, which means that something has left control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Peter Mayor is therefore reluctant to see such things happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the problem is solved, and without him, Du Lin has solved the idiots like Wood for him, making the competition even more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his hand and stopped Karul’s continued curse and embarrassment. “I’m not so good. The red fruit interferes with the operation of the merchants. These things. It shouldn’t be controlled by me, and I don’t think it’s necessary to take care of it.” Peter cocked his legs and continued: “Internal competitiveness can drive evolution, which was established many years ago in the Ogiltin era...”, When he said this, Peter shook his head with a smile and did not continue. Not that he didn't want to say it, but that he didn't say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether it is Laur or Ernst, there is no aristocratic elite education. What Peter wants to say may be difficult for them to understand. Of course, there are also It may be that the mayor feels that it is better to shut up than to speak up. In short, I used my own attitude to show my opinion on this matter - that is, I don't care, don't come to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karur screamed at Ernst and the mayor’s adult and left the office of the mayor’s adult, and sneaked into the car through the window. After leaving the city hall of Karur, the mayor was just a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
