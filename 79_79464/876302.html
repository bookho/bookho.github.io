			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus has a gun in his pocket, but under the dim light, he doesn’t know if there is a gun in his hand, is he pointing at him, that The person is very cleverly standing at the edge of the direct light, the street lamp is like the perfect camouflage, separating the two worlds, but leaving the guy in the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people keep their own actions, no one else makes any other moves, they look at each other through the boundaries between light and darkness, time is This second, here, has lost its meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a dozen seconds, or tens of seconds, or a few minutes, Claus slightly raised his chin, he did not want to show a timid expression, here Keeping your courage to do so can be very helpful in what might happen next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you, who sent you?", Klaus turned and was facing this guy, he slowly bent down and put the suitcase Placed on the ground and opened the lock of the suitcase. He moved the suitcase to his front and pushed it gently on the ground. The suitcase was shaken and caused some subtle changes. Under the action of the reed, the suitcase slowly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few small metal boxes inside, I don’t know what to put in, but the most eye-catching thing is that there is already some messy cash on one side. All of them are 20 yuan denominations of cash, one tie and one tie even the bank's sealing tape has not been removed, there are ten, 20,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know who you are, I don't know who invited you, but I believe that my life is more than the money here. You want to have more. Friends, give me a chance, but also give yourself a chance, there is also a checkbook, already signed, the maximum limit is two thousand. I will not cancel this checkbook, one hundred Zhang, twenty-two thousand are yours!", he tried to slow down his tone and make himself look threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you stand here, wait for me to go out from the alley, you can chase me again, why not give yourself a chance and give me a chance "", Klaus's squatting side rolled down a sweat, and rolled down to his chin along his well-kept side. More and more sweat is accumulating along the "river" that the former has pulled out. The drop of sweat can no longer bear more weight, loses grip, and drops from his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little sweat beads picked up a small splash on the wet ground in the alley, and a car passing by the lane quickly passed, and the driver did not seem to find everything that happened inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window on the upper floor of the apartment was slammed shut, and an old voice came from the ear, seeming to be yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is like countless calm and boring nights, but something less ordinary happened today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After my death, the bank will freeze my account for the first time. If there is no heir, the money will be swallowed by the bank forever, 20,000 or twenty. 20,000, this does not need to think!", Klaus kindly reminded the guy who might be a killer. If he killed himself, then the 200,000 people in the bank would not get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more sweat makes Klaus feel less comfortable, he wants to tear open his mouth and breathe, but he is afraid that he is too big. The move will cause this person's misunderstanding. He knew that there would be negotiating capital as long as he put his hand in his pocket, but he couldn't do it, even if his hand and pocket were less than a foot away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long wait, the man spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You did something you shouldn’t do, and you said something you shouldn’t say, Mr. Doolin wants you to remember this lesson!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence sounds like forgive yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surprise on Klaus’s face just emerged, and there was a gunshot in his ear. His eyes were uncontrollably fast under the spur of gunshots. A moment, the body vibrates. He slowly bowed his head and looked at his chest with a small wound on it. After a few seconds of blood, the blood spilled a little bit and stained the waitress shirt he had stolen from the damn place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his right hand and touched the wound, and placed his finger closer to his own eyes. The fresh blood was not sticky, but rather a little thin. It's like red ink. He felt that the power in his body was quickly pulled away by some unknown power through this small wound. His legs could no longer support his body and he fell to the ground. Breathing has become rushed by fear, and a powerful force has emerged in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power gave him an illusion that he didn't have any problems, and he could stand up, run and jump, and defeat the killer. The five senses became more sensitive. He heard the footsteps, his big eyes saw a man with a cap, and he stood by his side. From this angle, he can see a pair of cold eyes, he opened his mouth to say something, a coughing desire interrupted the urge to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sigh of blood, the blood mist blooms in this quiet alley, the old man who has been yelling shut his mouth, constantly shaking the old screaming sound The bed seemed to be firm, and the guy raised his gun and leaned against his face, his fingers on the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin only stayed in Orodo for three days and left there to return to Otis. There are still many things waiting in Otis. He handled, he could not stay outside for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already nine days after he left the city of Otis, Monday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just woke up early in the morning, Dove is ready to go early, he just took a sip, think of something, immediately asked: "The new municipality How was the hall built?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new town hall made a sketch according to Doolin’s ideas and the designers who came from the emperor’s side. Very style, a total of five floors, covering an area of ​​about 1,500 square meters, excluding gardens and yards. The style adopts an ancient style called "Ya", which is said to be a great empire thousands of years ago. Later, because of the civil war, it eventually went to ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This style is popular in the atmosphere. The six pillars that need three people to hold at the door are enough to make many people detach from the chin. The whole building is not luxurious, but can feel To a heavy weight and majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the provincial ya claimed to be a descendant of "Ya". As for whether it is true or not, it is not clear from their building style. Ya" has any connection, it may be "shrinking"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the construction period of such a building is calculated according to the world in the dream, it will take at least half a year, but it does not take so long. With the birth of the AT-1 magic engineering machine, many engineering costs that require manpower, material resources and time have been greatly reduced. Take the pillar, it took half a month to ship from the west, but it took less than a morning to transport it from the station to the new town hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two construction machinery can completely hold the column and walk, thanks to the weapons developers, without their replacement, everyone can not enjoy the utility of this construction machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire project schedule takes two months to complete, and has been thirty-seven days until now, and twenty-four days are two months. In addition to the interior decoration, the main project should have been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes Du Lin feels amazing, it may be too much influence from the dream, he always thinks it may take a long time to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Natalie said that it will be completed in about half a month, thanks to the help of many locals." Some milk, for this milk, she specifically asked Du Lin to transfer some cows from the field. Locals do not raise cows. First, people here seem to be less interested in milk, mainly because there may be young people missing here. Secondly, the economic value of cows here is far less than the economic value of beef cattle, so no one is raising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and he knew about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that the big building in the city of Otis is the happiest person, it must be no more than the locals, except for the changes in the city that allow them to enjoy the developed cities as well. In addition to everything, it also provides more job opportunities. For example, to build a house, a five-day daily salary in other places, where only one or two pieces are willing to do. Under the premise that the financial pressure is less than other places, it is natural to hire more workers to build together, and the construction period is naturally much faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Garfield also complained to him, it’s really busy, because he is not only one of the big landowners in Otis, but also the mayor. Friends, so many people order steel from Garfield in order to mix and match. This made him painful and happy. He bought a large number of purchases from steel mills all day long and then sold them. Although the profit per unit was reduced, the overall revenue was rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is like a day, and Du Lin’s heart is full of sense of accomplishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once thought that being a mayor is not very meaningful, but watching the city glow with new vitality in his own hands, just like a father Treat your child like that, even though he has no children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
