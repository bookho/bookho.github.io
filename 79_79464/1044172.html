			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still young, not eager to get married." Du Lin refused the good intentions of Magus as soon as he opened his mouth, which made Magus somewhat surprised. He believes that Doolin can produce the true content of his last sentence, and the fact is true. When Magus said that he wanted to introduce a better girl, Du Lin immediately realized that Magus wanted to "kidnapp" him. This is not from the kindness of Magus, but a trap that Maggs specially designed for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally... Do you want to start fighting, or just temptation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s brain slurry formed a whirlpool in his head, stirring agitatedly, and each brain cell was in a rotating species to analyze Magus’s doing this. The reason, as well as his true purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is not dead, but Magus is not too young. After living for so many years, he overthrew the rule of the royal family. ", but definitely enough "demon", or that kind of big demon. Fortunately, Doolin also has his own advantages. He witnessed the life of another world in his life, and he also realized something different from the feelings of Daxie from many books that he read. It can be said that he is a second person, and his age is not only so young that he has shown himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While rejecting Magus, he also understood that the purpose of Magus was not completely malicious, but it was definitely not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s biggest shortcoming is now born, yes, under the efforts of Magus and the New Party, the Yaoxing Empire has entered a new era for more than 20 years. In the past two years, many changes have taken place, and people’s conceptual changes have taken place. For example, the royal family that once ruled this empire has become a mascot. The word of the nobility has gradually faded away from people's memory, but in the middle and upper levels of society, people can still feel the old nobility and the new aristocracy against this empire. Dominance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles changed their name, wearing a new coat, and appeared again in front of people. But no matter the old nobility, or the new aristocracy in the new era, most of them have the same characteristics - born extraordinary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new consortium headed by the northern aristocracy is almost always a nobleman. These people are old aristocrats in the new era, prominent origins and wealth accumulated in the family. Let them not even work hard, they have already surpassed 95% of the people in this society. In the new era, they were born as "nobles", which is no different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than 20 years of exploration and evolution, the new aristocrats, led by the southern aristocracy and the capital, have found a way to the top of the tower. They don’t look like everyone has a prominent identity, but in reality these people are In the past, when the new era had not yet arrived, it had already had a fairly high social status. They are all businessmen. In the old society, the status of businessmen is not high. This is a book, but what about the actual situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of merchants is not higher than the elites of the elites of the society at the time, but they are many times higher than ordinary people, they not only There is a huge wealth, a certain degree of private armed forces, and their relationship with the nobility is also very close. The nobility believes that merchants are their own dogs, but this is also for the nobility. Take these dogs and compare them with ordinary people. They are noble dogs, but they are made to be low-lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the prime minister’s dog have the same status as an ordinary person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously not the same! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if it enters a new era, the new society, the top empire has been propagating the great empire dream, the real vested interests in this era, not much real Ordinary people. Their extraordinary origins allowed them to get up to the initial stage of accumulation faster, even skipping this stage, and those who are truly ordinary people can do this very little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a railway tycoon. People have been repairing railways since the old society. An ordinary businessman can repair the railway in the old society where the nobles ruled the world. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The railway repairs him almost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin keeps snowballing to expand and expand his power, but he is unlikely to form a core with him as soon as the industry tycoons People are willing to pay for the consortium, because his origin is too low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer is born... This precondition makes him and the people only a cooperative relationship, an ordinary interest group, not a destiny group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin agrees with Magus’s request, he knows the lady of a noble family, whether it is a new or old aristocrat, he will enter a rapid development. period. Marriage with the nobility will fill his last shortcomings, even if this will make his marriage a bit embarrassing, it will make people feel that he has stood up with the advantage of the woman. With such a birth, he would not be difficult to find a real elite. The elite of the high-class class in society is willing to work for a boss with aristocratic status and make suggestions for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inevitably envied the environment in the Federation, which is why the Federation is called a “country full of opportunities” among many people. Everyone is a former mud dog's leg. No one is looking down on the factors of their origin. Everyone is looking at the money. There is money, that is, the nobility, that is, grandfather, that is everything in society. Without money, there is nothing in nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if Doolin agrees with Magus’s "goodwill," there will be a huge trap, or a drawback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be tied to a carriage called "Aristocrat", he will become the covenant he needs to look up in the past... No, it is a big man who needs to look up His interests will also be tied to these people. Every time he does something, he needs to consider what I will do, what benefits it will bring to me, what benefits will it bring to my peers, and whether it will hurt our relationship and friendship with each other. Because this is a very important thing, once he has made the harm of those who hurt the top of the tower, he will become a "special" person, a person different from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that when a heterogeneous person appears in a group, people will not turn him into a class higher than himself, and will only find ways to eliminate this heterogeneity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as Doolin does anything that harms this class, or if people think he has harmed this class, everyone will start to reject him and treat him as The enemy, and want to send him to see the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, one step went wrong, the upper society of the whole society would form a flood to drown him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His enemies will inflate from a few people, a family or a consortium to all the vested interests, and he will become a public enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the trap that Maggs has laid out. Once he stepped in, he didn’t want to be a public enemy, and he was the public enemy of these people on the top of the tower. He had to converge. Own desires, hiding their own minions, following the rules of the game, obeying an invisible overall will, living in this society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he has the opportunity to win the scepter of the imperial power, but more likely he will become the sponsor behind the power of the scepter many years later. The role of business, political sponsors, and so on, this is not what he hopes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must reject Magus, can not have a moment of hesitation and heartbeat, this is a trap, a delicious trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s rejection of such decisiveness has made Magus a confused, Doolin’s discovery of his purpose, or whether he really does not intend Make a girlfriend? His answer was too quick to give a view that "this is his most primitive, not concealed heart." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus laughed. "I have heard of a rumor...", his eyes were a bit strange, and Du Lin felt the scalp a bit numb. "They, that is, those newspapers and public opinion, do you like men?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled quietly after listening, "This is nonsense." Talk about it, you should understand that this is a sick society, people will not allow too perfect things to appear in this world. Perfect things will make them feel ugly and broken, so they have to look for themselves. Add at least some imperfect things to someone or business that is perfect for yourself, at least let them feel better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not thinking in arrogance I am perfect, but it is indeed a filth. I am never interested in men. I like women as much as most people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago Doolin lived in Ilyan and had no female horns for a long time. Always have the Buddha with him. After a long time, there will naturally be a kind of unfriendly speech, saying that he likes men. He can see the reasons for this rumor, not everyone is willing to admit a better thing, as people often say "not that he is smart, but I am too stupid" or "she will be with me It looks beautiful when she is, and she will become ugly when she is with whom." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of willingness to belittle and not willing to admit that other people’s excellent morbid thoughts have always occupied the mainstream of society, and that the recognition of others’ excellence is not exemplified by these people. Out of yourself is not too much behind others, and will not be worse than others. What is even more extreme is to demonstrate the value of being in society by defaming others to elevate themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people are often the weak in society, and the weak in this society is, after all, the majority, relatively speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s not particularly strange to have such a statement. The reason why Maggs asked this is to cover up his eager mentality, he pretended to be Du Lin didn't know, Du Lin also pretended that he really didn't see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
