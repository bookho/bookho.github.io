			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limocas Aristocratic School has a history of more than 400 years. In the past, only aristocratic members were enrolled in the school. There are 20 classes in total, each class has the most No more than three students, but each class has at least six teachers. With a long history, deep heritage and strong faculty, Limocas has become one of the best aristocratic schools in the Northwestern Ordos of the Empire. Among the students who graduated here were a duke, five marquis, and more counts and viscounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that the Limocas Aristocratic School is the cradle of the elite aristocracy - in fact, it is all blowing, because the Duke’s children are here to go to school, In adulthood, he inherited the title of the Duke. Whether he studies well or not, he must be the Duke. The other graduates are all the same. As long as they can inherit the title, they must be nobles with titles. However, it is also necessary to pay attention to it. The people who have become "successful" in the Limocas aristocratic school for more than 400 years seem to be a little less, and it sounds very powerful, but in turn, think about it, it seems that more children have not succeeded in the title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they went to Limokas, or for other reasons, it’s not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this does not prevent the Limocas aristocratic school from making a louder name in the new era of new society - because this school has "noble" Ingredients, so more middle-class families want their children to be on the side of the nobility, even if it is just a noble school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual tuition fee of 2,500 yuan is definitely not affordable for ordinary families, even some ordinary middle-class families can not give such money to children. Go to this school. From four years old to fourteen years old, ten years of ten years require tuition fees of 25,000 yuan, which does not include some other super-event expenses. But the more expensive the tuition, the fewer students can afford it, and the more valuable those in the eyes of the rich can prove the value of the school, so that each year, the new students need to spend another sum of money to find a relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 8:50 in the morning, there is still 40 minutes from the freshman enrollment ceremony at 9:30, and the Buddha is nervously standing outside the auditorium. Today, Du Lin and Dufo have put on a very formal dress, a pure black tuxedo with a white shirt and bow tie, even the collar and cufflinks are very high-end goods. The heads of the two men were so shiny that they looked a bit funny, like those in the movie or in the drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still some people around who are smoking. They look at each other from time to time. They are polite and keep a distance and smile with a smile. They are everywhere in this ancient campus. They are filled with an atmosphere of elegance and dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a little nervous.", Buddha took a sip of smoke and spit out into the sky. "I was so nervous for the first time after I grew up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the hand of Buddha, who shivered slightly. He licked some dry and tight lips. "Okay, I know, you are very nervous. Can you tell me why I am nervous?", Du Lin also ordered a Smoke, two people stood outside the gate of the auditorium, and at a glance they could see Vivian, who was standing first on the right hand side of the first row, and a four-year-old child. Vivian looked back and encouraged the Buddha with a smile. Both of them also smiled and said that they had nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the smile is so magical, it is impossible to show any substantive content, but in different circumstances, different environments, different emotions, Smiles and eyes will become able to communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought that the Buddha may be because the child shouted a father, so that the Buddha is nervous, or it may be because his current status is very embarrassing The Buddha is nervous, but he guessed it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is a school...", the Buddha took another cigarette. "I am afraid of school. I used to go to school very poorly. You know." The conditions in my family are very poor. It is very difficult for me to go to school for one child." When the Buddha said this, his hand seemed to be less shaken. He looked at Du Lin’s self-deprecating smile. Kicked the ashes under the kick. "Mother has supported many of our children and gave me the opportunity to go to school. I hope that I can change my future and change the future of the family."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am desperate to learn, every day I spend all my time on learning, but I don't know if my brain is not smart enough, not like you...", they all point with their fingers. My own temple, "My grades are very poor. I have been counting down. Every time I got E, I got my mother, but my mother has been encouraging me until one day..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day the school’s teacher and principal I think that Buddha is not suitable to continue to study in school. His poor performance has become like this, and learning has become a heavy family burden. Although the annual tuition fee is not a high expenditure that cannot be paid by many people, for the family of Dufo, the money is his mother, and his younger brother and sister are saved by hungry. He studied for two years, and his family was hungry for two years, but he exchanged the teacher's conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher told him that the school was going to talk to his mother and let him drop out. At that moment, there was only fear and self-blame in the depths of the young Buddha. As the oldest man in the family, he lived up to the hopes of all and failed the mother's hopes. He begged the teacher, begged the principal, and asked him to try again, but unfortunately he still failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a test paper in front of the old teacher and the principal. When he sat in the chair and picked up the pen, he began to have a stomachache and was accompanied by The desire to go to the bathroom. In the torment, those problems seem to have come alive, and they have been constantly changing on the test paper, so that he has another E. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, every time the exam is done, the Buddha is very nervous, perhaps because he wants to do something but loses his usual heart. Every exam is for him. It’s all suffering. Not only must weigh with the pain of the stomach and the urge to excrete, but also the illusion of inexplicable emergence. In the end, he still dropped out of school. When his mother stood outside the school gate and looked at him with a warm smile, the Buddha not only did not relieve himself, but felt the pain of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He failed the mother’s hopes, and lived up to the patience of his younger brother and sister who could not eat enough to hungry for his school. He failed the family and disappointed himself. I hate why I am nervous, and hate why the school can't give him more time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even now, he can’t forget what his mother said at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, learning doesn't mean everything. I believe that my Buddha will definitely be a great person. You are a man, and my mother believes I will wait for that day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha seems to be out of control. He forced the cigarette butt on the ground and then stepped on it. His eyes have also changed, as if they have been arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stepped forward to hug the Buddha and patted his back. "Yes, my brother, you are not the street punk." You are already a big man. Everyone is proud of you, your mother, your brothers and sisters, the whole street knows that you have done it. You change not only the fate of a family, but also a group. Man, the fate of a race!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the comfort of Doolin, the Buddha took a few deep breaths, his eyes became gentle, and he smiled and smiled. Shaking his head and flapping his cheek, "Sorry, thinking about things at that time is always uncontrollable. This may be the shadow of a life doctor's life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Psychologist?", Du Lin listened to the disdain of his face. "They sold the wheat flour as a piece of medicine and sold it to you. Then they told you that it didn't work at all." The curative effect is that you have to lie to yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha also stunned, "Really? Why don't I know?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the arms of Dudu, and they walked together toward the auditorium. "You certainly don't know, so I said that reading newspapers is good for you." What are you going to see all the TV shows besides smirking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha thought very seriously, "Happy!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening ceremony is very grand. Each semester Limocas Aristocratic School only accepts 100 students. As before, there are 20 classes in each grade, each There are only five students in the class, and no more than six students. Each class has at least six independent teachers responsible for their studies, and when necessary, organizes the children to receive more group education. In short, this is a school that can see the effect as long as it costs money. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the age of four to fourteen, there is a decade in which a child should not be studied, and then they will find that there are still ten years waiting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher, the teaching director, and the principal came to the stage and spoke on the stage. They all said very beautiful words. It’s just that people didn’t think that Vivian actually went to the stage to speak. And just in the fourth place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the teacher in charge of the presentation introduced the identity of Vivian, such as the daughter of the Governor, the heir to the great aristocracy, the outstanding feminist and active social activities After a series of names, people began to applaud enthusiastically, as if there was no silence before that, and there was no question about why a woman would be in the fourth place on the important day of the opening ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Vivian became very bright, and the whole person seemed to be shining. Her speech was very infectious, especially her constantly waving arm. Aggravated the weight of her speech. I can see that she likes such scenes very much. She likes to express her opinions in front of people and instill their thoughts in others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old governor said that he has not died yet. In the whole family, the only way to go is not his son or nephew, but this has always been Not a very eye-catching daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
