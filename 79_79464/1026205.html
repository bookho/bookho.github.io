			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s cold face suddenly appeared like a March spring breeze, he let go of his hand, the girl fell to the ground, while helping the girl Hair, while standing up, the girl stood up. "Hey, this is very simple, isn't it? Why do you have to make such a wolverine?" Du Linyi helped the girl to go to the sofa and sit down, then decisively from the girl. Two blades were pulled out from the thighs and shoulders. "Get some medicine and bandages, and prepare a dress for her by the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are mild Like a boyfriend who is in a warm love period, he carefully and thoughtfully helps the girl to deal with the wound, so that Angela, who has been shaking, suspects that this handsome but powerful young man is a neuropathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never dared to talk, waiting for Du Lin to help her get a wound and put on a bandage, curled up in the corner of the sofa and looked down, my heart was very sad . She feels that she doesn't have the family she loves for 16 years. She is willing to say something she shouldn't say in order to live for herself. It is very likely that her family will be taught by the gods. The soldiers killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tudio taught her a world that she once felt happy and fulfilled for 16 years, then personally broke the world and gave it back She has a new hope, a future that can be touched. But now, she personally ruined the future. She felt that she had betrayed her family and could not breathe. She felt that if she was a little brave, she might be able to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if she lost her, she will be very happy and happy in the days when she is not her. Even if she has given her own life, maybe she will be happy when she sees the happiness of her family in the Kingdom of Heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a picture of the sofa cushion around him, "Come, sit here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl Looking up at him, he quickly went down. She slowly moved to Doolin's side. She now fears Doolin more than the woman who shot her with a blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all Buddhas know, they may kill her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me the answer I need, I can give you what you want, this is the equivalent exchange, and I am a very honest businessman. "Du Lin took out his cigarette case. He felt that Angela would give himself some gains. "Do you want a cigarette?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl quickly glanced at the cigarette case and hesitated and nodded. Du Lin directly ordered one and gave it to her. The girl took a sip and coughed up. At the time of the Tusi religion, smoking is not allowed for both men and women. Because it takes a long time to develop a habit of smoking, it takes a certain amount of time to get rid of it. If it is necessary, it is not too late to learn after they have assigned the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all target people like the kittens around them to smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charles... is the great priest in the church, second only to the apostles and elders, who have a high status in the teaching. An elder was missing some time ago. The apostle said that he wanted to fill the vacancy. Charles wanted to go up one level, so he got a task.", said that the girl once again looked up and looked at Du Lin, who was listening carefully. "Take you into the teaching." The task is very difficult, and Charles feels that if he can do it, he will be appreciated by the apostle and let him fill the vacancy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I It’s just a means he uses. He hopes that I can persuade you to participate in an in-school activity next month. If you can, it’s best to let you... like me, so the chances of success are even greater.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The headquarters of the Tushen is in the Wagra Mountains, and there is a cave on the mountainside in the east, just inside the cave."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "Very good, this information is very valuable, you still know some What is his thing? For example, what is the purpose of the Tusiism to the present day, and what big people have joined the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angela shook his head quickly "I don't know much about it. I have been in the Holy Court College for many years. I haven't touched other things in the church. It was only since last month that it was because I was selected, so I only got a touch." Some common sense of living outside, other things I really don't know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the girl’s crying expression, Du Lin thinks that she is not really true. It is also impossible to be fake. He waved at Defoe. "Take her a bath, put the clothes on, and then close it in the attic on the third floor. When I figure out things, let me not let her out." He looked back at Angela. "Do you have anything to say about my arrangement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angela’s eyes suddenly widened and she lifted up I tried to grab Du Lin’s arm, but I didn’t dare to put it back. “Just... just didn’t you say the equivalent exchange? Can you save my family? Charles may be because of mine. Betrayal kills them... please, no matter what you let me do, just ask you to save them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Angela told Doolin what happened to her, and Du Lin nodded after listening to the calm face. "I promised that things will always be effective, tell me their names and addresses, if you have not been cheated If you are ten days later, you will be able to see them here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s answer made Angela’s whole person there, like the soul. I left the body in an instant, leaving only an empty shell. She soon came alive, tears big and big from the eyelids, excited to organize any effective language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not a good person, nor a bad person, he is a person with a code of self-behavior. He will not pursue to shape himself into a good person for external factors, nor will he give up the correct three views because others evaluate himself. He is a person between good and bad. People who love him think that he is an angel. People who hate him regard him as a demon. As for who he is, Du Lin feels that he can follow his own ideas. To face this world, he is a satisfied person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next evening, Doolin went to Henry’s suburban estate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a private estate is a very face-saving thing in an economically developed area. After all, the estate often represents identity and status, but has a manor in the west. I can't make myself look great because the Westerners call the estate a "farm." This group of very realistic people will not pay attention to how many gardens to build a house on this worthless land. They are more concerned about what can be eaten at night, or where they can make money to improve. Let's live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening's cold meal is very small, and Du Lin has only 11 people in total, but these people have great prestige in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First as the owner of Henry is a very famous person, just the second son of the steel tycoon is enough to make him famous in the west, because his life, but also because He has been at a disadvantage in the fight against the West Mine. In addition to this, there is Sandra, a woman who is like a snake in the eyes of the westerners, Mr. Clarence of the Jindis Mining Group, and other representatives in the west of large group companies. These people serve different group companies or consortia, but they all have the same characteristics in the west, that is, they have been pressed by the West Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the West Mine on the western mining industry is unquestionable. Even if the Orvili Group wants to get some ore and metal ingots, they need to use the blood to wash the mining area and then buy it. Obtaining the way to operate by yourself, it can be seen that the dominance of the Western Mining Association is definitely not just that simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
