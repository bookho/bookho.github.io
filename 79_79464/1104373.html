			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from the valley, Doolin let Savi with some people at the exit of the warehouse area, let Dufo bring some people, including Some standard weapons are hidden in the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When choosing this manor, the main reason was that the manor looked more like a small castle, square and square with four corners There is a very simple atmosphere. It is said that the owner of this manor is not an empire or a federal designer. It is from the west side of the mainland. Naturally, the style is also biased towards the western continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that the main body of this manor building will not be easily broken, Doolin also slightly modified some places, such as outside the manor. Some traps, the walls of the main part of the manor building are thickened, and even the inside is paved with measures such as steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a change, it is necessary to race against time. From the master bedroom or the study to the evacuation position, it takes at least one and a half minutes. If even a half-and-a-half of the resistance can't be done without the defense system of the entire manor, Du Lin's end can be imagined, then this is a journey of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you talk to them, why should you arrange these backhands?", all of them are in the hands of a group of gunmen who have just arrived from the secret road. I saw the figure of Kina. This time, it was mixed with Savy to help Dulin's people train the militarized content about the use of sniper rifles. After they graduated from the Navy, they did not relax their demands. Du Lin got them a security company in the west. They are employed security guards. They can hire them to guarantee their employers if they have money. Security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the secret has been undergoing strict militarization training, and Du Lin also invited two retired naval officers to take charge of part of the training, such as organized The arming details of the storm and defensive battles. If these things are not military personnel, it is difficult to give a relatively reasonable training program, at least not so rigorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shakes his head and laughs with each other and can really be called a warrior. "If this plan fails, I can Living away, the current pattern of the Federation will not produce any change, they need a living loser to appear in front of people, and try to put pressure on the empire to make me not happy. Even I may need to flee overseas. Magus will certainly trade for some political reasons, and will arrest me at the moment I return to China. Sometimes there is no evidence at all, especially when it comes to serving some large political transactions. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, people will see a failed Doolin, and the purpose of the federation will be reached. Anyone who challenges the federation will not succeed, and then humble and humble lives in an environment that is not as good as death. This is for all attempts. Challenge the best warnings of the latecomers of the Federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo asked again, "So successful?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Success?", Du Lin walked toward the hall and said while walking, "Once the country is successfully built, the first person to be killed by the new consortium is me!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the founding of the national family, they must let me close my mouth forever to conceal them from subverting the existing political environment of the country with me, they will not let them The people know that it is their rulers who unite with outsiders, in order to stabilize their power, to smash the attempt to challenge their own domestic forces, and to redistribute the solidified classes for the redistribution of social resources, the country has suffered the most serious financial disaster. They are more It will be known that these rulers are also involved in this looting action, putting the money belonging to the people into their pockets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Once there is clear evidence to prove this, there will inevitably be a turmoil that will affect the entire territory, and even a civil war. So in order to make these dirty things not known to the public, all insiders must shut up forever. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddhas feel that they are still stupid, and the world of smart people is really too complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, Savi stood up immediately and shouted a happy brother. This title is his unique way of calling Doolin, the little guy used to Helped Du Lin very busy, he should have his own privileges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down and say.", Du Lin raised his hand and sat down on the sofa, with a structure diagram of the manor on the coffee table, Du Linlai Before Savey was discussing with another young man to arrange defense forces, Du Lin’s request was to resist at least three minutes. This requirement is honestly a bit "excessive" and they are working on a defense plan. Many ordinary people may feel that resistance is an easy task, but the results of this action by Doolin are destructive to the Federation. In addition to other things, the federal side may not just dispatch the police to arrest him. So simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very likely that the army will be dispatched directly, using heavy weapons, because their purpose is to let Du Lin shut up, they only need a body, not let him Or what to say in front of the federal. Once a heavy weapon is added and the opponent's goal is to kill him, it is extremely difficult to resist three minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
