			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Doolin received several guests, the charity auction began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time because Du Lin invited the church as a preparatory co-organizer, they provided a lot of valuable auction items for this auction. The church may be one of the most well-preserved forces in the world for the preservation of things like antiques. Even now, some historians want to inquire about the more detailed historical data before the break, they must go to the church headquarters in the sunset city, where there are still a number of relatively complete handwritten, the history of the history is more than the outside world The complete countless times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only these booklets, but also some antique artifacts, many of which are fine, have a church substrate, at least the auction items will not be The picky person looks flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people think that charity auctions are just cheating, and some may have some meaning, such as a sock worn by a historical celebrity or a famous name. The things that Mr. Jiao’s used by the ancient empresses were auctioned out, but these things don’t have any practical value, and the final donation will not make everyone feel that this is truly spontaneous charity. It is more like a trick to use the scorpion of charity to rob social celebrities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they can’t hide, the higher the level of society, the more attention and focus on charity. It’s not all high-level people who are enthusiastic about doing good things, purely because comments like “willing to donate, enthusiasm for charity” appear in court, appear in front of the jury, those who do not have advanced degrees and knowledge reserves, live in society. The jury members at the bottom will have a good feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be help from the "defendant", even if the help they received many years ago was not from the gentleman’s pocket, but He also helped a lot of people who need help like themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem like a naive or even impossible message, but in fact it works, in several famous cases, really The words "charity" were used to incite a number of jury decisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who is willing to do good is definitely not a bad person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a social consensus, and the amount of charitable donations can be taxed to a certain extent, so why not donate taxes that should have been handed over to the empire? Going out for a good reputation and an insurance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people came almost the same time, the charity auction officially began. This is a unique auction, because there is no quiet auction hall, it is open air, but there is an inexplicable atmosphere spreading. The wonderful atmosphere of nature and the symbol of pure white gauze have inspired some people's enthusiasm, so that from the auction of the first hot spot, each piece of the subject must be auctioned through several rounds before being taken. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next auction is a very special product...", the young auctioneer who worked with Doolin was waving and waving on the stage. In the little girl in the middle, Du Lin’s attention is on the person around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry, this guy didn’t know where to mix an invitation, ran in, and sat next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is a bit low at this time, not as arrogant as he used to be. In the past many years, he has always been "the successor of Magus" and the "new party." The identity of the next leader is active in the social and political arena. With these two halos in the body, everyone will look at him high. Sudden changes can make Harry's embarrassing political life suddenly sway, and while some people feel pity, more people are gloating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more happier than watching a political star suddenly collapse, even if there are many people inside the New Party who are watching Harry’s jokes all day long. Think of yourself as the next prime minister, the leader of the new party, and the realm of talking all day long. This is a terrible fall, and it is comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need a little help...", Harry whispered and whispered to Du Lin. "The committee lowered my rating and there was no new to me." The arrangement may have to refrigerate me for a while. I don't want to waste my best time on my own sentiment, I have to find something to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Du Lin watched him not speak, Harry looked away from his knees. "In return, I will try my best to help you get the most advantage in the campaign. I have been the governor after all, and I know more about it than you." More, you should believe me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you need me to order for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Harry was silent for a moment, it seems that it is difficult to talk about it, but if he feels that his life is tainted or shameful than the current problem, he must also say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good situation is because some small things have been destroyed, and the family’s support for him has been reduced to a minimum. During this time, he has been looking for Magus. Magus has not promised anything to him. Instead, let him rest for a few years and let him He enriched himself. He knows very well that he has been abandoned by Magus. If he can't find a new backer to take him out, his political life is very likely to end, so this is his last chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep breath took a sigh of relief on his chest, he said his request, "In return, I hope to give me a position in the state government." , Assistant Governor, or Secretary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin brows and loosens, "Would you like to participate in the next mid-term election?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..., yes." Harry was a little surprised at Dulin’s sensitivity. He participated in the midterm election as assistant governor or secretary and then became the mayor. Many assistants and secretaries. The best way to embark on the political stage, they have a higher level of experience in the administration, and they are very familiar with the cities in the state. They have good innate conditions, as long as Doolin does not openly oppose him, even if If you don't support it, he has a way to start his political career again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of friends behind every big aristocrat who are interested in all kinds of investments, including political investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out a cigarette and took his arm for a moment. "I can't promise you now, you know that some things are not what we want." How to do it, this matter needs to go through the Prime Minister’s nod.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is somewhat disappointed, in his impression Du Lin has always been the kind of courage Those who break the rules, he rarely surrenders to the rules set by others, but are willing to abide by the rules they have set, but at this moment he has become honest, which makes Harry feel as if he has been targeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "Well, call me as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin clicked. "I will contact you as soon as I have the exact information. Also, don't forget the money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of money Harry’s face became ugly again, and his campaign funds were temporarily frozen after he was dismissed. If he is determined to continue to run for the prime minister’s prime minister, the money can still be activated. The problem is that if he can't win the election, he will lose the money, and even the governor's position will be gone. Those capitalists who took him to the sky on weekdays will be able to swallow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this money cannot be moved for the time being, and it will freeze if it is temporarily frozen. The problem is that Harry still owes a lot of money to Doolin. If he can't get back, the family can't take the money for return. His personal debt. The bigger the family rules, the stricter and stricter it is. Du Lin’s last sentence is really smashing his death. When he asked Du Lin to borrow the money, the New Party Committee had not revealed his intention to dispose of him. He felt that if he had to go through this difficult stage, it would be too simple to get the money out, even if it was Without a prime minister or as his governor, a local policy would be enough to get him to get more money from the capitalists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep look at Du Lin and grinned his head. "I won't forget it." After that, he got up and bent. Was away from Doolin's side, and now he is not suitable for excessive exposure in public. This invitation is also an invitation from the elders to a small aristocrat who has interests with the family. letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Harry left, Doolin turned his attention to the auction, and he began to look at the auction carefully and flipped it. The album, this is a collection from the church, it is said to be the belongings of the Pope Rossi, a statue of the Father, with all kinds of magical powers... Of course, these are unverifiable, because No function has been confirmed so far, most of which are recorded in the handwritten notes of the church, such as what is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, such a valuable thing should not be auctioned out. In fact, the people here, except those of the church, have no real Learn about this stuff. This small-armed statue has always been an unspeakable taboo. People in the early church found a secret by sorting out past documentary material. The statue looks like this and the Pope Rossi’s own description is extremely similar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some records record that Pope Rossi is the apostle of God, the embodiment of God walking in the world, but the problem is that no one has a clear view of God. The description, then why is the Rossi Church so similar to the gods they believe in? Some senior clergy believe that this may have hidden an unknown history and has an amazing inside story. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Orthodox Church overthrew the other sects in the church, the lord of Heaven is the true God, and the "successor" recognized by the Father The comprehensive replacement of the Lord of Light, who is dominated by the Pope's appearance, is the church of the Lord of Heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
