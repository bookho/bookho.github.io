			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering it for a while, Du Lin nodded. After all, this is the first time in two years that Dove has asked for it, no matter what the reason, he Not very suitable for rejection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the vaccination of the fight is still to be played, otherwise it really appears to be a change, and whose face is not good, "I need to remind you." Once I think your brother has done something that harms me and everyone's interests, depending on the severity of the disorder, I will consider driving him away, or...", Doolin laughed, he shrugged his shoulders "I have to be responsible for everyone. I need to take care of the interests of most people when necessary. Can I understand that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff this time Only when Du Lin came out with his positive titles, there were a lot of fearful and fearful identities. In the agent meeting held in Du Lin in the first half of the year, she watched Du Lin with a living person, and then loaded it into the oil drum and threw it into a garbage truck and transported it to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that life has made Dove’s wrong estimate, or forgetting Dulin’s identity with darkness and tyranny, she’s not allowed to start My brother is worried. Because she knew that Du Lin did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once her brother did something stupid, it was very likely that Du Lin would be disposed of... and she immediately wanted to let her brother go home and continue Mixed eating and waiting for death, what can I do just now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a discoloration on her face. After a while, I bite my teeth and waited for him to arrange the most tiring work for him. The younger brother who likes it has not suffered at home. All the chore is done by her and her brother. This kid must not persist, and will take the initiative to send him back. Maybe it may be blamed by parents, but losing a job that looks good is better than losing a living life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when Doolin thought about Merlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dove thought about her brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a steam locomotive, two young men sat together and there was a girl across from them. The girl always looks out at the scenery that is constantly flying backwards outside the window. It seems that she does not care about the things inside the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the boys wanted to attract the girl's attention more than once, but unfortunately it failed. He could only divert everyone's attention. He said to strangers around him: "I will give you a magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same young guy looked at him like a fool, and when he saw him feel awkward again, he laughed a few times and bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn seat number, he complained, there is no shipping from Irian to Otis, otherwise he will definitely not choose to be a steam locomotive so slow And uncomfortable transportation, not only can not directly reach the city of Otis, but also must transfer, wasted a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the ticket and looked at it. The ticket said that there was a 16-hour drive, calculated according to the current time, and waited until the city of Otis. I don't know if my sister is doing a good job at reception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly noticed that the temporary companion’s eyes were concentrated on the ticket in his hand. He raised the ticket and asked with a puzzled question, “You also Go to Otis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man hesitated, then nodded and said a "yes" after a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow young people to find a topic, at least the journey will not be so boring, he seems to notice that the opposite girl also took his eyes back, so Enthusiastically asked, "Are you also going to Otis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl nodded, which made him very encouraged, "Our luck Yes, hey, the three of us who are going to Otis are sitting in a carriage, and more importantly, sitting in the same deck. What is this? This is the arrangement of God!", he is not the mouth It’s true that there are such people. The three young people gathered together in the north of the country are riding the same train in the vast sea of ​​people. What is even more wonderful is that they are still in the same deck. Perhaps this is really Some guidance from God is also uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man around him leaned back and glanced back at the "Go to Otis City" written on the carriage, and then regained his gaze, he felt like this The guy is a bit stupid, not so wanting to talk to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Buck, I am very glad to meet you!", his smile is very infectious, but the two people next to him do not seem to be infected by him. His smile gradually became a bit sloppy, and he smiled and asked: "Don't you introduce yourself? It's very rude, you know?!" His voice gradually rises. He swears that this is the most frequent time in his life in a short period of time, and he has never been smashed like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl nodded. "I know, you are Buck." Then she looked at another young man. Buck kept screaming in his heart. The girl is really superficial, only pay attention to those good-looking guys, not at all. Care about the inner and the connotation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also looked at the guy around him and pointed himself to himself: "Hey, I introduced myself, it’s up to you, you are the next one!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked at the opposite girl and said blankly: "Next!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The girl suddenly couldn’t help but laugh. Buck was a little crazy. Before he tried his best, he didn’t attract the attention of the girl. But the bastard around said the next one and actually laughed at the girl. Is it that he has been away from the world for too long, or are these two people teasing him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man, listen to me, I introduced you to me just now, right?", he began to seriously take care of this relationship, young people and girls. They all nodded, and Buck was a little relieved. Then he patted the shoulders of his temporary companion and suddenly felt the strength of the tight muscles. He took the handles off the shoulders of the opponent. "So is it your turn now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man hesitated and nodded, "Merlin, next!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Merlin has traveled far away. Before leaving the "prosperous" metropolis of Turner, he asked Mason what he needs to pay attention to when he goes to Dulin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason told him to talk to strangers as little as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is for Meilin’s thoughts. If Du Lin’s guy asked this, he would definitely say, “You are less likely to pay attention to others!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin has hardly communicated with others on the way. If it wasn’t for the guy named Buck, it’s too interesting. He actually didn’t want to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is very happy, "Alisa!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short embarrassing atmosphere has finally passed. Buck thanked God in his heart. It must have been that his old man had heard his prayer and answered himself. He had the opportunity to sit in the church and sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck continued to "can talk." He pretended to be very sophisticated. "Do you know? I went to Otis to trust my sister. My sister is now following a great big man. The big man is missing some people, so I I have to help him. To be honest, I didn't want to leave my hometown to go to a distant place. Maybe the big man knew that I was very capable from other places, so please my sister asked me to go to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s very deep-seated and extraordinarily serious: “Sometimes it’s not a good thing to be too big, I think it’s good to be mediocre.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what about you? Are you going to travel to Otis to travel? Or go home to visit relatives?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck knew that if he asked the girl directly, the girl might not say it, so he asked the young man named Merlin, and when he said that the girl named Alisa would definitely say Because everyone said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin hesitated again, and he remembered that Mason told him something about the future, such as not saying his purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Buck looked at Merlin, Merlin seemed to be driving for more than a dozen seconds, and Buck once again felt that something called cockroaches began to spread. He hates this feeling, his expression is a bit stiff and he licks Merlin with his elbow. "Hey, what are you doing there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin is coming back Looked at the girl, "Next!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisaton laughed happily, but she didn't want to laugh at all. She hasn't laughed for a long time since her child was taken away. If Mr. Bain didn't have a way to get back to her child, she would definitely not go see the bastard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, she actually laughed on the train, and it was the kind of sudden, unpredictable puncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck suddenly has a feeling that he may be in the wrong position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, if you can hear me, please save me, I can't stand it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
