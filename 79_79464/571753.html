			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words spilled over the entire block like a downpour, and more and more adults came over and they continued to ask people around them. What did Du Lin say just now, why everyone is so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a self-righteous big man who said this sentence, "Only the poor love to watch the fun, because our time is invaluable." He must have forgotten a few words when he said this. Perhaps he has mastered the so-called "95 percent of wealth", but all this is laid out in 95% of the people who are willing to be On the basis of his exploitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people provide a good life for a few people, raise their social status, let them enjoy a prosperous life, and give them unlimited power . But if one day these 95% of the poor are not willing to raise him, what else can he still have? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin never thought that the poor Guar people would be the burden of his struggle and development. On the contrary, these people might be building his dynasty. The strongest cornerstone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have promised..." Du Lin opened his mouth, and some people were noisy, like the ebb and flow of the crowd, quietly, except for the children on the street. In addition to the occasional laughter, only Du Lin’s voice is, “The parents of every member of the fellowship are my parents, we should be a family, and all the Guarts should be a family. God gives With the blood of our King Odello, we should be closely united and send out our own anger for all enemies who dare to discriminate against us, threaten us, and treat us harshly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The blood of King Adelrero is still rushing in our bodies, the will of the king has never been extinguished, even if our country has been indulged, but the children of Odello will never surrender to fate. Play with it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odello is the first emperor of the Guardian dynasty, an emperor full of personality charm. He is not just an emperor, but a great thinker, a great artist, a great politician, and a great king of people. This history can be traced back more than a thousand years ago. The once powerful dynasty almost ruled the whole world, so all the Guartes would proudly call themselves the descendants of King Odello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words have once again triggered a violent response, and the guars who have been treated differently feel that there is an indescribable heat flow that rushes to the top of the head. What is being saved, they are constantly rushing forward spontaneously, wanting to get closer to some of the young people who speak. In their minds, they remembered the "King's Poem", which is of high status in the Guars. There is such a paragraph:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the sun and accepted the blessing of the sun god. The eyes of the people fell on him and crowned him with his crown. Every word of hiss is like being ignited by fire. People are willing to fight for him, die for him, be sacred for him... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone may ask me, do you want to reinstate these words?", Du Lin shook his lips and closed his head, stressed The squeezing lips lost their blood, slightly pale, but it further showed his imposing manner and majesty. "I never thought about using other people's lives to go through war, go for me, or individually. What do several people do? What I want is not to reinstate the country. What I want to fight for is just justice, equality, and respect that should belong to us in this society, but deprived of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not willing, I am suffering, I am angry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I walked on the streets, those Ogings, the provincial sages When my eyes fell on me, I didn't want to live. I am the son of the great King Odello. We have conquered the whole world. We should be respected, but we don't." Then someone sent a stool. He was placed next to Du Lin. He looked at the man and the man nodded hard, Du Lin. He is standing on the stool, so that everyone can see him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his fist and shouted loudly. "No one respects us, only ridicule, sarcasm, irony! Whose fault is this? It is Ogildin." Is it wrong? Because the Yaoxing Empire defeated us, so we lost these things. Should we blame them?” Du Lin waved his arm. “No! This is not the Ogildin’s fault, not Yao. The mistake of the Star Empire is that we are wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone threw the rice bowl for feeding the dog in front of us, and some of us fell down. Just like a dog eating food from their alms in the rice bowl, how can they be treated equally, how can we respect us?”, Du Lin’s sharp eyes glanced around the guar like a sword. Special people, many people are ashamed to bow their heads. Isn’t he talking about the fact that it is happening and continuing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are poor, willing to be poor, willing to receive relief food, willing to indulge in such an environment. They squatted on the ground, kneeling beside the dog pot, screaming like a dog when they didn't get it, shaking their heads when they got it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin regained his gaze and continued to shout: "There is a problem, someone may have asked you, I am here today to ask you the same content,' Do you want to be happy?? This is the slogan of the church pastors who confuse ordinary people into the church. It has also been published in the most authoritative magazine of the Empire. Many people were attracted by this slogan and entered the church and became a cult. When Du Lin said this sentence, many people couldn't help but nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
