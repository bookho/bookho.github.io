			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think...", Buddha is a little helpless and squeezes a smile. "It is definitely a wrong decision to send him over!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows very well what Vivienne wants his child to become. It is a realm that Buddha has never achieved. He needs to be like a perfect gentleman. Be polite, talkative and humorous, no matter where you are, you can maintain your own demeanor, not a child whose face is covered with mud and bare feet in the countryside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but..., looking at the happy smile on his son’s face that has never been revealed, maybe Du Lin is right, he can’t give his child too More help, then when this child needs to enjoy the innocence and childhood happiness, give it all to him and give him happy power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that there is a lot of buddhism here. Of course, he still doesn’t know that the children and the faces are burdocks, otherwise they may not think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why Du Lin can know at a glance that those things are calves, because he is very familiar, as to why familiarity is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few young people behind the children. Although they are chasing, they are not fierce, not serious, and their faces are more of a kind. Helpless, their pursuit is more like a helpless and powerless "crack". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two approached a little, Fred, who was running wild, suddenly stopped, his happy expression remained on his face, his eyes suddenly became somewhat He was confused and he saw the Buddha. As soon as I thought of myself, the feeling of "cracking" spread quickly in his body, and he turned his head down uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two children looked back at Fred and looked at the two people who came closer. After a glance at them, they quickly ran home. While running, yelling, "The bastard is coming back, the bastard is coming back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no smile on the face, and the Buddha laughs out loud. Laughing forward and backward, he looked at Du Lin and said with a smile, "I think they may be talking about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin ordered a cigarette He was so eager to know why he became a bastard, and then discussed with two children, how to respect their father as a child, of course, Mr. Kemma taught him a lot of things, such as whip, Sticks, belts and even shoes, in short, as long as you want to swear, you can see the perfect equipment everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people who are chasing a few children have also stopped. As far as watching, Du Lin walked over and asked, "Why should you chase them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Some young people are somewhat uncertain and ask, "You are Doolin?", Doolin nodded, and then the young people turned around and left, leaving only the inexplicable Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have forgotten that when he was a child, the three brothers were not a good thing. Mason sneaked around other people’s bread and often fought with others. Merlin peeked at the widow’s bath every day. Du Lin is a small, masculine bastard. No matter what his two brothers do, they will have one. People say that Mason and Merlin are clearly bad, and only Du Lin is boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stone in the farmland of Mr. Zema, the stone is always blown a few meters by the wind. In countless battles, the three brothers have become synonymous with terrible, Ray The children of the family are not nearby, and they dare not face Du Lin alone. They were just chasing Du Lin’s son. What if Du Lin knew the truth and beat them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrugged and walked slowly toward his home. Every time he returned, he always felt that time had become much slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side went to Fred’s body and fell down. He asked the child to look up at him. He hadn’t said anything, Fred. I apologize first and say sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have liked to talk about Fred’s Dudu suddenly like being acupunctured, and some twitching pain inside, he didn’t know How Vivienne teaches children, but obviously this kind of education is wrong. He should not apologize. It is Vivian who needs to apologize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at me...", all of them rushed out of the handkerchief and began to clean up the burdock on Fred’s face, while wiping, and asked. "Why apologize to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred’s eyes were a bit timid, his head went down again, "because I didn't keep my instrument, I got a whole... cow dung."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s face looked ugly and glanced at his hand with a pale green stain, and there was still some hidden inside. After completely digesting the grass roots, he greeted the two little bastards of Du Lin’s family and took a deep breath and threw the handkerchief on the floor. Then he said, “You should not apologize because you have not done anything wrong!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred suddenly looked up and looked at the Buddha with an unbelievable look. All Buddha smiled and licked the child's soft hair. "Everyone should have a happy, no sad childhood. I heard that sentence." "Children and joy are the power of children." No matter what you do, as long as you don't hurt others and you do something that makes you happy, then you don't need to apologize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred doesn’t know how to tell if the Buddha’s words are right, he hesitated, “but mother, she...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is not here!", they all stood up, some disgusted but still biting their teeth and holding up the child's hand full of calves, walking toward Du Lin's house, "at least in me Here, you should be happy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Buddha will know why these three children are all cow dung, Mr. Knoxma, that is bigger. The child raised a new idea this morning, to feed the cattle of others to eat laxatives, and then to put these cows Ding eyes plug to see if they can by virtue of their ability to pull out ...... feces. Well, this is a story full of taste. The Buddha who knows the truth almost didn't hold out the laughter. He just warned Fred, don't participate in dangerous games, and the other doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just saw Mr. Xerma when he got to the door of his house. Mr. Xerma’s mouth was hung with a pipe that didn’t know how many years he used. Du Lin After sending some cigarettes back, Mr. Kemma gave up a few and then gave up. He still used to the tobacco leaves and taste he planted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he stood on the steps and glanced at Doolin, and snorted, "You still know to come back."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two little bastards are hiding behind Mr. Xmas, one person holding a leg, curiously watching Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa wears the clothes that the peasant women often wear, wearing a headscarf, holding a basket of grass in their hands, relying on the corridor outside the door. Next to the doorpost, watching Du Lin with a smile, the younger brothers and sisters also ran out in one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, and said hello, then looked at Mr. Kesma, "Why do they call me a bastard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you are a jerk, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
