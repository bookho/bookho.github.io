			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, Mrs. Vivian did not let these two unscrupulous guys help. If Peter really disappeared, the first one to be shocked must be the Governor’s Knowing what kind of experience Peter has, and what kind of resume he has, the most vivid mark on him is "the son-in-law of the Governor." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor can even attack the old party, taking the opportunity to take over the actual control of the city of Tener, prompting the tearing of the iron curtain of the old party in Cannes . At that time, the Governor’s original physical condition was already very poor, and I am afraid it will become even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether the Governor has cared about Mrs. Vivian’s life, and whether Mrs. Vivian’s has been reluctant to go back, no matter between the two What kind of contradiction, they are both father and daughter. In front of the big and the big problem, you don't need anyone to remind you, you know how to protect the interests of your loved ones. Because safeguarding the interests of their loved ones is to safeguard their own interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left, he didn’t ask about his son. Du Lin asked why he didn’t mention it. He said that this time is not appropriate. Mrs. Vivian has decided to divorce Peter. If this time he is thinking about taking her son, it is definitely a devastating blow to her. Don't look at Mrs. Vivian's feelings with Peter for many years, but marriage is marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t matter what you say, even a terrible marriage for women is a sacred and solemn thing. Peter has personally ruined her marriage. She is now going to make a knife for herself. If she loses her son, she may collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donlin didn’t make any comment on this. They and Mrs. Vivian’s dinner together after the last bus, returned to the purple town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment I got off the bus, Du Lin felt an unprecedented ease. The smell of cow dung in the air blends with the flourishing crops that exude the scent of plants. I don't know why, when the wind blows over the night, the whole person seems to have relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that Dudu came to Dulin’s hometown, but it was definitely the first time he entered the town. He stayed outside for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town was still the same as when Du Lin left, and he couldn't see much change. When he walked into the settlement, many people looked at him with a different look. Ziwei Town is not a famous town. There is no deep historical background, and no tourists will come here to play. And this is not a good place to produce food, time is not right, so it is even less likely that someone will come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, in the most unlikely time, there are two guys who have a lot of money to look at in the eyes of everyone, they are curious to look at These two people, until Du Lin raised his hand and cheered everyone, these people realized that this is the third child of Mr. Ke Ma, he is back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Mr. Kesma is now a very famous person in the town. It is said that his eldest son Mason is already a thing in the city of Tener. The head of the police branch, that is, the policeman who is even better than the sheriff of Johnson, and dozens of police officers under his hand obeyed his orders. The third child of his family didn't know what he was doing. He drove the car when he came back last time, and he didn't come back afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that he had made a fortune, went somewhere else, and some people said that he was not good at mixing, so no face came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, as long as you talk about these two people, you will definitely be involved in the Xerma family. If there are children who are too naughty, they will take Du Lin. Doing their negative textbooks, and finally have no face back. At the same time, they will also take Mason as a positive role model. If you work honestly and diligently, you will not be able to set up a job in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good name for the Xemma family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the buzz grows louder, the residents who have eaten dinner and gathered outside the door at this time are crowded, just like what is new. . There was another guy carrying a scorpion and holding a piece of cow dung in his hand. He ran over and shouted loudly with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also responded with a smile. The guy is the next door next door to his house next door. His father is Layton. There are only two children in the family. A strong. When I was a teenager, I was able to walk with a half-and-a-large cow. Some people chewed their ears behind them, saying that Layton’s wife was actually smashed by the dragon, so they gave birth to two great strengths. Endless half dragon people. As for their lack of scales and tails, they may have been cruelly cut off by their parents when they were born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in fact, this is the big people used to lie to children, the purpose is to tell them, if you want to find someone to fight, don't look for the children of Layton's family, the two bastards are not people at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is it coming back?", the leader of the Layton family is called Kina, who is pushing people behind himself like walking in the lake. Then scratched his head, "Did you eat at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufoy noticed that this guy’s hand was cow dung, some slimy when he scratched his head The earth green also stuck to his head with a block of grass roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have noticed the Buddha’s gaze, and Kira touched the burdock on the head and took a piece in his hand. After a moment, I have a very good experience and said with a trace of pride: "This is a calf, digestion is not very good. If it is an old cow, there will be no such a straw!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have he always been like this?", Du Buddha asked with a whisper in his face, "I think he is...", he did a little regret It is a direct statement that this kid has a problem with his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at Du Lin with a funny smile. If he pointed out, he replied: "You can't beat him, you can't do three!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Du Lin walked in kindly, hugged with Ginna, and did not care about the cow dung that fell on him. He patted Kina’s arm. To the Buddha said: "My brothers, I have been fighting with this bastard since I was a child, but I have never won. What is even more irritating is that he also told me that Uncle Layton said that he is not allowed to use force, otherwise he will go home and smoke. "He is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin finished this sentence, the people around him laughed happily, and the strange feeling in Du Lin The self-deprecation disappeared without a trace. They all can clearly feel that the little bastard Du Lin is back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin greeted the residents around him while walking towards his home. I have lived here for more than ten years. It is better to say that I am a neighbor. It took him almost twenty minutes to get outside his home. At this time, Mr. Kesma was standing on the steps. He glanced at Du Lin. The pipe in his mouth shook twice, and there was a thick smoke. Sprayed out of his nostrils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you come back, remember to inform me, I don't like any surprises!" After that, Mr. Kesma walked into the door with his hands on his back. Then, if there is a welcome voice, "Welcome home, bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the Buddha to the steps, then turned around and waved at everyone to enter the door. After entering the door, Buddha said with a smile, you have a good relationship with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is because the Buddha is very strange to this place, so any feelings and emotions will be zoomed in quickly. In Du Lin’s point of view, in fact, both Buddha and Tener The neighbors on the street have a good relationship and can talk and laugh. If anyone has a problem with life, others can also relieve it. Although there are not many things, it is enough for everyone to get together to make it difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting down at home, Du Lin introduced the Buddha to Mr. Xerma, who is still the stereotyped, gently I nodded, even if I knew it. Doolin understood Mr. Kemma's character and temper, and he also said this to Dudu on the way back. Not long after, the family appeared one by one, including Mr. Xiaoxma sleeping in the basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Dolin has seen his child. He once heard someone say that when his eyes are on his child’s eyes, I feel the feeling of connecting blood, just like my own life has been pinned. Sure enough, these rumors were artistically processed. He didn't realize the mysterious feeling. He only thought this guy was a bit ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man is the spirit of all things, and is ultimately one of the animals, but people and other animals have a little different place. Other animals will be very cute when they are born, but human beings are not the same thing, not only not cute, but also ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching a few eyes, Du Lin regained his gaze. He took out a box of cigarettes and held one without holding it in his mouth. Mrs. Ma’s phrase “Getting out of the pump” almost scared and fell to the ground. When he got up, he glanced at Mr. Kemma, who also ran out with a pipe, and the father and son had something to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That letter, what happened?" Du Lin was on the guardrail and looked at the quiet and peaceful town. "Do you have anything?" I am?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma thought for a while before remembering that he sent a letter to Du Lin six months ago, his face suddenly blackened. "You just want to ask me now? Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't, don't misunderstand, it was received a few days ago. The person at the post office said that it was wrong. The place, the recent mailbox has no one to use, when it is ready to be removed, it is found that there is still a letter inside, and then sent it.", Du Lin looked sincere, "Hey, I received the first time of the letter." Just rushed back, don't you think I am slowing down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
