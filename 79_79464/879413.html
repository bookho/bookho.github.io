			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in the city center, the frightened journalists are quickly igniting the spotlights to shoot the city’s downtown, it’s too scary, they even suspect If it is not a little far away, and the fear of these mobs in the hearts of reporters, the cameras in their hands may be snatched away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s face was standing in the empty city center, the column of smoke above it has not been extinguished, the shops are being smashed everywhere, and lying Innocent citizens who mourn on the ground. Du Lin snorted. "I feel my guilt as the mayor for everything that happened here. I will make up for the loss of everyone, free medical care, free reconstruction, and extra compensation. I promise that this It’s definitely the last time!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, some reporters suddenly realized that this was also a news, and suddenly surrounded me to surround Du Lin’s waters. Heite took the police. I have been vigilant against these reporters and kept them a certain distance from Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mayor, what do you think about this parade?", a female reporter continually squeezing inwards, her hands holding pens and books, high Lifting on the head. Dooling didn't know if she really could record what she heard without looking at it, but it didn't prevent him from expressing his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are wrong, madam, this is not a parade, but a riot!", Du Lin's first sentence made the reporters a little quieter, he The surrounding rustling sounded immediately. "The empire gave all citizens the power to declare their rights through the procession, but one thing, the parade must ensure safety, the safety of the demonstrators and the safety of other onlookers." To both sides, smirked and said: "Hey, is this a safe place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tipped up and slammed, the blood on the ground splashed On his trousers, he also made a sound of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is not a procession, it is a riot. They exercise the purpose of riots in the name of a procession, this is a crime!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female reporter is full of red, she likes this young mayor very much, because he said the news that the entire imperial citizen wants to see tomorrow morning, she quickly followed and wanted to continue to ask questions, but was A young reporter was behind him, and the young reporter asked his question. "Mr. Mayor, who do you think should be responsible for this riot? Is it you, or a workers' union that organizes the parade?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor looked at the reporter and frowned. "This question is very good. It is well known that there was a general strike today. It was personally initiated by the Workers’ Union Branch President Buju, and it is said that it also involved the president of the Federation of Trade Unions. They Not only did the strike, but also submitted a marching application, which is still in my office. It is well known that workers’ unions have caused huge economic losses more than once through strikes and marches, but this is their power, I They were given in reply and stated in the reply that they must maintain order, be rational and be safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head slightly and his voice was slightly higher Some, "But you saw it, it is different from what they said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't deny the role of workers' unions in society, But if you ignore some problems because they are workers' unions, this is wrong. Today, right here, now, these problems have arisen, we should face this problem and the possible existence behind the problem. The deeper phenomenon, rather than the entanglement of who is responsible, simply relying on me to take responsibility, or the workers' union to take responsibility, can make up for the damage caused to the public and the empire brought about by what happened today?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "No, sir." He sighed. "No matter what kind of disposal is done at the workers' union, I will compensate these innocent citizens." The losses suffered, whether in property or in health."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is not a fool, Du Lin seems to be a grandiose but has already pushed responsibility I gave the workers' union and characterized this time as a "phenomenon". This is the rhythm of making things big. In addition, he took the initiative to propose compensation, apparently putting the workers' union in a very bad situation. The young reporter was very satisfied with Du Lin’s answer. He even thought about how to use the horrifying title tomorrow to attract the reader’s attention to his article. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another reporter who looked very calm and raised his own question. "Mr. Mayor, I have a place that I don’t quite understand when riots happen. When the army quickly cut into the city center, do you expect this? If you anticipate, why should you let the riots break out, instead of using soldiers to deter these people in advance, to avoid the turmoil caused by this riot? The necessary losses?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all journalists are neutral, and some journalists are pointing to the workers’ union, not to say they are hardcore supporters of workers’ unions. But the newspaper needs more exciting news to earn enough eyeballs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Du Lin knows that the riot will break out and prepare soldiers for repression in advance, then this is a conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the riots caused by the march, perhaps people are more likely to see the conspiracy and the ruthless government officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "This question is very interesting. If one day you go home and find that your wife is cheating with someone else, your wife accuses you. You know that she will be unfaithful, but she doesn’t stop her at the beginning, and thinks that all this is your conspiracy. What do you think?”, he didn’t give the reporter a time to refute, not so much around the crowd. I continued with the appropriate laughter. "When President Buchao handed me the application for their march, I did hear some rumors that they intended to give me a look!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not sure what kind of state of affairs will evolve into this parade, but in the attitude that I should do my duty as the mayor, I informed the Imperial Metropolitan Area and told them that there is a The parade. The reply from the warning area was to let me send the police to maintain order. But when I told them that the parade might involve tens of thousands or even more people, the warning area began to pay attention and sent soldiers. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "Gentlemen, please face up to the scale of this parade. It is a parade involving tens of thousands of people. I don't want to discredit the working class, but we should all understand that there will always be good people in this world. There will always be The bad guys. At the same time, I would like to ask a question. If there are many good people in this riot, why do you have problems after entering the relatively busy part of the city center?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A small group of people can't control the greed of desire, thinking that with the power of the collective, they can get through the customs. I heard that some people even slogan that 'the law will not punish most people', if those who participated in the parade themselves A sense of justice, why most people are involved in this riot? I can't control their thoughts, and I can't predict that there will be such a disaster. Everything is done according to the rules and regulations. If you read one Reading the imperial law should understand one thing. Before the time that harms urban security and the property and personal safety of the citizens occurs, the army is not allowed to enter the city. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; across from the reporter, Doolin understatement calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But outside the city, Bucho’s wandering in the mud pit on the side of the road escaped the army’s memorial. He didn’t seem to be moving around. Only climbed out of the mud pit. He knew that he was finished. There is no doubt that the Workers’ Union headquarters will never lend a helping hand to pull him. If they reach out, they will pull the trouble together. Therefore, they are more likely to condemn their actions and mistakes while trying to make up for the negative impact of this riot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
