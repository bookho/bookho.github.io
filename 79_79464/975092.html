			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the farmer want to see me?", Du Lin looked strangely at the door, and claimed to be a young man of the city hall staff, did not expect himself Not long after arriving in the west, the doorman reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not impossible to see a farmer now, but Du Lin has more to do. If you don’t choose the rest of the empire as your destination, except that those developed places have become the food of the capitalists, the whole class has already solidified, and it needs to fight against a large number of social vested interests. Unpredictable consequences. None of the politicians of the Imperial Capital, the nobles of the north, and the big capitalists of the South are provoked. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Doolin has tens of millions of liquidity and has a fellowship as a cuddly, he or she may not be able to work positively. Instead of wasting your money and strength to fight for an uncertain future, it's better to focus on the sparsely populated western region. The economy here is far less developed than other places, and the folk customs are also relatively embarrassing. Apart from a handful of capitalists, there is still a “simple” folk style – try not to go to a remote place after dark, people here will tell you the reality. How cruel it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So putting your destination in the west can effectively reduce competition, while suppressing the Kadima Party and trying to make this part of its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there is not much time for Doolin. He needs to turn the west around before the spring, let the people here know that there will be a huge change. So he didn't have time to meet the doorman. After seeing the doorman, he wanted to do something. It is estimated that there will be some trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that there is no trouble in not seeing the doormen. It is purely an exchange principle of initiative. When you meet the doorkeeper, Doolin will lose some potential Initiative, but not seeing him, then these potential initiatives are still in their own hands and can be thrown out as an excuse when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inform Du Lin’s staff that he is in his thirties, is not tall, is wearing a thick leather coat, and he will have his forehead when he has wide eyes. A few heads up, plus rough skin and cold eyes, look like a robber is more than a government worker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very sorry, I still have something important, so I can't go to see Mr. Mennon for the time being. You can help me convey my gratitude to Mr. Mennon's invitation. Tell him, I will meet him after the weather is warm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin decisively refused the invitation, but the messenger did not leave immediately. He was still standing outside the door. The open door opened the cold wind outside the door. The clothes in the room were all dressed. Not much, I have already felt the chill of erosion. He looked at Du Lin straight, and he didn't know much about Du Lin, but he knew Mennon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the Mennon wanted to set off a war to seize power in an "uprising" manner, but it was quickly suppressed by the Imperial Army. This time he made a comeback in another form to break into the core of the empire, and to achieve the highest power of the country through peaceful means to complete the coup d’état. In the west, people know a lot about the old history of the doormen. There are always some people who belong to the losers of this society. They are the ones who most hope that the doormen can succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only the doormen succeeded, they could get more benefits by relying on the doormen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the government staff member of the message is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Mr. Du Lin, maybe you have some narrow understanding of Mr. Mennon, Mr. Mennon’s influence in the west is very Big, and has won more than 70% of the entire state of the city, the next step is to run for the governor and there is a great possibility to sit in that position. For Mr. Mennon's goodwill, I personally think that you still accept better, this pair You, to me, to Mr. Mennon is a good thing, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Doolin, and Du Lin also met his gaze. After watching each other for a while, Du Lin’s expression became a little indifferent. He tilted his head slightly and played with a lighter in his hand. He smiled and asked, “I didn’t understand the mistake, are you threatening me?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Threats?", the man bowed slightly. "No, no, Mr. Doolin, this is not a threat. I just put some things to be more clear, so that you have more A more adequate reference to make the decision that suits you best, this is not a threat, it is help! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin couldn’t help but laugh, he pointed to this person and said: "Your way of speaking is very interesting. You used to be at the circus. Have you done it? For example, playing a clown makes people laugh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the smile on the face of the man converges and becomes a little cold, "You I think I am teasing you? Mr. Doolin, maybe you have some power in other places, people will respect you. But here is the west, your set of things is no longer applicable here! I repeat, the door Mr. Nong hopes to see you, you can refuse, but you have to know that some things are not the best choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished these words, a cold thing fell on his head, but he did not immediately converge his temper like some people, but turned hard when he was pointed at his head. Head and look at the young man standing on his side and holding a gun at his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very handsome young man, handsome to his woman's clothes can be one of the most beautiful women in the city, facing this young Man, he asked: "Do you dare to shoot? If you dare, come, give me one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshot rang, but it was not Hit him on his head, but on his knees, the Buddha's wrist flipped slightly, the gun pointed at his other leg. "What did you say? Give you something? Smoke?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man actually did not fall, he stood in the door frame and stood there, no sound, his eyes looked straight at the Buddha, the blood in the bones Activated by a bullet. He lifted his chin and clenched his teeth. Every word seemed to be squeezed out of his teeth. "A new bullet, aiming at my head, just like you threatened me?!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s muzzle was lifted up and pressed against his head. He was not willing to force his force against the muzzle, so that the muzzle of the bullet had just been fired. The heat caused his forehead to be slightly reddened by the muzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha looked at Du Lin, and the man also looked at Du Lin. Du Lin had no expression on his face. "You can safely go on the road, I will Go visit your family and the people behind you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood bursts instantly, the broken bone fragments and the white red things are sprayed on the ground, in a few After a second, a heavy body fell to the ground, making a loud noise of dong. Du Lin looked at Icourt. "Come up here, find out his identity, and send them to a family." His understatement is like saying something insignificant, but deciding the ultimate belonging of a family. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin saw the suffocation from this person. If he is not the robber who is riding on the Gobi, he must be a gang. This kind of person can Successfully mixed into the city hall and issued orders on behalf of the doorman, indicating that he represents the interests of some people. It’s easy to get rid of him. Those who represent the interests he represents will certainly not be so. They will definitely find a way to figure out what is going on, so Doolin will not give them time and opportunity to kill them directly. Ignorance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
