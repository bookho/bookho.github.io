			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member card is a good thing. People who invented this thing are all coins or banknotes. Only this kind of piggy bank can think of such a tear. Conception. The membership card makes good use of the characteristics that people like to be greedy and cheap, so that these people maintain a good consumption inertia. Once the inertia of consumption is cultivated, it will breed a kind of loyalty to the brand. This is a terrible thing, because no matter what you sell, they are all loyal, they are willing to try, even if Do not necessarily like it, will stand out from the maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, membership cards can provide a terrible cash flow, and cash flow is the most important means of capital. Of course, Dooling does not lack this money, but this does not mean that it is a bad thing to have a pre-paid consumer money into the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first store in the capital will serve as the flagship store of Xema Agricultural Company, and the people involved in the sales here will soon leave the Imperial City to other developed cities. As the manager of the store, they will train more outstanding employees to join this great business of selling health. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price that Dulin gave the contractor was seven cents, and those contractors thought that Du Lin was crazy, they called it from other places. "Green One" is actually a beet. You can get three for a penny. The price of Doolin is several times higher than that of picking up goods from other people. How can they accept such a price? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no broad channel for contractors, which means that these vegetables are difficult to appear on the table of a small family in the public for a short time. Dooling is not willing to sell these vegetables cheaply, so simply do it yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of these vegetables now looks much higher than before. In fact, only the flagship store will sell so expensive. After the other brands are built, the beet The maximum price will not exceed 30. If you have applied for membership and upgraded the membership level, you can buy beets at a minimum of 12 points and 3 yuan. Some people may question why the same thing can sell a lot of different prices. In fact, the reason is very simple. Here is the flagship store. The vegetables sold here are all selected from the millions of vegetables, the most perfect vegetables, so The name of the store is perfect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other brand stores will not sell to the 臻 series of products, if there are customers who want to buy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, you can submit your purchase intention to Xerma Agricultural Company one week in advance after you apply for the membership card, and then you have the opportunity to pick up a part of the application from thousands or even tens of thousands of applications. The other is natural. Just go to the next time. Of course, you can also go to the emperor to buy, but there is a better way, that is to upgrade the membership level, after the membership level five, there will be "lucky crit, inevitably shipped"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is rare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can these vegetables cause huge social effects in the empire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thinks this is okay. There is a saying in his dream that it is good, that it will be very good, or that it will be effective. If some of the great men of the empire began to consume the high-end brand vegetables of Zema Agricultural Company for a long time, then naturally there will be another group of people who try to improve their tastes and start to consume these expensive vegetables. But there is a little different place here. The big guys don’t need money to eat these things, but others have to pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether these big men are willing to purchase Duolin’s products for free, Du Lin will send a part of the door every cycle and let many people see the kind of door-to-door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the short-term staff training, Du Lin returned to the villa in Oak Bay, and will open the court tomorrow. After a long delay, I didn’t expect to drag the old Cape. Dead, of course, this also blames him as old as he has not yet selected the right successor. This does not blame Du Lin, blame himself. So the next thing is to go through a process, then he will see Maggs, and let the lawyers register a few patents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific group of scientists has completed a set of assembly lines, which can mass produce decoders, which means the arrival of a new era - the era of telecommunications ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement of each era will incite the overlord of the past, let the supreme degeneration, for example, the newspaper will soon be affected by the sales volume, and the tape business , will face a shrinking business of terror. Nasha's cooperation made Du Lin willing to give Nasha a way to live, but the Empire Star and the Star Empire must re-invest in Doolin's capital injection, which is a necessary prerequisite. Perhaps in some people's opinion, Du Lin really is not a thing, and the high price has sold his company that has obviously been eliminated to Nasha. Nasha has experienced continuous efforts to re-enter and operate to achieve commercial success. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empire Star and the Star Empire have clearly led the entire tape business. Each period of eye-catching sales and the advertising business to be lined up has proved Nasha’s dominance in this field, but at this time Du Lin has to Bite a big bite from the two companies at a very low price. The most important thing is not to eat or not, this is simply bullying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is the gameplay of the capital world, falling behind beatings and losing money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not satisfied? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, after the elimination, there may be no residue left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of cable TV technology and the upcoming big construction does not mean that the tape industry will be completely eliminated, the tape will still have a certain market, and the profit is not yet It will be very low, but there is a premise to change the business direction and business ideas. At present, when the huge impact occurs, these tape companies will definitely not think that they will have a way to live. It is like when the tsunami comes, everyone is struggling to survive and run forward. Even if they tell them that the tsunami will not kill them, they will not necessarily believe it. This is a good time to annex these industries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of annexing a large number of tape companies is not to continue to strengthen the tape business, but to directly fight these fierce shopping malls to kill and survive the production team The content of the tape is merged into the two star companies, but these production groups that have proved their worth in the market will provide enough rich content for Doolin's cable TV stations. Content is an important factor for cable TV stations to survive. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin does not think that his science island invented the decoder, he owns all the patents of cable TV, and can completely monopolize the cable TV business. With the improvement of the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act and the Anti-monopoly Act, the monopoly of such commercial activities will become less and less common in business. Recently, an anti-monopoly law enforcement supplement has been submitted to the Imperial Parliament. Article, one of the contents is "Enterprises or individuals with a technical monopoly industry, need to accept a certain degree of market financing ...". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, if Du Lin really started this unique business, he would have to dilute his shares and accept other capital forces. Investment, this is absolutely not allowed. He can see the future, but these investors may not be able to see the future, and in the end it is very likely to cause the company to have huge internal problems, which makes some people take advantage of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of this, it is better to continue to authorize, master industry standards, and master the most popular content, to win with content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina came at night, when Du Lin just started from the west, she already knew the news, because tomorrow will be in court, Du Lin said that it will appear in In court. So she took a vacation at night and rushed over from the Royal College. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are four months, my training is over." Freena sighed straight in the upper body, and today she specially wore a set. Very nice clothes, able to show the characteristics and beauty of women, while the two special colors of black and purple add some mystery and expectation, she paid a lot of thought for today's dress. She put out her tongue and rubbed a trace of glucose with more than 90% of the water stains on her lips. She sat down to Doolin's side. "How are you going to arrange my next job?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hasn’t responded yet. He obviously has a few seconds of hesitation. “So fast? Has it been almost two years?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking like it’s really almost two years, Du Lin’s head is in silence, time flies It’s really fast, he thinks about it, and he’s twenty-three years old in six months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-three years old! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, who stole my seven years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was only sixteen when he came out from home. Now he is almost twenty-three years old. How can he feel nothing? The time has passed seven years. Can life have a few years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to speak... I haven’t been home for two or three years, and I don’t know if Mr. Kemma will kill himself. Still don't think this is the best. The son who had only met once was afraid that he could not run all over again. He remembered that when he talked to Mr. Kesma last time, Mr. Kemma told him that the little bastard was catching chickens from other places, and Tearing the chicken hair is fun, why is Mr. Xerma not jealous of him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duo Lin, who came back from the mess of thoughts, grinned and looked at Freina’s shoulders, watching the TV stupid and vulgar. The TV series, pointing to the screen, said, "Where to fall from, where to get up. I will form a new company in the near future, and the content of the operation of the Empire Star is the same, but the business is more, the audience is wider, and the form It is also different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
