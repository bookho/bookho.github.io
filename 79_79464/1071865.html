			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as a few days ago, Taylor and Perito had contacted Jackson privately, and they gave Jackson a price that they thought was "sincere". I want to get Jackson to compete in my own camp. The price of the two people is very high, Taylor is very tough, and Perito is a little talkative. Whatever they do, they are actually a humiliation for Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson considers it as a modest statement and directly interrupts both sides. contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Mr. Jackson is so ignorant and can’t see the current situation, when Taylor proposes to let Mr. Jackson be the administrator, Perito directly I agreed, which made both people realize that Mr. Jackson maintained a neutral attitude and did not favor any of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just this neutral attitude that makes them more bored. In the mall, even allies can slap themselves in the back for the benefit. The neutrals don’t need to talk about it, and they don’t even have a psychological burden. So many times when a disputed thing develops to need to stand in the team, the unfortunate is often the wall of the wall. Either they are unplugged or they are stepped on. It is impossible to sit on both sides of the wall and see what is likely to be a potential crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they gave Mr. Jackson an administrator job, a confidential file manager, a very important job! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jackson’s face is like a slap in the face of the good-looking duties and powers of other retail companions. He clenched his teeth and sat back, and his face became iron blue. Mr. Taylor, sitting in the middle of the first row, looked back and showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smile made Mr. Jackson almost erupt, he hardened his head, he had to wait, wait for the changes Dulin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, some unusual changes are taking place in the lobby on the first floor of Kailemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, sir, I don't welcome you here!", the lobby manager and the hotel guards stopped the group, and there was some dispute, the hotel guards were Contact other guards to come and support, because they are facing a lot of pedestrians, there are more than ten people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are not others, it is Du Lin and his party. When Doolin applied for inter-bank signing rights, the imperial central bank's head office knew that Doolin had come to the Imperial Capital, and after the first check with Du Lin's signature was honored, Du Lin's trail was completely confirmed. In the eyes of the central bank's top management, Du Lin was very annoyed. He made the plan that would not have any accidents full of variables, and finally made a western insurance company. If it wasn't for the second time that Taylor, a man with strong working ability, had to go to the West to settle these things, there might be a lot of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they don’t like Doolin at all, and in the central bank’s record, Doolin’s bank account was suspected of gang trading and smuggling accounts in the Tener area. These two terms have been frozen once. Later, these accounts were unfrozen. Of course, there were not many funds in them. Only a few hundred thousand, all of them were confiscated and transferred to the special account of the Imperial Ministry of Defense for criminal funds. Such inferior customers have always been the focus of the central bank's attention -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is related to the requirements of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defence, for accounts with criminal records Fund monitoring has always been a joint project between the government and the central bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now they just say hello to Kailemen on this ground and don’t let Du Lin come in to interfere with the establishment of the Self-Discipline Committee. The hotel has no objection to this, and its own Kailemen has an extraordinary political status and significance. The founder of the hotel is also an official guest of the empire and the federal government. It is related to some policy aspects of the two countries. The official will also invite him to attend a hearing or attend a parliament to provide the necessary reference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very inappropriate thing to ban a criminal with a criminal record in such a different hotel, and this involves the central bank. The request of the hotel immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin, with a cane, stepped in front of Doolin. He smiled first and then showed his identity. "Why should we stop us from entering?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby manager glanced at Kevin, who was inconvenient in his legs and feet. He didn't know the rogue and rogue lawyers. Of course, Kevin is not a rogue lawyer anymore. He is the prosecutor of the Imperial Prosecutor's Office, has an official status, is the nemesis of criminals... Probably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, because this gentleman has been involved in criminal activities and has files, Kailemen’s rules and regulations allow us to refuse to affect our reputation. Please come to the hotel for accommodation and consumption, please forgive me. We can arrange for the vehicle to transfer you to its best hotel, and arrange the room for you free of charge and pay no more than one thousand dollars.", the lobby manager is very polite And given the measure of compensation, in fact, he also feels that this is not very good, but after all, this is the requirement of the above, he can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin shook his head. "No, I don't think this is the main cause of the problem, because my client... my friend is a Guar, you have a disgusting prejudice and discrimination against the Guarts. You are discriminating against his race, so you are not willing to let him in, is that the case?", before the lobby manager said anything, Adams stood behind and stood up. He is now Dulin’s lawyer, not Kevin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s cooperation with him makes him a prosperous time, earning a small amount of money, what will be long, what agents, every time you get through the business The telephone number means that 500 yuan of income is credited. From Doolin and his ventilation, there are already hundreds of calls and more than 70 lawsuits. Nothing has been done, and more than three million agency fees have been credited to his account. in. This also made him more aware of the benefits of holding Doolin's thighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Adams, you don't know me, but what I need to tell you is that we are now officially suing you Kailemen for committing to my client. Racial discrimination, and you have damaged his legal rights..." As soon as Adams reached out, the lawyer's letter he had written since the beginning of his class had been written and handed over to Adams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams took a look at his lawyer’s letter and took out his signature in his arms and inserted it into the coat manager’s jacket pocket. Tell your boss, we are ready to fight a lawsuit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conflict has existed for a while, and there are a lot of Kailemen today. When the reporter came, some reporters retired from the meeting and rested on the first floor, and immediately surrounded them. When they discovered that one of today's protagonists was Doolin, they immediately became excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper industry has summed up a lot of experience in the past two years, one of which is any news report related to Doolin, which will make newspapers easier to sell. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of the reporter made the lobby manager more flustered. He blamed the guard captain around him and then explained it with a strong smile. "This is foreign-related." Hotel, gentlemen, we must guarantee the safety of all our customers and the safety of our property. We have the right to refuse guests who we think are dangerous to enter the hotel, which has nothing to do with other things!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Du Lin stood behind and pointed a few words to the Buddha. They all left and nodded quickly. At this time, a large number of hotel guards came from outside the gate. They surrounded Du Lin’s group. live. As the hotel lobby manager said, this is a foreign-related hotel, and the reputation of Kailemen is as good as it is in the empire or in the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
