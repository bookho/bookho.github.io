			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not obvious that the throat has a clear sliding motion, and Delil swallowed a sip, and struggled deep inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, or not, this is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, it’s impossible for Dulin’s barbarian to treat him, he doesn’t want to leave any traces on his perfect face, and he doesn’t want to be The guy was violently slammed for three days and five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you don’t say it... The cold metal pipe on the chin makes him breathe a lot harder, it’s a terrible thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of beatings and life, Delil chose his own life as unreservedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said a name, Gothor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando’s eyes lit up instantly, and the pistol was immediately collected, and the warm smile returned to his face. He smiled and helped De Lier sort out his clothes, but Delil escaped with some fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando held his stomach in his hands, his mouth said that he was full of words for his own sloppy behavior, and his mind was already boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone has to deal with Codor, this is not a news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Gothor’s famous Tener City, there have been people who have been threatening how to treat him. Isn’t he still alive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, I am afraid it will be different. The first thing that Prando associates is that there is only one threshold for the identity of the tycoon from the tycoon. Is there anyone who does not want him to cross the past, so he designed this trap. This is not Prando's speculation and delusion. In fact, it is still full of cruel and fierce struggles in the upper class. It is only that the expression of this kind of struggle is different from the bottom of the society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took the knife into the arms with a mask, and smiled at you while reaching out and inserting the knife into your chest at the moment of shaking hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of all this are rooted in "resources." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tycoon is a general term that can be used to understand the tycoon as a rich man. This is the most obvious and is the underlying society's understanding of the tycoon. In the eyes of the people in the lower society, the tycoon is a rich man, living a luxurious life, every day, drunken, no need to worry about money, there is no end of money. But in the upper class, the tycoon is just a synonym, a symbol of social class identity, and it can be a real tycoon without money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tycoon needs not money, but political resources! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All true tycoons are vying for limited political resources. After all, Ternell or Cannes, so many officials, so many After power is naturally transformed into political resources, it becomes tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Wood, he is also a tycoon, then his life is to eat the sea every day, do not do business? No, his daily life is not like this. He will take the initiative to the old party. This is the abbreviation of the current aristocratic power. He will donate political contributions to the old party in exchange for the support of political figures, so that he is ready to change. The election two years later became a political figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a politician wants to maintain the detachment of his status, it is impossible to support everyone who has given him money. This stupid way is only Being able to undermine his prestige and status, he must have a clear choice, and only then can he be able to do things for him. Then the politician is the root of the struggle for the tycoons, the political resources for which they struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordo has a boss above it. This is almost a bit of energy. People know that it is a big man, not only a huge force, but also political. There is also a deep background. Once Córder steps across the threshold and becomes a new player in the "new gameplay", it will inevitably dilute political resources, because his boss will certainly support him and become his help in a future election or political event. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that a new round of elections is about to begin, at this critical time, if someone is likely to lose a person because of the "upgrade" of Codor Supporting his important people - this is not an impossible thing, after all, it is better to use it, and even if only one in a million chances can not be ignored. So what does this mysterious person do? He will definitely find a way to not give up the opportunity to upgrade to Gothol, hit him down with a stick and let him wait for the next opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is the next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, he felt that he had figured out that Prando’s eyes were pumping, and he stinked himself. When he first managed to do so many things, he was going to frame Doolin and let him go to the trap. Although he is likely to be caught up, it is better than being trapped in the trap. Of course, Prando was able to sit in the position of the regional police chief, which means he also has his own "resources" and a possessive head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately had a judgment and was relieved. Things have not broken down to the desperate situation that can't be saved in the end. It can even be said that he is fully capable of picking himself out of this matter at this time, and it is the kind of cleansing. Of course, any return needs to be paid before it is received. Fortunately, it is not him who is paying this time, but Córder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando immediately took Delier together and returned to the city of Turner, waiting for this opportunity to pick himself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Mrs. Vivian’s eyes were pretty and ruddy, when she came out of the Delil Art Museum, she unexpectedly saw Prando and Delil The two stood under the steps and both of them bowed their heads. Her steps slowed down and stopped as she slowly walked to the third step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She chose silence, but Prando did not dare to choose silence. He took the lead and stood down and confessed to Mrs. Vivian’s "wrong". "I am very sorry for the lady. The Cod three who were caught this time were identified by Mr. Delier. This is a mistake in my work. I must admit to you my mistake. This is my job. The result of the negligence in the hope that you can punish me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivian’s lightly looked down at Prando and then Looking at Delier, Delil explained it very cleverly. "It’s such a lady. I went to the regional prison and found that the three were not robbed that day and brutally beat me three people. This is me. I have already explained to the Director of Prando."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Mrs. Vivian has troubles, she is patient and asks: "Who is the person sent?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando moves forward one step, lower head lower," is a song called Godor When the citizens were sent, he said that the three were Cod and his accomplices, and they also robbed Mr. Delier. When they were sent, they appeared to have been punished by some lynchings, so I could not do very well. Recognizing the three, my negligence led me to think that the person brought by Codor is the three people Mr. Delier is looking for, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
