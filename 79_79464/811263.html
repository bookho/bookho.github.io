			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin noticed these people, he took up the newspaper subconsciously, and it was not difficult to find out that the big man who was awkward was Clark. A little bit shorter is Amp. To say what is the most powerful intelligence organization in the world, Du Lin thinks that perhaps reporters and special publications are holding journalists’ cards and searching for privacy in the name of freedom of the press and then revealing them. Their news is really well-informed. It is. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, the newspaper has exposed the sullen Clark and the expressionless Amp photo, thank you very much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their stuff, I asked." Du Lin snorted at the coffee shop owner who was delivering the meal and took three out of his pocket. Ten dollar denominations of banknotes are pressed under the plates. The owner of the coffee shop glanced at the group of newcomers, and Clark and Amp also looked at Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is a bit weird. There is no enthusiasm between the guest and the person being invited, but there is some chill that cannot be said. The surrounding snow fluttered between the two sides. For a while, Amp laughed. He took out his wallet and took out some change. "Thank you for your generosity, but you don't have to. We just have to bear the cost ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn't care to point the desktop with his finger, "Take me.", said he licked the coffee The store owner glanced at the moment, and the latter suddenly became a spur of the spirit. He took the 60 yuan from Du Lin’s plate and took it. In Irian, Doolin circulated many rumors. Some people said that he was very generous. Even if a friend sold him, he would not care. But there are also some rumors that this person is actually not as generous as he has shown, and has provoked him. He may not know how to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of those rumors that are true, those are fake, the coffee shop owner is only a middle and lower class, he has no courage and no ability to fight against Doolin Such a request from the upper class, unless he does not want to continue living in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp did not emphasize anything. He stuffed the wallet back into the inner pocket and raised the cup of coffee, and asked, " Do we know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sigh of relief and was not as hot as before. He slid the newspaper up and turned the news page back. They are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarke sneaked a sneak peek, this group of female watch reporters, really dare to report anything. Anpu was also a gaze, and suddenly realized that he stood up and walked over to Du Lin over the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat, he stood, he looked down at Du Lin, but there was a illusion of looking up at the mountains, his mouth was awkward, "You are Doolin "Sir?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin blinked and stood up, took the initiative and held a good smile. "You said what the information says. The same, is a very intelligent person, Mr. Amper.", said that he looked at the Amp, who was standing outside the umbrella and still falling on the snow, if asked, "Would you like to sit? Say? It’s snowing outside.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp looked up at the gray sky and shook his head. “Sorry, I don’t like to sit and talk.”安 <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s refusal was also in Doolin’s expectation that he was not a fool and had an extraordinary encounter. The idea of ​​"proud son", he wants to maintain his self-esteem and maintain his own heart, this is also an inevitable thing. Du Lin let go of his hand and asked, "When will we meet again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp once again looked up at the sky, "When it is fine!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... goodbye!", Du Lin took a little hat and showed a high level of education and quality, and Amp also smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin left, Amp converges on the smile on his face, sitting next to his companion, his face is a bit serious. Doolin is more troublesome than he imagined. If he is not arrogant to the eye, he has absolute confidence in himself. If it is the former, perhaps Amp does not need to come to Irian to find the last clue, then he can directly kill Doolin in this case. But he thinks that Du Lin is not showing arrogance, is an unparalleled self-confidence, this confidence is terrible, terrible enough to affect Amp's emotions for the next job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark’s lips squirmed twice, or asked the scalp, “will it affect our investigation and evidence collection?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp holds coffee, does not drink, his fingers keep sliding along the edge of the cup, his eyes are fixed on the chair left by Dooling. "No, he will definitely let us Go to the investigation and then look at our jokes. These criminals have a strong sense of self-esteem. They think that others are not as smart as they are, so they don't mind someone investigating him. I have to admit that this dulin and the criminals I have seen are essential. The difference, we should pay attention to it, perhaps this is also his 'fatal flaw'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasant thing to have a cup of hot coffee in the cold winter morning. It was a pleasant thing to do, but Du Lin’s sudden appearance made the entire investigation team fall into a quiet and strange atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Durin sitting in the car is still reminiscing about the information he received from Kevin about Amp, the Buddha responsible for driving through the rearview mirror I took a look at Du Lin and asked, "Boss, do you want to get rid of them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin turned back and shook his head. "Now is not When I need to do it, I will tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you start, Du Lin wants to see this empire, which is enough in the world. How big is the difference between the characters on the peak. As Amp evaluated Du Lin, he was full of confidence in himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden heavy snow lasted for more than two days, and it will take a long time for the snow to melt, the snow just stopped, and Amp has two The team members came to the place where Juan jumped off the building. The purpose of his doing this was to attract Doolin's attention, and then let Clark go to the police station to check the information of the jeweler's registrant and try to find the person in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigating the suicide incident in Juan is not purely a blind eye. If you can pull Du Lin out of this case, it is also very beneficial for the investigation team. thing. As long as there are excuses and goals, the upper level still hopes to recover the lost 70 million funds, which gives Amp more time and more convenience to dig deep into the opportunity of Du Lin, the criminal and his criminal group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the roof of the bank building, watching the snow in the white, Amp shook his head. He bypassed the police pointed out that Juan jumped from the building and went to the other side. At this time, the snow is covered. If the snow is forcibly removed, it may destroy any evidence that has not been discovered. Although the snow will melt and devastating damage to many pieces of evidence, it is limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the edge of the bank building, Anpu looked down and looked down. A police officer stood in the position where Juan fell to the ground and looked up. Looking at Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His brow slightly twisted, remembering the official site investigation report with a record of Juan’s death, the record said that Juan died on the sidewalk. Looking down from Amp's own point of view, it is not so easy to die in that position, because jumping off the building will have an inertia, not to say where to jump out, where it must be. He asked people to find two hemp bags, which filled a hundred and thirty pounds of things, one was directly held by people, and one was sprinted and then thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
