			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new prohibition of alcohol has a great impact, but it is good news for us!", Du Lin sat in the chair on the corner of the playground and looked at the sky. Thin clouds, bright reflections in the eyes. Dudu and others sat next to him. They were somewhat confused about Du Lin’s statement. It was obviously a bad thing. Why did it become a good thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes some things are really funny, the New Party’s proposal has just entered the process of the Imperial Parliament, and the news that should have been temporarily kept secret has actually spread. The prisoners in the regional prisons outside Nair City have already received news. The news came from a letter from a prison guard. There is no doubt that this must have been passed in by the Ellisto. Du Lin’s attitude is very optimistic, he thinks this is a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalism is rapidly expanding its power, and some research books on capital are constantly appearing in this society. Someone has summed up such a thing - goods The price positioning does not depend on the quality of the goods, but the demand of the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain in a way that people who have never attended school can understand, that is, if people have a need for shit, then dogs and shit can Sell ​​high prices. The former can produce shit and the latter can be sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second ban on alcohol has indeed had a major impact on the private wine industry, and new departments are under construction, once the new department is officially listed. Now, the rampant private wine industry will inevitably be devastated. The introduction of any policy is not only as simple as having documents, but also requires the cooperation of a series of personnel, such as executive agencies and supervisory agencies. The impact of the previous prohibition on alcohol was indeed great, but not many people did it, which naturally caused a situation of private liquor. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the second prohibition of alcohol is issued after the promulgation, with specific agencies to implement and supervise, it will inevitably cause a devastating blow to the private liquor market, at least now These blatantly large-scale shipments of private liquor through steam locomotives do not exist. More than half of the sellers of private liquor will disappear, and the private liquor circulating in the market will naturally become less and less. According to the researcher, a commodity depends on the needs of the market, and when demand is greater than supply, the price will rise significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now a bottle of eight dollars of wine, in the near future may sell for eighteen, or even more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a good thing for all the wine drinkers who have the ability and confidence to do business, which means they will get more net profit at the same cost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, this is also a challenge for all private drinkers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More stringent supervision and enforcement, no longer able to transport large quantities of private wine in a box, but also to face other surviving private wines The traffickers attacked fiercely. The increase in net profit costs has sharply increased the desire of private liquor dealers for market share. In the past, several people could share the resources of a city in peace, but after the second prohibition, few people would see it. Looking at the income several times more than ten times more than before, it flows into other people's pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war has become the only way for private traffickers to "elect", to select the final winner, to eliminate the loser from the cause and the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly turned around and asked: "Yes, how are the recent arrivals?"<br /><br />&nbsp On the fourth day of Dolin’s imprisonment, a group of prisoners were returned. The prisoners’ sentences were not very long, the longest year, and the shortest three months. Their charges were armed robbery, and they also had to be hospitalized for the victims. They were stupid enough to gather together to go to the night to entertain and say loudly about the matter, and eventually the police arrived late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These messages were told to him by the warden, and they were also reminded that these people followed closely, not necessarily being guilty. They are most likely to be arranged by the enemies outside Doolin to solve the killer of Doolin. Du Lin also had the same opinion, so he asked Dudu to keep a concern for this group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are very honest.", both of them looked at the two people sitting loosely in the other corner. "There are two possibilities for those two races." It was their leader, and several other people did not have any conflicts with anyone else. Once they were provocative, but they quickly shrank back, so now people here think they are 'harmless'."林 <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also looked at the ladder across the playground. I don’t know if it’s a coincidence. The guy sitting in the opposite position also looks at the guy. Dooling also smiled and nodded to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be true, whether it is or not, we must be careful, here is not outside!" Du Lin took a pat on the leg and stood up. The members of the fellowships around him also stood up. "Be careful, definitely not Wrong. In addition to them, pay attention to other people. The initial prestige is easy to set up, but how to maintain it is not a simple matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The conflict in the restaurant subsided very quickly, the brutal image of Du Lin’s group has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and they are a group, and the reputation of Doolin is gradually spread here. Not many people are willing to take the initiative to provoke they. Everyone knows that Doolin is selling private wine, and it is one of the original Big Three in the city of Tener. They don't know more detailed information, and they don't know that Du Lin is almost finished. They are not willing to provoke Du Lin to fear that Du Lin will go out to retaliate after a short sentence. If they know that Du Lin has basically nothing at all, I am afraid that someone will soon take Du Lin on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm days are extraordinarily slow, and every morning after breakfast, there will be a short break and then work. The Ternell District Prison is a vertical management and is headed by the Imperial Prison Administration. Under normal circumstances, this department is a specific matter that never interferes with the local prison. The only thing that can be done in a year is to collect prisoners and prisoners in various prisons. Specific information about prisoners who are released from prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have no policies, and no funds are allocated to the localities. The maintenance of regional prisons needs to be operated by the prison itself. To put it bluntly, it is self-financing. It is not a small expense to manage so many prisoners, give them food to drink, and pay for their wear and other expenses, plus the salary of prison administrators. So the vast majority of prisons are running small businesses that use prisoners to create revenue without the extra cost of labor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes it is to take orders from some capitalists, and sometimes it will also produce some things for sale and exchange for the cost of maintaining the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part of the fee comes from the “donations” of the families of the prisoners or their own forces. These donations are not as simple as simple donations. The wardens everywhere have their own The name of the project is to handle this special fund. The statement of these donations here is the cost of improving the daily life of the prisoners. The money will go directly into the treasury of the warden, but they will prepare a "account" for the prisoner for extra spending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, cigarettes, a cigarette outside a dollar here to sell ten dollars. A chicken leg may not cost five cents outside, but here is a dollar. Even the things that the prisoners themselves produce want to use them themselves, and they have to pay ten times the price to buy them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have said that there are two kinds of people who can't afford to be guilty in prison. One is that they don't take their lives seriously. These people are all crazy madmen who may not want to live at all. Maybe you just look at him more and he can do everything to kill you, so this kind of person can't offend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second person who can't offend is the "rich man", which includes people who live in "villas" and have a thick private account book. These people have a close relationship with the prison without exception. The prison guards always have a "care" mentality for them. They also violate the prison regulations. They may only be confined, but the "poor" is ten. I don’t come to bed for half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin these people belong to the second, but there are some differences with other second people, he still has to work. It is not who forced him to work, but he felt that it is not bad to experience such a life. It is an improvement in experience and psychological progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, he finally defeated the big man in the dream in one way. The big man was shot in a few days after he was jailed. He had never lived in prison, but Du Lin had. Although this experience makes people feel some... but always the side of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sometimes thanked the big man for his rich experience and experience, and he also had a comparative psychology that he himself was not very clear about. He feels that he will become a big man like a big man, and he will be better than him, live longer, have more power and a higher status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is Doolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Du Lin’s group was ready to go back to rest and eat, a ball flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a ball sport in this world, no matter what the world people have inexplicable love for chasing rounds that will roll and bounce. Ball games are also quite popular in this world, mainly divided into two types, football and handball. The rules of football are relatively simple, and they are more like the football of the world in Doolin's dream, but the handball is different. A bit like a collection of volleyball and rugby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ball can't land, it must be put into the opponent's net in the process of sports to win. In this process, in addition to not being able to punch the opponent, not kicking the opponent, and not having obvious aggressive actions, all collisions and pushes are considered reasonable actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
