			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently I have been thinking, is there any difference between rewarding a dollar and rewarding 10,000 yuan? In addition to the simple difference in numbers, the mind is actually the same. It is affirmation and support for me, and it is not affirmation and support for me. No, it is not like this. Everyone's mind is the same, they are all affirmation and support for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I re-enacted a rule that adds more rules to all book friends. Whether you reward a dollar or reward a million, you will reward me for all my support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how do you return? Of course, it is more, but my method of adding is not the same as other people. I will briefly introduce it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of rewards this month is divided by one hundred and then the whole is the next month's plus chapters. For example, if you win 1000 prizes in January, then you will update 10 chapters in the next month, which is the update base in February. If everyone rewards 10,000 pieces of accumulation... Forget it, don't reward so much, I can't afford it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then is it infinitely more? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author also needs to rest, but also needs to go out to the waves, but also need to sing songs every night, plus no more than 90 chapters per month, the base is 2, that is Say no more than 5 per day. If the card is inconsistent, the debt will continue until the next month, and the new month will be added to the cumulative update. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there will be a book friend asking, isn’t it not rewarding every day? This is a serious question, and my answer is no. I have a reward, I will not find a reason to update more? For example, my two treasures are beautiful, my boss test scores are good, recently I have a few good-looking *****. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, more, no, no less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and I said that when I want to add this, they say that I am stupid. If someone really gets a silver, I am not going to blow up? I don't comment on the ideas of my friends, they are also kind. However, I can't ignore the support of all my friends. No matter how much money, it represents everyone's recognition of me, my love for me and my work. How can I live up to your love of this book and the readers who like me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
