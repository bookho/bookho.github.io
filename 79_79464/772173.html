			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think I need to introduce this, the two must know something.", Juan is introducing Duling and his side to Maddest. Dove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes the world is so interesting, the church has repeatedly reiterated that alcohol is the temptation of demons to humans, and there are strict standards for prohibiting alcohol in the theocracy. Any believer who has been found to believe in God after drinking alcohol will be punished by the church's delisting. It can be said that wine is a taboo word in the church. It is difficult to find the reasons for the church's ban on alcohol from documents such as the ocean. I don't know why the church hates wine so much. Perhaps it is another story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church’s attitude towards wine has always been clear. It’s ridiculous that the Cardinal and Mr. Juan is a good friend. Doesn’t he know? Is Juan a wine merchant who relies on alcohol to make a fortune? In some of the church's literature, the workshop for brewing wine is called the place to breed demons, and the master of the workshop is the father of the devil! In the period when theocracy was above the secular power many years ago, countless wine merchants were burned to death on the trial column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he knows that he knows better than anyone, because every year Juan will send a lot of wealth to the church. Part of it is an ordinary donation, and part of it is the money he spends looking for his own destiny to find ancient churches for prayer and revelation. The name of Juan is not known to the top of the entire church. This is a guy who doesn't take money as a money. He just needs to fool him a few words, and he will put a lot of money into the donation box. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the top members of the church and Juan are good friends, and more than half of the cardinals have occasional correspondence with Juan, as for the identity of Juan. And the banknotes with demonic smell in his hands... God will forgive this lost lamb! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hua took the hand of Madest and introduced him kindly, "This outstanding young man is the richest and youngest of our Irians." One, we all call him Mr. 350,000, and also my partner. This is his female companion, Miss Dove, who just said to me that Dove is a devout believer and is looking forward to being able to You talk to one or two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madester is the cardinal, he is also a political figure, he immediately realized that Juan used such an introduction There must be something to do with Du Lin alone, so he nodded and talked to Dove. The little girl is indeed a little simple, her excited face is red, and she is stuttering when she speaks. Fortunately, Madest is not urging, nor disgusting. She can always listen to Dove quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dove didn't notice that just in the first time she talked to Madsted, Juan took Duolin's sleeve and took him to the corner of no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought we would go to Miss Chris with two people!", although Juan’s expression is laughing, can he stand alone through his tone of voice? Reading him is actually angry. "I think this is a kind of deception, a betrayal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not see Chris When Joan was together, it made him very unhappy because he didn’t know what time Du Lin and Chris had been alone. What did he say, didn’t say anything, did he have a preliminary problem with the cooperation? The conclusion is still really no result. All of this is plaguing Juan. He has already sprinkled more than two million and circled nearly 50 plots in the next state, and the theater building began to build. Next, he probably spent about three million dollars to ensure that he has the resources of no less than one hundred cinemas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this critical time, Du Lin took him to see Chris, which made him unable to calm down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and kicked the kicker. "Mr. Juan, I respect you as an elder, but there is no basis for jealousy and I will not Admit. Yes, I did see Ms. Chris, but I have never hurt your personal interests, and I have consulted you before, and you finally decided that we should do everything. Didn't you make a mistake?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone was a bit tough, and even the problem was thrown to Juan, "If you choose us to continue eastward Coastal Entertainment Company has invested in capital, then there is no such thing as it is. The election is your choice. Now, if you say such a thing, you said it, Mr. Juan, do you think that I am younger than you, just bully? From me When the first money comes, no one dares to slap me. Please don't regard my respect as my concession to you, which will hurt people!", this last sentence is faint A thing that made Juan feel the heart, his eyes became a Joints, stiff smile for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, no one has dared to blatantly threaten him in the city of Irian. Now, when Du Lin reveals the threat, he feels strange and discovers it. A little fact that I have not discovered before. In the face of Du Lin's threat of injury, his first thought was not to counterattack, but to avoid. He stared at Doolin's eyes with his eyes open, and at this moment he couldn't find the look of the old man who was smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin did not retreat to meet his gaze, even more sharp than his! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s heartstring suddenly loosened, his face smiled back to the sun, raised the cup, and said with a smile: “Maybe it’s a bit of drinking at night, say something.” "It's a bit confusing." He thought about the words and continued: "I apologize for what I said before. I am really anxious. I have invested too much energy and financial resources in this area, so I hope You can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s face is also filled with a smile like a sun. “I also need to apologize to you, you know that I am still young, sometimes I can't control my temper, so I talk a little bit more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two laughed and looked like they couldn’t see the fire of Zhang Jian’s sword. Juan took a sip of his drink. He didn't clink with Doolin. This is also a reflection of his own real thoughts through details. "How do you think about this in cooperation with the George family?" His tone has eased a lot, not in the attitude of a superior person. , The two sides placed on a flat surface peer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin naturally will not continue to destroy the atmosphere at this time, he explained, "I and Ms. Chris directly indicated that we have a huge amount of hands in our hands. Resources, if we can't cooperate, the George family can't do monopoly in the field of cinema, and finally it can only form a situation of separation between the North and the South. This is the result that we, and the George family, cannot accept. So we In addition to cooperation, there is no second way to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to it, Juan thought for a while and cautiously agreed with Du Lin. Say, "Yes, if you can't monopolize, it means that all the early investment of the George family has failed. No matter who proposed this plan, the status within the George family will drop a lot. They can't refuse our condition unless they immediately Stop and sell the upfront investment. If they do, we can take over directly at a lower price, and we can also monopolize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really you can monopolize an industry, if not George and family cooperation is acceptable. It is best to work with the George family before you have enough strength. It is like a relationship, or even an intangible business card. With this aura, it will be of great benefit to future development. However, if you can't cooperate in exchange for monopolizing an industry, it is not impossible. It is also the embodiment of strength and a symbol of status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
