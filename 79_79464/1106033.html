			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a gunshot from outside the house made Albert slammed, the forked beef grain rolled off the dinner plate, the sauce splashed, his clean shirt There are a few more brown stains on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swallowed and watched the young man sitting opposite him silently put down the knife and fork. Although he was under house arrest, Du Lin allowed him to look through the newspapers of every day. Through the newspapers, he already clearly recognized the situation outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Atlantic Group company is finished, he doesn’t know why the Atlantic consortium will be so fast, at least when he still has freedom and is responsible for this work, he I have not found any problems. Of course, he felt that this was not a problem. Du Lin used to use a billion-dollar federal shield to pile up an Atlantic group company. Then he must have a complete plan, only the manager and the plan he knew. Looking back now, perhaps because everything is going too well, and the frenetic atmosphere on the federal side makes it impossible to study the sudden start of the Atlantic consortium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people can only learn how the joint construction workers are doing in the empire through newspapers and some pictures, or how the United Pharmaceuticals and Atlantic Chemicals have gained Breakthrough research progress, everything is so smooth, everything is perfect. Every step, every piece of evidence is carefully designed so that people can't tell the difference between true and false, and then all this is poked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era of industrial decision-making power, the avalanche effect caused by the collapse of the industrial sector is amazing, perhaps this is why the joint construction can develop so smoothly in the empire s reason. There is not only the merits of his Albert, but also the merits of more people, including some tycoons of the empire, and even the Imperial Cabinet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no appetite at all, he is a little scared, he doesn’t know why he has a special fear at this time, but he is afraid, his hand They are shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha wiped his mouth with satisfaction and threw the napkin on the table. He lit his head with a cigarette and took a breath. It’s like laughing and laughing, looking at Albert. “You have half the blood of the Guartes. Originally, according to the rules of our Guartes, you need to go through a sacred trial!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?", Albert told himself to say something, which helped him to ease the anxiety in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha shrugged his shoulders. "Oh, that's why you only have half the blood of the Guartes. You don't even know our traditions." He said he laughed. "It doesn't matter, we still have a lot of time." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the gult tradition, all betrayers must accept the rulings of the gods, and the gods think that you can survive, then Everything you do will be forgiven, no matter who you betray or who you betray, these will be forgiven. All the Guars will not hurt you and curse you because of these things. But if you are in the sacred The trial failed, and the gods thought that you should not continue to live, then your life will go to the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you want to ask, how is this? Do. Actually very simple, have you ever heard of skinning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert trembled again, hesitantly nodded. "It seems to have been heard. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s cigarette with his fingers is a little bit distant. "Yes, I’ve heard of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the traitor, we will strip his skin, while he is alive. Then we will use one A special kind of liquid fills your body to make sure you don't die too much. Then you will be hung in a very high and obvious place. In the past we used to hang people in the city most of the time. On the clock tower, it is high enough and eye-catching. You will be exposed for three days. If you are still alive after three days, it means that the gods have forgiven you, you will be free, no one will be embarrassed. If you are dead, then Your soul will fall into the abyss and be punished by eternal torture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s words made Albert very uncomfortable, and even had some nausea, his teeth trembled When I got up, I made a screaming voice. "No, I didn't make any move to betray Mr. Doolin. This is a lynching. This is illegal. I want to see Mr. Doolin!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha shook his head gracefully. "Boss doesn't want to see you now, its You don't have to worry, because you don't need to bear these. I reminded the boss that he said that only half of you are the blood of the Guar, our sacred trial is used in your body is the shackles of our own blood, and he also I have arranged a new job for you. If you do this, you are free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Albert a sigh of relief, he The body is soft on the chair, "What do I have to do? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufu smiled and held out a hand, like a pinch of money, the index finger and the thumb of the thumb almost stick together, the mouth emits a long tail like "pi...", and then the slightly folded five fingers immediately Open, "pa..."! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of the Atlantic consortium were revealed, indicating a huge conspiracy and a series of follow-up troubles. Therefore, it is necessary for someone to draw a pause for the troubles that may exist in the future. At the same time, the federal government also needs a person with sufficient weight to appear and have an explanation to the public. Many times the middle and lower classes need not the real truth. They need a plausible story that they can accept, and the story is good enough to be accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more valuable and meaningful than the members of the Federal Parliament, the president of the Atlantic consortium, and the outstanding federal young entrepreneur Mr. Albert. He must appear, but he can't speak, so Du Lin arranged a more ceremonial ending for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 8:15 pm, on the top floor of the Atlantic Group’s office building, the cold wind is as horrible as the financial order that brought the federal chaos into the bottom Blowing, like a small knife on the face, is not painful, but it always makes people feel that they don't know when they will be very hurt and feel pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha stood on the edge of the roof and leaned forward to look down, then immediately retracted, he was a little afraid of heights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind is very big, but I have to say that it is high enough!", the Buddha hooked the two young people on the side, they will even stand The unstable station Albert came over. I don't know if it was much more than before, but he was also afraid of heights. In short, he was scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha turned and contracted his neck, and the cold wind ran down the gap in the clothes, which made him feel very cold, he stunned. At a glance, Albert said loudly, "Boss has no other things to come in at night. He wants me to convey some words to you. He gave you a positive evaluation of your previous efforts, and at the same time disobedience and betrayal against you. It is also very angry. The road is chosen by everyone. Everyone needs to pay for their own behavior. Now it is your turn to pay the price of fault, Mr. Albert."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin asked me to apologize to you, your time is over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu revealed a big smile and hid aside. "Take him down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dudu took the elevator back to the first floor, pushed open and posted When the door that was sealed but torn was gone out, it happened to see Albert, who had finally twitched. He glanced down at his eyes and squinted, rubbing his head and slamming his head into the car, the damn ghost weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than ten minutes after the departure of Dufo, a young man got into the phone booth and made a call to Mr. Ma Jili, an excellent reporter for Good Morning. The phone revealed the discovery of "great". Soon after, I called the police and disappeared into the twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Majeri and the police arrived at the scene and watched the dead Albert, who had nothing to express except silence. thing. At the same time, Du Lin is on the phone, and many problems have begun to erupt, which makes the founding of the national family that Du Lin said is not quite right. Place, because this is not the same as the script. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You never said that the empire will join the game, and have not told us that the empire will isolate us in terms of diplomacy." The anger, Du Lin and the people behind him were superb. The federal army on the international diplomatic battlefield has apparently fallen into a passive position. This is not the same as their initial plan. Du Lin has never said anything about this, which makes them passive now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin responded with a smile. "I know there is a word called 'improvised performance'. The more excellent the actor, the more able to perform during the performance. Touching some moments of inspiration, and in what we said, you have not told me that the soldiers will surround my estate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From At noon, the surrounding whistle found a situation in which a large number of soldiers were faintly surrounded. Before that, Du Lin knew that these people would not let him leave. Just as Albert must jump off the building, the federal government and the nation-building must also find a scapegoat with enough weight to quickly resolve some troubles. Whether Du Lin is enough or not is no doubt. The identity of his imperial person and his resume in politics are enough for him to take this scapegoat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the best way to “deny” everything into an “empire’s conspiracy”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
