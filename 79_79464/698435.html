			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning after the breakfast was used, the captain did not immediately let the prisoners go to work, but gathered them together and said that there was one thing to Everyone explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night, an accident occurred in the prison area. A prisoner unfortunately slipped during the bathing process, and the back brain caused a coma. Finally The wet towel covered on his face was alive and suffocating." He looked very serious. He used his steel whip to beat a few desktops, and the whispering prisoners were quiet. "This is simply our supervision area." The shame! A big one would actually slip into it. When I heard this, I couldn’t believe my ears. Are you only three or five years old? Can you slide in a shower? What’s more funny is that he fell. Why didn't anyone put him in a safe place after the fall? I have to wonder if your cold-blooded garbage is sympathetic and human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Starting today, you must wear non-slip slippers when you take a bath. I don't want this ridiculous tragedy to happen again. If someone falls in the bathroom, the last three people who leave the bathroom must Responsible, remember, not allowed ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin understands that this is a hidden warning, the bathroom in winter does seem to be the best place to kill, once everyone starts to bathe, water The steam quickly spread and almost no one meter was seen in the bathroom. Coupled with the rustling of water everywhere, as long as the relevant preparations are done, no one will be found dead in the bathroom until the water vapor in the bathroom is dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a pity, but unfortunately such a good place can no longer be used. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain also named a few prisoners who did not work hard, and then let the prison guards watch the prisoners leave the restaurant and go to work in the workplace. The most recent order came from a trading company that produced blankets for sale, and they booked a total of 5,000 blankets. With the arrival of winter, such seasonal products also reached the peak season of sales. The trading company's own factory was unable to do full-load operation, and had to teach the prisoners in the regional prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone must complete two blankets per day, this is the bottom line, there are rewards for exceeding, and punishment for failure to complete. There is no management and human feeling at all in such a work environment. Fortunately, the production of blankets is not complicated, or the blankets they make are not high-end goods. They only need to use a special tool to clamp a small pile of fluff through the blanket and tighten the needle on the back. Although the workload is relatively large, it is good at work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey boy, this blanket, you come!", Du Lin, who was working at the desk, did not notice the surrounding environment, and a blanket was thrown from a place separated. A guy grinned at him, and there was a fierce luster in his eyes. "I found that you are doing very fast. This blanket is what I reward you!"<br /><br />&nbsp Such provocations and oppressions often exist in prisons. There is never a prison in the world full of peace and love. There are oppression and humiliation in all prisons. The class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just glanced at him and threw the blanket he had thrown over the floor. The guy stood up with a glimpse of his eyes, he had not had time to When doing the action, the prison guard knocked on his back with a stick. "Go back and sit down and finish your own thing, or you will receive it this evening!", the prison guard looked at it again. Others, "I warn you, don't make trouble here, you can't afford it, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy seems to care less about the prison guard's stick. After sweeping the dust that might exist on the shoulder, he pointed to Du Lin and sat back. Many prisoners are waiting for a good show with a smile. They want to be a person in the world. If they want to be a person, they must learn to step on others and raise themselves. It's like a dark jungle with basic rules. If you want to stand at the very top of the food chain, you have to step on other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just disappointing that after the end of the work, the guy who provoked Doolin didn’t seem to have an immediate conflict. He seemed to just want to provoke Du Lin’s first shot. The more this, Du Lin feels that he can no longer wait, the other side begins to take the initiative from the passive situation, then the danger must be eliminated in the bud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly put his goal on a very regular guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is very strong, his muscles are like a piece of hard rock, his life in prison is very regular, every day according to the rules of the prison to participate in each An activity that uses equipment to exercise before eating at night. Of course, when they take a shower, they will go in with a group of people, and then a group of people will come out together. It seems that there is no place to start, but it also allows Du Lin to find an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next evening, people left the work area after the work. The management of prisoners in the prison is basically in a state of semi-stocking. As long as they do not violate the rules, they can still have some freedom. In order to prevent these prisoners from putting too much energy into the fight, the prisons also opened up sports facilities to give them too much energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
