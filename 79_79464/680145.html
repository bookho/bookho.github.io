			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a second!", Heidler pushed the newspaper on the table aside, he frowned and thought about everything that happened recently, he always I feel that something is not quite right, but I can’t say what is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directly abandoning Doolin is not a difficult choice for him. The success of a character will inevitably use more people as a stepping stone, otherwise how can Prove that you are the most successful one? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin does have the value of an investment if he can grow up healthily and vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a premise here, that is, he can grow up without losing, rather than halfway through the inexplicable things that become only in people’s memory. The past. Now, this may be expanding rapidly, so that Duolin's investment value will be reduced to zero on the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not accumulated his own advantages, he has been rejected by the mayor, and he does not know the alternative to leave the city, he has no value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people may still have a memory of the past for something that is of no value to them, such as an old children’s shaker that has been placed for many years. It may be because of the various memories of childhood, etc., even if they have a new shaker, they are not willing to throw away the old shaker. People are animals full of emotions, and this just proves this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the businessman is obviously different from the person. This is not to say that the businessman is not a person, but an emotional aspect, and a matter of things. For business people, no value is equal to waste and can only be abandoned. Du Lin is such a waste. He has lost value without "getting up". It is not a mistake to abandon him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler felt that something was wrong. He shook his head and said: "Let people pay attention to Doolin’s business. He should use a lawyer. Introduce him to a reliable lawyer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing lawyers to Doolin does not mean that Heidler must have some direct connection with Doolin. How many gulls have been caught in Liedel, can't you say that he has contact with every Guar? Even the mayor of the city can't take things for this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler retired, and Heidler sighed and looked at the gloomy sky outside the glass window, feeling a mad madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen it clearly, the old party can’t stand it, only to vote for the new party at this time is the most sensible choice. But the problem is that as a veteran old party, it is not an easy task to get rid of the old party. Someone in the Chamber of Commerce had a glimpse of his position. Some people in the party coveted his wealth. He was also the most unpopular among the Guarts. People want to step on his body and climb to a higher place. He does not allow himself to be the loser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes he feels very lonely and hates his father who has already gone to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father, if he strengthened his position, did not sell the interests and secrets of the country, perhaps he is now like the Guars in the slums, the family Squeezed in a small room, gave birth to a pile of children, and went home exhausted every night. But he feels that life is not necessarily unsatisfactory. Indeed, there may be many problems because of poverty, but he will not be alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at it now, he is very rich, but he is lonely. He has no one to talk to, a friend who has no heart, no partner to rely on, and he is a lonely man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes he wonders if his father passed the gene of "betrayal" to him, so that he always weighs in the face of choice. After the pros and cons, choose the one that is the safest, and the one that is the most ruthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to change, and he wants to change, but he has no courage to do these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very bright light instantly lit up the whole world, followed by a thunderous sound from the ear, and the pouring rain blurred the whole world in a flash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s raining!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sky outside the iron railings The falling bed plate blocked the small window and prevented the rain from coming in. The weather is a bit cold now, and there are no necessary heating equipment in the damn cages. I don’t know how people in other rooms spend the winter in such places. Dudu smashed his hand and put a new quilt on his body, finally feeling better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stove will be delivered tomorrow, I am afraid it will be difficult tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin calmly draped the quilt and sat on the bed with a book. He was reading a book, sometimes he encountered an incomprehensible vocabulary, and he used a pen. Draw a horizontal line below the vocabulary. Kevin’s words have always kept him in mind, and whenever he has time, he will read some books, no matter what the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he holds in his hand is a book about rethinking the war, called My War. The protagonist in the book, the author, fortunately went through forty-one battles and survived, waiting for the victory of the Great Patriotic War. But the lucky guy lost two legs and one arm, which was the last battle and the trace of the most tragic battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy’s intensive cover attack immediately took his legs and one arm, just as he had a medical soldier around him, simply for him. Stop the bloody bandage and let him survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he lived and saw the victory of the war, he felt that the war was actually lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A powerful empire in the past was violently pressed by a neighbor who had been despised in the past, and almost even the pants were taken off. Keeping the pants is a temporary victory, but definitely not all victory. The author's dictation plus the recorded re-creation has this book reflecting on war. Not only reflected on the war, but also reflected on the political system and reflected on the sick society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, this book was a frequent visitor to the hot list, and even now, the book’s sales are still impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor veteran and author struggled for a lifetime without having more than a hundred dollars in his pocket, but the war made him a nouveau riche . It is worth noting that the two legs and one arm are in exchange for a prosperous life. It is also a matter worth reflecting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin, the formalities were approved, and now I will start the trial. You will come out first." Mason stood outside the room with a smile and knocked on the door. There are occasional civilized laws and regulations in this barbaric world, all of which are brought about by the New Party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin carefully folded the page a corner, shook the quilt and put on the shoes to go to Mason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
