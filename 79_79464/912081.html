			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three fires reflected the half of the Emperor’s capital in red, and the siren of the fire truck never stopped after dark, and John, who had fallen asleep, was Mark woke up from his sleep, and the old man sat up with some irritability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to sleep will become more when you are older, not because you want to sleep, but because your body's function is rapidly declining and you need to reduce your metabolism. Mitigating the process of this recession. Especially at night, after being awakened, the body will be in a very unhealthy state, and irritability is only one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Mark returned to the family, John has not been woken up in the middle of the night, and everything has Mark treatment, he can enjoy his old age. Of course, he also understands that Mark can wake himself up regardless of his break time, and something must have happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked, opened the lamp on the bedside table, put the reading glasses on the quilt, and looked at Mark Shensheng and asked: "What happened? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John has experienced too many things in his life. The nerves have been as tough as steel. His voice seems to appease Mark’s horrified heart. Mark swallowed. Spoofing, slightly bowed his head, whispered: "Our three special publications were burned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not speak for a long time after saying this. There was no other sound in the room, only the shallow breathing sound could be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, when Mark looked up, he saw Mr. John’s eyes wide open and looked at him. There was no bloody face that had already turned red. He was open. The mouth gasped and the outstretched arm trembled. "You...what did you just say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specialist...burned!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, if Mr. John can still wake up, he will say that at that moment he felt something in his mind suddenly broke, Then the whole world is in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a life-winning winner in the life of a lifetime. John is the winner of a lifetime. He knows why he is the winner. People respect the George family and respect him. Even the top leaders of the two parties are his guests, not because of the great personality charm and ability of this person. They are all in the monopoly of the George family in the newspaper industry. Now that his weapon that monopolizes the newspaper industry has been destroyed, it is conceivable that politicians who are usually respectful to him will show their ugly teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark exclaimed and rushed forward to hold Mr. John, who was slowly leaning, and called the doctor loudly. The whole manor was in a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thinking Magus was alarmed by the phone ringing. He actually saw the light of the sky halfway, so he was waiting for the call. The telephone was personally called to him by the Chief of Police Investigation and reported to him three things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three major feature agencies were set on fire at the same time. From the current situation, there is no need for rescue, and they are swallowed up by the fire. It’s clean...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I interrupted, are there any casualties?”, Magus is very concerned about this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no casualties, it is only a scar on others, and it is also a scar on other capitalists, and they are not only not scared by the citizens of the entire capital. Will be resentful, but will gloat. However, if there are casualties or even serious casualties, it will cause public opinion and public opinion to rebound. This is definitely not a good thing for the cabinet that has just finished the stage of the ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is an accident, while the latter is an accident. Although it is also necessary for someone to bear this responsibility, the nature is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Prime Minister, this is what I want to say. There are no casualties in any of the three fires. According to the information we collected from the scene, the other party has already been arson. I gave enough warnings and dispelled all the staff. Of course there may be situations that we didn't find, and it will take the final conclusion after the fire is completely extinguished."<br /><br /> Mr. General Mr. General paused for about five seconds. Magus did not continue to ask questions. He continued: "The second thing I want to say is also related to this arson case. Just now Twenty-five young people surrendered to the Imperial Police, claiming that they created the arsonists in the three arson cases and offered evidence. They are currently in custody, based on our knowledge of their identity, they It should be..." The Chief Secretary hesitated a moment before he whispered: "Maybe Dulin's person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is he?", Ma Gus’s voice was accompanied by obvious accidents. Too many unexpected things happen some time, so let him have a little numb. His nostrils were slightly enlarged, and a stream of air was ejected from the nasal cavity. He picked up a piece of stationery that was not compacted on the table. "I know this thing. I don't want to leak it temporarily. I will talk to Du Lin." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr. General did not say how he discovered that these people might be Du Lin’s people, since he can speak out, he must have obtained some ironclad evidence, otherwise he will never talk nonsense in front of his prime minister. Some things can be planted, but some things are absolutely impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third thing, someone just contacted me on a single line, Mr. John has fainted, and has not been awake until now, may be long I am not awake in bed. At present, all things in the George family are taken over by Mark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to a few words, Magus hangs up and he does not understand. Why Du Lin suddenly opened fire to his "cooperators", so that the old John was unconscious. Magus knows the situation of these capitalists. Once Old John has not established a clear will, it is very likely that the George family will fall into the fight. Arthur’s uneasy guy and his uncle’s stake in John’s hands have long been drooling, and maybe they’ll start with John’s “reasonable” division of the George’s family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Mark... His time to take over family affairs is still very short, and he has not lived in the family for a long time, and the prestige is definitely insufficient. It is possible that the family may fall down as a result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin What do you want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus is in deep thought. At this stage, Du Lin’s main opponent should be the sacred consortium headed by the Cape family. Why suddenly and the George family have With such a contradiction that cannot be solved, it is necessary to retaliate through such fierce means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus has made a lot of guesses and inferences, but none of them is common sense, and how could he know that it all comes from "not compromising?" ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire upper class of the imperial capital was shaken by these three fires, and countless people immediately left the scene of social entertainment and returned to their homes. The occupancy rate of the telephone line reached instantly. The peak. Numerous intrigues and tricks are formed in the waves, and countless transactions are made at both ends of the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a more advanced primitive evolutionary forest. Only when you continue to swallow can you grow yourself. When a creature grows to a certain extent, those ordinary Species are no longer able to meet their evolutionary requirements, and only the same giant can give them the opportunity to evolve again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, a giant may be about to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the signal that Du Lin wants to release, but he did not expect that the signal flare did not hit the sky, but shot straight Mr. John, only Blaming his life is not good, igniting the sky with himself, illuminating the way others are moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tycoons of the Imperial City have been too busy for a very certain interest, and the phone ringing of Doolin’s voice has also ringed. The phone is from Irian. While calling, Nasha’s phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Mr. John fell, Mark immediately called Nasa to let her return to the Imperial Capital as quickly as possible, before Mr. John woke up. In time, he alone may not be able to hold Arthur and those uncles and uncles. Although Nasha is only a girl, she represents the first person in the third generation of the family. Every family has rules that cannot be easily destroyed, as well as in the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first person in the third generation, Nasa has a considerable part of the rights, so Mark needs her to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she came back, she called Doolin. "My father said that he was very unhappy with you, and then you set fire to the family." The most important industry, is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chick’s tone was with a questioning tone, and Du Lin chuckled twice. “I don’t deny it to your father. The contradiction, but Ms. Nasha, please pay attention to your words, a mayor is going to jail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So really is you Do you do?” Nasha’s gnashing voice can be heard through Du Lin’s long phone line. “Why are you doing this, is there anything that can’t be negotiated? Even if it’s on my face, you’re also You should first ventilate with me, you know that my grandfather is his..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin caught the core of this sentence in an instant, and asked, " What happened to Mr. John?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was mad at you, fell a lot of things!", Nasha has been here until Du Lin became her "good friend", but when Du Lin asked, she realized that the world is not what she imagined. She and Du Lin, the George family and the Doolin group are absolutely two lines. The person on it. She immediately lie a lie, very good to pick up the words. But can Du Lin not hear it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
