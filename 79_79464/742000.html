			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carroll’s brain is blank. At this time, he only knows what he is talking about. It’s a bureau, a very unconventional bureau, a rogue Bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stupid trick is actually fooled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of more than a dozen black holes, he can only do obedience, but he will not admit defeat, because Lewis is hiding next to him. After this deception, Karur suddenly thought of another question. If Xiu En was hiding next to him, why didn’t he find a problem when he sent someone to search the dock in the afternoon? Why did Lewis not see the horse when he was hiding? The repair of grace? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a trap for him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolin, Xiuen, Lewis, the three hybrids are just to get him into jail? If not, Lewis found Shuen, why not remind him? They must be colluded! Karur’s inner temper was smothered by deception, and his gloomy face almost dripped water, slowly raising his hands, slowly squatting on the ground, and then shame on the ground. He swears that if he can get through this difficult time, he will definitely let these hybrids pay the price they can't imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shin’s face rosy and pulled out the handcuffs from the waist, stepping on Carol’s shoulder and pulling his arm hard, hurting Carrollton screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, what about Du Lin?", one of the men looked at Du Lin who was sitting in the car and slowly reversing, whispering a reminder. "Would you like to stay with him? He used to be Tener's private wine giant. It is a feat to take him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced at the car that was falling backwards. Although the car was dark, he could still feel the look of Du Lin. He shook his head and said in a tone that he didn't even notice: "Don't worry about him, just put Karur into prison and stabilize my current position, Du Lin can't turn any waves!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as you can catch Karur and then get rid of Prando and the mayor, there is a place in the city. At that time, the private liquor industry was completely determined by him. Although he was arrested and sent back to the state bureau, he suffered a lot and suffered a lot of losses, but he understood one thing, something he had never considered before. The contraband investigation bureau is indeed in order to prevent the smuggling and trafficking of various contraband products in the name and actual work. The real intention of the new party leader, Magus, is to use the contraband investigation bureau as a means of political struggle to help the new party’s grassroots. The official opened the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the city of Tener, the old party is closely united and it is strictly forbidden for the new party to intervene in this area. The main job of his cultivation is not to catch the small gangsters who sell private liquor here. His main job should be to help the governor open. The work situation of the city of Tener has taken the initiative to become a banner of the new party in the city of Tener! He should play a political role, not a policeman who catches thieves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this kind of enlightenment and understanding, Xiu En feels that Du Lin’s is really only a trivial matter. Only by giving the big men’s old ones can they play themselves. A special role, recognized by the boss and the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has locked one end of the handcuffs on Carol’s wrist, just as he prepares to lock the other hand, Huge force pushed him forward, slamming his weight and falling to the ground. Immediately after the fierce gunshots, Xiuen immediately understood that this time he wanted to be a hunter, not only himself, but also others. Fortunately, he wore a bullet-proof vest, otherwise he could have taken his life with that shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He panted and hugged behind Carrull’s car, faintly seeing some black shadows on the containers stacked next to him through the window glass. Shaking, he shouted a counterattack and took the initiative to fire a shot, and immediately pointed out the enemy's direction to his allies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Prando looked at the three sides of the crossfire and had some unusual thoughts. This is a good opportunity. For him, this is a rare event. opportunity. There are three big people here, the director of the Bureau of Prohibitions, Xiu En, the only private wine tycoon in the city of Teruel, and the leader of the biggest gang in the city of Tener. Lewis, he has no friendship with these people, and there is no good feeling. On the contrary, he did not like these three people very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little headache when he remembered the name of Xien, and he was too lazy to recall it. Since Carol has become the "only", he has forgotten some things, forgot what he is, what position he occupies at any level, always a disgusting look, and he is not as polite as he used to be, even if he is not so polite It is like a kind of charity to give him money. If Prando’s hatred of Doolin and Sin is the hatred of the red fruit, then the dislike of Karur is like a soft disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Lewis is concerned, it’s even more remarkable. At present, the most powerful gang leader in the city, it is reasonable to say that no matter how Lewis is mixed, as long as his identity has not changed, Then he should always be shorter than Prando. Can this be the case? No! Lewis is the one-of-a-kind guy. Every time he looks at Prando's eyes, he makes Prando feel like he is being humiliated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is thinking about whether or not to leave these people behind, knowing that the members of the parliament have already revealed it to him a little. In view of the increasingly chaotic city of Tener, he waited to clear the entire city after the gold robbery ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think too long, let the gendarmerie soldiers who changed clothes start shooting. In order to avoid retrieving the identity of these gendarmes, and to avoid the damn Amp's gaze on the gendarmerie, they not only changed their clothes, but also changed their weapons. They were all pistols. In fact, even if Prando wants them to take out rifles, it is impossible. The gendarmerie can't take the initiative to interfere with the city's specific management during the non-war period without the joint signing of the mayor and the parliamentarians. In other words, even if the city has become a sinful capital, criminals are everywhere, but as long as the ordinary people's life order is not chaotic, there is no riots, they can only shrink in the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some policies can be enforced flexibly, but some things must be strictly enforced, especially in the military and in the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth party’s fire suddenly caused a brief pause in the exchange of fire between the three parties on the field. Now, let’s not say Karur, even the self-cultivation It is not clear what happened. Why is there so many people coming to a simple event? Where did these people emerge from the horse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Xiuen can ignore Du Lin, but Prando can’t do it. This time he has the most people, and the gendarmerie gives it. Thirty military soldiers trained in military training, he has seven or eight in his own hands, this is definitely a powerful force. He left his own confidant to continue to encircle the criminal group in the city of Tener, with a well-trained soldier to chase Du Lin. At this time, he ignored a very obvious problem, clearly that Du Lin could leave here immediately. Why is his speed so slow, just like deliberately catching up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando didn’t think about it. After he took Du Lin into a warehouse at the dock, the lights in the warehouse suddenly lit up. As white! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin still sat in the car, even if he didn't even look at it, Prando's pupils shrank, and a "Yes" blurted out! He saw, the rifles held in the hands of those people, his reason told him that he should be able to run away if he turned and flee now, but the sensibility occupied the commanding height. If he could win Du Lin and "evidence", he not only cracked the gold settlement. At the same time, it may be appreciated by the top leaders of the old party, and from then on to the peak of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human greed is the most terrible thing. Being timid will make people zoom in on risk and make people fear. But greed will make people ignore danger. Even if they are on the cliff, they will not hesitate to take the final step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is almost no suspense of crossfire in one minute, and the firepower of the rifle’s rate of fire is not that these people can rely on the body of the body. Resist. Even if the soldiers trained in the course of avoiding bullets, facing the intensive sweeping of the condescending, it is the same as the fart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last shot stopped, and Du Lin came down from the car and walked to Prando. This chubby guy may be able to breathe because of the thicker fat, which resists the lethality of some of the bullets. His eyes were a bit sloppy, as if he didn't see Du Lin, he stared at the wall and stared at a pendant. The pendant is hollow. After opening, there is a photo of his wife and his two children. His eyes have been locked in these two photos, as if entering an independent world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin kicked the pistol around him and squatted down. He grabbed the chain of the pendant from his hand and slammed it a few times before he rushed over. The heavy breathing was whistling, and his lungs were broken. He coughed blood and wanted to grab his own pendant, but he could only look at Du Lin and stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a very beautiful wife and a very cute child, I can understand people's uneasiness and worry about them when they are about to die. But please Rest assured my friends, I will send them greetings from me, I wish you happiness in the kingdom of heaven!", the pendant fell from the hands of Doolin, fell to the ground, in the eyes of Prando as a treasure pendant in the soles of Doolin Wail and smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes gradually dim, the body violently twitched a few times and then slowly tilted and stumbled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin drew a cross on his chest, prayed for him piously, then turned to look at his brothers and smiled and said: "Take Things are loaded on the boat, we can leave!", he actually understood, behind the Prando should be the group of the gendarmerie, but he still does not understand why the gendarmerie wants to kill him, this is a Very strange thing. But it doesn't matter, because he wants to leave, he will take everything, but he won't take hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day he will come back, pick up these hatreds again, and return the angry flames to those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
