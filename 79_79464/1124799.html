			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you are getting engaged...", Alisa looks at the green wheat fields in the distance, and the wind that keeps blowing makes the wheat sprouts in the wheat fields A road of wheat waves, the wind has become tangible and qualitative, and is being presented in a very different way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening of the summer, the wind blows on the human body and takes away the lingering heat left in the daytime, looking at the layers of wheat fields, lined with a red sunset The smell of the earth and the fragrance of the vegetation make people who are used to the high-rise buildings feel a sense of heart and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa holds the railing and looks at the horizon in the distance. She once had such a slight expectation that she might have become the wife of Doolin. But the reality is always so cruel and ruthless, breaking her fragile dream. When she knew the news that Du Lin was going to get engaged from Mr. Kesma, there was a feeling that she couldn’t say it, lack of oxygen, dizziness, and my heart seemed to split, but I could taste it carefully, but it was not so serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a wonderful relationship with Doolin, she has seriously considered this issue, and more may be the original surprise, and the embarrassment of two children, Love what... maybe, but maybe not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called discomfort is more likely to be a loss than a despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood by her side and tried to look into the distant sky. He replied to answer Alisa’s question, just like As he and Mr. Xerma said, this is what he has to do and a part of his experience in pursuing his pursuit of ideals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of girl is that?", Alisa’s gaze is recovered from the distant sky, watching Du Lin’s face, though not very handsome. It always gives people something that can't be ignored. His eyes are very god-like. Alisa sees from his eyes what he is watching - this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly thought of a very interesting question, until now, she did not have a deeper understanding of Du Lin, all the contacts are so Flows on the surface. She never knew what kind of pursuit Du Lin had, but also had terrible or not terrible pressure. His attitude towards life, attitude towards life, attitude towards his career, he completely did not know, let alone think To understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strange man. For her, Du Lin is like an ordinary passer-by. You may pass him by, but you don't have to know everything about him because he is just a passerby. But the most familiar stranger is the father of two children. They don’t understand each other completely, but they do things that only couples can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a fate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate is really wonderful, it has become a shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s heart was very calm at this time, and here he was able to calm down completely. He thought about it and replied, “Magus you. Do you know? The Prime Minister, the girl is his niece."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The niece of Magus? Is that a very powerful girl?", Alisa secretly made a comparison with herself and the girl who was about to get engaged with Doolin. Unfortunately, she couldn't find a place where she could beat her in any aspect, even if she had never seen the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "This is what I need. On the way to the end of my life journey, you can go over one step at a time, or you can run Going, I chose to ride a car, it was faster, and it allowed me to go further." He looked back at Alisa. "This is a deal, it has nothing to do with love, people like me, this It may be difficult for people to feel emotional in their lives." He laughed at himself. When a person has an unprecedented great ideal and wants to achieve it, the desired personal desire will be suppressed to the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know if there is such a person in the world, but there is one in the world of his dreams, and not one or two. Once an idealized thing emerges, it means that there is a more idealized goal, and some people believe that this more ideal goal can be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't fall in love with me, you will be very tired!", Du Lin suddenly raised his arm and licked Alisa's shoulder, and they stood in the sunset. Next, no one spoke, wearing the gauze weaved in the evening glow, watching the ups and downs of the wheat waves, rare in a quiet that should not be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Du Lin was assigned to Alisa's room, in fact, this room was originally his. Mason and Doolin sleep in a room in the four older children of the Mazma family. Merlin and Kinsale are twins, and they live in another room. Now these four children left home to pursue their careers. One of the two rooms that were vacated gave two children, and one of them was for Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible for Du Lin to go to the Kemasa couple, and it is impossible to squeeze with his younger siblings. It is even more impossible for Mr. Kemas to let him huddle with two children, especially Du Lin revealed. After giving the two children a kind fatherly love, he could only sleep in his own room, which is now the room where Alisa lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shower in the evening, the countryside bath is not like a villa or manor in the city, there will be a shallow well for non-drinking, The boys often stand directly beside the wellhead and wash their haha. The girls will have a shack dedicated to bathing, sending water to the large bucket on the shack, and then a pipe with a faucet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people in the city will not like it when they first come to the country, but they will find it after getting used to it. In fact, it is very good, at least very convenient, and summer. Especially cool - Merlin praised this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking a shower and changing clothes, and looking at the only bed in the room, Du Lin did not have a very hypocritical sleep on the floor, he lay directly The bed then set aside enough. Alisa didn't have any feelings. She was lying next to Doolin in her pajamas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the strangest state between two people. They are not husband and wife, they can hardly know each other completely, and they have not seen each other for a long time. . Even true couples will have some strange alienation if they do this, but this kind of thing that should exist does not exist between two people. They are naturally lying together like sleeping together every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Du Lin’s heartlessness, his head fell asleep with his pillow, Alisa finally performed normally, and she didn’t fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is lying next to her, and on countless nights she sometimes imagines that Doolin will come back one day and think of other things. At this time, she has neither heartbeat nor discomfort, and she is not too used to squeezing a bed with others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought a lot of things when she couldn’t sleep, such as what to do if two children grow up, for example, if they want to send them to a private school in the future. Going to school, for example, Doolin’s engagement ceremony will be very grand, for example... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa was gradually getting tired in countless cranky thoughts, and the eyelids became heavy until she didn’t even notice it, she slept. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the chicken outside the next morning sounded strangely. When Doolin opened his eyes, Anlisa was lying on his side and sleeping. He looked up at the sky outside the window, and then lightly Breaking away from Alisa's bondage, curiously went outside. In his memory, the chicken that screams in the morning is not so called, feels a bit... miserable? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know why there was such an idea. Maybe he thought that the sound of the chickens was very fierce. When he first went out, he saw Mr. Sitting in the easy chair and smoking a pipe, watching the two children run around by a group of old goose, but there is no idea to stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat next to him and ordered a cigarette. The father and son sat without talking, watching the old goose put two The children are flying chickens and jumping, this is perhaps the only poultry in the town that is not afraid of this brother? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why... are the chickens so called now?" Du Lin hurriedly asked when he was crowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma looked at him with a strange look and then impatiently pointed at the two laughing children. "They used soy. All the cocks that can be called are dumb..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when it comes to this matter, I have to blame Mr. Xerma himself, once he went to two The grandchildren showed off and said that when they were young, they were very poor at home. In order to eat a delicious meal, all the methods were detailed, including the "fishing chicken." It’s very common to go fishing, but the word “fishing chicken” makes the two children interested. Then Mr. Kema is very proud to tell the two boys to find a bigger soybean with a small hole in the middle. Then find a strong line and wear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing soybeans into the wall of the rich merchants used to raise poultry, shaking, feeling that when the line in the hand is a little heavy, you can catch the chicken It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the crystallization of the wisdom of the working people, because the big soybeans bear the chicken's scorpion, neither the cock nor the hen can call it. It will not cause the owner's suspicion. After stealing the hand, he will directly break the chicken neck, and you can eat a hearty delicious food without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story has greatly inspired the interest of two children, and then... the chickens in the town have been embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
