			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When three huge wooden boxes were sent to the manor, everyone was curious, and no one knew that this was called "television" by Du Lin. What is the meaning of the game. They vaguely remember that Du Lin seemed to say that he wanted to buy something back. Is this the case? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the efforts of the porters, these three huge cockroaches were finally placed where Dulin needed them. One in the living room may be habitually influenced by the world in the dream. Many people like to put the TV in the living room, so he also chose to do so. The second TV was placed in the newly-arranged room, which will be used as a "home theater". As for the third TV, it was placed in the bathroom on the second floor. For this reason, Du Lin also made a waterproof one. The glass cabinet is used to exclusively put on the TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world TV is a bit big, and it comes with a solid wood base, connected with the TV, it is estimated that there is at least one hundred kilograms. After sending the porters away, a group of people gathered in the living room, where they touched, touched them, and their eyes were curious about the TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin lightly coughed, then took the instructions, followed the process on the instructions to open a few buttons, put a roll of tape just unpacked into Played in the disc. Then he went to the sofa and sat down, letting the big guys let go, don't block his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the flashing screen like a dead fisheye flashed some snowflake points, the picture finally appeared. This is a movie last year, the box office can only say the general The investor has just returned to it. When the actor appeared on the TV, Du Lin heard the exclamation of the people around him. It was incredible. Can such a small thing actually play a movie? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin feels a bit boring, this black and white TV has long been eliminated in the dream, replaced by a thinner and more powerful TV . He just gave up for a while and gave up watching. He didn't turn off the TV, because everyone else was shrinking around the sofa and staring at the screen and occasionally there was something like interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV is the top priority in the next step, and politicians always say that every citizen has equal power in this new world. There is no class in it. However, this kind of political propaganda that is almost equivalent to fart does not say that Doolin does not believe it. Many people do not believe it, but some people believe it. This is the credit of public opinion. The newspaper trust headed by the George family always instills something at the right time for the middle class of this society, and they believe the politicians' sinister rhetoric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important and most indispensable force in this country is the middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor, the citizens of the underlying society do not know which party is better for ordinary people, more welfare, they only care if they can find a job, can they eat on their own Under the premise of fullness, the family can also eat. They don't care about politics, they don't want to care, they don't have a need at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only middle-class families will pay attention to these things, they can eat enough, have more time and more money to make some makeup for their own life. Good things, such as actively participating in political activities - elections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the election, they need to know who they can vote for, and also need to know whether the concept of governance will affect their lives after each candidate takes office. Where do they get this information? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it was a newspaper, then it might be a TV set in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there are too many word games hidden in the lines of text. Different things can be interpreted in different moods at different times. Is it simple? The host’s position with or without a position is enough to quickly shake their views. In the world of Doolin’s dream, there is a magical place called the United States. When they elect the president, they are not considering which candidate. People are more useful to society and the country, but to see which president can spend more money on propaganda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the act of top-up in a game that the world has been exposed to in the world is called 氪金, then that is the lowest level of gold, because the most advanced The gold is in the United States. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popularity plays a much greater role in politics, in current affairs, and in people's lives than people think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastering the intelligence network and illegal groups throughout the empire, mastering the main political voice of the future, his future social status and influence are self-evident . At that time, wealth was the least important thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, when Freena came back, they were already watching the fourth movie. The filmmaker soon joined the crowd watching TV. , and I look at it with relish. The rapid advancement of technology is also giving people more entertainment, while also changing the existing film industry. When she chatted with the director for the past two days, the director talked about this. Last year, some loss-making movies gradually began to return, and it was not the box office and the surrounding area that allowed him to return to this. tape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps in the future, the box office of a movie's total income is no longer the biggest income, these miniature tapes are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone on the first floor rang, and Dove knew that it was Du Lin’s after answering the phone. After hanging up the phone, she asked Freena to go up, and Du Lin looked for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s the first time, maybe Freina is still worried, she can stay here for a month, and she hasn’t seen Du Lin or anyone else. With any disgust, she settled down. She didn't think that Du Lin was looking for her to roll sheets with her. There should be other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the room was upstairs, the door was open. Du Lin was sitting at the desk in the middle hall and wrote something. She knocked on the door and Du Lintou also Don't lift up and say "sit" and continue to write your own things. She suppressed her curiosity and did not walk over, sitting in a chair not far from the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, Du Lin took down his hand and put down the pen in his hand. He recorded his plan for the next period of time on the book. As for whether this book will be lost or not, will anyone take the first step to take the chicken that belongs to his golden egg according to the plan on this book? He thinks it is unlikely because he uses Chinese characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at Freena, Du Lin smiled and relaxed on the back of the chair, just like a chat, asked: "You See the player below?", Freena nodded, and Du Lin said again: "The movie? Is it finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This period Movie time is not particularly long. About 80 minutes is a very standard time. Some movies will be shorter and some will be longer. The filming time of this film will not exceed 90 minutes, and the filming has entered the final end. Except for a part of the lens that needs to be re-shooted, it will end at least a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena nodded and said: "Next Monday should be almost over, I dare to thank you for your help, otherwise I can never be A big production heroine." She saw this very thoroughly, not that Dulin needed her, but that she needed Du Lin. Without Du Lin, he was only a supporting actress. Even the supporting actress with a little more drama was difficult to mix, and she had to face the choice she had made at Tyner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either follow the flow or sink to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea." Du Lin crossed his hands and fingers on the lower abdomen. "Do you see the girls below? I think they may be able to learn how to perform. I heard that there is no school specializing in performances. I plan to set up a school like this in Irian to teach some talented children to learn to perform. You are the most actor in the performance I have ever seen, and I believe that you will be a very good teacher." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You teach me the children to perform, if you have the right movie, you can also shoot, or invest by me. This is my general idea. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no surprise for Dulin’s idea, so for now, if you want to learn to perform, there are only two Places can go, one is a theater around the country, and the other is a production company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have their own points, but they all have their own shortcomings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theater generally only recruits young children, and it takes at least five to ten years to learn to perform there, or even longer, Freina herself is example. She was sent to the Tener Opera House to study opera and stage dramas from a very young age. It took more than a decade. Even worse, most theaters will sign a contract with their parents. At least for the next ten years, children will need to be boarded in the theater for closed management and learning, unless ta has no potential and talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the production company, it is more commercialized. There is no age limit for learning performances in them, but it is necessary to sign a very strict contract and learn. After the end of the period, they had to take a few unpaid films for the company to get out. There are also provisions for breach of contract. Once you are carrying a job outside the production company, or you are away from company management, you will need to face breach of contract compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a pure performance school? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena had nothing to tangled with herself. After she left Turner, she spent more than half a year in the film circle of the Imperial Capital. In addition to the scammers and third-rate directors and producers who want to get her to bed, she is hard to get away with. There are always some people in this world who are better than you, more beautiful than you, and more than you are to sell everything. If there is not a rich man who wants to get her to bed, she has no choice but to make an attempt. It is impossible for her to come here, and it is even less likely to be the heroine of the film. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
