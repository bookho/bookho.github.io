			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pushed the plate in front of him and sat back, his hands clinging to Richard, "Mr. Richard, I don't Knowing that you know the price between me and other suppliers, whether they told you or you accidentally heard it, it doesn't matter. But you definitely have to listen to something, or others tell less. Some things about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big order of 50,000 bottles a year is in front of you, let alone Du Lin satirizes him a few words, even if he beats him, he can Laugh out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling a product earns 10,000 pieces and sells 50,000 items to earn 5,000 pieces. From the point of view of profit, it seems that the former's income is greater, but as long as It is a smart businessman who will choose the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big capital home, there is a business saying: "Businessmen who do not enter the stream sell goods, low-ranking merchants sell brands, and higher-level merchants sell the market." This sentence is actually very well understood. For small businessman hawkers, they are always pursuing the return rate of individual commodities, as long as they have money to earn. And a slightly more advanced businessman is doing the brand and is the value of the brand. Even a single piece of merchandise, even if the profit margin is large, is a big profit from a successful brand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said that the moon brand almond bar, the manufacturer’s profit is about 30, and sells 100 million bottles, which is 30 million. But what about the moon brand? As long as you do well, the value of the brand is more than 50 million! Moreover, the value of this brand will continue to increase with increasing production and more perfect sales channels. The brand value will always exceed the value of the product itself for countless times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most senior businessman is doing the market. Markets and commodities can be said to be completely two levels of things. When low-level merchants are still playing with the tricks of profit and brand, senior businessmen have begun to operate with market share as a standard. For them, one percent of the market share means millions, tens of millions or even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard heard this and carefully thought about it when he knew that Doolin’s needs ranged from 10,000 bottles to 50,000 bottles. I know that the opportunity to change my life is coming. Not many 50,000 bottles? It is only a small amount in the whole world, but for Tener's wine market, it may account for 10% to 20%. Once the 50,000 bottles can be rolled out, it means that the market share of the moon brand almond wine has increased sharply! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the increase in market share mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; means a commodity, a brand, and an enterprise’s absolute control over the market! No matter what kind of new wines are introduced in the future, they can be quickly converted into consumption power through market share. Even if they sell shit, they will be crazy in the process of occupying the decline! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer a business of just 50,000 bottles of wine, this is an opportunity, a hope, a future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Doolin’s ridicule, the smile on Richard’s face has not changed, maybe, but the smile will only become more humble . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his head and pulled out a small iron box from his pocket, which contained a box of ninety-eight cigarettes in the city of Tener. Among the cigarettes that can be purchased, it is the best one. He handed the cigarettes in his hands, and after Du Lin took over, he learned the way Mr. Kesma looked and smelled under his nose before he slammed into his mouth. Richard immediately took out his own custom lighter, slammed it and rushed it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucking two spit out a smog, Du Lin said with a smile: "I have signed a letter of intent with two of them, they gave me more price." The offer, but also promised to be willing to customize the shape and label for the wine I need. To be honest, Mr. Richard, I think this price is unbearable, and even if you can offer the same price, I am very It’s hard to continue to make a deal with you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard seriously thought about it. In fact, this kind of glass is not expensive, but it is very cheap. More than a hundred years ago, glass was arguably the second most precious thing behind gems, and it was dominated by a handful of merchants. But when the world war began, when a burning bomb landed on the beach and burned a layer of crystals, the glass has evolved and evolved over a hundred years, and it has been cheap to negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The label is not expensive, you can print five pennies, count the cost of typesetting and stereotypes, and customize the bottle and label cost per bottle. penny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke with almost hesitation and discretion after almost half a minute, and asked with some caution: "Is it because of liquidated damages?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "It is true. There are two letters of intent, one for seven hundred stars and one for one thousand stars. It is because of these agreements. Exist, so I can't continue to work with you. After all, these liquidated damages are not a small amount, what do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Du Lin’s words made Richard fall into trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that if Du Lin signed the letter of intent and agreed to a breach of contract, if Du Lin broke the contract, he would lose 1,700. But in the face of a huge market share in front of the eyes but not to go, and let him itch like a cat scratching. He thought about whether Du Lin could get the wine to sell, but he quickly left the idea behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he buys it and hides it, it is not for sale. For Richard, it is nothing but a profitable business. But what if he sells it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a big deal, a long-term and growing deal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no loss at all, why not gamble? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that you have been in this damn country town for more than a year, even the cost of shipping and peace days can’t be saved, thinking that further is a huge market and profit, The nature of the businessman has finally broken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen are actually doing business similar to gambling, optimistic about a business, then investing, operating, and finally failing to make the most important thing besides being able to be artificially controlled. It is also the vision of the initial choice of investment direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made a decision at this time, biting his teeth, and the hand that hangs under the table hides his thigh, and he is going to hurt. When he cried, he took a deep breath and said with sincerity: "We are friends, Mr. Doolin. God makes us know each other and become friends. It is not unreasonable. We should help each other, isn't it? I think, I will give the liquidated damages, Almond wine, the moon card, fifty-eight points!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasped and looked at Du Lin, this time really The pickpocket. A bottle of almond wine free federal wine industry union and the Ministry of Commerce will subsidize him two cents, the cost is forty-five cents, the transportation cost is about three cents, that is to say, to sell a bottle of wine, he Only earned is twelve points. Among them, he also needs to bear the loss during transportation, as well as the cost of warehouse and labor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net profit of a bottle of wine is about a little more than nine cents! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profit of 50,000 bottles is only 5,000 yuan, but he has to pay 1,700 pieces of liquidated damages in one breath. It is really a bit painful to say. But he soon thought that as long as the sales of the moon brand almond wine opened, the next step was a steady stream of money and more money. And the channel doesn't need him to do it. Du Lin's hand holding 50,000 bottles of wine will definitely open the channel more than himself, which is equivalent to making a lot of money for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
