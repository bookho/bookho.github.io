			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice immediately returned to the restaurant behind her, which is the restaurant that made her "temporary bankruptcy". She found the waiter who was working as a waiter. With his arm applied for excitement shouted: "Quick, go take the camera out, something big!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the class can't fully understand Alice Silk's excitement comes from here, but in recent years he has a good understanding with Alice. It is definitely not a trivial matter to know that Alice can be so rude. Immediately, he turned and looked at the entrance of the employee from one side. Restaurant staff lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he came out again, Alice had taken off her apron and stood on the side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you see that car?", Alice raised her chin, and the photographer followed her gaze and found the road across the road. Parked on a very ordinary car. With his knowledge of the car, you can see that this is one of the civilian family cars developed by the Empire's largest truck manufacturer. The date of production is two years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This car has been highly anticipated by designers and manufacturers who believe that this car can take a certain share of the low-end car market, thus getting rid of the product In the middle of the situation, trucks are so embarrassing that the products are diversified. It is a pity that the sales of this car are very general. Most buyers think that it is not comfortable enough, and the style of driving is hard. If the road is not good, it will be very bumpy... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you discuss the shortcomings, you can't finish it all day and night, but if you have something to say, you can finish all three sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin, reliable, low failure rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of design and production, manufacturers involuntarily joined their habit of producing trucks, the vehicle materials are very willing, said to be at a distance of 30 meters The body of this car can defend against the pistol bullet attack, which can offset most of the damage of the rifle bullets in about 200 meters. Its accessories are also very "rude", so detailed as the luxury car manufacturers like House, as long as it is not a part quality problem, you can certainly fix it after reading the instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many gangs are more fond of this car, so this car has also been dubbed "gang masterpieces". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the class, "What happened to it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice lowered her head slightly, lowered her tone, and said softly: "I just saw four people in the Inside is time...", her eyes are shining with amazing brilliance, and the picture in memory has never been so clear. She even remembered that the four men were wearing black gloves and windbreakers, and some of them wore sunglasses. When they got off the bus, they also brought a hat. If these four people are killers, then there is only one object worthy of four killers in the vicinity, that is Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice couldn’t help but feel excited when she thought she was about to witness a murder and the goal was still the mayor. This is definitely a big news, the kind that can shake the whole world. She raises her eyes and glances at the class. "Can you shoot this light without the spotlight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Following his eyes and looking up at the sun over the city of Otis, he nodded and said, "No problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next we are famous Making a fortune, or going back to being an unnamed independent journalist, it’s up to you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shot in the chest and asked, “What about you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?", Alice’s smile was somewhat flaming, and she said with a smile: "Of course, to be a witness to history, at the scene." Also, in your photo, do you understand?", she said as she walked across the road, "Let's find a high place, think of ways to frame me with Du Lin!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dooling did not know that the danger was close. He waited for everyone to laugh, and shrugged his shoulders. "I was originally A lot of words want to say, but you smiled like this, I forgot what I should say...", the laughter sounded again, and some people who didn’t have much affection for politicians couldn’t help but have some good feelings for Du Lin, Du Lin’s The hand presses weakly, which makes the laughter weaken a lot. "Well, you can't always stand here, always say something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then let Let me say the city of Otis, talk about the future and challenges we face!", the title is not like a casual talk, the square is quiet, Du Lin hands on the podium He looked calmly in the square. "Everyone knows the city of Otis in the past, so I don't need to remind you of the past. I only talk about the future."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In my plan, the traffic in this city will become well-connected. Perhaps you already know that the City Hall and the federal joint construction work will build two railways from here, running through the east and west. The mountains, plus the corridors of things we originally owned, the city of Otis will play an important role in the transportation hub of the imperial heart in the next 30 years. I think everyone should understand the economic value and political value."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When someone comes, someone will go, the mobile population and a large number of goods will provide the city with more economic resources, provide more jobs, everyone will have It is suitable for your job, and it is in short supply. At that time, you are not asking others to hire you, but you are going to choose a bigger employer and a more comfortable job. For all the people who are fighting for the city at this moment, I Need to say thank you, because to complete this great dream not only needs me, but also you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will become a In the bustling metropolis, we don't need to envy other cities, whether it is Nano Lindes or the Imperial Capital. On the contrary, they need to envy us in a few years. Because we have better welfare guarantees, better urban systems, and A better social structure. Many people have been talking about the Empire Dream, but what I want to say is the Otis Dream, a dream that can really be touched by everyone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we have a bright future, and naturally we will face some challenges. These challenges come from..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s voice suddenly stopped. After all, because the people in the distance suddenly stunned in the end, accompanied by a "grab thief" people went back. Perhaps in the hearts of everyone, the "mayor" is not as good as the "thief", because the mayor can see it every day, but the thief is not so easy to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heite, who is responsible for maintaining law and order, waved his hand immediately, and several police officers ran quickly toward the place where the riots occurred, some hidden bodyguards in the crowd. Attention is also drawn to attention by things that happen not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God is on, he has a dagger!", another scream, Doolin frowned, and he tilted his head and said to Heite around him. "Go and see what's going on, when necessary..." He glanced at Hait. Hite held the police cap with one hand and straightened the brim. One hand pressed quickly on the gun bag. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the double interference of the police and bodyguards, the riots seem to soon subside, and two of the wolverine young people and the police are twisting together, most of them When people were paying attention to the police fighting the thief, some people in the crowd raised their arms against Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin's eyelids slid into the back of the podium, and the podium was made of wood. At such a close distance, the penetrating power of the pistol bullet could not be resisted. The slashing sawdust slaps the sound of the sound, everyone is crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone actually shot the mayor in front of so many citizens? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a chaos in the entire square, and the assassins hidden in the crowd dispersed with the people who panicked around, disappearing without a shadow. trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;侄Sun first stepped back, he started the car, and the other three took the car and then stepped on the power cabin pedal, the car almost hit the person , rubbing a few passers-by with dust and disappearing at the end of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you hit him?", leaving the Town Hall Square, the road conditions are much better, and there are not so many pedestrians running around, he has the opportunity to divide The heart asked about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three did not speak, just when the grandson felt a little disappointed, one of the guys said: "I feel that I should hit him, he saw him. When I was kneeling, my shoulders looked backwards..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin returned to the city hall with his arm escorted by several policemen. He took off. A jacket and a dark shirt reveal a wound on the big arm. The bullet ran through his arm, and it was hard to say that the injury did not hurt the bone. He tried to raise his arm. Although it hurts and is a little hard, there should be no big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you caught someone?", he did not show the slightest weakness, as if the gun did not hit him at all, he let Dove He cleaned up the wound and looked at Hite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite shook his head. "There are too many people, everyone is moving, we can hardly find the gunmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clue?", Du Lin's brow slightly twisted, I don't know because the action of Dove's hand is a little heavy, or the answer to Hite is not slow, "I believe this is absolutely It’s not sudden, it must be premeditated. Look for people around you to see if there are a bunch of people who behave strangely and rent a room. First find their temporary dens.” Du Lin calmly analyzed The brain in the brain is rotating out of a whirlpool. He recalls how the big dreams in the dream deal with similar things and how to detect clues in the TV drama, while slowing down the breathing and calming the heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
