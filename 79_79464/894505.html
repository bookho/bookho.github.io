			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this cargo ship chose to cooperate, two training ships with the Jolly Roger did not take the initiative to launch an attack, parked in a place not far from the cargo ship, and used The slogan, let all of them stand on the deck, put their hands on the visible places, and ask them to disarm them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant followed the requirements of these two very special pirate ships, so that everyone stood on the deck and placed all the weapons they carried with them. The place where these people can see. Not long after one of the pirate ships put down the boat, more than a dozen people came to the cargo ship with a gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cargo ship is not big, it is not far from the empire to the federation, it belongs to the deconstruction of the inner sea, it is surrounded by the continental shelf, there is no such horrible storm, the only trouble There are many reefs, but as long as they are not close to the coastline, there is nothing wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After boarding the cargo ship, Lieutenant was more certain that these people were military, and most likely the navy, he saw militarization from their behavior Something left after training. For example, the formation, such as the posture when holding a gun, such as the cooperation between them. Only professional soldiers will train these things, and those pirates do not care about training without training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you hit it, you can hit it, but you can run it. This is the survival rule of pirates on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the person in charge of this operation..., I have something to say to your leader.", Lieutenant specifically used the "action" as a professional. The term, not the task, the other party reacted immediately, and the two men discussed for a moment, and one of them nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;中尉 raised his hands and walked slowly. He thought he could reach the superior officers of these people and explained that the operation was the Army Department. A colonel command with a great future, strictly speaking, everyone is their own, and there will be no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Thomas looked annoyed at the boat that was going back and forth, some angry walking towards the ramp, he looked at the two players A crew member boarded the training ship and immediately scolded: "What happened, what do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, don't be angry, I explain "Now!", Lieutenant immediately stood up. This is what he asked. Naturally, the other two good-natured naval soldiers could not be used to make a black pot for him. He introduced himself. "I am the lieutenant of the Imperial Army Army Base in Cannes. This time, in accordance with the requirements of the superiors, we transported a number of important things to the Federation. This is a secret military operation. There are no written notices and documents, so there may be a slight misunderstanding between us." His own military officer's card was handed to Thomas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Thomas glanced at it, he knew that the officer's card was true. There was a lot of stuff there. He put the officer's card in his pocket and asked, "Misunder? What misunderstanding?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle stunned, then laughed. "Although you and your men concealed very well, I almost thought you were really pirates, but I know that you are an Imperial Navy, so this It’s a misunderstanding, we are our own people!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lieutenant did not welcome Colonel Thomas’s amiable smile. He ushered in a bullet and shot directly. He got his head and flew the skull of the back of the head. Colonel Thomas snorted and pointed to the two subordinates. "Do you have a brain eaten by a dog? We are pirates now, understand? No matter who the other person is, it is just our goal, and immediately perform the task, idiot!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he shouted again, and pointed to the lieutenant who was surprised to die and could not die again: "Throw him into the water." In the evening, you two cleaning decks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A completely unequal killing has ended at the beginning, this kind of thing is not the first I did it once, but this time they killed everyone. They used to grab the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artwork in the cargo ship was carried intact to the training ship, and Colonel Thomas returned to the naval base with these things and reported this to the Major General. The process and results of the second action. For two stupid soldiers who made a wrong judgment in "wartime action," Major General said that the training of these two people needs to be increased, the time is one month. He also asked what was on the boat, and he was able to call Du Lin very concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be some art..." Thomas honestly replied that he had unpacked a flat wooden shelf and found a pair A painting that is tightly wrapped in sheepskin. He doesn't understand art and their value, but he can guess what Du Lin cares about, and it must be worth a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger minor’s little eyes suddenly light up. “Is this action goal rebellious?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thomas just prepared to say that there was no resistance, but he subconsciously looked at the Major General, and suddenly realized that "they had a fierce resistance, and finally we had to shell their cargo ships and force them to give up their resistance."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So there is no loss?", Major General is very satisfied with Thomas's witty answer, perhaps before he retires, he can try to hold him to the position of Brigadier General. As long as he can continue to bring more benefits to the Navy, the old friends of the lesser will not mind someone picking up their class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has found something that will allow him to live a comfortable life after retirement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Major General, because of the shelling of the cargo ship's cabin, some of the cargo was washed into the sea, we only saved a part of it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, very good!", Major General left his seat and walked to Thomas, raised his hand and patted him on the shoulder. "You are doing very well. Give the truth to Mr. Doolin and tell him that we regret that we didn't get back all the things he wanted." After he finished his head, he went outside. "I went to see what was lost." In the event that Mr. Doolin blames us, we have a few in my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas rolled his eyes and stood for a while before picking up the phone. It’s really not good to play, but you have already made a choice, and he has no way to object. He took a deep breath and sown the last number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be "loss" for this shipment. Du Lin knew from the beginning that the navy’s life was not good and that the general’s days would not be How comfortable it is, if it is not for them to hire the Navy to become their own smuggling channel, it is very likely that the days of the Irian Naval Base will be even more difficult. Although I feel that the little old man is not paying attention to it, Du Lin is not selling the old man's feelings, but Thomas's human feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is still retiring in two years. If there is no accident, Colonel Thomas’s performance in the past few years is among the best in Irian and even the East Coast. The commander of the next base is very likely to be taken by Colonel Thomas. Plus Du Lin is willing to spend some money for Colonel Thomas to help him, so today is not a thing. A person who is awkward about himself is better than someone who always feels that he has suffered a loss in his own place. From another perspective, this is a good thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s tone was very easy to express his understanding and understanding to Colonel Thomas, which made Colonel Thomas very moved and relieved. He was afraid that Du Lin felt that he had been pitted, and then interrupted the transportation agreement. At that time, the younger ones will definitely not have an accident, and only the ones will happen. Fortunately, Du Lin was very understanding, and said that he would ask him to eat after the election, which also made him realize what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
