			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at five o'clock in the morning, when Du Lin woke up, the genius was slightly cold. He touched the blanket that had slipped on his lap and hit it. A sneeze. It was a bit cold. He took the blanket and put it on his shoulder and walked to the bathroom. When he felt cold, taking a hot bath was undoubtedly the best way to chill. Watching the bath filled with hot water, he took off his clothes and lay in, comfortably sighed, and then began to think about the next thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of things going on, mainly in three areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first aspect is to create a hotspot of public opinion, let people know that there are still a large group of slaves from all over the world, who are enslaved by mine owners and let them engage in the most dangerous work. They gave them the worst treatment, and they often beat and killed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person always has a kind of thing that is not needed after having a stable life. This thing is called morality. Morality is a magical thing that will make some people feel angry or pity for something, even if they have done it before, or have done something similar. They will never feel embarrassed, regretful or otherwise emotional when they have done it in the past. They will only feel anger and disgust for those who are doing these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the incomparable moral high ground, it is selfishness, and such people are well utilized. How bad they used to be, how good they want to behave now, and of course they are sad people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect is about the overall strategic problem in the west. At present, many farmland has started to cultivate, and the first batch of vegetables can be sold in up to two months, but So far, Du Lin has not found any dealers who are willing to pack to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All interested dealers have the same opinion and his pricing is problematic. Sell ​​a penny of pounds of vegetables to fifteen cents a pound. If it’s not crazy, it’s a problem with the brain. No one will be willing to spend 15 cents to buy a penny to buy something, even if you blow it again. No matter how good it is. What people need is life. Those people almost tell Du Lin that he doesn't understand life at all. He doesn't know what ordinary people's life looks like. His shit pricing is not as good as his liquor pricing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, their words and tone are very polite, and they are full of praise and marvel at Doolin’s pricing strategy and ideas in the process of speaking. Lin is able to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to sell high-priced vegetables not to make money, but to bear the consumption of his western strategy, so there must be something that can be self-sufficient to make him relieve the heavy burden. So far, the farmland is only what he can think of, and the most likely to achieve of. In fact, he also considered tobacco at the beginning, and the profits of tobacco have been seen more than once in the world of dreams. However, tobacco is not suitable for this period of time and requires a lot of investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tobacco companies who survived the federal merchant dumping strategy have their own loyal customers, and now the economic situation is getting better so that they can start to harvest dividends, Du Lin thinks To do tobacco, you first need to invest a lot of money to set up tobacco companies and factories, buy large pieces of land suitable for growing tobacco, and grow large quantities of tobacco. Then he needs to advertise, open up new sales channels, and then compete with these already established tobacco companies, all of which take one to two years to complete, and the funds invested are calculated in tens of millions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t have this time, and he doesn’t have the energy and money. What he needs is something that is small and quick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to start the “exquisite life enjoyment” plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect is to master a certain force basis, because after three years, it is a general election, which is exactly three years and five months later. At that time, if his plan succeeded, then there is no doubt that he will certainly win the entire west, become the first governor of the guar in the west, and will be the first non-Augdean in the history of the empire. Governor. Once Magus wants to turn his face and find a reason to get him down and put it into action, the force he holds in his hands can be a necessary condition for escorting him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very clear that Magus is a very important person, or that this person has always been very problem-seeking. He does not think about the changes that a person's own things will bring to a family or a city like ordinary people. He considers how his own policies, ideas, and ideas will change the empire and even the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has two choices. The first option is to deprive Doolin of the last governor’s position in the civil libertial vote, and remove all of his department’s Government officials, blatantly violating their own laws, destroying the so-called freedom and justice, allowing the empire to slip into an unknown abyss, and possibly fly to heaven. Moreover, the force that Du Lin possessed is very likely to turn such a political scandal into a military confrontation, and finally let Du Lin occupy the west by means of armed separation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has a choice. In order to avoid the unity and integrity of the empire's territory, in order to avoid possible armed confrontation and civil war, and to protect the empire from any harm, he will compromise to a large extent. He will admit that Dulin’s position is legal, admit that Dulin’s officials are legal, accept Du Lin’s formal participation in this minority game, and then eliminate Du Lin in the rules by game. Drop it. Only in this way will there be no destructive consequences. Only in this way will he maintain the situation of the empire that is getting better and better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Du Lin really had the power, not someone else gave him, but he himself fought for himself through his own efforts and hard work. A power that really belongs to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is unknowingly lit up. After eating breakfast, I read a newspaper for a while, only a little more than eight, and four "scams" the mine of Doolin. The main brushing appeared outside the villa of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time their attitude and last attitude have changed dramatically. The last time they met, they still had a "I really don’t want to sell you." Such a foreigner, if you don’t look at your sincerity, you can’t have such a deal. There is a hint of tone in your tone and look that you don’t know where to come from, and they still step on it. The liar of the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, these four people are head down, a cautious look, standing in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin leaned his legs against the sofa to read the newspaper, Otis Daily. After eight months of work, the mountains on the east side of the city of Otis have been completed. The joint construction began to attack the mountains in the west. It is expected that the east-west direction will be fully open for half a year. This good news has made all walks of life in the city of Otis optimistic. The major analysts of Xie Lisi Street also predict that the city of Otis will start from next year, and the annual income of the city hall will be no less than 200 million yuan. This is definitely a miracle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the newspaper also brought along the Otis City Mayor and the Cape Family, still in the lawsuit, and the Audi that was delayed until today. City listing plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cape family has discovered Doolin’s conspiracy, Du Lin has missed two trials, and the Supreme Court has sent him several subpoenas and told If he is absent from the third trial, then even if they withdraw their case. Because Du Lin was the first witness at the same time as his victim, his absence made the court unable to proceed. The Cape family has already protested and believes that Doolin is deliberately delaying the process of the lawsuit in order to commercialize the industry of the Cape family and the hymn community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
