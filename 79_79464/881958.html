			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lapuan is a very generous person. He pointed out that the wine in Mr. Tucks’s hand shouted to the bartender behind the bar. Mr. Tucks’s wine is on my account!”, when he said this, the bar laughed in the bar, and even the clothes on the stage were still hot, and they continued to stretch. Girls who use the body to move in the air and the airflow to remove heat from the surface of the body can't help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that Mr. Tucks is a very wealthy person, and this first time Mr.’s party is really a bit... funny . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone is pointing at a passerby on the road, saying that this is a rich person, the person who might hear this sentence has the concept of "rich" Still staying on the basis of more money than the average person. But when this person points to a person in a wealthy area where the rich are gathered, he says that this is a rich man, then this person may be really rich, no longer the meaning of ordinary rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Tucks first appeared in the bar, he invited everyone, including the waiters and all the performers, to drink a bottle of wine. The damned bar owner laughed and smiled, and smirked a group of high-end wines from other bars. After that, he has done this many times. Basically, his birthday, his wife's birthday and the birthday of a dog in his family will come to everyone to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for others asking him... How do you feel like this is a joke? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucks raised his hand and everyone closed his mouth. He looked at the man who claimed to be Lapian and said with a smile: Your mind I understand, but you don't need it!", he shook his head slightly at the bartender, and the latter smiled with a smile. "Talk about it, what can I do to help you?" His eyes returned. Mr. Lapuan’s body, “Listen to your accent, you don’t seem to be a native.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lapuan nodded, “I am from the Empire, and I And Du Lin was a good friend. He went to find me some time ago. We talked a few words." When he heard that Du Lin went to the purpose and presented himself with a bouquet of flowers, he also talked with his tombstone. At the time of the meeting, Amp had a strange mood spreading. Perhaps as many books have said, what you probably know best is not your loved ones and friends, but your enemies, and only the enemy will remember your name for a long time to come. And the threats you have brought to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in his life, he uttered a word in his mind called a confidant. But what he has to do now is to implement justice and find a way to let Du Lin accept the trial he should be subjected to. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucks heard that when he said the name of Doolin, the alert after the smile was reduced a lot, the sitting position was slightly collapsed, and he shrugged. "Dulin? That's a smart guy. If it weren't for him, there wouldn't be my life now." He said with a long lingering sigh of relief, as if he was lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapuan wrinkled his brow inadvertently and then stretched out. "Du Lin is indeed a very intelligent person, always making me helpless. And he Too much like to break the rules, this is not good. Of course, we should be considerate of young people, after all, the young nature is comfortable, this is his youth, but also the price of his growth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s very good, Lapian...Is that you can call it?", after Mr. Lapuan’s consent, the relationship between the two has been closer, which allows the girl on the stage. Hey, crying, and finally, when she was on stage, Mr. Tucks came, thinking about being able to make a big profit. I didn’t expect him to forget about himself with a guy who didn’t look so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swears that she must make Mr. Tucks look good and make him ugly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl turned around and turned her back to Tucks. She bent down and picked up her ass. She also made a face, and the laughter was alarming. Mr. Tucks, who was chatting with Mr. Lapuan, looked at the girl and apologized for taking out the money in the box. There were two hundred pieces, and then one was thrown out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar was filled with whistles and cheers, and some people also lost a few dozen pieces to let the girl run to the edge of the stage. He squatted on Mr. Tucks’ neck on the stage and took a kiss on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a small meeting, she has already got two hundred and three small three hundred, and today’s mission is completed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucks is not annoyed, smiles and pushes the girl away. "Well, my father will kill me!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are a burst of laughter, although Mr. Tucks often spends a lot of money here, it’s one or two hundred and three hundred and five hundred, but he has never touched it here. Any girl. Some people say that he is a man who is afraid of his wife, but the girls think that he is not afraid, but respect, and especially the woman who is lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and looked back apologetically. "Where did we talk about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapuan immediately said, "Like us Speaking of Du Lin is a smart guy, with his help, your career has developed very smoothly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there?", Mr. Tucks wants I thought, he was not sure. He drank a little wine and suddenly had a nap. He really couldn’t remember it. He could only continue to say, "Dulin is a good boy. I was at Irian. I have never heard of a small jewelry store. I mainly sold some agate and gems. Then one day, a young man came to my store and asked if I wanted to make a big business. He can provide enough gold..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapuan’s heartbeat is like a racing car on the runway, the code table has run to sixty yards, he swallowed Spoofing, looking at Mr. Tucks, who is drinking and looking down, can’t wait to carry his neck and let him continue to say . His fingers are constantly drawing circles on the mouth of the wine glass, and the speed is getting faster and faster, but he does not seem to be in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Later...he did, a lot of gold was sent to my store with a very simple box, and then we opened the jewelry store now. Mr. Tucks shook his head with a smile. "You may not know, in fact, my jewelry store is the inheritance of my grandfather. He is a small and famous jeweler who used to make jewelry for the little nobles. By the time of my generation, the nobles were almost finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I would lose my ancestral business, but I didn't expect it to be carried forward with the help of Du Lin. Grandfather, he will be very happy in the kingdom of heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapuan took a sip of wine and calmed down the heart of the continually moving heart. Still feeling dry, he asked for a glass of ice water and then asked, "Why are you coming here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax looked Look at the surrounding environment, "because it is more suitable for wealthy people to live in, and the jewelry store does not need me to ask again. Du Lin has arranged for me to be perfect. We have three shareholders, plus he and I are five people. I am assured of Du Lin, I believe him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lapian sighed. "I really envy your life, freedom, fun, and much better than me. You may not believe it. I am also a jeweler, and the main business is gold." This is the reason why I and Du Lin knew each other. We originally rushed to grab a batch of gold purchase rights, and finally he won, and then we became good friends.", Lapuan looked back at the past sigh, " Very embarrassing to ask, are you still using Raphael's gold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raphael? No, we are using Mr. Federley's gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapuan I also know Federley's expression, use one A weird expression said: "Fedley? That's a greedy guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucks doesn’t seem to notice that Lapian has After he had a lot of words, he drank another glass of wine. The feeling of slight dizziness was so wonderful. "Mr. Federley compares in terms of money... sorry, hey, but his supply is stable and stable. It's what we need. You can't imagine how much profit our jewelry store can bring every month. Although I only make up 15% of the shares, it is already an amazing asset."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked a lot, until the sky turned black, Mr. Tucks strongly invited Mr. Lapuan to have dinner together, but Mr. Lapuan was going to take a boat at night. Leave, so you can only put the opportunity to the next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After bidding farewell to Mr. Tucks, Lapuan - or Amp limped into the car and boarded the return home passenger ship. He has used too much time and resources during this holiday to find out the specific place of residence of Mr. Tucks. If he wants to continue checking, he can only wait for the next time. However, he did not have nothing to gain. First of all, he knew that Du Lin did indeed go to see Tucks with gold. If he could prove that the gold had no legal source, he could infer the gold and Tnel in inference. The lost gold is tied together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspecting the operating income of jewelry stores through the tax system of Irian City and the gold raw materials that Du Lin received from Federley, if there is more than the comparison Part of the gold that came out, it is very likely that the 30 million gold he got is not fully sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Federley is also a very important clue. After the end of this working time, he will seize this line and check it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that under the premise that Doolin does not know that he is still alive, he will never know that someone has approached the truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Dulin’s most deadly point. Once the evidence in this series bursts out, he’s afraid that he won’t even save time. He’s panicked. Next, it will expose more problems, so that Amp has more evidence to nail him to the dock! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
