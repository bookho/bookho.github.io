			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every household, I will give you 10,000!", when Du Lin said this sentence, even the faces of the citizens who had already moved There was an instinctive look on the top. Some people even wanted to stand up and walk towards the little monk, but the words of Du Lin dispelled their impulses and thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, after you took the money, leave the city of Otis immediately. I tell you these people on behalf of the city. I don't welcome you here!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at other people, "My commitment is still valid, I will not only lead you to change the city, let outside people see it as a garbage pair. Look, let them know that their eyes may not be able to see the world, and I will assure you that most of you will become rich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ten thousand? That's just a part!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a young man who was embarrassed to stand up. He looked back and looked down and asked: " Mr. Mayor, you said that most people, then there are some people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin replied with a smile: “All hardworking people are willing to pay People can get my promised life. But I can't guarantee that everyone is diligent, they are willing to pay, always Some people are daydreaming, dreaming of falling pies and banknotes from the sky. These people will not be in my promise, I can't let these people share the fruits of your efforts, it will be for you. The humiliation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted a few clothes, surrounded by construction sites, the dust is a bit big, only stood for a little while on the shoulders and fell some The dust visible to the naked eye, he looked at those who were awkward and unwilling to relocate. "I will let the Secretary of Hait send the money to your hands, and then will send you away, and please do not regret what you are doing today." The choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said that after turning around, he walked toward the gate of the town hall, just the moment he and Martin staggered. He whispered, "Live in fear, Mr. Martin!" No one knows what he said to Martin, he didn't even see him, only saw him smile at Martin and nod, then left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marin stunned, his face was filled with anger, he just prepared to tell Du Lin’s threat to him, but he saw those people’s eyes flashing The luster, he knows, even if he said no one would believe him, and some people even think he is in Du Lin. He clenched his fists, clenched his teeth, glanced at the wastes that were not used at all, and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin is from Nano Lindes, and the mayor of Nano Lindes has felt the threat from Doolin, especially when Harry’s governor talked privately about Du Lin’s plan to wear two mountains and build a railway. It is precisely because this sentence is irrelevant to Governor Harry that the mayor of Nano Lindes has a sense of crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem in Otis is in traffic. When the traffic is not convenient and there is no railway, the prosperity of Otis is like today's nano Lindes. Because the two mountains are just for people to ride around the horse, and the city of Otis was considered one of the satellite cities of the Imperial City at that time, guarding the imperial capital and resisting the threat from the south. Any caravan from the south to the capital and to the north must be inspected in the city of Otis to pass, which guarantees the prosperity of the city of Otis. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the appearance of the steam locomotive, the two mountains in the east-west direction of the city of Otis made the railway a bubble. The residents or goods in other cities in the north wanted to go to the emperor. It is necessary to go to Nano Lindes first, which has created the special status of Nano Lindes in the whole state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin really broke through two mountains, or launched a canyon that can accommodate steam locomotives, plus his current range of operations and states There is no doubt in his support for him that the city of Otis will gradually replace the special status of Nano Lindes. At that time, the status of Nano Lindes will become very embarrassing. In order to save resources, the state will certainly take back the policy and turn to the city of Otis. Finally, Nano Lindes will become an empty city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bustling city can not only bring excellent performance, but also add to the wallet of its own wallet, so the mayor of Nano Lindes is out of For political purposes, or for his own interests, he must engage in Doolin. Not to mention Doolin, at least to lag behind his development speed, after the past four years, he went to other places or promoted to leave the nano Lindes, and then let Du Lin develop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Nano Lindes, Ortis City, had nothing to do with him, but not now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s identity is not a secret in the New Party, especially after the concept of the SAR has attracted the attention of the new party leader, Magus. And the things he did, were deeply excavated. It’s nothing new like a smuggler, and people find out that he used to be in prison or even join the old party. Except for those things that are still ambiguous, there is not much secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what Martin may know is not so clear. If he really understands Doolin like the new party leader, he may not be willing to come to Otis to give Du Lin embarrassment. You must know that the party whip has said that Du Lin is a viper. You may not have the chance to find him before he launches an attack, but you may have been bitten by him when he started attacking and injected venom into your body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the office, Du Lin immediately called Hite and asked him to arrange for someone to stare at Martin. Be sure to monitor this guy and see if he contacted him. Whoever lists the information of the person he contacts is listed on the list when needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with such a small person According to Doolin’s past practice, the easiest thing is to let him disappear, and to eliminate this bane directly from the flesh. But it is a bit unsuitable to do so now, especially Martin is against Du Lin in front of so many people. If he disappears, the people behind him will definitely use his death to make a fuss. So Martin can't die in a short time. After a period of time, I will find another chance to send this guy to see God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After signing several documents, Doolin locked the door of the office from inside. He sat in the chair and thought for a while, and made a phone call to Kevin. Number. Next week's hearing, he needs Kevin's help. Although this guy is a vampire, he is really capable and, most importantly, his network in the capital is far more profound than Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard of Du Lin’s voice Kevin is also very happy, which means that he has a large amount of money, this guy is born to be a devil who eats money. As long as he is fed, he is willing to do anything, and he can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you have to attend a hearing next week, so I have prepared some materials in advance." Du Lin has not spoken yet, Kevin Let me talk about what Du Lin wants to ask. He has a lot of informants and acquaintances in the judiciary. After all, the profession of lawyers is born with a relationship with the law. Sometimes he is the spokesperson of the devil, and sometimes he does not mind becoming an embodiment of justice, provided that the employer has enough money to move him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever can afford Kevin, I definitely don’t mind spending some money to let him lobby some key people, so this guy uses the employer’s money for I have laid a network of relationships myself, which is a swearing in the words of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s words blocked Du Lin’s words to be spoken in the eyes of the blind man, and he snorted and then reluctantly asked: “You are planning to accept How much do I have? Hell, I helped you clean up Amp last time, you have to give me a discount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
