			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days of interviews have made Du Lin remembered by more middle class. He did not advocate the rules of the new party’s survival and free competition. Sniping the old party's social system of historical reversing, he cleverly catered to the middle class of the empire, and used himself as an example, using a more accessible language to gain a part of the middle class's goodwill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Doolin’s own words, he was an empire of the Empire, born in a remote country, born as a farmer, still in the field before the age of sixteen Work. Suddenly after the age of sixteen, if you do not work hard to change the uncertain future, then the future can only be dark. He spoke out something that he could say, and the very emotional voice gradually brought the audience into his role, and he felt excited for every success. This is the creator of a living empire dream. This is not an illusion created by the government. It is through his own efforts to obtain today's status and wealth. At the same time, Du Lin praised all the middle class with great enthusiasm, and believed that the wealth of the middle class was not what people imagined, it was obtained without help, and the wealth was the same. It is through labor income. And it is reasonable to affirm the existence of wealth differentiation, which is proportional to the degree of education and effort. At the same time, Du Lin also ridiculed the provincial sage, the provincial ya people are lazy to make the empire famous, they are willing to do a short-term work, timely squandering all the money and then go to find a short-term work, do not want It is necessary to promote the position through hard work and embark on the peak of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the TV broadcast, some of the content was reported by some newspapers, which immediately caused dissatisfaction with the provincial sage group. Some provincial sages accused Du Lin of the province. The embarrassment is ugly and discriminatory, and it also claims that the Guarts are not much better than the provincial sages, all of them are criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened as early as Doolin’s expectations, and before he said these words, he decided to do so, and Hellsman was also very Support him. There is a sharp contrast between the provincial sage and the middle class of the whole society. Most of the provincial sages have not received higher education, and rarely do something with perseverance. They always blame the unfairness of society and hate those who live in the rich. In the middle class of the district, and even in the early years, some provincial sages believed that the middle class had stolen the wealth of the provincial sages. By oppressing exploitation, the provincial sages were firmly suppressed at the bottom of society and they were not given the opportunity to turn over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those provinces with low language and low culture are hard to give people a positive feeling. The middle class is just the opposite of them. They have received high education, good education, serious work, and passion for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for people to provoke a fireworks between the two extremes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People often use the provincial sage to set off the contribution of the middle class to society, including everything, and often use the middle class to counter the terrible living environment of the provincial people. The opposition itself is hatred. In one manifestation, Doolin’s claim was recognized by most middle classes in society and triggered a round of heated discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two hot topics, one is that the provincial sage accuses Du Lin of racial discrimination, and the other is the whole society's discussion of the Empire Dream. Does the existence of a living empire dream achiever indicate that a great era is coming? The recovery of the economy has taken off, the great advantage on the battlefield, the combination of various factors and the confidence of the imperial people. All that has happened in recent years has inspired all the imperial people to convince people that a good era It is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, we are back!", the Buddha who just came back from outside, holding a shopping bag, and holding a little boy in the other hand, Mrs. Vivian I have to go abroad during this time, and the children are a little worried when they are alone at home, so they are temporarily sent to the Buddha. After she returned to China, she took the child from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, Vivian has been getting better and better. This time before she left, she had a short conversation with Du Lin, and she talked to Du Lin. Knowing that Mrs. Vivienne is planning to run for the mayor of Orodo, of course she does have this capital. Not to mention that her father used to be the Governor of the Governor, in charge of the military and political power of the entire state, even after death, has left countless contacts to support Vivienne. On the other hand, her performance and achievements in the feminist movement are enough to make some things change. Today, Mrs. Vivian has become the vice president of the imperial feminist movement organization. She is very famous. Everywhere, there will be a large number of ladies and gentlemen coming to join us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional feminist movements believe that it is time for women to embark on the political arena as politicians, and the entire feminist movement is actively planning to help Mrs. Vivian . In the past, people talked about women in political circles, often in the form of social flowers, even if there are one or two female counts in history, it is definitely not a good thing. In order to free the feminist movement to liberate more things, a female mayor has become the most important task of the feminist movement at this stage. They want to tell everyone through facts that not only men can become managers of a city, but also women! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in order to create momentum, Mrs. Vivienne became the head of the feminist movement organization that represented the other countries in Congress, expanding her international influence and adding important chips to her next campaign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the Buddha with a slight look and quickly put his gaze on the child beside him. This child is Fred, already on the second. Grade, very polite, at first glance, I know that this is definitely not a child of the average family. Whether it is the use of tableware during meals, or the words and sentences in the weekdays, all reflect the family education and upbringing behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his shoes and put them on one side, put on the slippers, and then slightly succumbed to Du Lin, before pulling the hands of the Buddha. Look, this is definitely not a good boy, right? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin touched his chin and glanced at him. "I think he should enjoy his childhood. Do you understand what I mean?", Du Lin added One sentence, "If there is no unscrupulous childhood, if this childhood has not been sobbed because of a stupid thing, it is not perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha put the things down and took his son’s hand on the sofa, seriously thinking about Du Lin’s words, and said for a while, “I think you are lying to me.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheat you?!", Du Lin snorted twice. "I don't have to lie to you, really, do you want me to call back now? Mr. Kesma will definitely tell You, my idiot son is licking other people's chickens or geese, and even going to kick the cow's eggs, this is childhood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not pay attention The guilty conscience in Du Lin’s words, his two sons only saw a few faces, most of the time what happened to them was Mr. called "the way" to tell him. The old-fashioned Mr. Xerma called Doolin most of the time to discuss things about the weather and farming, and then used the remaining ten minutes to talk about his grandson, the son of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Du Lin is not a qualified father, it is a jerk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha knows about the situation of the two small Sigma, he hesitated. "But there are no children here that can be reassured...", Oak Bay There are many children in the villa area, but these children are the products of the "abstinence system". They will not play like normal children. Instead, they will politely discuss some academic or social aspects. It looks like a little adult, but it has lost what the child should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Would you like...” Du Lin glanced at the little boy who blinked and suddenly tightened. “Send him to my house? It’s fun...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After twenty minutes, I always felt that my brain was not enough. I called Vivienne and asked if it was feasible to send the child to Ziwei Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Weian considered it for a while and gave the Buddha an unexpected answer, yes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was before, Vivienne would never agree to send his dearest son to the country to play with two little mud dog legs. But now Du Lin’s market is very good. He also wants to run for the governor. She also heard that many gualts have recently entered the old and new parties. She is sensitive to the fact that Du Lin’s situation has been gradually emerging. water surface. Then the two little mud dog legs in the country... No, the two gentlemen have a better market. Now, let the children make them without any loss, but they may benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman, always a very realistic creature, especially after she was hurt by life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furly, Fred left the villa under the escort of Doolin’s people, and Doolin smiled and looked at them in the back window. De waved his hand, he certainly wouldn’t say that he said these words because he didn’t like children, and he looked forward to Fred’s performance after Vivienne’s return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning, very good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duo Lin returning to daily life will soon be attending a small birthday party. The main character of the banquet is the royal princess, this is her 16 years old this year. The birthday, and this is also the object that the royal family launched to marry Doolin, and one is only fourteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the royal family lost all power, the royal family is a royal family after all, and it is the spiritual symbol of the empire, and it is of course the first place in the blind date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 6 pm on May 19, Doolin and Magus left Villa One, and he slept in the villa of Magus before going to the palace. One afternoon, I just woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yawned to organize his dress, looked at the luxurious and honorable palace, touched the stone on the outer wall of the palace, shook his head and sighed Tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
