			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know that there is no defensive power in the manor? These rich people are very afraid of death, they will use the full bodyguards to protect their safety. Maybe After we went in, we faced a group of bodyguards with guns. By that time, the fun would be big!", talking to Mickey’s neighbor, nicknamed Greyhound, had two robberies, and now there is no serious matter. Do, every day by selling some anesthetics to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the Greyhound to the Greyhound. There are channels to buy some pistols. They are all black market goods, and no one can trace them. And Mickey also needs the experience of the Greyhound, at least he is still walking outside, and the specific steps for some crimes are better than Mickey or others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey was not worried about this question raised by the Greyhound. He chuckled and his face showed a smile full of superiority. If there are hordes of bodyguards inside, then we are going to negotiate. If there is a chance, we can hold the gualt rich. If there are no bodyguards inside, we can clean up the irrelevant people and wait for them. Take a ransom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grayed dog's eyes are bright, this is a good way, in any case will not put yourself in danger. He nodded. "This thing can be done, what else do we have to prepare?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey gestured a pistol. "At least four are needed. But we don't have money right now. Is there any way to get it first? Give them or pay more for it afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the Greyhound a bit I don't know how to answer them. These people who smuggle arms are doing business with their own freedom. They are willing to do business without paying for it. Hesitating for a moment, the gray dog ​​shook his head and said: "The credit is impossible. I don't have such a big face, but I can introduce a guy to you. He has money in his hand."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gross loan?", Mickey agreed without any hesitation, "No problem, take me to get the goods tomorrow!", said that he looked at the companions around him and asked: " If someone wants to quit now, I won't stop it. If no one wants to quit, I will listen to my command in these few days. Believe me, each of us will be a millionaire!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps under the temptation of a millionaire, everyone’s inner greed and longing for money overcomes reason. These people are gasping and thinking that they may become one. It is difficult for a millionaire to suppress the power of the body. That is a millionaire, a squandering a hundred years a day to squander 36,000 ... five hundred, want to spend all the money to spend at least ... thirty years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickey read their eyes, stretched out their hands, stacking their palms one after another, and quietly reached agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an emotion that rushes in their chests. This kind of emotion is called struggle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the little gang broke out and they all needed to prepare for the next "work." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greyhound has been considering Mickey’s plan on the way back, and he believes that the plan is unlikely to be implemented. I have never heard of the richest man in the city being kidnapped until now, and I have never heard of anyone who has been blackmailed. These rich people have a lot of wealth to support them in hiring a professional bodyguard team to protect their safety, plus their status and influence, if you don't want to be right with the whole city, it is best not to move them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he agreed to Mickey’s request was not that he wanted to participate. He just made Mickey fool the past, then hid it and waited for the event to come out. He even thought about how to avoid this situation without hurting each other's feelings, that is, surrender. Trafficking in narcotic drugs may face a very serious sentence, but the glass of the family is only a few days in detention. Just as he was going to surrender, suddenly there was a hard poke on his back from his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not quite sure what the thing is, but it is definitely a dangerous thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t move, keep moving forward, there is a car at the street, if you don’t want to have your photo on the front page of the Irian’s Daily tomorrow, you’d better With a little bit.", after the guy behind him, the gray dog ​​heard a strange sound, he knew the voice, the sound of charging after the pistol insurance opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly took the first step and walked cautiously, not letting himself make any action that might mislead the other party, "Man, hey, I didn't bring the goods when I came out today, and I was just a small person on the street, I don't have money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goods in the gray dog ​​mouth are purple angels - - an anesthetic preparation. The main ingredient in anesthesia comes from Gnox mushroom, a substance that is easy to cause hallucinations. This substance can cut off the signal transmission between pain neurons. Therefore, after years of research by Imperial College of Medicine, a standard of use has been developed. Under the premise of cutting off the transmission of painful nerve signals, the birth of hallucinations is reduced as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the injection is excessive, it will still produce a long-term hallucination. Many people like this tone, so there has been a market for anesthetics. Now, in the case of Ordos State Prison, Ernst also smuggled narcotic drugs in addition to selling private liquor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greyhound is such a guy who sells anesthetic drugs on the street. He really can’t make much money. He can only get a dollar for a small bottle of fifteen dollars. In the draw, the other must be turned over to his home, plus he is still a person, and occasionally need to resolve the loneliness, so it is difficult to save any money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this experience, I saw too many things on the street, so he concluded that Mickey’s plan would not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things on the back of the waist topped, and he suddenly became scared, and in the city with millions of people, there was one less punk that sold anesthetic drugs. It was not a problem at all. The police even didn't even bother to investigate the investigation. He walked slowly and painfully. At the intersection, he saw a gray, very worn car. This kind of car is basically flooded in the third district. People who can't afford a new car are loyal to spending a little money to buy an old vehicle that may be three or more hands to support the face. Like the pistols circulating on the black market, it is difficult to find out who is in the final hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got in the car, sitting in the co-pilot, behind the head is the hard poke, he has no choice and resistance, can only let these two The man took him to a place he didn't want to go. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car quickly crossed the highway intersection into the fourth district, and turned to stop in a place like a factory warehouse. He was pushed into the empty warehouse by two people. At this time, several lights were suddenly lit in front of him, and some tears appeared in his eyes. Raising his hand to cover the strong light, he saw a guy in a suit with a dome felt sitting on a chair in the middle of the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the strong backlighting, he couldn’t see what the man looked like and could only see a silhouette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think Mr. Greyhound would like to repeat what you heard and see at night?" The guy sitting was open and the voice was male. Very young and somewhat magnetic. He was so delayed for about a dozen seconds, and a sharp pain in his head, a hard thing squatted on his head. He also had a force in his leg. He lost his center of gravity and slammed into the ground. There was a heat flow in his nose. He touched it and was transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
