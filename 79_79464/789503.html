			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boys are great!", Sergeant Johnson was a little swaying while walking, he drank too much, if not Mr. When he visited, he could not stand even in the station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma is a very eye-catching person. He frowned slightly and glanced at Sheriff Johnson. "You should drink less alcohol, Anna has already Dead, it is her sin deserved, it should not be for you to bear everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John suddenly fell into silence, the name Anna is too familiar with him, The familiar ones have been deeply engraved into his soul. It was his wife, the first woman she ever loved and the only woman in her life, but this woman killed the son of Sheriff Johnson and her own son. She also killed the entire family of Sheriff Johnson. Sergeant Johnson said some people's names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is an undercover, a spy, a vicious woman who played with Johnson’s Sheriff’s feelings and smashed dozens of knives in his heart. He knew that Mr. Kemma was right. The woman was dead. He saw the bullets in her head and watched her fall to the ground. She could not live. I don't know why, he has been afraid, he feels that Anna is by his side, and will kill him whenever and wherever he wants! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vicious woman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident led Johnson to no longer have the idea of ​​marrying his wife and children. He couldn’t go to the level in his heart. He felt sorry for many people, including Mr. Kesma in front of me. Of course, he is also very grateful to Mr. Xerma. On such occasions, he did not kill himself, but forgive himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...he shook his head. "I can’t leave without drinking. I’m just an alcoholic old drunk, Mr. Kesma, I do everything. No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma snorted twice. "I have never thought about what you can do great things. I just think you are like this. Drinking one day will die in the bottle. Anna did not kill you, the nobles did not kill you, I did not kill you, but you died in this meaningless thing, it is better to wait for you to feel almost live Say hello to me, I will help you solve your pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, how is it now, Walter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson laughed a few times and said that he was finished, but he didn't want to die. Even if he spent every day in a groggy way, he never thought about going to death. He knew that his courage was broken in that disaster, and perhaps he never had any courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Guard’s training place is outside the town. It takes only fifteen minutes to walk. The two walked and talked about the latest situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The doorman is now infinite. He wrote a letter to me some time ago, hoping to ask me to do things. I don't really like that guy, he always There is a hypocrisy, but it may be because he is the most hypocritical of us, so he can mix so well." Mr. Kesma said something like a complaint, and at the end he sighed. At the beginning, so many people almost died almost in the end. He thought that if someone would inherit the business he had not completed, he might be someone else, but he would not be the peasant who was afraid of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the facts are so wonderful, all the people he is optimistic about have chosen silence, only the doormen stood up. Of course, he is certainly not for what great ideals and ambitions, purely for power and interests. It was a villain who never concealed himself. Mr. Kesma first met this guy called Mennon, who was in the Hummer market in a noble territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mennon guy didn’t know what method to use to make his Hummer’s mouth extremely flat, but it took two days to get it. It was found that the horses that were like the horses in the first two days were actually old guys, and there were still a few who were too tired to die. So Mr. Kesma became a "friend" with the Mennon. Everyone didn't like the market and blackmail of the Mennon, but Mr. Kesma knew that they needed a guy like this to take care of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the sale became the last sale of the farm gate, and then he made a wise choice between death and obedience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson paused when he heard the name. He quickly chased after two steps and followed Mr. Xema, "Mennon?" Didn't he die? I remember that it was all messed up at the time, and I heard that he was dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma’s dry laughter is as harsh as metal friction "He is just pretending to be dead. He is more embarrassed than all of us. At least we don't think anyone is lying on the ground and pretend to be dead." He said that he paused. "Now he is doing a good job, and he doesn't want to be too out of the limelight. So I plan to find someone to push on the table to blacken him. But these things have nothing to do with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant Johnson’s lips moved. He wanted to say a dirty word to express his feelings at this time, but he could not say anything. If the doorman finds Mr. Kemas, it means that the town will not be peaceful for a long time. Is it necessary to change places to live? Soon, Sergeant Johnson dismissed the idea. Although living with Mr. Zema would be a little dangerous, he would face even greater danger after leaving Mr. Zema. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of the speakers have already left the town. The National Guard’s post was outside the town, and after some repairs, it was a little bit like. The two did not directly call the door, but turned in from the fence where the side was missing. Mr. Kesma wants to see if these guys can use it, whether they are lazy. He gives these young people a generous salary every week, but he doesn't have time to look at it. Sergeant Johnson is drunk every day. The training can only rely on these young people to consciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two first sneaked a glance at the barracks, there were no people inside, things were neatly packed, which is very good. Then they went to the playground. When they didn't come near, they heard someone whistling. Mr. Kemma's face suddenly became a bit gloomy, and Johnson almost cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know which of the gods heard Johnson’s prayers, and the things that made him afraid didn’t happen. Two of the seven boys were only Wearing panties to play on the playground. Their fists were only tightened with bandages, not to protect the enemy, but to protect themselves. In close-range equipment-free fighting, the finger is a very vulnerable part of the injury, so it is necessary to use a bandage to tighten the finger joints while avoiding finger fractures and dislocations during punching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two young men are full of oil and sweat, and the strong body presents a visual impact of the oily eyes. The two have been awkward, and each face is swollen, but they are There was no idea of ​​stopping until Mr. Johnson and Mr. Xerma appeared in their sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma blinked and let go of the way to the center of the field, glanced at the seven dumbfounded boys and saw each of them Both noses and swollen face, it seems that these two people are not only fighting, "Why do you fight fight?", no one answered this question, they did not want to say, but did not dare to say. They all ate Mr. Xerma's salary, and the days here are much more interesting than doing farm work, and they can also supplement the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are sent back, don’t say that there is no such happy day in the future, that is, people in the town will laugh and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kesma pointed to one of them. "You said, if you don't say anything, just pack up and leave here. I am not spending money to ask you to play. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Under such pressure, the young man had to say the reason. It turns out that they are not conflicts caused by contradictions. They are purely a kind of actual combat. The initial idea may be to choose the best captain, but everyone is almost the same. Gradually, this selection method has become every three days. Once a formal training, everyone felt that it was very useful and more practical than boring training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma took a look at the training results of each of them and patted the shoulders of Sheriff Johnson. "Although you are just drinking drunk every day and so on." The old man, but you can do these things well.", he said that he looked at the young people, "pack up everything, take the weapon with me, and now execute the order!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people, although they don’t quite understand what they need to do, are still doing what Mr. Xerma’s request. When I first selected people, Mr. Kesma had only one request and was able to obey the orders seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside world is very fresh for these honest young people, especially when they heard that they are going to a big city like Orodo. When performing the task, they all whistled with excitement. When Mr. Kemas promised to give them a three-month salary before they arrived at the place, Mr. Xema, who usually didn’t meet very much, became their most supportive. Object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mr. Bain of Orodo just talked with a visiting guest for half an hour, and after he left, he patted his cheek. It’s a bit tired to face all day, but there is nothing to do with it. When the license plate rules were implemented, they encountered a little trouble. They will soon pass the Supplementary Provisions of the Urban Road Traffic Regulations. More people are on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the newspaper this morning and looked at the title and then directly to the second page, with a title printed in bold black body at the top— - The Kadima Party aims to lock in the mid-term elections, and the situation may be subversive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read it very seriously. The Kadima Party recently proposed a new concept of governance. They intend to introduce the federal universal welfare system, which will solve the aging of imperial citizens. After losing the labor force, I can't support myself. At the same time, I also plan to make breakthroughs in medical treatment and plan to solve some medical expenses for the citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
