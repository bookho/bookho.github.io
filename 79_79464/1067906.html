			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin talked a lot about this candidate, and he has to say that this is the first person to take the initiative to come to the door. He has strong practical business ability. And have very unique insights into the way certain business methods are used. He is as good as his resume, graduated from a higher economics college, has many years of work management experience from the grassroots to the top, has a strong personal ability, and has a brilliant view of social changes and economic fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, he is not what Du Lin wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, can you tell me where I am not suitable for your company?", in Du Lin’s expressly regretted, he was temporarily unable to work with the job. When they cooperated, he couldn't help but ask such a question, "Is something missing, or is my plan for the future not in line with your thoughts? I am not humble, I think my personal work experience and ability. Even if it is not the top, it is definitely the first batch. Please let me know, Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave He smoked a cigarette and he stroked his emotions. "You said these are very good, very good, and they feel better than your resume. The things we talked about are indeed very practical. I feel that if you hire you to be an executive director of cable TV, the company will become a company with great business value in the next five to ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then why are you not willing to use me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lin Zhanyan smiled, "Because you are not me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can take this company to lead a mountain, but I can let this company fly to Heaven. I need an executor, I don’t need a person who can think for me and make suggestions. It’s not fair to you, it’s not fair to me, what do you say?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The job seeker left very lost. When he left, he didn’t understand why Du Lin was so confident. It was a very strange thing, just like... he couldn’t tell the feeling, just like Du Lin’s already Can see the future beyond a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he did not guess wrong, Du Lin really can see the future beyond, this is also the secret of Doolin, but also the wealth of Doolin. No one knows better than him where the future of cable TV is, so he needs an implementer with a certain self-thinking. Self-thinking is not the most important. The important thing is the performer. He doesn't need to have a leader in high housing. He doesn't need a pioneer with strong independent thought. He needs an executive who can execute his route quietly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are afraid that their company employs a mediocre person, but Du Lin is not afraid, because his eyes can see the future trend through time and space, because the future is in his palm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be his biggest drawback, because he looks too far, far away, many people don’t know what he saw, even if he said those people I don't know if what he saw is right or wrong, and even questioned him and shakes his trust. This also makes it difficult for him to find the right person. Sometimes Du Lin feels that he should let others have more initiative... Well, next time it is so good, let these excellent talents be employed in those unimportant positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena was quickly recalled by Du Lin in advance, and her studies were basically over. The Royal College may have studied economic management for two years. It is not enough to make her an industry elite with pioneering spirit and strong personal abilities as well as the job seeker, but it is enough to let her be a self-thinking performer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freina’s return indicates that Kemma Cable will be handed over to her for the time being, and when she returns, Du Lin also took the lead for him. Feast, introduce her current partners to her. He can see that there seems to be a little bit of emotion between Freina and Nasha, but he is not too concerned. The reason why people are people is because people have love and love, and restraining others does not mean that things will change to the good side. As long as the small contradiction between them does not affect the overall plan, Du Lin is too lazy to manage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent almost a month outside and returned to the West at the end of July. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "grabbing head" activity in the west has gradually come to an end, and the biggest winner is Du Lin. He and Mr. Jack's industry have more than 400,000 farmers and workers who participated in the three-guarantee policy, plus the crazy acquisition of the fellowship during this time, which made him acquire a total of 1.3 million contracts. The independent contract for the entire western part of the three-guarantee policy is about a little over four million. He has got one-third of it and is already the biggest winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southern commercial bank’s Bailito barely passed a million contracts, and the imperial central bank was the worst, with less than 800,000. Some of the approximately one million contracts are still on the sidelines, and some are acquired by other scattered institutions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "player" who entered the game may not be aware of the rules of the game and the benefits that the winner can get, but see both the big line and Doolin are buying those crazy Contracts, they naturally participate in the acquisition battle with the idea of ​​holding speculation. If they can get the benefits, they will take the benefits into their stomachs. If they don't see the profit point, they will sell them to other "players." It is said that the new central bank leaders are actively contacting these “third parties” and hope to get more contracts from their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who just got off the train, had not had time to go back to rest, and I heard an interesting thing. The new central bank owner persuaded Bailito and other third parties to open an advanced industry conference to form an organization similar to an industry association, while setting industry standards for self-discipline of industry behavior. What's more interesting is that they didn't inform Du Lin, and even chose Du Lin when he didn't come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Dolinbe’s plan to return to the West two days earlier, he might have missed the “industry conference”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the conference room on the seventh floor of the Vanlier Hotel, a group of people are sitting together to discuss how to develop an industry standard and access system. It was initiated by the new responsible person of the central bank. Because of the mistakes made by the previous work of Phyllis and his belief that he could not continue to fight for the imperial central bank in the west, he decided to take the initiative to leave the west after considering it for a long time. He will face huge losses, including losing his status as a director, unable to interfere with the work of the central bank in the next three years, and he must take out 0.3% of the shares in his hands to other shareholders as a punishment for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment is very heavy, but it also makes Phyllis breathe a sigh of relief, at least compared to the terrible collapse of the overall collapse, the current punishment is not painful. In addition to a little less shares, there is nothing. Many of the directors, like him, are not named, they will appear in addition to the meeting, and they will not be seen at other times. He is now figuring out that he is not a qualified banker, not even a banker. He does not intend to sigh. The rush to retreat is the most correct choice, let the successor go to the headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice’s decisive withdrawal to the new governor Taylor caused great passiveness, and Phyllis’s stupidity made the central bank more aware of this In the war of multiple advantages, it is actually a disadvantaged party. The only way he can reverse the current situation is to integrate the industry first, then acquire the contracts of the speculators, and finally kick out the biggest winner of the war, Du Lin. Nothing is known than Felice, and it is clear that Taylor’s approach is more sophisticated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the industry integration is completed, the industry standard is established. As a missing and not in the industry, Du Lin, the first thing to face is the huge threshold for entering this industry. As long as they clench their teeth and refuse Du Lin to enter the industry, the contracts that Du Lin acquired are equal to waste. He has no second way to go except for the members of the industry. Taylor has already Perito has privately discussed this matter, and after the integration in the industry is over, they will apply for a franchise to the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
