			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really didn't think that in just over a year and two years, you have grown to this point!" Heidler was very emotional. Who can think of the young man who was in jail in Tyner, and actually completed the counterattack in such a short period of time and became the mayor of a city in one fell swoop? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed the difference in the city from the moment he got off the bus. The urban vitality of the city is like a heart, and it’s like a heart. People can clearly perceive the pulse of this city. Pedestrians walking down the street are either hurrying or smiling, and rarely see people who are frowning. This is a city with extraordinary potential, a city that is in the midst of a change in life form! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The founder of all this is the young and embarrassing guy, Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled, and the compliment he had already heard was annoyed, and he could no longer feel that he had a slap in the face, but it was very boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler adjusted his mindset and said: "This time I will entrust me to establish the Otis Chamber of Commerce and use it as the core of the Chamber of Commerce in the entire state. In the future, more businessmen will come here." He observed Du Lin's look. There was no change in his face. He didn't know if he said it was not clear enough, or Du Lin thought it was not important. In fact, the establishment of a chamber of commerce is a very important thing for any city. It will attract more capitalists to enter the city and learn more about the policy changes of the Chamber of Commerce and the changes in financial support. Going bigger, it will attract a lot of capitalists to invest in the city. After all, the relationship between the club and the city hall and the state government is much better than that of ordinary businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can use the power of the Chamber of Commerce to gain support from the City Hall or the state government and policy tilt, it is highly likely that these businessmen will change their "destiny" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler has thrown a huge bait, but did not get enough response, he scratched his brow slightly, and said with a smile: "Next There may be many things that need to be bothering you in the days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin heard a smile on his face. "I am grateful to the Chamber of Commerce for the willingness to fall in the city of Otis. But the city of Otis is a city that is not the same as other places. Here is the SAR. '!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what is the SAR?", Du Lin glanced at Heidler, and Heidler became serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before some of their general meeting members discussed this matter by way of a call, the SAR, then what exactly does the SAR mean? If you simply analyze it according to the material submitted by Harry, you can't analyze much useful things. This kind of fresh administrative unit and the special meaning is rich, so that people can not understand the mind, but also have an attractive feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a cigarette from the cigarette case and shrugged his shoulders. "The SAR means that in this area, I have the final say!", He smiled and took a sip of the cigarette and slowly spit it out. "First of all, I think there are three different parts, and the three most different parts from other places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You please say..." Heidler used the honorific words unconsciously, even he himself did not realize this. Just as soon as Du Lin spoke, a raging momentum instantly sprang from his body, and Hedler, who was pressed, had a few seconds of breathing. Such a horrible momentum he has only seen in several old members of parliament and some governors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a bit of a mystery, so popular, that is, at the moment Dolin opened his mouth, his self-confidence made him want to release light... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under such circumstances, Heidler involuntarily used honorific words to express respect for Du Lin’s status and respect for his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first piece, tax. I don't care what tax plans are implemented in other regions, but in Otis, I will implement another tax plan.", These are all things that Doolin thinks during this time. To make a city prosperous, in addition to turning it into a place where everyone can release pressure, it also needs a large circulation of goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capitalist is indeed abhorrent, the act of capital is indeed abhorrent, but it cannot be denied all good because of odious. Without the operation of these capitalists and capital, this world ghost knows what it will be like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Doolin does not refuse, but he needs control, and the way to control is tax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin remembers seeing such a news in a dream, a country sues another country for dumping, and filed an anti-dumping lawsuit to raise tariffs on some goods. This ensures that a certain commodity is protected, but the merchants in another country immediately begin to transform and dump other commodities that are not restricted and impose high tariffs into the country. In the face of more categories of dumped goods, a country has recognized it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually very similar to the Otis city, not because someone dumped things into the city of Otis, but about the control of the merchants. When a commodity is levied a higher tax, the purchasing power of the consumer will decrease, the temptation of the commodity will be insufficient, and the capitalist will change his business type in order to obtain more profits. Just like tobacco, the tobacco tax is actually very low, but if the tobacco in the city of Otis increases the tax, it will probably cause many people to smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no consumption power, naturally those who sell tobacco begin to change careers. Maybe they start selling toothpaste, maybe start selling socks, but they will never sell tobacco again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin intends to try to regulate the market in Otis through free taxation and to limit the power of capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the effect is obvious, maybe the entire empire will start experimenting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you put yourself in the perspective of a businessman, you must do it yourself. But Du Lin never thought that he was a businessman. He was just an "ordinary person." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidele was very interested in hearing Du Lin’s words. When he had not had time to ask Du Lin how he planned to do this, Du Lin said The second feature that is different from other places, "In the city of Otis, there is no contraband, and everything will be sold in limited or limited quantities. Whether it is wine or ghost mushrooms, including any goods, including weapons, In our plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Third, all monopoly industries in Otis must be licensed by me to operate." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the first two still make Heidler very interested, once felt that he came here is a very good decision, then Du Lin’s last sentence, Just let him feel that it is not so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that the most profitable industries and trading are always brought about by monopoly. Monopoly means that you can sell a penny to one hundred, and you can't buy it from other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most troublesome thing facing the empire now is monopoly. The tycoons of various industries have formulated the rules of the game in the industry. Even the official has no power to intervene, resulting in the official There is a lack of power in certain areas, and this gap is growing. The only thing that is fortunate is that the resources of Jingjing are firmly in the hands of the royal family. In fact, this is also a monopoly, but the destructiveness of this monopoly is smaller than the damage caused by other monopolies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin does not want to have a monopoly in the city of Otis. Monopoly industry means abducting ordinary citizens. When these capitalists have accumulated a certain strength, they will Will start trying to force the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has already appeared in other places. On Doolin’s site, only one voice is allowed, which is what Du Lin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also only allow one will, that is his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidele frowned and thought about something, and he asked for a moment: "I can understand your thoughts, but what are you going to do in the face of smuggling? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and shook his head. "First, you don't understand that there is no such thing as smuggling in the city of Otis, because all goods are legal." Secondly, no one dares to smuggle here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler is not convinced if others say this, but Du Lin said, he must have believed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of Heidler and the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce is like a signal, a banner, before the city of Otis can hardly see what can be called a capitalist The power appeared, but on the second day, there were already capitalists appearing in the main hall, and asked about support and policies on investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the influence of the Chamber of Commerce. These people Du Lin all pushed to Natalie, he needs to leave and leave Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of the incident stems from the fact that after Heidele left, he was also ready to go out to eat, and the phone rang when he closed the door, this time. The same is a call from someone he unexpectedly, from Graf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
