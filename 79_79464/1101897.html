			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Walter feels that his life’s big ups and downs are too fast and too exciting. He was still at the peak just now, and now he has fallen into the abyss. This ups and downs are really too embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was galloping with his beloved girl on the plateau of hopeless dreams, suddenly a "big surprise" woke him like a thunder, he slowly Turning his neck and seeing a small face that is as stiff as his own expression, the horror in his eyes is exactly the same as himself. He is a daughter of his own, and looks like a horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not what you think, I can explain!", Huatra covered the sheets with two sheets, and returned to reality from the dream plateau of bliss, he Pretending to be calm, I could explain it all, but Melissa screamed and turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is even more embarrassing, the little girl’s scream of this age has a high penetration, a couple passing by the door of this villa The couple heard the scream and immediately informed the security guards in the community. Then three patrol cars and an ambulance appeared outside the villa door in a minute, and they violently crossed the half-wall of the one-meter-high shrub. Then use the broken hammer to open the door of the villa and rush in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oak Bay Living Area is the most luxurious villa living area of ​​the Imperial Capital and even the entire empire. In order to create a "bay" atmosphere, they also created A lake. This means that the price of this artificial lake has been transferred to the villa, so the villa is very expensive, and the people living here are not rich and expensive. The community guarantees to all owners that the quick response time is no more than 90 seconds. Even if someone is shot and sieved, they can then rescue them for a while. The owners finally realized how worthy their money is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, under the watchful eyes of many busy owners, the security captain came out a little embarrassed. In the face of the owners, he lie a little, "Little girl I saw a mouse, and I was shocked and screamed. The kind owner pressed the alarm button." Yes, if there is an urgent matter to inform the security guard or the property does not need to call, just press one in the villa. The button, the security team will come over immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people haven’t had time to say anything, they will hear the angry screams from the villa. “You liar, you carry mom and other women. Go to bed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security captain's face was stiff and he made a haha. "We have been working to protect the privacy of all owners, but sometimes..." He smiled helplessly. "Maybe they didn't realize they had leaked their privacy." "The people around the crowd watching the crowd applauded and felt that the security captain was doing the right thing." In such a special villa area, people are most concerned about personal privacy issues. He said a lie, saying that the girl screamed when she saw the mouse. At this time, people understood that this was an idiot carrying a wife and being found by her daughter, but this does not mean that the security captain did something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes what happened to him and it will spread quickly. They feel that they are buying the industry here is the right choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I can explain!", Walter wearing the clothes, explaining to the daughter of the fried hair, to the best of his ability, "This is not what you saw." That way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa sighed with anger, "I didn't see it? Do you want to say that you are with a young female watch? Dancing on the bed, then adjusting the greenhouse so high that you hotly took off your clothes? Or did you accidentally fall off after you took off your clothes, just falling into what I saw? I am already fourteen years old. I understand that I understand, I will tell this to my mother, you are disgusting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whit’s eyes flashed a bit irritating Look, although the daughter has been brought to the big from childhood, but he does not like this daughter. In this family, Natiya is the head of the family. She has little time to bring her daughter, but her daughter admires her and takes her as an example. Perhaps everything is back to the core issue. Walter has no ability to make this. Family members in the family fear him. He could not maintain the family's excellent living environment, could not give his daughter a great father, and could not give his wife a reliable and solid backing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an ordinary ordinary person without any property to inherit, no special ability, no big skill, he can do nothing about it. Silence doesn't bring anything positive, at least not let Melissa put out her anger The woman at the end of the sentence swears a "female watch." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the empire is very open and not wrong, but everyone, or the universal morality, is obeying one point, that is, not destroying other people’s families, derailing in marriage It is also to be condemned by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter didn't explain anything. He knew that his daughter was angry and said that nothing could only lead to negative effects, but this does not mean that his female companion can endure a smaller woman to insult her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your tutor is sad, dear." The woman shook her head and said, "What a little girl should not appear dirty from your mouth?" The vocabulary, when your teacher was in school, did your teacher call you that? Or do you call your teacher? I suggest you go to a better school and receive a better education. You have to learn what is respect. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respect?!", Melissa will be beaten with the woman when she rushes up. "Do you have a female watch to let me respect you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One big and one small two girls beat together, Walter persuaded a few words after no effect, and finally broke out. He tossed the two sides hard and stood in the middle of two people. "Enough, I said enough. No matter what, first we need to be quiet, then discuss this! And...", he looks Melissa, "You can't respect other people, but you must respect me. I am your father. Now I ask you to go back to your own room. Later in the day, let me talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa is younger, how could she be an opponent of an adult woman, her hair is torn apart, she is embarrassed, her face does not know how it still appears Some redness and swelling should be hit during the assault. She panted and glared at Walter, yelling at his nose. "Your daughter was beaten by a female watch. You don't help me to return me to the room now, but also I respect you? Respect you. Looking for a wild woman to beat your daughter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irritability has become violent in the quarrel, and Walter slaps on her daughter’s face, an unprecedented cold Looking at her face, "Is it calm now?" The woman behind him was smug, sluggishly messing with a mess of hair, and the demonstrator glanced at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes were filled with tears immediately, and she looked at Walter for twenty or thirty seconds, then turned and ran out of the house. The family can't stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to get your daughter back?", the girl who sat back on the sofa again put the finished hair up and asked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt shook his head. "She will come back. The question now is how to solve these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know that you are married, and you still have children." The girl's first sentence made Walter dumb, and he did conceal the information in the process of their interaction. Of course, he can be confident. I think this is the other party has not asked. They just moved here, Villa Natiya and Du Lin went to the federation. Melissa, who studied at the Royal Academy, only had a holiday to come back. They didn't even have time to arrange it, so there was no woman life in the whole villa. The details here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter wants to explain, but after waiting for a long time, he can't find the right way to explain everything. He can only hold his head. "I am sorry. "He is slamming his head. "Emotions are not controlled by reason. Suddenly when you find that you fall in love with someone, you will forget everything that might affect you. I am sorry, I did Things I shouldn’t do, but I don’t regret it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Melissa ran out of the house and had nowhere to go, she could only call one The taxi went to her roommate's home, and even more so is the money paid by the taxi or her roommate. The two girls returned to the room, and she told her roommate everything that happened, and her roommate was very angry. Of course, they are angry for different reasons. Melissa was angry because Walt betrayed her family. Her roommate was angry because Walter stood on the woman and beat Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa’s roommates are not ordinary family members. The family is very rich. There are no ordinary family children in the Royal College special class. Her father is the chairman of a company. He has money and a little power. Of course, there will be mistresses. But no matter what, no matter what happened, her father would stand on her side instead of standing on the mistress, so this made the roommate very angry, this is an incompetent father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should you do, it is best to call your mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Lisa grievously cried and twitched. "She went to the federal business. I don't know how to contact her. I don't have a phone number on the federal side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roommate asked, "Don't you have any way to contact her? For example, ask her colleagues?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa thought for a moment," There seems to be one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is going to fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
