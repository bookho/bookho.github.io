			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not see the big railroad contact with the railway when he was in a dream, so he is very strange to this, at this time When Lills made this suggestion, Du Lin was still very modest inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to cooperate?", Du Lin tilted his leg, a very interesting look, "I don't know much about this, you I should have known that I have not touched it and said that we are all interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collier glanced at Harry, and Harry smiled and nodded. Then got up and closed the office door and locked it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next topic is not too convenient for others to know, Colliers can come here, can say it, in fact, it is also related to Harry's strong recommendation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s good performance at the hearing saved him some things, plus the appreciation of Dooling in the mouth of Magus, which made Harry very Quickly judge that Marx seems to have a deal with Doolin that he does not know? He is not worried that Du Lin will become his "enemy". Du Lin is too young. Even if he possesses the wisdom and skills of Magus, he will not block his political path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is too young, the empire will not allow a prime minister in his twenties, and the new party will not allow an important person in the twenties So, in the next two decades, Doolin will not be a competitor to Harry. On the contrary, if Du Lin is well-funded, his resources, financial resources, and power can all become Harry's help, paving the way for him to at least 12 years in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a win-win situation. Twelve years later, Harry has tremendous power and influence within the New Party. When it comes to returning investment, it will continue. In a win-win situation, he can try his best to bring Doolin to his position, just as Maggs nominated him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This behavior is called a continuation of the faction. Although Du Lin is not a nobleman, although he may have many minor problems, these are not problems in the political arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was only after today’s scene that there was a surprise that Collis personally visited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Harry has been telling me that you are a trustworthy friend, I really like to make friends, will we be friends?" Colliers did not immediately Saying his plan, but saying such a seemingly insignificant sentence, he looked at Du Lin with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands. He asked: "Are we still not friends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like your frankness, Mr. Doolin Colliers licked his lips. He actually meant to seek the unity of Doolin and his political and interests. He believed that Du Lin could hear the meaning behind this sentence, and Du Lin. It did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed to a more comfortable sitting position at this time, it looked not very beautiful and not very polite. "You don't have that much money in your hand, right?" This sentence is very abrupt, directly saying that there is no money in the other pocket and using "right" to deepen their affirmation, to be honest, it is very rude. However, considering that everyone has already carried out the unification of interests on the surface, Du Lin did not negate the direct nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collier smiled slightly. "No, I have been repairing the railway for more than 30 years. You just have to say where and where to go. I can estimate the approximate cost in a short period of time. I haven’t exceeded 10% of the error so far. I’ve heard that you’ve already estimated it, two From the construction to the end of the railway, it takes at least two years, and the cost is about 12 million. The most expensive is the two valleys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Just two months after I took office in Otis, if it is Nano Lindes or the city of Irian you have stayed, I will not hesitate to affirm that you can come up with this money, but this city of Otis "..." He smiled and made a regrettable action. "There is no money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thoughtfully pulled out the cigarette case, Two people had one, and after three people smoked, Du Lin asked: "So what do you mean? How do we "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple!", when Colliers said the phrase, Du Lin noticed that there was a green luster in his eyes. Yes, it is greed, it is blackmail, it is the devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can lend money to the City Hall of Otis to build these two railways. Although it is not a small amount, I can still take it. Come on. Right, take the liberty to ask, how long are you going to work here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Harry, and Harry just happened to look at it. Du Lin, after the two eyes exchanged, Harry answered the question. "If there is no accident, it will be up to two or three years. After the development of the city of Otis, he has enough political achievements and reputation, and he can be transferred to other places. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry did not say that Colliers and Dooling all understood what he meant. Harry intended to start campaigning for the next prime minister and party leader, so he would put more energy outside the party. In this fight, he needs someone at this time to replace him in managing the state. Apparently he intended Ladulin to do this. According to him, Du Lin could serve as a consultant to the governor's office to deal with the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a semi-official position and will not be subject to age restrictions. After all, it is only a consultant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four years, Harry succeeded, so Du Lin was qualified to become the mayor of the capital. After eight years, Du Lin was almost thirty years old. As governor, he waited for Harry to take over from the top of the party, even to run for prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very ordinary and complete political line. When the 40s is the time of the year, it is also the time when the male personality is out, plus the beautiful The "transcripts", as well as the assistance of Magus and Harry, the possibility of Durin's summit is enormous. Of course, in return, Doolin must designate the next successor, and this person's choice is to choose between Magus and Harry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it is also possible that in the process they found a more suitable candidate than Doolin, then it doesn’t matter, high-level positions in the party such as Bowworth I am sure to leave, and his position will be enough for Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you choose Doolin, Harry asked Magus, Maggs did not explain too much about the stakes, he only told Harry Dulin to treat capital. The attitude is consistent with him, and Du Lin is more controllable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good place to control is that Du Lin belongs to the "halfway", he has no strong network of relationships within the New Party, in the old party, and in society. The top leaders of these new aristocrats, behind them, have more new party capitalists and politicians and vested interests to support them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has nothing. If he wants to sit in that position, he must listen to them. Indeed, in addition to Du Lin, there are actually several good seedlings, but these seedlings are not so well controlled. They all come from the veteran aristocracy or the cultivation of capital forces. It carries a huge "halo" itself. Once the two sides have conflicts in their ideas and opinions, Magus and his Harry will have nothing to do with them, because the other side's foundation is not necessarily thinner than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with young political stars who are hard to control their brilliance, it is Dulin's unrooted person who is best controlled and in the best interests of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Harry began to support Dulin very strongly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still have at least twenty years to observe this young man. If the young person meets all their requirements, they don’t mind putting him on. The highest power throne. But if Duarin is found to be inconsistent with their requirements, or if there is a more appropriate goal, they can completely break Duolin without any consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in addition to Doolin, Magus has trained several other young people, elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colliers didn’t know so much, he just took a fancy to Harry’s attitude towards Doolin, one of Harry’s biggest supporters. Naturally, the principles that are considered for Harry will be followed. He smiled and said: "Since Du Lin will not stay here for a longer period of time, then we will not put the plan a little longer, sign a 50-year contract, and return the interest of the bank to the City Hall of Otis. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the last money entered my account, the rights to use these two railways belong to me!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened calmly and nodded, but he was amazed at the lion's opening of Colliers. This is not a simple matter of adding or subtracting thousands of millions. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said more than 10 million is only a preliminary estimate, once Doolin agrees to the plan, the cost will be as high as 20 million. Then 20 million in accordance with the bank's interest loan for 50 years, according to the current interest rate of the imperial central bank of 6.98, when the city hall of Otis City will face a franchise of about 7,000 Heavy economic pressure of about 10,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is fortunate is that this money is not a one-time return to Colliers, but is divided into six hundred months, to more than 100,000 per month. The amount is returned to Colliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Colliers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t spend 40 million yuan on a penny, he still got the right to operate the two railways for 50 years, he actually got More than 500 million profits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
