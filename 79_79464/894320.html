			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That kid is really big, so I don't die when I hit it.", Ed bites the chicken leg, sipping a glass of wine, he is in life. The attitude is completely different from Alex, just like walking two extremes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex is acting like a nobleman, what is the style, he is willing to use a knife and fork to eat chicken legs wrapped in tin foil, it will not be like Ed Just grab it with your hand. Perhaps Aide, who has been a soldier for a long time, has been deeply influenced by the military. He is more pragmatic and efficient, so he looks a bit "rough" and is not like a child of great aristocracy, although he is indeed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we have to come again?", Alex took a napkin and licked his lips. He didn't like the chicken legs with bones. He used a knife and fork to be a bit awkward. "If we do it again, someone will doubt us soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, so wait a while Let's start again, we sell those things first, and I have recently lacked money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Army’s transfer cycle is almost coming, in every election In the first two years, the Army will begin to carry out a wide range of mobilization. This is to avoid the fact that the various military regions of the Army have been in a certain place for too long and set up a mountainism. At the same time, it is also preparing for the next change. If the old party can get the key ticket to become the new ruling party, then they will begin to adjust the framework of the entire empire, and the army is the most crucial place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the rotation, everyone is facing relatively strange people. If you want to mobilize some people, it will not cause any rebound, you can spend it smoothly. Change period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, Ed must have enough money to manage his resources and contacts in the military, to become a brigadier, to host a small In the process of the next re-election, he will have the opportunity to become an imperial major, and he will climb the top of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires money, a lot of money. The problem of corruption in the military is much more serious than people think, but many times the high level of the Empire did not disclose these issues for the sake of social stability and law and order. On the one hand, the Navy is actually facing some problems that the Navy has in the past. Now the high-level empire is carrying out strict supervision of the army, and on the other hand, it takes a certain kind of soft-hearted means to firmly hold the army in its hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex understood Ed's thoughts, and he also knew that it was now a critical period for Ed, and naturally he would not make different opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two then discussed it and sent the two hundred works to the federal side to auction, almost one or two million, when Dedo took a little, Alex took a little less. When Ed became a brigadier, even after the future became a major general, he had enough time and means to bring back what he was putting in, and then he would support a wave of Alex, maybe Alex also May be mixed with the mayor of the capital or the governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t look at Kevin, a lawyer, even if they were famous again? Two of their brothers are the army's youngest officers, and the other is the head of the important department of the state government. I am afraid that it will be more difficult to defeat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything went to calm in the next few days, and Du Lin returned after not leaving Orodo, he held a bunch of flowers The door of the ward immediately saw the little nurse suddenly leave from Kevin, and his face ran a little red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, disturbing your pastime." Du Lin put the flowers on the bed of Kevin's bed and randomly found a place to sit down. He looked at the ward, very luxurious, there was only one bed in the entire ward, and Kevin was sleeping. There is also a living room, as well as a separate toilet and toilet - these two are separate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such wards, only nobles and officials were able to live in the past, even if there is no prominent status and social status, the hospital will not mention this. thing. Thanks to Vivian, Kevin hasn't had much fame in Oro, and the lawyers do a good job as a lawyer, unlike the vigils of Vivian, who are also famous social activists and feminist fighters. Her face is much better than Kevin's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin looked helpless, he and the little nurse were having fun, I didn’t expect Du Lin to come over this time. Although there was a very unhappy expression on his face, his eyes were full of smiles. "If I let you out, will you go out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at him and thought, "I'll beat you!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? then you asked me this question," said Kevin laughed When he got up, he got up and sat up, extending his hands far away, "Welcome, my friend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True treading!" Du Lin dismissed some of the distracted walks and relaxed his hands. He stood on the edge of the window and smoked a cigarette. He did not care about the no smoking sign hanging on the wall. As long as you escaped the death of the god of death, what happened to smoke a cigarette, "How are you going to revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s throat slipped a bit, he was facing Du Lin I waved my hand and looked at the door of the ward subconsciously. "Come, give me one too. It's just a little bad here. I don't give me a cigarette here. God is on. Do you know how urgent I am?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out the cigarette case and put it on the window sill. He pointed his finger at the no smoking sign on the wall. "No smoking is allowed here, and you and Xiaoli just now." The nurse seemed to be very happy, not at all like smoking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Doolin gave him one, and the cigarette seemed to work better than any medicine. After taking two breaths, Kevin slapped all over. He pointed to his ribs. "There were two cuts here because they couldn't go back." Then he pointed to his legs, "Doctor Tell me that I will become a blind man, can you imagine it? The greatest imperial lawyer, Mr. Kevin, is actually a blind man? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you ask me how to revenge? Of course, it is necessary for their family to die, not only them, but also their wives, children, the flames of anger and hatred It is like lava being poured into my body. If you can't kill them and don't let their families live in a tragic world, do you think I will be willing?", Kevin's face is awkward and somewhat distorted. He raised his hand and rubbed his nose a few times. "You have to help me, I can't do it alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged and spread his hands. "This is also the purpose of my coming here. I will arrange for people to fix them both and leave the rest to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but before that We must first let them fall into despair and kill them little by little!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the supervision of the court bailiff, the artworks belonging to Ed and Alex were removed from the collection room of the Governor’s Office, and then packed and placed in a collision box. Arrived at the pier on the agate river. A team of soldiers who changed their plain clothes had already waited at the dock. They put the things on a cargo ship and set off with the ship. The destination was the Queens auction house, the largest auction house in the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed has already contacted the people there. At the autumn auction two weeks later, the artworks will be auctioned as the main auction item. Although there are still two weeks, the Federation has already sensationalized. There are many treasures in these works, as well as a few stone carvings of the origins. The entire federal financial system has also experienced some fluctuations. A large number of capitalists are drawing funds to prepare to buy back some of their favorite collections in the autumn shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment art, although it is slow to appreciate, often takes more than ten years or more to find huge profit points, but these things are a little better, that is, there is no risk . It is safer than the low-risk investment of workers like farms. Farms may also experience the phenomenon of unsatisfactory or unacceptable weather. The art will only appreciate, but the appreciation is fast or the appreciation is slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This money will be transferred back to the Imperial Bank after the federal tax is over, the federal tax is lower than the Empire, which is why they choose to auction these arts in the federal One of the reasons for the product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide and the leader of the team leader slammed a few times and watched them leave, then they just had to wait for the imperial central bank to call them and inform them of the money. Already in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cargo ship entered the Shudun River along the main stream of the Agate River, and then entered the East Imperial Sea from the east into the sea. According to their calculated itinerary, it would probably be It takes two days to arrive at the Union after 10 days, and then the inspection will take two days, followed by an auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailing on the sea is very boring, because there is no reason for the comparison, so many people who enter the ocean for the first time think their ship is not moving, or completely Lost direction. The soldiers have become languid, so boring travel is not as good as training in the base. Some of them are playing mini games, others are exercising, and the lieutenant responsible for the escort does not blame them. He is also reading and relaxing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the hottest time of the day, the crew, including the soldiers, began to leave the cabin to go to the deck for activity. Suddenly the observation hand madly slammed the bell. He found that the two big ships were coming towards them quickly. What was more troublesome was that he saw the black flags hanging on the big ships. It was a pirate ship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhong Li quickly took a telescope from the soldier in his hand, his face was a bit strange, while letting the soldiers prepare to fight back, let the captain stop the boat," I think maybe this is a misunderstanding, I can negotiate with them and resolve this misunderstanding peacefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
