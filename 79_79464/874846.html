			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack did not respond after hearing Doolin’s words. He looked straight at Du Lin for a while before he extended his nails. The little finger, licking his ears, "You just said... five hundred times the rate of return?", said that he laughed himself. "Is it wrong, the wind here is a bit big!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and said very seriously: "You didn't get it wrong, I did say that, five hundred times the rate of return, I have already put together. 100 million yuan of funds, a total of no less than 300 million funds. Once the funds arrive, I will immediately implement the plan.", he said with a sigh, "Honestly, if there is still financial difficulties, I do not intend Inviting anyone, the last time we worked together was very enjoyable, so this time, in order to deepen our relationship, I formally invite you to join this plan. I can only talk privately with the person who is the owner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack swallowed a sip, five hundred times Daily rate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is absolutely not convinced that there are more than one hundred times the rate of return in the world, unless it is..., he suddenly thought of the seven operations that Du Lin had previously operated. More than a million things, it is definitely an amazing huge amount. When he was privately calculated, Du Lin’s investment would not exceed two million, and one of his investments was recovered by other means. . That time he did at least thirty times the rate of return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the size of his capital, not to mention the return rate of five hundred times, fifty times is always there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50 times that of 300 million, that is 15 billion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the organization also took out 100 million to operate this thing..., God is on, five billion enough for them to use the world to destroy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack licked his lips. "At the latest, I will give you a message tomorrow night, but I still have a problem. After we invest in it, we can get us." How long does it take for the money to be deserved?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin’s calculations in his heart, “three to five years!”<br /><br /> The cycle of three to five years is actually not too long. On the contrary, it can be said that it is very short. For a very large-scale economy, the pursuit is never a huge rate of return, but stability. The biggest piece of investment by the imperial central bank is actually farms and pastures. In addition to natural disasters, the stable rate of return exceeds that of all other investment projects. This investment has a longer cycle, often more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three to five years can get dozens of times of return, it is indeed a very terrible investment project, because the specific content of Doolin must be with the king and the queen, so Mr. Jack did not ask Douling himself. As for high returns, nature is accompanied by high risks, which have nothing to do with Mr. Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go back and inform the two adults, and I will give you the news at the latest tomorrow night!" Mr. Jack, who took the first step, is still very optimistic about Du Lin, first He doesn't need to worry about Doolin's deceitful organization. A potentially powerful organization loses the money. It also has the means to recover the loss and the means of punishment. Secondly, the way Du Lin used to make money in the stock market was really bright. The King’s evaluation of Du Lin was very high, so he had the investment in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Mr. Jack left, Du Lin smoked while looking at the empty stacking area. He knows that if he goes down the line of Magus, he will spend his continuation of his qualifications for at least 20 years. With twenty years to gamble on an uncertain future, he does not have the patience and is unwilling to accept this approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new party can achieve maximum success by releasing capital power, so why can't he use the capital that is out of control to gain greater benefits? In the game of playing the empire, everyone is a chess piece, but everyone is also a chess player. How to play, it depends on who is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his cigarette butt and threw it on the ground, lifted his foot and grinded it, and with a wind of autumn, he raised his hand and pressed his hat. It gradually disappeared into the densely populated buildings in the warehouse area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the office, Natalie came to find Du Lin, and explained straightforwardly, "We need a regular hospital, and there are enough professional doctors and nurses." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the period of Du Lin’s departure, an accident occurred. A fixed scaffolding worker fell off the scaffolding, and the drop exceeded 10 meters. . Fortunately, underneath the scaffolding are neatly stacked steel frames. After the impact of the steel frame, some of the impact was rolled and unloaded. The worker was not killed. But unfortunately these steel frames, rugged texture and hard texture make workers seriously injured. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers’ union arrived at the scene in the first place and arranged for the vehicle to send workers to Nal Lindes, at the same time protesting to the City Hall. It is believed that the City Hall has slowed down the construction of the hospital, which is a disregard for the dangers that residents and workers may encounter, and raises the stupid idea that the City Hall should pay part of the cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of the entire empire's medical system is in the hands of the capitalists, and only part of it is the official operation of the empire, which has caused the lack of affordable medical infrastructure in some backward areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the resident medical insurance guarantee proposed by the Mennon can be partially accepted is also here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can guarantee that they are not injured, if they pay a small amount of money in exchange for free or a small amount of medical expenses to complete the treatment process, for those workers engaged in high-risk industries It is very attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment, "Does the state have its own medical system?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na Tally shook her head. At this time, the medical system was basically linked to the education system. This is a very strange combination. The Medical Education Resource Management Office is fully responsible for these two aspects. Compared with the more enthusiastic education system, the medical system is not very concerned. There is a special problem here, that is, competitiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital operated by the government is far less competitive than the privately run hospital. It seems to be a little unbelievable, but this is the reality. The private hospital has already paid a high salary. Experienced doctors and nurses, although the fees for public hospitals are relatively cheap, sometimes they may not be optimistic about the disease. On the contrary, private hospital fees are expensive, but at least they can be reassuring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is really a bit of a black eye in this regard, he licked his half face, a little tired and said: "Go ask if anyone is willing to take over this Live, if there is any bidding, if not, apply for an application, let the state office solve the problem, we can get the money, but the doctor must be a sufficient number, the business is skilled."<br /><br />&nbsp Natalie turned her head and turned away. Doolin didn't know if she felt wrong. He always thought that Natalie always twisted when she turned her back to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nal Lindes, the injured worker was still lying in the ward, standing outside the ward with several workers’ union members in suits and suits, and the doctor gently closed The door, the expression is a little dignified, "You are all family members of the patient?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho came out of a few people and glanced at him, feeling this guy and The people lying inside are not very similar. It is not the face of the two, but the temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho looked like a successful person, his suit and his face were calm and calm, and he had no similarities with the dirt-filled worker. He asked again, "Are you a patient's family?"<br />< Br Qiao&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho shook his head and replied: "I am Buzio, the president of the Otis City Workers Union. This time we sent him here. I hope to get the most accurate. Information, in order to facilitate consultation with the employer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor suddenly laughed, he knew the hardships of these workers’ unions, and met several times. Cases taken by the workers' unions do not need to consider the cost of medication for the people they send, and what is expensive and will be paid by the employer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that may be cured with only a few hundred pieces will become thousands of pieces after the workers’ union intervenes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is a bit serious!", the doctor started the communication in the way he had mastered, and his face looked heavy and said: "This gentleman has multiple fractures in his body." There may be some problems with walking in the future. In addition, his skull base is also damaged. When he falls, he hits the back of the head. Fortunately, the damage is within the acceptance range. This is why he has not been awake so far. Personally think that if he or the employer does not have the ability to pay..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following words are not his script, but Bujo is very skilled to pick it up," You don't have to worry about the cost. With the best solution, you must try to get him back!" He glanced at the doctor's condition record. "Can I take these things away?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor smiled and handed him, "Yes, I can rewrite one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhu Qiaodao The person who left himself left the hospital and stood outside the hospital. After reading a few pages and recording, I pondered for a moment. "First let the employer pay for 500 pieces. Can we get money from the city hall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The lawyer hired by the workers' union around him nodded: "This is completely possible. The infrastructure of the city of Otis should include hospitals. Because there is no such infrastructure, there is a delay in the time of treatment. The city hall should bear certain responsibilities. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucho pointed to him. "You think this idea is very good and correct. Let's visit the young mayor tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
