			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the angry Nasha was sent away, Du Lin returned to the office. He knew that when his tape became popular, those predators started. When entering the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of these giants needs a mouthpiece that belongs to them too much. The newspaper industry is firmly controlled by the George family. They can’t intervene and think. I have to find another way to find another way. At this time, Du Lin opened a window for them, and by the way, opened the door. In this new industry, there are no rule-makers, and everyone is likely to be the final winner in the industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a lot of capital will soon flood into this industry, but Du Lin is not worried about it, but he hopes that more people will enter the industry. in. If there are more people, the competition will be fierce. If the competition is fierce, someone will fail to make a loss, and this means that someone is making money. If any industry does not go through such a big wave of sand-washing process, new challengers will continue to emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no such mixed competition, perhaps at some point Doolin may need to face a consortium alone, or a tycoon who intends to cross-industry, Then the pressure on him will be much heavier and the difficulties will be more troublesome. Only when you put everyone on a plate at the same time, only when others do not regard themselves as opponents, will it be possible to surprise and defeat everyone. At that time, after a brutal commercial war, Du Lin’s Imperial Star Media Company would swallow those losers and turn themselves into a giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no new challengers, Du Lin will be monopolizing the industry, he will set standards, set the rules of the game, and everyone must be in his framework Play according to his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, there are still a lot of big killers in his hands, such as various series, various programs, various kinds of Interactive program... As long as he wants to, he can make an unprecedented program anytime and anywhere, and hold all the audience in his hands. Sometimes the first is not necessarily the strongest, but the first means attractiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the entertainment industry, for the television industry, attraction is the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the window watching Nasha get on the bus and leave the gate of the city hall, Du Lin suddenly suddenly wonders, do not set a bureau, put The George family swallowed it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is tempting, and it is not completely impossible to operate. In particular, the news brought by Nasha's trip indirectly indicates the attitude of the two generations behind her. Dooling can understand them. If the TV tape industry has the biggest impact on anyone, then there is no doubt that it is a newspaper. The charm of two completely different media is completely incomparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of his dreams, the circulation of newspapers has been declining year by year, or the living space of traditional paper media has been squeezed by the visual medium to the edge of death. . Perhaps it seems that the TV tape has little effect on the George family, but if every day there is a roll of tape in the people's newspaper box? If you can get the latest happenings and enjoy the entertainment through this tape every day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even...the emergence of cable TV? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn’t know if Mr. John had this idea, but he knew that the other party must feel a sense of urgency and would immediately think about buying it. industry. On the one hand, it is to prevent the explosive development of the Empire Star before the development of the George family company, and on the other hand, it wants to completely swallow all the threats to yourself, whether it is people or industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha is only the first step, and then I am afraid that her father, and even her grandfather personally appeared. To be honest, Du Lin still has some sense of accomplishment when he can bring such a big man to the broken place of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a pity that his good mood did not last long and he was destroyed by the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s face is gloomy and coming in. The key is that he still has a child in his arms, a child who seems to be only one or two years old, hanging The tears lay in his arms and fell into a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo is similar to all Guarts. There are many brothers and sisters in the family, so the skill of bringing children has already been very skillful. He carefully placed the child in his arms in a baby basket, the long basket of rattan weave. Then, after asking Dove to send the child to the inner lounge, he went to Du Lin and smoked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not speak, he was waiting for himself to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After exhausting a cigarette, he only smiled a bit, and he scratched his hair hard, causing the combed hair to become chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may have to leave for a while." He took out another cigarette and continued to suck up. The whole person bowed his waist to the window sill. On the other hand, "I have a little bit of things on the side of Vivian. I don't feel relieved. It's about three days to a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a little familiar in the morning. The middle-aged man sent a basket to the Buddha, the child in the basket, and the child of the Buddha. The middle-aged man was the steward of Vivian's father. Before she left the residence of the Governor, the middle-aged was taking care of her. This time Vivienne found him. When he sent him to the Buddha, he realized what might happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after seeing the appearance of the Buddha, he said a word to the Buddha, "Mr. Buddha, please follow your heart to make a choice, no matter What choices have you made, I believe that Mrs. Vivian will not blame you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left after saying this sentence, only stayed I haven’t returned to the Buddha of God and the children in his basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taking a smoky cigarette in the morning to take care of the children, until now he made a decision, at least not to regret himself, not to let himself be in a certain After a few years of hating his decision, he went to see what happened to Vivian, so that he would send the child to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not stop him, nor was he qualified to block him. This is the housework of Dufo, he was inconvenient to interject, but he made his own suggestion, "If You decide, you can leave at any time. When you go back, it is best to bring Kina, and let him bring his 'fish'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I know that there is not a fish in the box!", he used a fist to smash the wall, and the outer wall smashed some patent leather. "What is inside? Gun?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. "You just need to know what it can do for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo I took Du Lin’s arm and waved and turned to leave. Du Lin suddenly stopped him. “Remember why we were in prison in Tyner?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha’s mouth smirked and smiled, and the sun shone brightly, turning again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then found Kea, saying that there is something that needs his help, although sometimes the two will satirize each other, but this time Did not say, walked back to the house and took out the box with the "fishing rod", carried it on the back, and followed the Buddha without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha is actually a little touched. Kea is a "friend" of Doolin. Although he is also a friend of his own, there is no reason for him to be his. Take the risk because he is not Doolin. Ke Ke can be able to ask nothing, follow him without saying anything, which makes him have a "satisfaction" mood is spreading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two got on the steam locomotive that returned to Turner. The road was long and they couldn’t help but ask, "What is inside?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think is what it is, such as a fishing rod.", Kea is still a straight look, showing two rows of white teeth when laughing. A bright face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Vivian is in the residence of the Governor, and the Governor’s physical condition is very bad. Since the beginning of the year, his body has had some problems. The doctor said that because of the decline of physical function, his drinking milk can no longer satisfy his body's nutritional needs. The chefs have exhausted the method of making some nutritious things into liquid food for the Governor to drink, but the effect is very poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, every time he ate, he would vomit. His stomach did not touch the oil star for a long time, so he had a huge sense of rejection. Later, he was a little better. It is still so serious that he barely maintains his body without sudden exhaustion. Every day, he is one step closer to the god of death. The old man seems to know that he may not live long, so his mentality is not bad, which led him to live longer than the doctor’s guess for two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, when Mrs. Vivian was on the street to promote affirmative activities, a car lost control and slammed into her. She reacted at the moment she was about to be hit and escaped a fatal wound. But she knew that the man was sent by Peter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between her and Peter has fallen to the freezing point, and there have been many quarrels around the topic of divorce, and even Peter has not hesitated to say some cruel words to threaten her. , including including killing her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
