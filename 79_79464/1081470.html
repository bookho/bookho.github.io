			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Angelo’s statement, Du Lin still had no clear position. He held the glass of his goblet and licked it. Grio, "Mr. Angelo, this is an interesting statement. I try to believe that everything we talked about this evening is for your goal. Can you tell me how you plan to solve it? Trouble, not the same trouble as the Imperial Bank?", when he put the glass down, Natiya added some more to Du Lin, although this is a little inconsistent with the etiquette on the table, but it can be done in Natiya. It seems that she is very enthusiastic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angrio snorted and prepared a lot before Du Lin raised the issue, including the strategy and plan for the conversation before the dinner. However, in fact, these plans always have only reference value, providing a correct answer to an accurate answer, and can not really answer in the way of the plan, it is a stupid approach. In the conversation, the other party's tone, expression, attitude, and position will constantly change, and the corresponding adjustments may be made. It may be a weak adjustment or a large adjustment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t see Du Lin’s change of mood and mentality. In his preparation plan, Du Lin’s attitude was clear, such as Saying disdain, questioning, negation, and affirmation, as if to discuss an attitude that has nothing to do with yourself, does not occupy much share in Angelo's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the best child of the Diplesie family. He does not think that a child from a farmer’s family can master too many conversation skills, and it is impossible to completely Concealing his emotional changes. Even if they can make their facial muscles become stiff after training, there will be some changes in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human eye is a very magical thing, probably because of wisdom, wisdom makes the eyes of all wise animals very wonderful. Many people don't believe that their eyes can convey information and express their own inner fluctuations, but this is true. When you see someone who is very afraid of you, his eyes are full of fear and escape, and can make you feel. If you can meet someone you love and love you, you don't need to talk to him. Just confirm your eyes and you will know that you are in the right place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also a very special skill to feel the other’s psychological fluctuations through the eyes. It requires a certain amount of observation and sufficient wisdom, and requires a certain degree of training. At Dipreci's home, the way to explore the inner world through the eyes often starts with raising a dog. When a person can speak without speaking, just knowing what their dog wants through the eyes, they complete the basic training, and then slowly put the target into adulthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angelo didn't dare to say that she was the best, but it was definitely the best wave. The problem now is that he doesn't understand Doolin's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the two did not evade together, and there was a trace of sharpness in a shackle, a flat and gentle stone that was washed by the stream for 10,000 years. This gave Anglia a great sense of frustration, because Doolin was better than him, he was just a farmer's child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angelo said with a smile on his face, "We can vote in the self-regulatory committee to include your insurance company in the industry self-regulatory committee." Come inside and become the third executive member with an independent seat. I am confident that I can persuade the shareholders of the Western Insurance Company to stand on my side, so that we have at least two votes in the self-discipline committee. Mr. Doolin, as long as We can cooperate, the imperialist central bank also needs to stand by in this field! Even, I mean even we may be able to kick the imperial central bank because our votes are more than him!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very deceptive statement, because this statement is based on the legality and existence of the self-regulatory committee. If some people who have no ability to distinguish may be said by Anglio It will feel like this is indeed the case, the second is always bigger than the big ones. The western insurance companies are a beggar. Their "money" is still in the southern commercial banks. They will naturally choose Legislation or backward southern commercial banks, the next step is a happy thing. Du Lin was able to take revenge, and the Southern Commercial Bank got what he wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Imperial Central Bank, everyone is a winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Du Lin is not the kind of young man in the true sense of twenty-three years old. He knows much more than anyone else knows. He casually took a roast chicken breast in his own dish, cut a piece into the mouth and chewed it twice, then said, "The chicken breast is just right, you can taste it.", no matter how many Thanks to Du Lin for introducing food, Du Lin continued, "Mr. Angelo, I need to correct a mistake first...", Anglio clicked and showed a very serious expression, "In this At the end of the lawsuit, before the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Empire came down, the industry self-regulatory committee and the industry standard for insurance business were illegal, or did not have any value or meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"With some things that don't currently have any value at all, I want to thank you for thinking that I am young, but I am not stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Du Lin’s unreserved shot made Anglio a little embarrassed. He suddenly felt that it was not a good decision to personally negotiate with Doolin because he could not adapt to Doolin’s apparent attitude. With a strong offensive rhetoric, he seems to understand why Hill’s sisters are so angry when they leave Doolin’s estate, and he is angry now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a negotiating attitude. In the past negotiations, Angelo has also encountered people who want to deceive himself, but he is always very gentle and polite. Inadvertently break the other party's traps and scams, do not let the two sides have any embarrassment, and ensure that the negotiations can continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not such a person, he does not care whether he is embarrassed, just want to show his will, completely ignore the rhythm and atmosphere of the conversation, this Really a jerk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he had to sit here and continue to sit because Du Lin had the things they wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director sitting next to Anglio saw Angelo’s embarrassment, and he naturally took the opportunity to ease the atmosphere for Angelo. Mr. Lin, do you think that you can win this lawsuit?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said with a serious bow, “Of course, this is why I am emboldened. The reason for sitting here is not only that I can win this lawsuit, but also the other two games I can win. And not only I am sure I can win, I believe that you are also sure that I am the last winner, this is exactly where you are sitting. The reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The winner only needs to plunder what he needs from the loser. Only the loser will attempt to use something from the winner. I exchanged my hand for what I needed, sir, do you say that I am correct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director took a drink and drank a glass of wine to cover up his own Oh, Du Lin’s attitude made him very hurt, and he found himself having nothing to say. As Du Lin said, if they win, or can be sure that they are 100% victorious, then there is no need to sit here with Du Lin for this unpleasant negotiation, directly let Du Lin hand over the contract and The patent will do. The problem is that the answer given by the Legal Department of the Southern Commercial Bank is that Doolin’s victory is even greater – remember the famous saying that the law of fairness and justice “decision is always outside the court”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this lawsuit, the imperial central bank’s performance was too strong. In order to let Du Lin’s patents lose their profits, they not only brought the patent office to court, but I also brought the Justice Department to court... This is a very stupid performance, but at the same time very brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
