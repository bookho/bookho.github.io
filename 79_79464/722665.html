Agents trained in professional military training have a response speed of only 0.2 seconds. In this one-fifth of the time, they are visually and audibly judged whether they are safe, whether they need to fight back, and then they will pull out the pistol at about 0.5 seconds. Make the final judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, when a detective faces a possible danger, he may take less than a second to confirm the danger and confirm whether a counterattack is needed. This is a normal situation, and there are some abnormal situations. For example, when the mood is fluctuating strongly, this speed may have some small changes due to excitement or anger. For example, the speed of the response is increased but the speed of judgment is reduced. Then, with the instinctive drive, the most common actions in training and career are made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lightning-fast hand grabbed the pistol, the person outside the house heard two gunshots, followed by the detectives. Immediately, they rushed over with the guns. When they stood side by side with Xiu En, the eyes of the two were the children who fell in the pool of blood. The young body is still twitching slightly, and the hot blood makes the water in the cold air coming in from the room a little more hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman who looks dressed well ran out of the room, then glared at her chest with disbelief, crying and crying . The heavy footsteps in the attic made people feel a little uneasy. A man in a plaid shirt walked down the stairs with an axe. In his mouth, he asked loudly what happened. When his anxious eyes touched the child's body in the blood on the ground, the body shivered like an electric shock. His stiff eyes moved from the children to the black face and stood at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not know what happened. He only knew that someone had broken into his home and shot and killed his son. The emotion of his horror as he rushed down the stairs made him raise his axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the gunshot sounded again, more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other voice in the calm house, all the agents are silent, they are elite, naturally know what they are facing What the situation says, some people are giving their directors the next set, and even more troublesome is that their director stepped on without hesitation. How to deal with it in the following is definitely an important question concerning whether the Bureau of Defence of the City of Teel can take responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the middle class lived. There are already some residents around. The middle class is not the most in the entire social system, but the energy is the most terrible. If a country is a grand palace above the mountains, then the bottom class is the mountain, and the middle class is the foundation rooted in the mountain. Once the foundation is broken, the palace will naturally break and collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this group of people is upset, it will definitely become a huge political event, and may even affect the layout of the Bureau of Prohibition in the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes are focused on the body of Xien, and the anger of Xien at this time is completely vented by shooting an innocent civilian. He walked over to the two children, bent down and picked up the pistol in their hands. There is no doubt that these two light pistols, which have almost no touch, are just a toy and do not have any lethality. When he was stunned by anger, he did not discern the authenticity of these pistols. He now has to pay for the trouble he has created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect that this family is suspected of storing, smuggling, selling contraband, and searching for this house immediately!", his face changed a few times, calmly Speaking of this sentence, he can't fall here, he has great ambitions and ideals, how can he be trapped in endless lawsuits and prisons because of such small things? As the director of the Bureau of Confessional Investigation, whose power is now infinitely magnified, he may need to abuse his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not unacceptable to him because he has a reason to do so, the evil has not been sanctioned, how can justice be first? Faded light? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brains were slightly blank for a moment and the agents suddenly understood. They silently began to block the house according to the procedure and expel some of the onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of this house loves to be clean, and the work should be very organized, the layout of the home is very concise, this can be placed from the kitchen utensils in the kitchen. figure it out. The things that make breakfast are put together, and the cooking of the breakfast can be easily done in the corner of the kitchen without leaping back and forth. The cooking tools are used on the other side of the stove for lunch and dinner. The very planned placement indicates that the owner should be a person with a certain level of education and will plan, he or she may have a Work like accounting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen unscrewed the coffee machine, and the small cup under the filter quickly accumulated a lot of brown liquid, a special smell of alcohol disappeared. When he came out, he glanced at the beef on the cutting board that had been loosened to remove the fine film, unscrewed the switch of the stove, and placed two pieces of butter in the frying pan to discharge the cattle. The hygienic frying sound and the soot of the smoke made more saliva in the mouth of Xiuen. He carefully cut the steak in the frying pan with the clip, seriously as if he was really preparing for himself. A sumptuous dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be better if there was a little red wine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen does not know if his mentality is wrong at this time, or for other reasons, the busy detectives around him seem to be absent, he is leisurely Sitting on the side of the table with a plate full of steaks, tied a pink striped napkin, picked up the knife and fork and began to enjoy this steak with only six minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it!", a detective led a torn pillow with a pencil that was no more than five millimeters in diameter and no more than two in length. Cm seal glassware with some lavender liquid inside. This liquid is a hallucinogenic ingredient extracted from the mushroom and added with some drugs for anesthesia during surgery. Of course, this anesthetic can block the pain signal, and also release a lot of illusion information to the user, and the empire is labeled as "dangerous contraband." This kind of thing does not cause physiological dependence, but the process of hallucination is likely to cause the user to have various hallucinations to harm themselves and others, so it is completely prohibited. Only after the hospital and the authority sign the For anesthesia injection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slow-cut steak on the plate, and the pink blood of the knife is mixed with the gravy from the muscles of the steak. He glanced at his head and shrugged his shoulders. "In the face of conclusive evidence, the criminal is emotional, trying to attack the detective, being legally killed, you write a report to me." He continues to taste delicious Steaks, these steaks for the middle class are much better than those cheap steaks. "The criminals are really terrible! It also shows the value and necessity of our existence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning of the next day, there was a bit of incitement in the calm city of Tener. The first report was the Tener Daily, and the editor who published the article in the newspaper used a full The scrutiny of the interview examined the incident that happened yesterday. In the absence of any witnesses, the Prohibited Investigation Bureau actually killed a family of four. What kind of "thug" can be so fierce to let RCA explore? The players hit the first time All the "thugs", which also includes the only two big old child? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, whether it’s a daily newspaper or an entertainment newspaper, it’s reporting the incident and directly pushing the contraband investigation bureau to the forefront. Some middle-class people even spontaneously stood outside the city hall and raised their flags, asking for censorship and finding out whether the case that occurred before was a real "case" or a deliberate "murder." The emotional crowd wanted to rush into the city hall several times and was stopped by the police outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
