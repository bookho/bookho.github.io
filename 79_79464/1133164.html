			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the night, Du Lin participated in the recording of a political interview program. Anyway, TV Group is his wholly-owned company. Why don’t you have such a good channel? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it cannot be said that it is because he wants to run for the governor and he has a brand or a channel brand. In short, he is like a normal recipient. The invitees participated in this program - "When the time" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invited guests were not Du Lin, and two politicians who are now in the limelight. In addition, the host has a total of four people. This is a chat-like program with high ratings. After all, TV is often a middle class in society. Their sensitivity to politics is much higher than ordinary. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest attraction of this program is the conflict between different political positions and ideas. People also like to see the politicians with different positions in front of the camera. Demeanor, at least that will be more real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the recording, everything went smoothly, and the host did not raise any extreme questions. Most of the questions and conversations revolved around the general election. And the outlook for the future. When the show was in the past half, the host suddenly raised a question for Du Lin's question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, I heard that during the day’s public speech, you criticized some politicians for using false propaganda to deceive voters to vote for them. "When the host asked this question, there was a bit of a shock, she could only try to maintain her professional standards and smile on her face." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and did not deny, "I don't deny your claim, I did say that."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host stunned two other politicians who were invited, and continued to ask the scalp, "So, do you have any thoughts on the other two political views, do you think they have Fooling the voters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't say they fooled the voters, I reserved my attitude on this issue." Du Lin did not show the aggressiveness, but gave it An ambiguous answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this program, there are actually books in Taiwan. Some sensitive questions will be listed on the books to ensure that the invited guests will not be sharp. The problem is unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are also some programs to create explosions, create topics and ratings, they will hide some content, such as asking a star wearing a green hat, do you think this green hat is made according to your head, bring it up Is it comfortable? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After encountering a well-conceived person, he will avoid this question and not answer, but if he encounters a bad temper, he will have an accident, but this kind of accident is very A good propaganda point, people like to watch the star character's impatience and ruin to meet some of the unknown desires in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current question belongs to the kind that is not listed on the guest table, but the host has a different version. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continued to ask questions with a blunt, "Do you mean, don't deny that there is such a point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin laughed and said two times without answering, but the laughter made the other two guests frown. The political circle is a very interesting place. Most people have done this kind of dirty water. Although it looks naive, it is effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the rumors of Peter and his mistress that Teel had circulated earlier, saying that they have a lot of love and many illegitimate children, but in fact Peter’s egg is early. It was abandoned by the Governor. Sometimes the more low-level means, the more effective it is in the political environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What people need to attack someone is just an excuse, even if the excuse is fake, it doesn't matter, as long as there is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the guests couldn’t help but ask, "Mr. Doolin, you said that everyone else is a liar, then are you a liar? You can be sure that you said Every sentence is true, and fulfill them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at the guest and asked, "Follow your letter The meaning of the above, my understanding is that you have said some lies, and have not fulfilled all your commitments. I understand that there is no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest angry Resentfully, "You are escaping from the problem. Your answer has nothing to do with what I asked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "So you really lie. !!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another guest also had to make a sound. Under the guidance of the host and Du Lin’s ambiguous answer, he actually pulled him down. If you don't figure this out, his support rate is likely to drop by one or two points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many laymen, one or two points don’t mean anything, but the problem is that the campaign is not a one-man show, you lose one or two points, and others One or two points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming everyone is fifty, now is a fifty-two, one is only forty-eight points, and you want to catch up with a difference of four points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the 4% support rate good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to catch up. In some areas where the support rate is glued, it often fails to fail at a support rate of one percent. For the general election, he also Must jump in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, I personally think that a good politician should focus on how to improve the living standards of the people in the area, and be a voter in the jurisdiction. Do something meaningful, not like now...", he shrugged his shoulders, "making some ridiculous gimmicks to attract the attention of society, you are a politician, you are not a star. Those little tricks may be short There is some effect in time. After a while, people will see through your disguise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and didn't immediately refute, but instead looked at the camera and said "This is reality. When people are obeying certain standards, someone stands up and uncovers the shady scene. He can't be accommodated by others, just because he said the truth. This kind of thing happens often, it happens. "We are around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When those who dare to tell the truth begin to try to close their mouths and begin to lie under the siege of these shady, the society Finished!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There must be someone who dares to tell the truth, I am the one." Du Lin sat up straight and looked at the two, "I let Otis city from a garbage city." It has become the most prosperous metropolis today. I have made hundreds of thousands of families in the West have a reliable job. I have also solved some medical, education and security problems for many cities!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't dare to say that every single sentence can be achieved smoothly, but I am working hard in this area, then what about you? What do you do to make sense to society? Do you have something worthwhile to tell us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
