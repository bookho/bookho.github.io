			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west of July is sunny and the golden light nourishes this magical land, allowing everything to thrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basement door was opened, and the glare of the light shone in the moment, the dark basement became brighter, and Westwarika raised his arm to block the light. He was sitting in the corner, his expression was a little numb, or it was awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sleepy eyes of Hu Yu, some of them couldn’t figure out the situation and blinked their eyes, then thought of something, and the expression became a little more exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for teachers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slept at the foot of West Warika, closing his eyes forever. There was a clear mark on his neck that died of mechanical suffocation. The words of Doolin last night were doomed to three people entering the basement, only two people could live out, or one could not come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original West Warika is still thinking about discussing it, to see if there is any other way to avoid the death of a person who must die, but to enter the basement teacher It is very clear that he is instructed to kill the West Warika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the teacher's point of view, although the brain is a bit stupid, but he has a very good advantage, that is obedient. However, he did not think that, before this, the squad of the thinking channel of Luo Hu and Siwarika in the hut made the teacher think that he was stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the solidified thinking is formed, it is difficult to get rid of this deep-rooted impression. A person who dislikes him in his heart still wants him to get rid of a good relationship with him. friend? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The script of the drama does not dare to write this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, West Warika decisively started... and then the battle lasted for almost two hours, never actively deliberately wanting to kill someone by hand. West Warika and Luo Hu have several chances to kill the teacher, but they can't go to that hand. If the teacher didn't know where to find a rivet and wanted to stab Siwarika, maybe he still couldn't die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, West Warika untied his waistband and strangled the teacher himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first murder did not anticipate the physique of vomiting, only the anger and violent killings were surging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no plans to kill you, but you always want to kill me, then you will die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until sleepy, Sivalika, who couldn’t resist, finally sat down for a while in the mental and physical fatigue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of over-exposure in the eyes gradually returned to normal, and West Warika looked at the smiling young man, standing silently. He glanced at the teacher who would never wake up again, striding toward the stairs, and the silent look on his face gradually began to melt, as if it had been melted by the warmth of the sun, showing a smile. With a hint of humility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead?", Buddha looked at the one lying on the ground and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westwarika nodded hard, "Dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Buddha carefully I looked at West Warika for a moment and then nodded. "Go up, boss is waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not go directly to Doolin Instead, I was sent to the servant to clean up and changed to a clean and tidy clothes before I saw Du Lin, who was reading the newspaper at the table. Both West Warika and Luohu have shown enough caution at this time, because if the man is a little fluttering, one person has lost his life, and he does not need to be hands-on! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumor that many of the gossips associated with Doolin gather into a wave of enthusiasm in their minds, constantly rolling forward, constantly growing, this is a A man who can't afford to provoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the teacher made West Warika more sure of his own guess, all because they had done too much before, so Du Lin came back to clean up the mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not show the arrogance of arrogance, but was very easygoing. He pointed to the two empty chairs and put down the newspaper in his hand. "You must be hungry, eat something together, just as I have something to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sat sternly at the table, watching the hearty morning on the table, and the slobber's mouth was drastically secreted. He only thought of delicious food, but Siwarika saw something different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is called the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, I am able to live this life... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head and prevented Du Lin from discovering the changes in his eyes. Some of them were not used to picking up the knife fork and started to compete with the food on the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they ate almost, Du Lin ordered a cigarette and asked slowly, "One hundred and three people died, 346 people were injured." "More than four million economic losses...", he said, floating a trace of an unpredictable smile. "Can you tell me how this happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Westwarika sorted out his own ideas and told Du Lin about the original commission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at first they were not really going to fight the workers’ union, they just wanted to go to the demonstration and make an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Empire, but Many times emotional groups are always able to create something that is not planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the menacing demonstrations, the workers’ union locked the door and avoided it. This is actually the best way to deal with it, but when there is the first The moment when people went to push the locked door, the development of the situation was dislocated and could not be controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More people have joined this way of using violent venting, and they quickly damaged the door locks that could not have been strong. Then rush in to see people and fight, see things and swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers who heard the news came to see their atrocities. At this time, this is no longer a problem between immigrants and workers’ unions. It is immigration. And the problems between all the working classes in the West. Without a sufficiently fierce reaction, the working class will have no way to establish a foothold in the West, and a huge melee will be launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police who arrived came to be the last straw to overwhelm the camel. They asked the immigrants to abandon the atrocities and accept the investigation. This made the immigrants feel that the police and society included The judges are all biased towards the empire's natives, and the constant accumulation of negative emotions has finally erupted completely in a roar and can no longer be controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two groups of people attacked each other in two days. If the state government did not issue a notice, if the situation continued to deteriorate, they would ask the Western Military Region to send troops to suppress it. Perhaps this melee can continue to this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened carefully and occasionally asked questions that were more real and more detailed than what he heard from other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, Du Lin asked, "How do you think the conflict between the two groups should be resolved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a reluctance to stop eating, and the rest of the food was on Doolin. He was stupid, but he also knew that it was Doolin. He couldn’t do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, Siwarika is thinking seriously, and it takes about twenty or thirty seconds to spit out a word from his mouth - just! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, everything that happened so far is caused by the lack of justice, if there are more specific systems and policies to restrict everyone’s behavior in society. It is impossible to have so many situations from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the word justice is simple to say, it’s easy to say it when you touch it, but it’s not so easy to do it. Even Du Lin can't be treated completely and fairly, let alone a group of immigrants? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hearts of imperial people, because of the Western slave incident, many people subconsciously brought immigrants into the role of slaves, even if everyone knows this It is an incorrect attitude, but people can't control themselves to think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stereotypes This thing does not only exist in older people who are not capable of accepting new things, but also in young people and society as a whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People always say that the provincial sage is lazy and dirty, and the whole society recognizes this statement, so even if there is a diligent and loved clean provincial person standing in the society In front of him, there will be lazy, dirty labels on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded with satisfaction, this is a smart person, it’s good, at least it makes him less worried, he raises his hand and points with his finger On the tabletop, Luo Hu, who has been keeping his head down, looked up and looked at Doolin. "I want you to surrender..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
