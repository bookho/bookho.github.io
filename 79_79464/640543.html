			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In business, there are a lot of relationships that can’t be undone, and forced decoupling can only hurt yourself, such as a teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between teachers and disciples in this world is not as serious as the world in which dreams are, but in this world, the relationship between mentoring and apprentice is also measured. Whether a person's morality can satisfy people's pursuit of morality that they do not have much. There is another relationship, that is, a political guide. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past feudal imperialism of the old party, this system or phenomenon of the guide has existed for a long time. A certain aristocrat introduces a certain aristocrat into a political interest group, regardless of the future achievements of the latter, the former can obtain sufficient political benefits. Now that the two parties are standing side by side, this phenomenon has not only disappeared with the rise and innovation of the New Party, but has become the most important link in political exchanges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Dooling did not make a mistake, Heidele wanted to be his guide and refer him to a political figure to tie him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the Guar, there are some extremists who have been trying hard to make the former traitors pay for their actions. Many of the traitors are actually dead, but their successors have become the new target of these people. Heidler was included, and he received a death threat letter more than once, claiming that he would be allowed to accept the final trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Heidele and Du Lin hang this "leader" relationship, when Heidler faces the threat, Du Lin must stand Come out to safeguard the interests of Heidler unless he does not want to go further in politics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s funny to say that this group of people who are thick enough to talk to themselves can be left behind for the sake of profit, but they have to fight for it. The hope is to get loyalty to others, perhaps because they lack something, so they cherish and long for what they don't have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not what Du Lin wants. He doesn't want Heideler's friendship, and he can't want Heidler to be his guide. In the heart of Doolin, he had an idea. This idea was very dangerous. He planned to send Heidler to the trial when necessary, in exchange for more support from the Guarts. Therefore, he is even less likely to agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long silence made Heidler frown slightly. He was not sure that he was not clear enough. The boy who surprised him did not understand what he was going to say, or he was stupid. The way to circumvent this problem. But no matter which one, it is not what he likes. The former shows that Du Lin is smart, but lacks the necessary political literacy, while the latter...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an invitation letter for a charity evening the next night. I hope that you can participate. You should also appear in front of people and show yourself." Heidler did not give up, he handed an invitation to Doolin. Charity evenings are a very interesting activity. A group of businessmen and politicians who are rich in money are not money, and politicians sit together and mournfully shed tears for the bottom of the society that they are exploited and cannot survive. They donated money to these poor people, and then they took it away and then exploited them. They also exchanged good reputation and political value. It was too much to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seat of this invitation is next to Heidler. As long as Du Lin goes to the appointment, no matter how he interprets it in the future, he can’t explain his relationship with Heidler. . Because they are all Guarts, because the invitation is from Heidler because they are sitting together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knows that it is enough to reject Heidler twice. If he refuses to ask him what questions he will bring, he will think after a few moments and will invite The letter was put in your pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler took a sigh of relief and took a sip of the cup and raised his eyes and said, "I know that you are very busy now, thank you for coming today.趟.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up in a timely manner and left after a slight sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler is a relatively weak member of the Chamber of Commerce, but he is more than enough for Du Lin, so he does not intend to be strong enough before his current strength. There is too much contradiction with Heidler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Dulin’s calm back, Heidele sat in a chair and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left the house, Ramas and the car are already waiting for him. He did not get on the train immediately before he got to the car. Instead, he looked down at himself. Shoes. It is a pair of shoes that are not so expensive. He prefers to wear shoes compared to leather boots. The shoes were cleaned very cleanly, at least until now, but he looked at it for a long time before he said a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
