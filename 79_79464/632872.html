			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful lady sister hasn’t had time to squat and step up on the counter to enjoy the time of the sage, one hand will lie on her face, will She pushed back hard. As she struggled to lose something, she struggled to hold something, and through her fingers, she saw the good-looking boy in white clothes and another obviously timid guy to the last partition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is on, there is Mr. Duma's workshop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duma·Omitted some meaningless rhetoric and added the surname Paul is currently the main tailor and head of the Paul's clothing store in the city of Tnel, Paul The success of the ready-to-wear store has made this small clothing store almost the same as the “Paul ready-to-wear” in the main cities in the southeastern part of the empire. After the success of the new party, capital forces finally ushered in a major outbreak. In order to continuously expand the territory and cope with the number of family members that were restricted during the expansion process, the patriarch of the Paul family developed a plan for his two sons and two daughters. Claim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is, the Apprentice Inclusion Plan, the old patriarch thinks that if there is a suitable and talented apprentice, it can be incorporated into the family as an in-law and become a person. And then continue to expand the influence and territory of Paul's ready-to-wear for the family. The plan had to be said to be a very sensible plan. The tailors trained the apprentices, but if there were no restrictions, the apprentices would leave after the end of their studies, and then find a store elsewhere to start their first business in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is also the so-called "shameless first time" in the mouth of the handicraft industry practitioners in these years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn’t Du Lin become an apprentice in any handicraft store? Because he has not yet reached the standard of "evangelism", in simple terms, when the inheritor chooses an apprentice, he chooses to be an heir, or even his own descendants, so each apprentice is carefully selected. Has strict control. Few apprentices are willing to accept the “exploitation” and “oppression” of the inheritors after they have learned the craft. They are willing to give up what they already have and start over. At least then everything is done for themselves, not for others. who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is such a lucky one, Mr. Duma’s eldest son is sixteen years old and two years younger than the girl. He feels that there is a girl who can use it. Taking care of your son for a lifetime is a very worthwhile investment. What's more important is that after she gets married, she only has the craftsmanship and ability to stand up to a shop independently. Then she will be able to guarantee that his eldest son is at least worthy of his life. It is a very good investment, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, for all this, Du Lin is completely unclear. He now only wants to find the best tailor in this ready-to-wear shop, for himself, for Mason, for the Buddha, for Ellis, for the idiot of Graf. Two sets of decent clothes. As for the other? That is not the question he should consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Duma is 37 years old this year. He is slightly skinny, his skin is very dry, he has some shallow wrinkles, his hair is very fluffy, and he often looks like As a nurse, wearing a pair of glasses, lying in a rocking chair with his eyes closed. It wasn't until after entering this partition that Du Lin discovered that the bright light source from the outside was not all-round. In fact, half of it was covered by the lampshade, ensuring that most of the soft light in the partition was awakened, while the other half was always illuminated. On a translucent screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still politely knocked on the table, knocking so that Mr. Duma immediately woke up from the state of rest, he suddenly sat up, gold The silk glasses also slipped from the bridge of the nose because of his violent movement. Fortunately, there is a metal chain that holds the arms on both sides, otherwise it must be crushed. He stood up, put on his glasses, and his face was apologetic and sorrowful. "Sorry, I have been working in the morning, I am tired, I am sorry, all orders are 10% off today." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of bowing his head, his face changed and he adjusted back. The damn girl, don't you know to come over and remind him in advance? Being rude in front of a distinguished guest is really a very bad thing! Deduct her salary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very satisfied with the attitude of the "old gentleman" to work. He first pointed to himself and pointed to Mason. "Hello, we I need two formal dresses for the dinner party, I hope I can do it as soon as possible. If I can speed up, then it is best to speed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Duma is very diligent on the desktop A notebook was taken up, the whole person stunned, and then quickly said with a smile: "Too rude, hey, I haven't asked you and the gentleman's name yet...", after Du Lin told him, he was The name of Dooling and his request were written in the notebook, and then Du Lin stood under the particularly bright lighting and started the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked all kinds of questions while he was using his hands, and the whole process lasted for about ten minutes. His question is also just finished. Then he quickly cut out a formal suit with some pieces of paper and fixed it with needlework, placed in front of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
