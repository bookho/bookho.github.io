			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was such a big thing in the west, and the West Mine will hold various cocktail parties at regular intervals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eastern suburbs of Villier, there is a huge "garden" with various buildings and a paved A piece of high quality lawn. People who pass by here often can see that there are some well-dressed gentlemen sitting and chatting together in the distant greenery, or these people take off their coats and ride horses to play polo in a small place. Here is The headquarters of the West Mine. The mine owners did not mind tens of thousands of funds donated by themselves to maintain everything here, and they also represent their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time on a slope, several miners wearing shirt vests, with a delicate cap, waving the club to hit a small ball Far away. This is a new social movement from the federal side. Once introduced into the empire, it has aroused strong praise. The gentlemen and ladies in the upper class like this sport very much. It is said that the feminist movement organization also plans to hold a game. A female-dominated competition that promotes feminism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the people in the western streets, these people are also discussing the attacks that took place outside the city hall, but they all show gloating Expression, tone can not find a little bit of worry. The troubles of the doormen, for the West Mine, are definitely good news for the mine owners in the west, and they are a happy thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took down the dominance of several cities and began to consider how to incorporate the mine protection team, how to cancel the private armed forces, and ensure that the official land on this land It is the only force with formal armed forces. This idea was immediately opposed by almost all mine owners. Without the mine protection team, their property safety and life safety could not be guaranteed. The horse robbers would take their mines as their own home and patronize them. All the wealth. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the Mennon proposed an intervening proposal that the state government set up a new department to protect the safety of the major mines, the mine owners only need Pay a certain management fee. Moreover, the state government will adopt a “regional joint guarantee” approach to ensure and improve the safety index of major mining areas. Once a mining area has been attacked, the nearby mining area will immediately send some personnel to support the attacked mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea does not have much of a problem in nature, and it can even be said to be more efficient than the current mine owners’ own mine protection team. After adopting the regional joint guarantee method, the number of security personnel in each mining area can be reduced on a large scale, and only need to be able to withstand the attack from the outside world within a certain period of time. It can be said that once the plan is implemented in all the mining areas in the west, the mine owners will reduce their expenses and the safety factor will increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is because the plan is always good, but it is not so acceptable. No one wants to pin their own property safety and life safety on a party that has been involved in terrorist attacks, and there is really nothing in the Kadima party that can get the hand and convince everyone. But even if they do, people will still not accept it. The weapon is always the safest when it is held in the hands of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the plan of the doorman failed, and the failure of the mine owners directly led to the failure of his other big plan. In the previous period, it was probably a few years ago when the farmers were actively promoting the plan. His idea was to use such a special department, or even to stand up and set up a company to replace the group in the West Mine. The mine owner can also use this to open his own private armed forces on the open side without letting anyone find any means to disclose and attack him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a minority party, he still has a deep self-protection mood, once the new party or the old party thinks that eradicating him and the Kadima Party is the best choice, At least he can pull out a group of armed forces at any time and anywhere to fight, even to separate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his plan failed, he began to find ways to toss these mine owners, for example, the mine needs to provide the lowest job from 15 square kilometers to 15 jobs. Raised to fifty-five jobs in one square kilometer, and some other policies were formulated to make the mine owners very annoyed. These policies won't make the miners feel the pain, but they can make them feel disgusted, just like eating a shit will not necessarily die, but it will definitely be unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the farmer encountered a big trouble, everyone is very happy, it is time for the bastard to feel what is called pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a a gentleman who looks like a forty-year-old gentleman fluttering a club to fly a small ball, and several people look into the distance and keep falling. The white ball, he slammed his arm, "a very beautiful shot...", said that he handed the club to the caddy around him, let the caddy hold it for him, and took the towel and wiped it. face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that Mr. Hendry’s mine No. 3 has been dug up?", the person next to him suddenly said, let this The gentleman's face changed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he honestly nodded his head and confirmed the matter. "The gap between the results of the exploration and the current reality is somewhat different, and more than 100 Wancai can recover the cost, but I have no intention of continuing to explore the surrounding areas. Even if I can find a new deposit, I am afraid I will not dig it for a long time, and maybe continue to expand the loss."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hendry’s words made the surrounding friends immediately interested. The people who opened mines in the west were most worried about the bandits, but they couldn’t push a mine filled with ore. This is more serious than all things that hurt them. Without ore, it means no output, and will continue to pay all kinds of commissions, which means that the mine is finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Mr. Roel created a terrible mine disaster because he couldn’t dig out something, yes, “manufacture”! Inside the Western Mining Association, people very much used the word "manufacturing" very much in this matter. Everyone knows about the accident that happened in Mr. Roel’s mining area. It is a man-made disaster. The purpose is to lie. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "scam" also began to pop up inside the West Mine, and even some small mine owners are studying this matter, if one day they are in the mine When they can't dig out things, can they also try to make a mine disaster, and then make a profit, and take a huge amount of compensation to leave the west to invest in some industries in the South. It is said that the light industry in the south is very hot now, and there is not much investment but it can see a huge return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially some brand clothing companies, they produce a large number of low-end brands with a certain reputation, mass production of ready-made garments, good sales in the society People can't believe it, but it also brings a series of problems. For example, the influence of this brand in the upper class has plummeted. After all, not everyone who is willing to spend hundreds of thousands of custom-made clothes is willing to wear the same brand with the ordinary people on the roadside, which is a bit of a reduction in their grades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this has little to do with investors and brand owners, and it is said that they are making more money from civilians and the middle class than they are. They have made much more money from the upper class to make money for the dignitaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Hendry, how are you going to deal with your No. 3 mine?", a guy around Hendry was very concerned about asking, it seems to be aware When Hendry had some vigilant eyes, he immediately explained: "Don't misunderstand, my mine has also entered the countdown, and it will stop production for a full period of six months to one year..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the crystal, any veins have been dug one day, especially some small veins, may be a deposit. However, no one can guarantee that the results of their exploration will be correct during the exploration. In addition, there is a certain speculative nature in the mining itself. There will always be some people who will put their "future" in a big butt deposit. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
