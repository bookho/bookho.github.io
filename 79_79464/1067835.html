			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is very important, and it is indeed a very important issue. With the maturity of the "two anti-acts" and a lot of successes Cases emerged, people are concerned about monopoly and anti-monopoly anomalies. The maturity and improvement of all aspects of society make people more and more miserable for monopolistic enterprises and individuals. It is not a reasonable thing for industry resources to be held in the hands of a certain enterprise or a certain person. The profits brought by monopoly will destroy the health of an industry. More and more monopoly enterprises have begun to transform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't transform, you may be split! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Du Lin and Kevin opened a conference call to discuss how to avoid the interference of the two anti-laws on cable TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that he spent more than eight million before and after researching it are impossible because the two anti-laws are going to be handed out for others to use, even if others will Paying him an expensive license, at least within ten years, Du Lin wants to guarantee his exclusive management rights. This not only represents a huge amount of wealth, but also has a unique political convenience. Cable TV will be the best "microphone" beyond tape and newspapers, and will be able to spread its influence throughout the empire, or even the whole world, without leaving home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of their final negotiation is still very good, Kevin is very good at drilling loopholes, and Adams’s famous lawyers who want to face money are also very willing to Lin tore up the fairness of the law in court, and the results were quite gratifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin provides a different way of thinking about the two anti-acts, and there is a clear explanation for the word monopoly in the two anti-acts, Kevin’s life This seemingly perfect explanation has torn a small hole and reversed the situation with the help of the Adams Lawyers. Their idea is that Du Lin runs cable TV alone and does not run any content, so it seems that he is operating a monopoly business, but it is not a monopoly to open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he does not run specific content, it is not a content provider. This is like the relationship between an empire's power plant and the grid. Du Lin is operating a power grid circuit. He does not sell electricity. It sells electricity to various power plants. As long as Doolin does not block others from providing content services for cable TV terminals, he is not a monopoly because others can enter the industry to profit from selling content. If someone wants to sue Doolin's monopoly and wins, Kevin suggests that Doolin filed an antitrust charge against the State Grid to the Supreme Court and purchased the State Grid to help the State Grid complete the antitrust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just provided a way, a channel, to help others sell the "goods" in their hands to all terminals. Perhaps it seems that this is also a monopoly, but not completely. Because Du Lin did not have his own goods in his hands, he only provided services and completely avoided the regulations on substantive commodities in the anti-monopoly law. This is a contradiction between yes and no. Perhaps this will be updated the next time the Supplemental Anti-Monopoly Act and the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act are amended, and the provision of services will be added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kevin is confident that he will win the "outside the case" and help Du Lin persuade those who want a proposal or who can vote for the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this matter is not suitable for the time being, and Du Lin just showed his determination and confidence, and thanked everyone for his and cable TV. Concern and help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the press conference, the reporters left the venue with a souvenir bag, but most of the celebrities and tycoons stayed, and there was another in the evening. At the dinner party, most of them will participate. The conference brought them a big impact, and they also realized that a new industry is rising. Once Doolin’s cable TV proves its true value, it can be obtained as a content provider. More things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money, status, resources, and influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wants to talk to Doolin about joining, maybe they don’t know anything about this line, but it doesn’t matter, but it doesn’t matter, they have money. . There is nothing in this world that money can't solve. Money is the essence and core of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin, I don’t know if I can take up some of your time." Du Lin is talking to Nasha and Jeff about the next thing, one Men appeared beside them and interrupted their conversation with a little politeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at her, then said a nap to Nasha and Jeff and turned to look at the temporary entrant. "Hello, Is there anything?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is very happy with both hands holding a business card and handed it over, “I am the chairman of the company, very snowy today. I am honored to be invited by you to participate in such an inter-generational conference. I have some small questions. Do you know if you have time to mention it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Du Lin took a look at the business card, this person is called Lance. Daxueshan Tape Company still knows that after integrating two other companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy, they have smashed a world from the chaotic tape market, although they are not comparable to Nasa’s Empire Star and Star Empire. Jeff's San Fernando is much better than the other semi-dead tape companies, with a market share of almost 10%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This number is not bad, not too good, medium to upper level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the business card and clicked it. "You're welcome, as long as I know, I will answer."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance reluctantly, he thinks that those people are really in Black Doolin, and it is clear that a very good person is like a devil or a bastard in those people’s descriptions, which also makes him Realizing that there are negative rumors about Doolin outside are not necessarily true, there must be someone who is splashing Duolin dirty water. He converges on his thoughts and asks, "I think your cable TV will inevitably become a trend, changing the way people get entertainment in this era. I have a problem if Da Xueshan wants to join the content provider. In the group, like Ms. Nasha and Mr. Jeff, we provide content, what should we do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin snorted and stood Champagne took a sip. "You are wrong. You are not providing content for me, but providing content for end customers, that is, those who are viewers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I welcome everyone to join the ranks of content providers, and only have more content providers, so that more and more content can appear on the TV, so that the viewers are more satisfied. So, you let you The company provides a plan description, what kind of program can be provided, what kind of program, and if you have a plan to send me the explanatory documents after we have reached an agreement, then we are discussing it, what do you think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance didn’t think that Du Lin actually spoke so well, immediately thanked him and apologized again for interrupting Du Lin’s chat with others. I left soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people like Lance, Doolin is not disgusted. The more people come, the more money he earns. As for how to control, it must be To sign a non-disclosure agreement, for example, at some point Lance's content must be highly consistent with Doolin in a political position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance's success has made many people eager to try and want to talk to Du Lin alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The influence of this conference was just beginning the next day, and Du Lin was full of sincerity with souvenirs and other newspapers. Very satisfied, public opinion has also driven a wave of topics, everyone is discussing the issue of cable TV. Although there is another threshold in it - the cost of the TV itself is too high, but overall people are still very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially those middle-class people who have already purchased a player, they know from all aspects that they only need to install a decoder to receive the TV through the signal line. Signal, can't wait to write a letter or call to complete the installation as soon as possible. However, they may not know that the actual installation may take half a year or even more than a year later, and the basic lines are not laid so fast. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin intends to use a city in the south, Irian and the emperor as three signal centers to radiate to the periphery, and it takes too much to lay a nationwide cable TV network. Money involves too many projects, even if he takes all the money out, it may not be enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Du Lin let Jose put the company’s shelf first, perhaps because Du Lin’s reputation and social status are constantly rising, and someone actually took the initiative. It’s incredible to apply for executives, and Du Lin also met the candidate separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Doolin, I am very respectful of you personally, you are the best witness of the Empire Dream. This time I heard about you. After the cable company publicly recruited, he immediately quit his previous job to Irian and wanted to find a suitable position from you." The candidate is 41 years old and has worked in five different types of companies. From the department head, all the way to the chief executive, from the resume is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put his resume back on the coffee table after reading his resume, he asked a question, "Can tell me why you have to quit a high salary Work, come to me? Or what kind of attraction is there for you to give up a very promising job?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant smiled and said, "Because dreams, because of challenges. Chasing dreams is the innate power of everyone, and challenging new peaks is my personal pursuit. This is a very good company with terrible prospects and future. I hope to be with you. I went with the company to witness the rise of an era." He was very sincere when he laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
