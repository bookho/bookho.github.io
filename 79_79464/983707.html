			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter slammed the door, tore the neckline and walked back to the side of his seat, took the teacup and drank half of the cup of coffee left last night. And do it. He walked back and forth a few steps, and said something in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Donald Mayor’s attitude toward his police chief made people feel alienated, and the following people immediately showed some signs of miscommunication. . When Dooling did not leave, he was always a unique voice in the entire police station. No matter how unreasonable the task he asked the police officers to perform, no one would refute a sentence, and even the doubt would not be questioned. But now, there are already some unsatisfactory signs. These non-Guardian police officers have begun to violate his orders and even questioned him for the purpose of giving orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear why these people are doing this, just want to avoid the fact that when the mayor cleans up the Du Lin’s people in the police station, Go in. But they ignored another problem. When they started thinking about leaving a back road for themselves, they cut off Hite's back road. If Hite does not deal with them, at most half of the police officers in the police department will be arrogant and arrogant, and his orders will be ignored. If the hearts of the people are scattered, the team will not be able to take them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott calmed the anger in his heart and looked at Scott curiously. "What are you doing?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good thing!", Scott stroked Hite and sat on the chair he was facing, tilting his legs. "Boss said that since Donald is going to challenge his rules, then I should let him know that some things have been done, and it takes a heavy price!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is decided?", Hite stunned, Donald just took office. In a few days, Du Lin will take him down, is it a bit too fast. But soon Hite nodded and agreed: "No problem, he should accept the lesson, I will do it immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott left After Hite thought about it, he put on his police cap and went straight to the last room in the detention room. When he opened the door, the woman in the room immediately raised her head and couldn’t say the strange thing. This woman has been locked up here for almost half a year, and will start to make trouble at the beginning, not to accuse Du Lin or threaten to commit suicide. After no more than a month, no one took care of her, and after she broke her two-day food, she became honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every two or three days, a policewoman will come to chat with her. It is said that this is to avoid driving her crazy, but it is good to see her now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bag in his hand was lost, and Alice reacted slowly. She opened the file bag and had a thick photo inside. The look of Alice’s numbness changed for the first time. These photos are almost all close-ups of different characters. There are men and women, old and young, and they all have a distinctive feature. They are all Alice’s loved ones. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brother and brother, her father and mother, her uncle and aunt, all of these people appear in these photos. Alice slammed her head and looked at Hite. Her hand was holding her paper bag tightly. She grinned. "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I "Hite chuckled. "Not me, madam, boss. I want you to do something for him. After doing these things, you may have some trouble for the time being, but soon you will be free. Go to a new place and start a new life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea Specially looked back at the corridor and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, an explosive news was transmitted to all newspapers through the telephone line. Many morning newspapers and daily newspapers actually printed an urgent supplement at night. This shows the sensation brought by this news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor of Otis, Du Lin, has made a major breakthrough in the assault case, a free mind to sell the photos in his hands to 50,000 yuan. After a number of newspapers, they sold them to the remaining newspapers at a lower price. Although her behavior is very shameless, but everyone looks at the content of these photos, decided not to care about her for the time being, because these photos are worth the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of the same day, Donald’s face was picked up by the Audis Daily’s supplement, and the first page of the supplement was completely occupied by black and bold text. For "The Darkness Behind the Sunshine", there are seven enlarged photos. The entire newspaper has no text except the title, but it is absolutely imaginative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first photo was the moment when Doolin was assassinated in front of the Town Hall Square, and there were crowds rushing around, the most striking of which was Du Lin fell under the podium. You can see several assassins holding a pistol from this photo, pointing to Doolin on the podium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second photo is a car parked on the street. Behind the car, there are three faces with clear faces, and the guy with the weapon in his hand is rushing to the car. The car is hung with a local license, and there is a driver in the cab. These people are wearing loose windbreakers, with a dome felt hat, and the caps are relatively low pressure, but they can still distinguish their appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third photo is that these people are sitting in the car, one of them has a full lift, revealing his appearance, very clear. He was looking at the policeman who was running in the distance and the bodyguard of Doolin. The driver on the side had turned the steering wheel and the car left the roadside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth photo is a very ordinary street beat. In a street beat, a woman sits on the edge of the flower bed and looks at the book in her hand, revealing her thoughts. The look, the brows that are slightly twisted, give people a desire to find out, and what makes the beautiful woman confused. But this is not the focus of this photo, the focus is on the bottom left corner of the photo, the assassin is inviting a male sideways into a restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth and sixth photos are obviously not taken by the same camera as the previous photos, and the time may not be within a certain period of time. But in the two photos, the assassin who assassinated Doolin appeared. The assassin stood in the dress and bowed to the edge of the photo. In the middle of the photo was a very famous person in the upper class in the north. His name was Soro. The reader who saw this photo has already guessed that the assassin and the characters in the photo are definitely all related. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh photo, the content is very simple, everyone is familiar with it, it is the positive photo of Mr. Donald, who recently worked for the mayor of Otis. He was wearing a very decent dress half-side, facing the camera, laughing very sunny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people suddenly realized what they were, immediately returned to the fifth page, and looked at the person in the lower left corner of the photo with a magnifying glass, and his face suddenly appeared blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is Donald, Donald is with the Assassin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald himself was a stunned look, but he quickly returned, and he tore the newspaper torn. Yes, Solo talked about him and asked him to say a few words to the Cape family in Doolin’s ear to see if he could pass the road of the second person in his city and get through the relationship of the number one. The family gets a share of the casino. At the time they did sit outside for a while, and he did agree to Soro's request, but he did not tell Du Lin about anything about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just perfunctored Soro, but I didn't expect that he would probably be planted in this matter. This is a planting, a blame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time he can not hesitate to guess the push behind this thing - Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be that guy who hates himself for stealing his position, so in this way he is ousted, but he is innocent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald tells himself what he has to do, if he doesn’t say anything, under the leadership of conspiracy theories that can make anything as a conspiracy, Public opinion will definitely have a one-sided situation. Those ordinary and very stupid people will surely believe in some of the truth that has been distorted. He had to stand up and tell that it was someone who persecuted him. These reports were untrue and they were deliberately combined to frame him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the phone ring on his hand suddenly rang. He hesitated and picked up the phone. He had some strange voices on the phone. "Hello, Mayor Donald, I am Powell. I have a question that you need to answer. You must give me the most real answer. Only then can we choose how to do it, understand?", the voice on the phone. I paused for three seconds and then rang again. "Is Sorrow meeting you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald is aware of Powell’s, this time Powell can also say a lot of power, so he hesitated for a moment and said "yes". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you talk about Dooling and some policy issues about the city of Otis? This question is very important, you must answer it truthfully!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we said...", Donald’s words have not been finished, he has moved the earpiece from his ear, and then looked at the earpiece in his hand. The call signal inside has been cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you ask two questions and hang up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do Powell not trust himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald couldn’t figure out what happened to the world in a flash, but Powell wasn’t sure, because the call was not made by Powell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
