			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulat Mining Company in the gorge of Brewer Bay, Brewer Bay is actually a huge canyon that has been weathered for many years and has long since lost. The meaning of "Bay". The reason why it is called Brewer Bay is that the earliest discoverer of this canyon is called Brewer. Like many people who are looking to record their names in textbooks, Mr. Brewer himself has paid for the canyon to register himself. The name, but what makes Mr. Brewer feel a pity is that the empire does not accept the use of surnames to name a street and natural landscape, so that the descendants of Mr. Brewer point to the Brewer Bay on the map to tell others that this Named after their grandfather's name, people are very sympathetic to them and give them great care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brewer Bay ushered in many exploration teams, most of which were actually not interested in Brewer Bay, according to their The knowledge of learning in the past is really a river bay in Brewer Bay. During many, many, many years of the Ottoman period, the water formed by the melting of snow and ice from the western "Snow Top" Yaguer Mountain created Brewer Bay, which is just an ordinary plain area, and now looks like a majestic canyon. It is a miracle created by nature's ingenuity after the change of terrain. Of course, there is no such thing as a vein. It can only be said that the possibility is very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a variety of common sense as a circumstantial evidence, people’s interest in Brewer Bay is not great, but due to the investment policy in the west, there are also some People have violated their professional ethics, and they all claim that there may be mineral deposits in Brewer Bay. If more sophisticated exploration is needed, investors need to invest. Whether it's a lie made by the local state government in the West, or a trap set by the mining group to fool speculators, they all succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually not a complete flicker, because some natural bare gold particles were found on the weathered river in Brewer Bay. Some exploration teams think these Bare gold particles are not the output of Brewer Bay, they should be washed from other places along the water. But these bare gold particles have become the most powerful proof of Brewer Bay's high-quality gold mines, and many speculators and mining companies are eyeing this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Turat and his friends took out a total of 2.7 million to completely privatize the entire Brewer Bay, and then they continued to the Imperial Bank Lending, began three years of geological exploration - because the mineral deposits were not found, the exploration cycle spanned very long. Just when Mr. Turat and his friends were almost completely desperate, they found out. The place where the discovery was located was at the bay corner of the river. The exploration team accidentally discovered a large amount of sands during the camping. Brewer Bay became the focus of the entire west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the eleven years of excavation, Brewer Bay provided Mr. Turat with more than 10 million benefits, and his friends... have been forgotten. The poor gentleman had an accident while climbing the Brewer Bay Canyon, and he fell from a height and died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it has been built into a huge camp by Mr. Turat, with more than a thousand slaves and no less than three hundred imperial miners working here. The mine protection team has a full 300 people. Mr. Turat himself is no longer in the west. He has invested in a number of industries in the South, gradually shifting the focus of his business from gold mining to industrial investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn, more than twenty horses were loaded with goods from a distance close to Brewer Bay, and the campsite in Brewer Bay was built in the canyon On the basis of, there are natural advantages. At the entrance to the canyon, the two gates slowly opened, and the team members of the mine protection team standing above the gate looked at all the supply vehicles outside the gate with their guns. After several safety guards who were responsible for inspecting the vehicle made a safe gesture, the carriages were allowed to enter the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily replenishment of thousands of camps is an astonishing number. Like most mining areas, this is purchased from the outside and does not produce itself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the carriage entered the camp, a faceted coachman found the current head of the camp, the scorpion of Turat, "Mr., I have a question." I have to ask you, I don’t know if you have time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulat’s nephew is twenty-seven years old this year, still not married, he is not willing to come Here, it was completely forced to be sent here by his parents and uncles. He doesn't like it. He likes the colorful life in the South more than the boring life here. If his fiancée's family wants him to be "stable", he may be spending a lot of time now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the name looks like dust, even the coachman with the gravel on his hair is close to him, he seems to be a little impatient, "What is the matter?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, we hope to be able to buy excreta from you, and we can bring the excrement back just after we deliver it every day."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Turat’s nephew suddenly showed a strange expression. He looked up and down the young man who was just as young as himself. Some strangely asked, "You just said It’s said... '屎'? And it’s going to be paid for? Does your boss like the taste? Or do they have other uses?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The coachman did not reveal any rude expression to his boss because of the scorpion of Tulat. He bent his head slightly and explained the question of the Tulat scorpion. "Because there are several mining options this year. We ordered the living materials from us. The farms and pastures we have now can't keep up with the daily consumption, and we can only continue to expand the farm area. Human excrement can provide more land for the land, so that the parents can get Better and faster, and cheaper than fertilizer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulat’s nephew was still listening at first, and he began to feel the stomach after half of it. A burst of turmoil, God is on, his favorite thing to do is to eat some vegetables. Some Southerners often publicize the idea that raw food can provide more energy for men. I can't help but want to nausea when I think that the food I eat raw is actually watered with this stuff. The good eating experience now seems to be very bad now, and even he can feel a sense of scent from the mouth. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Although Tu Late nephew really wanted to beat this guy destroys the meal of his life, but he was very clear understanding that these are not complimentary stool Going out, but "selling" out. Even without these people acquiring feces, the manure in the camp cannot be preserved for a long time. Most of them accumulate a certain amount of manure and then they are sent to some mined mines to bury them. Now think about it is money, and it is still "own" money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulat’s nephew does not intend to hand over the proceeds of this sale to his uncle, who concealed it and agreed to ten dollars with the young man. One day, one month is three hundred dollars. It can also be three thousand six hundred and six hundred a year, plus some other income, it is not impossible to save more than 10,000 a year, because there is no place to consume! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the second day, there were a lot of strangers in the camp. These strangers got a lot of huge wooden barrels placed in various places in the camp. Even in the mine. At the same time, the management of the camp issued a notice requesting everyone, including slaves and non-slaves, to be excreted in designated places, or they would be punished. In the agreement between Turat's nephew and the supplier, behind the price of ten dollars a day, it must be guaranteed to produce at least 30 barrels per day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter was quickly reported to the management of the camp by Mr. Turat. Mr. Turat knew that he just smiled and did not instruct management. What does the layer do? Mr. Turat has two daughters and no sons. In addition to the small part left to the daughter, the rest will be the industry of his nephew. If he can stay in the West for two years and then get married, Without doing anything special, Mr. Turat did not intend to interfere with his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
