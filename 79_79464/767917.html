			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gavin and Joshua and I have signed a confidentiality agreement and left Irian, who will then arrange for Dulin’s work. Running around. Among the two, Jiawen’s salary is relatively low, but this is also relative. Compared with those who have only 20 or 30 monthly incomes, and the 30th district’s poor people in the fifth district, Gavin’s salary is already high. Joshua's salary is not low, it can be said that it is ten times more than Gavin, but for Joshua's request, Doolin did not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much money to do, how many things to do, this is the principle that Du Lin has always adhered to. No one can just take money and not do anything, no one can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina’s squad has also arrived, and after spending 5,000 pieces to buy a ready-made scriptwriter’s script, she started the selection. work. Du Lin has also visited a class in the past. The atmosphere in the crew is very harmonious. Everyone knows that they can participate in the filming of such a movie here, all because of the friendship established with Freina and Freina. Relationship with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting out 500,000 to make a movie is a big production in the current period. Usually a movie, the luxury lineup only needs twenty More than 10,000. Everyone in the crew is very grateful to Freina and is very grateful to Du Lin, which is an unprecedented breakthrough for their career. Once the film is released, their status and value in the film circle will advance by leaps and bounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these two days of investigation and tracking, I have basically understood the schedule and regularity of Xiao Fu Le Si, when Dudu told Du Lin about these news, Du Lin directly shoots the board and can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Little Fules broke free from the body of two women in the bed, and the night of the carnival left a lot of traces, and the house was full of decay. . This kind of life has already become his daily life. He looked back at the two strange women on the bed and went into the bathroom without looking back. The hot water cleaned the traces left on him and made him feel relaxed. Sometimes he doesn't like this kind of life very much, but every night, he is always uncontrollable and wants to go to such a place, in such occasions to have fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing a clean suit and leaving the room, someone will arrange for these women to leave, he does not need to care about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived at the dining restaurant, Old Forrest and his mother were already sitting at the table, whispering something, he sat down and said hello At the edge of the table, I asked the chef to ask for two pieces of six mature steaks and couldn't help but complain. "Can you imagine? I have been driving out of the old sports car three years ago, and everyone is jokes. Me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fowlers and his wife stopped talking, thought for a moment, and replied casually: "You go to Blair to pick a car and tell him to take the list and come to me to check out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blair is the general manager of one of the largest car sales companies in Irian, and they have the latest cars on the market. From the truck to the sports car, as long as you can tell, as long as it is the latest, as long as you can get enough money, he can get it. Many rich people and Blair have a cooperative relationship, they will buy the latest luxury car, after a 3-5 years, it will be cheaper to deal with Blair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cars Blair will be refurbished and sent to a little behind, and the same will be bought back. Although Blair is an unscrupulous car dealer, he does not dare to deceive these wealthy people in the city of Irian. He knows that these talents are his real parents, and most of the rich have the ability to play with him. So he is very honest and honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiaofulles excitedly shouted, he had long wanted to buy a new sports car under the House brand, it is said that the theoretical speed can reach one One hundred and twenty kilometers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fowlers looked at his son’s smirk and smiled very gratifiedly. The family was happy to talk about some interesting things happening in the city recently. Said the car accident of the Ilyan holiday crew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are really unlucky. I am afraid that I will not be able to continue shooting for a long time after the accident. The first colored film must be given to others. "But," Fowlers said casually, for them, what the first part of the second part has no meaning, is purely a gossip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Forrests nodded. "Luke’s 500,000 pieces of this time will not be reconciled. It is said that he will come to Yili personally. An Yizheng checked whether it was a natural car accident, or someone was smashing his hind legs behind him." When it came to Luke, the old Fowlers explained it to his wife and son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke is a nouveau riche, and has been in the family for five or six years. In the past, it was not that the poor were born, but only rich but not much. Later, a gem mine was discovered in the western region. There were rumors that there were a lot of gold, silver and gemstones in the western region. Many people went to the western gold rush with the dream of getting rich overnight. Luke is also one of them. It is only Luke that is different from most ordinary gold rushers. He directly circled a large area in the area and then asked the survey team to find minerals on his land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is also a very decisive speculator. He is similar to the old Fuller, selling all the valuable things and then gambling. At the end of the first round of surveys, there was no discovery, and many people looked at Luke. He did not reluctantly borrowed a little money and initiated a second survey. The results of the survey were consistent with the results of the first survey. The survey team believed that there was no mineral worthy of excavation on his land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost desperate Luke found his good friend, raised 100,000 pieces, and did not look at the survey reports, directly at the foot of a low mountain Start to punch holes. Perhaps there is really a fate to say that after two surveys, there is no result at the foot of the mountain, and he really found him a gold mine. The gold mine is not very high, but it is enough to make up for his early losses and bring him sustained profits. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After pledge the mine to the bank, he drilled holes in several places he thought there was mine, and finally determined two gold mines and one gem Mine, the rest there are some iron ore. The land he delineated was like a horse cell, and every place he felt was possible to mine, which made him one of the emerging rich. There was a very interesting rumor that Luke’s partner friend and his low price transferred his ownership to Luke and moved out of the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that Luke did not want to give his wealth to his friends, so he kidnapped his family and forced him to spit out that part of the ownership. There is also a saying that Luke sent the other party directly to hell, which completely ended the matter. No matter what the situation is, it is enough to show that Luke is not a good person, turning his face faster than flipping a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke’s coming to Irian is not a small news that few people know, many people know, and these people are more aware of Luke’s purpose here. what exactly is it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these things, Little Fowlers didn’t care after listening to it. He had no contradiction with Luke. His life was just eating, drinking, and having no part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Xiaofulus left, and the butler came to the downstairs with two girls still in the hangover. Although Old Fowlers is smiling, the contempt in the blind can be noticed by human beings. "My son is somewhat self-willed, I hope you can understand. If you are pregnant, please tell me, give birth to the child, I will give Do you understand the benefits you can't imagine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls nodded, and some of them feared to leave the villa quickly after saying goodbye to the old Fowlers and his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fowlers’ wife looked at her husband with some concern. “Why is there no news so far, will it...”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laofus patted his wife's back. "Reassured, it is because of this possibility, so I have been letting people spread the news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message refers to the news that if the third generation is good for the Fowlers family, the girls in this era are somewhat conservative, but some are just like they just left. The two girls, the purpose of their misunderstanding with Little Fleurs is for that benefit. The Fowlers family is not just a rumor for the infertile generation. Otherwise, how many girls have filled Xiaofulles over the years, why not even have a voice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the earliest 100,000 to the present one million, how many girls are entangled in Little Fowlers all day and want some of his essence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Fowlers left home and went to Blair, leaving a new House sports car directly from the store, causing many people on the road. s concern. These attentions and envious eyes make him very proud. His age is the age at which he hopes to get people's attention. Parked directly outside the door of a bar, Little Forrests got into the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeping so full, he should be active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Xiaofu, are you going to have two?", the guy who was sitting at the table and betting on the money waved at him. All the gamblers in the bar like Xiao Fulesi. They kindly call him "Xiaofu". Xiaofulus loses every time he gambles, and he loses very badly. At least two or three thousand pieces, he can lose more. Thousands. But the money is not so much money for him, so that sometimes he knows that if he wants to lose, he will make a big bet, just want to see the expression of others retreating and feel the excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand and today is not gambling. Just bought a new car and don't show off how his character is right? Take two girls from the bar to go for a ride, find a suitable place by the way, talk about life in the sunny field is what he wants to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of girls with a nickname suddenly stunned their eyes and immediately went to Xiaofu, but Xiaofu pushed them away with some greasy taste. He can't say that he doesn't like these girls who are sent to the door. But when he is awake, he is not very allergic. Only he likes him. As for the girl who likes it after drunk, as long as there is a hole, as long as it is a woman, he will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
