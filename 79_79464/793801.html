			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Huan, Mr. Luke...", the lawyer made a regretful expression as much as possible, but no matter how hard he tried, it was like In a twisted smile. This expression made Juan very annoying. He flashed a flustered eye in his eyes and stared at him calmly. The lawyer turned a blind eye to Juan’s somewhat threatening eyes, because when he announced the news, Juan was worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very sorry to inform the two here, don't you know if you know a stock called DreamWorks?", the lawyer's words made Juan uneasy, he ordered Nodded, the inner panic continued to spread. He thought that DreamWorks had reached a cooperative relationship with the George family one step ahead. If this is the case, he would not be bankrupt and would not be able to go anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows too much about these trusts that can be made for the benefit of what they can do. They can even use the free movie to put those movies in the hands of Juan. When forced to bankruptcy, he had to ask one sentence, one sentence about determining his own destiny. "You ask this because DreamWorks has also entered the lineup of this negotiation?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer shook his head. "I have something to do with DreamWorks, but the George family has nothing to do with it. Maybe you don't know, the stock of the DreamWorks factory has been suspended, the stock market and the empire. The Central Bank’s securities custodian office jointly informed that DreamWorks’ stock was suspected of financial fraud and is now investigating the investigation and investigation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan sighed, then some Doubtful asked: "Sir, what does this have to do with the people we are doing? If I just want to let me know this news, then I know now, we should save time and continue to discuss the issues that have not ended yesterday. That is the most important thing "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; lawyer shook his head, looked at some mercy Juan. This time Arthur asked the delegation to first understand how much resources Juan people have in control and how they rule over the industry. If they don't have a lot of resources and they don't have the dominance of the industry, then there is no need to care about the existence of the one or two hundred cinemas in their hands. As long as the George family completes the construction and acquisition targets of a thousand cinemas next year, one or two hundred of them are not their opponents at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Juan’s resources are really good and their influence on the industry is not small, then you can talk about cooperation in a limited scope. But the ratio of power to Juan can't exceed 12%, which is the bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed what Juan thinks. The entertainment company called DreamWorks gave Arthur a lot of pressure. The other side’s positive confrontation with the George family can actually increase the stock price, and there are so many big pens to enter the market. They, this weird situation gave Arthur some pressure, which means that Juan does have this possibility to become a partner of the George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no burst of DreamWorks itself is a scam! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now that everything is over, looking at the rich man who once had the opportunity to become a client, the lawyer’s eyes are left with jokes and pity. "Mr. Juan, Mr. Luke, this scam involves tens of millions of funds. The police investigation headquarters of the Imperial City has set up a task force for this purpose, inviting Emperor's most famous prosecutor, Anpu, as the leader of the task force. The person came to investigate the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just this morning, the president of DreamWorks has been arrested and brought to justice, and when the flow of funds was reversed, it was discovered. Your funds may have been involved in this case. According to the executive order issued by the Supreme Court of the Imperial Empire, the assets of Mr. and Mr. Luke have now been frozen, which means that you can't do anything until the case is closed!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huanteng’s moment stood up, his face was scared, and compared to Luke’s face, he said something very much to the lawyer. Understanding. To put it simply, he is finished! Before the tens of millions of scams were completely closed, all his assets were gone, including his deposits in the Imperial Central Bank, and the theaters he was acquiring and the theaters under construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s often a few years before such a fraud can be completely closed, and any case involving economic types requires a long process, because even if it’s a piece Money, they all need to figure out where the money has been transferred or spent, and there is enough evidence to prove that consumption or transfer has occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t hold it for years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t spend years, after a few months the George family can handle everything with great care, and Juan even wonders if the Georges have used their relationship. Push yourself to the edge of the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible. All my funds are very clean. It is impossible to involve any fraud cases!" Juan retorted, and he still has this last trace of luck, if he can prove himself and this case If there is no relationship, even if there is a loss, it is not unacceptable. At least he can sell his own things to the George family, and then return to Ilyan to continue his business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sentence of the lawyer allowed him to sit in a chair. "I am here to disclose some private news. This may be related to Mr. Luke. "He took a breath after he finished, raised his chest and smiled and clicked. "Well, gentlemen, we should go back, thank you for your hospitality during this time. If there is still a chance, we may still I can sit together." His smile clearly said that there was no chance. After finally glanced at Juan, a group of people left the meeting room in an orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke looked at Juan with a sullen look, then grabbed a lawyer who hadn’t returned to the present and asked him to explain it. At this time, the director of the regional police station stepped in. More than a dozen police officers held pistols and aimed at all the people in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Huan, this is the agent of the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau. I will leave Irian to the Imperial Capital for some time. I hope you can Understanding and cooperation." After the police chief finished speaking, the four police officers temporarily inserted the pistol into the holster and took out the handcuffs and walked toward Juan and Luke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke’s anger is also very frightening, and now he has no idea what is going on, why is it that the situation that is very favorable will become like this? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the Emperor’s Amp, the guy who kept coughing across the table was spinning fast. He played with the pencil in his hand and was not in a hurry. Start interrogating the work for the other party. He looked down at the man about the man. He was the vice president of the company at DreamWorks and had a very serious illness. This disease is called "dead cells" and is produced in the human body. It will continue to devour healthy cells and eventually force many organ diseases to cause death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, no specific medicine or physical therapy has been able to effectively treat this disease, as long as it is worth it, it is declared death. The only difference is the problem of being a little earlier and later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information was written more than a month ago. He suddenly acquired the company he worked for in an unidentified amount, then renamed the company into a dream factory, and personally Made this scam. From the point of view of his previous confession, there is no problem in the general direction, and some details are to be reconsidered. But is this case so simple? Certainly not, the simplest truth is where the huge sum of money of more than 70 million goes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
