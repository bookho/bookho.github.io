			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., although we are friends, but you have been suspected of this behavior!", Du Lin’s eyes were pumped, and he honestly said he had already believed Points, because no woman will lie on such things, especially Alisa knows that she is a robber of a gold robbery, but it is very dangerous and bloody! What's more, once Du Lin's work was discovered one day, even Alisa and her family were subject to criticism and interrogation. Her own accomplice was absolutely unable to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa looked down at the table and Du Lin immediately took the coffee cup up, watched her vigilantly and then drank all the coffee in the cup. Off, the former tickles on the table with both hands squatting, whispering slightly and bending. "What good is it for me to lie? Do you think I am willing? Do you know that I am pregnant? Every minute and every second seems to be suffering!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin turned his head and looked at Dave, who used a schaden in the moment before. I looked at Dave in my eyes, but now I have become a little bit unspeakable. "Do you think so?" He suddenly reached out to Dave. "Isn't you asking me yet?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave recovered from the shock, subconsciously and Du Lin shook hands and then reported his name. "Dave, call me Dave... you really Is Alisa's friend...", the two friends who should have been full of emotions suddenly became bitter. Dave now just want to find a place to beat their own meal. He intended to bring Alisa to distract, but the ghost knew that he would meet the "irresponsible man" here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this man’s clothing is very elegant, and it’s definitely not something that people like him can offend. He doesn't know what to do. If he leaves him, he will regret it, but if he doesn't leave, he feels too much, and it is too embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and nodded, took a ten-dollar bill from his pocket, and pointed to the intersection of Dawn Avenue and the beach. "There is a store over there, please help me buy a pack of cigarettes, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave was overwhelmed by Du Lin’s hand. Money, he opened his mouth and didn't know if he wanted to refuse or if he had any other words to ask Du Lin, but these words were swallowed back to his stomach. At the moment he turned, he stopped and said. In a word, "The smoke generated when smoking is not good for children...", then turned and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy, Du Lin looked back at Alisa, and he raised his hand and pressed a few times. "There is something to sit down and say that not only the smoke produced by tobacco is bad for children, but also the anger that affects the development of children. You Have you heard of it? When a child is in the mother's stomach, he can actually receive emotional infection from the mother. If you are always angry, the child may also be a bad-tempered child, which is not good!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa shook her head a little blankly. "I don't know this... hell, we are talking about you now!", even though she finally found Du Lin's premeditated topic Very timely response, but she still sat back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged. "So what do I have?", he glanced at the belly of Alisa and rolled his eyes. He is not married yet, but he will have a child soon, an unexpected child. The gods made a joke with him, which made him very headache. He doesn't know how to deal with this child. If you stay with me, it's obvious that Alisa will stay. There is nothing left. The key is that Du Lin will enter the eyes of the big guys and have some risks. Maybe someone will come to assassinate him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can ignore the lives of other people, but this child is his first child in this world after all, he does not want this child to have an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if they let their mother and child go back? So, will those people use Alisa and this child to marry him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin fell into meditation, and even Eliza said nothing, and for a moment his eyes began to condense, very solemnly asked "Who else knows that I am the father of this child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa is stunned by him, "Do you feel embarrassed? Have a Does the illegitimate child affect your social assessment?" She didn't have a good face, and it wasn't Du Lin's surprise that she was wronged. She has fantasized many times, if she suddenly appears in front of Doolin or holds a child's hand and tells him that this is his child, how will he react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be doubts about the authenticity of his relationship with the child and his son, or may be indifferent, but Alisa believes that the biggest possibility is that he will be very surprised. . However, the facts tell her not to believe what I guess, because that is simply not reliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled twice. He knew that the girl must be full of grievances, so she did not pay attention to her complaints and complaints. "It is related to our safety, Alisa, you know that it is what I did, if Let them know that I still have a child. Who do you think is more dangerous? Is it a robber with an automatic weapon? Or an unarmed mother and child? You must tell me the truth, if you want to hide something, it will appear later. Any danger and loss, then you can only bear it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he talked about the safety of the child, Alisa will be serious, she carefully After recalling the past, I finally breathed a sigh of relief. "I have never said anything like a child with a father. They all thought that I was a slut. I would not explain it to them. Until that moment, it was I first told you about your relationship with the children in my stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "That is, only you, me, Dave know And the guy at this tea restaurant Maybe you know, is this the case?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisaton was alert, and some of the guards sat back and put the handbag in front of her stomach. "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes became sensational. He raised his neck and sorted out his neckline and bow tie. “Of course it’s patched. "Vulnerabilities.", said that he hit a finger, looking for a guy to call a phone, when the guy turned around, Alisa squatted on the table and said as far forward: "You can't do this, they don't do anything. Know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When they know what, we may have already died. You can't think about it for yourself, but please consider yours. Family and your child. Right, I forgot to ask, is that Dave your husband?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa turned her eyes and said: "He Pursuing me." There are four very clear positions in men and women, friends, pursuers and pursuers. Couples, unmarried couples and couples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reveals a very regrettable expression, "Sorry, he may be the only one who is the only one to pursue you...", he closed his mouth. Let the dude put the phone on the edge of the table, and then Du Lin did not say anything after watching the guy leave. He called the number on the phone and after the operator was busy, someone finally answered the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just said a word, just hang up the phone - let the Buddha come to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who is at home, including Dove, Du Lin knows that Du Lin goes back to have a cup of coffee every morning and eats half a burritos. This is his habit. In addition to the bad weather and his things, this time you can find him on Dawn Avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa has an unbelievable expression, she can’t quite understand why it’s going to happen when she meets this man every time, “Hey, You won't come true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slightly tilted his head and smiled and asked: "Do you think I am joking?", Doolin's The expression is very serious, which makes Alisa completely unaware of how it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows very well that what Du Lin said is different from what other people said. Du Lin said that it is possible to kill someone. It’s a joke, but it may not be a joke. As for other people, it is a kind of venting to say who is going to kill anyone, and they can't do it, but Du Lin can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will return to Orodo with Dave tomorrow, let him go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Du Lin smiled and smiled. "You are in front of the father of the child in your stomach. Please ask me to let go of another man. Do you think that your thoughts and behaviors are asking me to let him go, or to force me to make up my mind? "Don't kill him?", Du Lin took a nap in Napa burritos, and the gangs bulged and chewed and said: "I think the latter is more likely, what do you say?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa just wants to say something when Dave happened to be back, he gasped slightly, he used to run this way, he was a bit uneasy Alisa A person is there, but I know that two people are sure that some words are inconvenient for him to hear. He ran back in time and squatted and placed a pack of cigarettes on the table near Doolin. "Your cigarette!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Thank you!", Du Lin nodded and picked up the cigarette case to open, took out one and then clicked on it. He took a bit of a surprise, looked at the trademark on the cigarette butt, and then asked some strangely, "This is Twelve dollars in a box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave grinned. "Yes, we usually smoke this smoke..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
