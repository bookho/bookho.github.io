			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s amusement park project has not yet received public examinations, but it can be said that it has achieved unprecedented success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, people’s stereotypes about amusement parks were that children were not mainstream consumer classes, and children like amusement parks because amusement parks don’t cost anything. It’s nothing more than an ice cream, or a bucket of popcorn, plus a drink, three or five is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, here, they found the horror of this amusement park, even adults like them are firmly attracted, not to mention More resistant children? According to Du Lin's single-vote and package, if a person wants to play all the projects in the amusement park, it takes at least two days to three days, and that kind of whole-hearted effort to play. Then you need to buy a package, the price of the package is 28 yuan, full of six drinks and two ice cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, this price is a bit outrageous, although many factories and companies are now raising wages, and people who earn more than 40 yuan a month are getting more and more More, but with more than half a month's salary to play, and used up in two days, still too heavy. On the contrary, the 28-point ticket may be more cost-effective. One ticket can participate in about 80% of the rides, and the rest requires two or three tickets. This kind of consumption is acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spend three or five, play a dozen projects, and then go home happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that most people forget one thing. Playing in the amusement park will never be a person, maybe accompanying their own couple, maybe Brothers and sisters, maybe the whole family, but not alone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is Ilyan, one of the three pearl cities on the east coast of the Empire, and it is the eighth district, the holy place for future filmmakers. Whether it's those with amazing income stars and the film industry, or those who can come to Irian to catch up with the stars, they will not lack the support of funds. In particular, this movie-themed amusement city will become a gathering place for many fans to review the classics. They will even come to play here, and then bring back what they want to share with others, attracting more people and so on. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who participated in today’s visit to the amusement park are mostly the middle and high class in the city of Irian. The reputation of the amusement park and the thrilling fun of it quickly passed through their mouths. It broke out in the city and it was only a week before it was opened. Some people have already asked for a pre-purchase package, which is really surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the amusement park, Dooling went to the headquarters of Imperial Star Media. In the third district, Doolin purchased a six-story building as the headquarters for the filming. Most of the tape content has been filmed here so far. He came to "inspect" the company today and stabilize the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he thought, the tentacles of the George family had reached Elian, and according to Freina, the George family had begun to contact the Empire in private. Star Media’s employees include members of the screenwriter and director group, as well as several young actors who have emerged in sitcoms. As for whether there are more people in contact with it, it is still unclear that these people have reacted to Freena because they signed a breach of contract with the company to scare the death contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary staff who don’t have huge liquidated damages can’t say it, Du Lin still remembers that there is a truck driver standing in the dream of the world in the dream, maybe There are some potential people in the little characters who will change the world's trajectory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena accompanied him in the company, Du Lin did not have any position on what he saw and heard, it can be said that the company operates in an orderly manner, It can be said that there is no surprise. He was actually a bit disappointed because he found that Freina seemed to manage the company well, but the way the company operates and the projects it operates are all from him. Simply put, there is no innovation, no excitement. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought together the top leaders of the Empire Star Media Company, saying that all the top executives actually add up to six people. As the company's vice president, Freina, the director of the director group, the head of the writer group, the head of the prop group, the head of the cast group, and the head of the house group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long story short!", Doolin sat on the first seat of the oval conference table, his fingers slammed the table, the rhythm in the quiet conference room The "squeaky" voice made the company's top executives nervous. "The George family media company will set up and launch their first tape after the election, and other companies will be established next year and compete with us. The market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a primitive jungle that has not yet been developed by humans. There are countless treasures hidden in it, in order to maintain our strengths and resources, You have to set up more projects. I have a suggestion, you can think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever anyone has a chance, God may say when Give them a spiritual flash, we need this flash. I think anyone, including cleaners and drivers, has the power to come up with their own ideas, if their ideas have room for operation, give them the opportunity to let him Attempt, perhaps an ordinary person would break out in our eyes in this new field of amazing energy "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"The second point, does our company have a filming plan?" Du Lin looked at Freina sitting on his left hand side. Freena shook her head. Du Lin regained her gaze and looked at everyone. "This is not good." We must have a film plan, the tape is for family entertainment, and the film is for mass entertainment. It also gives the company the actors who signed the contract, as well as the actors trained in the school, a goal, a dream, an opportunity." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third point, we can't sit here waiting for new technology to come out, can't sit and watch the times, take a step, let's take a step. Do this line We must catch up with the forefront of the times, even beyond the footsteps of the times, to ensure that we can always occupy an absolute advantage. I will set up a new department, the Department of Film and Television Science and Technology. The company's continuous development has made It’s a bit crowded here, I’m going to move the company out of the shoreline and pick up an island in the sea.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There are only three points built right now.” What do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin looked at the top of these companies, he only saw tame and obedience from their faces, did not see What he wants to see. He looked at Freena on his head. To be honest, he was a bit disappointed, but he was not very disappointed. After all, Freena is a "capitalist" who is a half-way monk. She has not learned how to make a company grow stronger, so this can't blame her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena knows what to say at this time, her mind is turning, and soon she raised a question that is not a problem, "Mr. President, if you need to finish The assumptions you mentioned are probably not enough funds in the company's accounts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waved his hand and said, "I will add no What are the problems with less than five million funds for activities?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After disbanding the meeting, Du Lin left Freena, and Freina knew that Du Lin might not be satisfied with the company's management. She was slightly behind and stood by Doolin. Du Lin stood in front of the window and looked at the lively city of the third district. For a long time, she looked sideways at Freena. "You will clear your work and I will find someone to take over your job." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena was shocked, and an unspeakable feeling filled her body instantly. She opened her mouth slightly and her face became pale and suffocated. The feeling made her chest boring. Her hand was tightly on the hem, and after a while it was relieved of the uncomfortable feeling. She nodded and said softly: "I know, I will hand over the work in my hand as soon as possible."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
