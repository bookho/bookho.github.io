This is political achievement, and the tree itself is not It’s all about political achievements, because there are things that can change and change. This release of Dooling focused the empire and even the world's eyes on Irian. This is a great achievement. People know that there is a city called Irian on the east coast of the empire. One is called Houghton. The mayor, during his reign, not only managed the Elian management, but also created the industry miracle in the eighth district, and also let cable TV be born here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, the great mayor, the economy, society, science, and the excellent results, then he must be a long time... ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this incident, the relationship between Holdenton and Dooling has eased a lot, and Scott’s departure once brought Horston into Among the shame and fear, he did some good and bad things in Irian for so long. Scott knew that he was involved. He ran to Du Lin, did he have a deeper meaning? For example, in the general election three years later, did Du Lin intend to use Scott's black material to stop himself from becoming a governor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not impossible. Everything in the political circle can’t be seen too simple, even if Magus puts a fart in his speech. It is possible that he is suggesting that some people, he did not count, or accused some people of not listening to his words at all. Even a fart can become so complicated, not to mention a person who holds his own black material, so Hossington thinks that Doolin is not a good person. But this time, he felt that Du Lin was good, and he wanted to open it. He took the initiative and Du Lin to ease the contradiction before – because of the city of Doolin Otis. The long position was dismissed, and he has now left the city of Otis, and he has no influence on him. Plus, Harry has some minor troubles now, and someone needs to be able to help him. It is not a big problem for Holden to hold the position of governor of the next state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to catch up with Doolin, Horston chose something that both of them were familiar with as the opening remark, Harry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Harry has a little trouble lately, have you heard that?", the two stood at the door behind the media signing place and chatted about the sky, or Huo Sidton took the initiative to find Du Lin to chat. "A few days ago, he also called me to complain to some departments that it was very uncomfortable for some things that might not exist at all."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing, Du Lin really did not hear that the relationship between him and Harry has always been used by each other. Later, Harry pitted him twice. He found a little face and the relationship between the two. Not as good as it was at the beginning. No one can hang up his Du Lin who can be his friend, except Mr. Kesma. So when he heard that Hossington said that Harry had trouble, the first reaction was to show some smiles. Of course, he would never admit that he was happy. "When it is said that he was caught by his wife?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha..., that wouldn't be!", Hossington smiled very exaggeratedly and held what Du Lin said, Du Lin is now not The mayor but the same important position, just the identity of the president of the association, can not make people look down on him. "It is also a bad luck to say that the cabinet passed the "Counter Crimes Act" after the end of the year. Do you know?" Dulin nodded. Hossington continued. "In April, two businessmen sued the Imperial Court of Justice and illegally misappropriated their assets and sold them to others, involving illegal transactions and duty crimes. Now the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are investigating these things in Harry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holston said that the smile on Du Lin’s face became weird, This is what he originally wanted Harry pit complex a bureau him the word. To put it simply, the three scammers took a piece of land in the city center with the help of the development. Then they faked a piece of things and prepared to run. At that time, they planned to sneak into the Federation from the East Coast. They cheated almost 10 million in Harry's side, enough for them to spend a lifetime in the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing was known to Du Lin. After all, the biggest smuggling channel on the East Coast is him. Sometimes some snakeheads have to cross the road and need to say hello to Du Lin. of. Even if Du Lin does not participate in the smuggling of such business, as a courtesy, these snakeheads will talk to Du Lin about when to send something from that channel to somewhere. This is a kind of courtesy, but it is also a hidden rule. They and Du Lin greeted them. Once they met them on the sea, Doolin’s smuggling ship, they would not have anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if these snakeheads don't say hello to Doolin, they can't say that Doolin's smuggling ship will come black and black. It is safer to eat black at sea than black on the land. After all the things were stolen, the people killed the light and went to the sea to cut through the ship. Even God could not know what happened here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who knew this thing, let the snake head bring him to him. He gave the snake a hundred thousand pieces of benefits, and promised not to expand this thing. Calculate, after all, the snake head also depends on this line to eat. After getting the person, Du Lin began to lay out the pit Harry. He first lost a person and said that he was cheated by his companion, and actively tried to raise funds to build the developed land. On the other hand, Du Lin arranged for another person to send money to Harry, saying that he wanted the piece of unfinished building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry, who has just emerged from the whirlpool of the mid-term election, is facing a tight situation, and Du Lin’s arrangement is 500,000. Four times, it is two million. In the face of so much money, Harry also knows that he should do things when he takes the money. He first re-accepted the land to the state government by interfering with judicial justice, and then he got angry at the auction and let the people arranged by Du Lin take it. Got the ownership of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very common power transaction, in which the swindler who took the land was also thrown into prison by Harry and sentenced to fraud for decades. If this is the end of the game, maybe everyone is good, I am, Dulin’s businessman got the land and built a building. Harry got a two million benefit and solved a bad ending. The building works, and the majority of the auction money is distributed to those who have been cheated to make up for part of the loss of these people. The damn liar is also guilty of deserving imprisonment. Everything is positive and good. It should be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Du Lin asked the two swindlers to go to the Supreme Court of the Empire to sue Harry for abuse of power, involving many crimes such as power trading and duty crimes. It’s not good, but it’s also causing Harry’s recent disappointment. The two scammers were confessed because they had to go to the federal head office for help in the capital chain break, and brought back seven million dollars in a few months to continue building the planned buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, this is a big problem. Harry not only took bribes, but forced the auction of other people’s private property to others, and was also suspected of using the position and The power in the hands of an innocent businessman is put in jail for a period of several decades. This is simply a shocking corruption case. If it wasn’t for Harry’s ranking in the New Party, if not everyone has been saying that Harry is the successor of Magus, if it’s not that Harry had no previous case, he might have been Dry down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
