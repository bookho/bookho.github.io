			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Magus, are you going to go out so late?", No. 1 Avenue, can also be said to be the No. 1 villa on Empire Avenue outside Magus In a windbreaker with a hat opened the door and went out. When he was locked, the police patrolling at night saw him. After politely asking, he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful person in this empire is the one with the least shelf, which makes many people who know something about Maggs deeply for him. The character is impressed. He never relies on his position and power to put himself under the spotlight, and he does not treat anyone arrogantly, even if he is a tramp. This makes many people truly, from the inside out, surrender to his personality charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus’s hand locked the door, and glanced at the patrolman standing three meters away from his face, smiling and nodding. "Yes, I want to go out and turn around, and buy some books back. By the time I am, I have discovered that my knowledge is too poor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol I don't know how to use the words to praise the first person of the empire, as Magus himself said, "at his age" he is already the highest power of the imperial power, no one dares to say that Magus is a There are no cultural fools, and everyone knows that Magus is known for his knowledge. Even so, he still felt that he was not reading enough books and was completely convinced! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolman smiled and nodded his intention to leave. He just lifted his foot and put it back. "Do you need me to send you in the past?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus has locked the door, he patted his hands and inserted it into the pocket of the trench coat. "Thank you very much, but I don't need it. Walking is a thing for me. Good exercise.", said that he also held his hat with his left hand and lifted it slightly. "I don't bother your work, goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodbye ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolman stood in the same place and watched Magus to leave. When Magus walked far away, he shook his head and took back his gaze. Suddenly Have a strange idea come to mind, do you want to buy a book after work? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus drilled into the alley next to Villa No. 39 on Empire Avenue, then crossed several small thresholds and then from the back door of a residential building Go in. The old woman sitting at the door was covered in thick sheepskin. She raised her wrinkled face and glanced at Magus. She lowered her head and continued to squint and do the needlework in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third floor, the old stairs that screamed and screamed, went to the innermost corner of the corridor and pushed open the door. A room full of books appeared in front of him. He walked to the third row of bookshelves, the wall-mounted bookshelves, and found a book called "Abstract Art" in the fourth row, then extended his finger to the top half of the book, pulling back Just let go of your fingers. The bookshelf in front of him slowly separated back, revealing a downward passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the black lacquered passage and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kicking of the leather shoes on the slate echoed throughout the passage, and walked down about twenty meters, the ground began to level, far away You can also see a house with a faint light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked in through the small door, he entered a round conference table with twelve gold soles on the table. Red-faced high back chair. The room was very dark, the lights only illuminated the table, and it was impossible to see the faces of people sitting around. These people are hidden in the dark, and everyone can only see their hands and their position below the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true for Magus. He came in very dark, only the table had some faint light, in order to prevent the reflection of the fiber, the only table lamp on the table. The lampshade is also made of opaque multi-layer black cloth. The desktop is matte, so the fiber is only concentrated in that small area. He glanced at the dark outline of the people around him, just as others looked at him, and he sat in the empty chair on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his position, just like every small chair behind a chair, they come here from different places, in order to discuss some important thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is here?", everyone's eyes are concentrated on the first table of the round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is difficult to find out which position is the first place on the round table, but here people take the position facing the north as the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice does not look old, but has a deep and strong young man. Under the faint light, he is leaning his legs, wearing a gray formal dress, one hand pressing On his knees, his fingers continually twirled a gold ring on his index finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a moment, no one is talking, the main character of this voice continues to say: "Very good, everyone is punctual, then let's get started..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning after Mennon issued a notice stating that he had left the bloody dawn, his assistant revealed the incredible look and brought the handset together with the phone, and revealed part of the phone to the Mennon with silent speech. - The phone of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence made the spirit of the door-to-door peasant still swaying. He immediately sat in the hospital bed and even showed a rare piety on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that from the beginning of the party’s display to the world, it has now had a very solid foundation in the west, won the mayors of several cities, and even There is a great chance that it will be able to compete for the next governor position. Even if he did this, no one in the core of the empire called him. He was standing outside the room called "power", with heavy snow outside, and his naked body stood in the snow. Trembling, looking through the glass window, looking at the warm room, a group of clothes and gentlemen, ladies and ladies are enjoying the feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to participate, but no one opens the door for him, which makes him feel wronged, angry, unwilling, helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, these emotions are gone, and only the intense and fierce things in his heart are slamming in the left and right, making his hand tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed the phone base on his legs and then held the phone in a very humble way with both hands, whispered: "Hello, I am "Mennon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mennon, hello, I am Powell, if you know me, you should know who I am!", the voice on the phone It is not as old as the peasant imagination, but it is full of enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded again and again, as if Powell could see it in front of him. "Yes, sir, I know you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it? I am very honored, which also saves us the trouble of introducing ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For you We have been very aware of the assassinations and other despicable acts in the west. We have also held a temporary meeting for this in the morning. The attack on you is a provocation against the empire and a provocation against all justice. Representing me alone, expressing my indignation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Mennon suddenly showed a ecstatic expression, and he knew that he was bet on this game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powell is the party of the New Party, the third person of the ruling party, second only to Maggs and the chairman of the committee, and can be said to be very Authoritative person. Although he does not have an official position on the face, such as a minister or a chief executive, no one dares to underestimate his influence. He was able to call and not represent himself as he said. This must have been made by Magus and the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t play before, but I’m playing now, why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mennon’s heart is also very clear. They saw the benefits and saw the benefits, so they called. They hope that he will be able to become a pioneer in the fight against the dawn of the blood, like a mad dog, after breaking with the bloody dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the darkness before dawn has passed for more than twenty years, the impact of some things is definitely not easy to erase. So many big aristocrats died in the hands of the bloody dawn, the mysterious leader who has never been caught, involving tens of millions or more of antiques, treasures... These are the meaning behind this phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready to be a dog, of course he is a smart, ambitious and planned dog, he will not follow the thoughts of these people Bite everyone out, he wants to play for the empire a little bit, at least after he really masters some initiative! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phone call said more than ten minutes, when the doorman finished the last word and hang up the phone, he was sweating unconsciously. Wry smile and sighed, took a towel and sorted out his instrument, only picked up the bell on the bedside table and shook it. The assistant outside the door pushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the phone away, and tell the doctor, I want to leave the hospital as soon as possible.", said that he let the assistant leave, just when the assistant is about to go out, he He said: "Right, get some food for me, then give me a bunch of flowers, I have to see Du Lin's bastard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the farmer received the "acceptance" of the top of the empire, his mentality has undergone tremendous changes. Of course, the fear of Mr. Zema still exists, not only has not weakened but has deepened a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
