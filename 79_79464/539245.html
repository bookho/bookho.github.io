			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curator of the Delil Art Museum, called Delier, a guy with a clear Ogilvy arrogance, even if he has some artistic flavor, It can't cover the contempt of his eyes when he looks at Du Lin. It was like a gentleman standing in a noble hall wearing leather boots, looking down at the barefoot and muddy feet, and the walking country boy left his footprints on the white floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreil is a very "art" person wearing a purple neutral shiny suit with a silver collar on the edge of the silver The silk line outlines a circle, it should be sterling silver, at least in the light of the shiny color, it will not be a low-grade material. He wears a pair of white crocodile leather shoes, which is not the same as other people. People prefer to wear leather boots more than leather shoes, because in this society where road traffic still has great problems, leather shoes are too easy for dirt to enter the upper. Inside, or contaminated with socks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair is very shiny, just like the hair of Wood's guy, but his hair doesn't look very stiff, but it's soft. The seven-pointed hair has a curl in the opposite direction to the right, and the other three points are backward. White and thin face actually painted some light makeup, if not the suffix on the business card is Mr., Du Lin will treat him as a masculine woman in all likelihood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the business card from Du Lin and took a look. The business cards of artists like him who are rich in "artistic atmosphere" often have some artistic features. For example, the name on his business card is handwritten, and Du Lin also found someone to recognize it before he recognized that the lines of the dragon and the phoenix dance were actually letters. He then put his business card in his pocket, one hand across the chest, the other with his hand on his arm, and a thin white smoke between his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and Kevin the bad guy is a friend? Then you must not be a good person.", Delil’s voice is also very mother, this time is even more Unobtrusive in his eyes with a trace of disgust, like he is not a human being in front of him, but a pile of rubbish. The "friendship" between him and Kevin is not harmonious. In fact, someone once entrusted Kevin to sue the Delil Art Museum. In that incident, Delil met with Kevin, under Kevin’s persuasion. I spent a thousand private cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who is said to be suing him is the male owner of a middle-class family. The family has a certain financial ability and hopes that his children can be influenced by art, so the child will be Delivered to Delil for training here - Delier sometimes teaches some children about art. I don't know if the child is very special, or for other reasons. In general, De Lier married the child and was known by the child's family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he had to take out a thousand pieces in private to understand the matter. Once the case was exposed, he might be expelled from Tener by angry parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders and was not very concerned about Delil’s ridiculous language. "He is the devil, we are all friends of the devil!", he The meaning is that if Kevin is really a bad guy, according to his thinking, all the people who are friends with Kevin are not good people, then he is certainly not a good person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier smirked and twisted his head to the side, spit a smog and slanted Du Lin. "My time is limited, explain your intentions!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Du Lin discovered that Delier actually applied nail polish, purple nail polish, and he seemed to like this color very much. Staggering this attention, Du Lin whispered: "I think we should go to your office to talk, I will open the price you are satisfied with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time De Lier’s eyes were a little brighter. He hesitated and nodded. Obviously, money can touch him more than what he doesn’t like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the office of Delil in tandem, very simple, and indeed very artistic. Unlike the sofas of the big men's leather, the sofas here are clothed, and the fabric sofas are just beginning to be popular in the Yaoxing Empire. Many big people think that this stuff is used by the poor, so it is not completely popular. stand up. If the trend of this thing lacks the recognition of the mainstream of the society, it is not a trend, but a non-mainstream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnishings in the room are very artistic, and the strange furniture seems to cost a lot of money. This non-standard furniture can only be made by hand, the price Not cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier Shiran’s walk to his rotating round chair, the chair that was like a shell with a window, the whole person was trapped Go in. He tilted his legs, sucked the last cigarette, and threw the cigarette into the trash can of a child with his mouth open and his mouth open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to get from me, what are you going to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very straightforward, This is very satisfied with Du Lin. He walked over to the table and sat on the chair carved out of the twisted wooden roots. He extended three fingers. "Help me get up with Vivian as soon as possible. I will give you three thousand pieces of compensation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
