			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando’s eyelids apparently jumped when he heard the word sincerity, and the hot 10,000 pieces were still in his remote property kitchen. Inside the safe behind the cabinet. This is not because he dare not spend a lot of money. In this city of Torn, where corruption is almost semi-open, there are not many things that he dare not do. He just thought that this 10,000-piece failure might be returned to Doolin at some appropriate time in a way that he himself did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has this kind of hunch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when he heard that Du Lin spoke of the word sincerity, it was obviously a little painful. The first time I was so afraid of accepting bribes was really unprecedented! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This has nothing to do with sincerity!", Prando pushed open the door of the office, held the doorknob and walked in to the door, waiting for Doolin and Mason After entering, the door was closed. This is a signal to tell the little secretary at the door. If someone comes to visit, you must first inform the Prando inside. There is also a room in the office of the director, which is a lounge. If necessary, people can go in and avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the bar and took out three cups, and when he was ready to pour the wine, he found that it was already empty. Looking at the cup in his hand, he had to walk to the side of the coffee machine and poured three cups of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason stood up and took over the coffee handed by Prando. Although the performance was somewhat cautious, he couldn’t help but feel proud. This is the regional police station. The secretary personally poured coffee for himself. When he looked at his face, Du Lin did not stand up, and Prando took the initiative to bring the coffee to his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three are sitting again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, there is a director who wants to retire, but you should understand that I can’t casually follow a preference for a newcomer who has no foundation at all. Send it to the position of the branch secretary. The police officers may not say anything, I am afraid that the heart will be shaken. When they are upset, they are far from me, and it is a huge loss for me, so I said this and There is no relationship between money," he took a sip of his cup of coffee and glanced at Mason, who was looking at his face. How could he not know how the two men might have blood relationship? He continued: "But if it is a policeman If you are long, I can guarantee that there is no problem at all, anytime, anywhere, or even now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin lowered his head and held out his hand to pinch the edge of the glass of wine, as if he had not heard Prando's explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of the Regional Police Department is actually quite heavy. The officers of the Police Investigation Bureau do have the right to challenge the local police chief, even if they are investigating the case. It is only necessary to obtain a permit signed by an important person from the State Bureau of Investigation. Even if Prando is ridiculous to hold a dog as the head of the branch, no one will dare to say anything. Obviously, everything he said was to deny this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason doesn't understand why Du Lin is still not satisfied, but the sheriff! He once gave himself a life plan when he was not far away. The first goal was to become a sheriff from a police officer within three years. He thought it would take a long time and cost a lot of money - about 50 or so, to complete his dream. But what happened now has to make him doubt his own world and himself. They are family brothers. Why is the gap between brothers so big? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t wait for Du Lin to agree immediately, but he looked at Doolin in silence and did not speak. He knows very well that being able to sit in this office can already be said to be the power of his younger brother, Du Lin, and he has no reason to change Du Lin’s original decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is like an old man who loves antiques. His eyes are all the glasses of one dollar. When Prando frowned and wanted to say something, Du Lin looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a very envious smile, the streamer between the eyelashes and the flash of light in the eyes reveals some bright feelings, and the voice is full of praise and praise. "Principal Prando, in fact, I envy you, really!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando has a tight heart, but his face has not changed at all, he does not I knew what this kid wanted to do, but there was a chill along the gap of the buttocks, and it was drawn to the top of his head, so that his hair was erected, and he moved his hips uncomfortably. "Oh? Is it? I am a stature." The little local director, can you have any envy?" He put the glass on the table in his hand. "It's you, young and promising, and you are very handsome, and you are still very handsome. I should envy you. "What?", his self-deprecating and a series of laughter after the talk is very infectious, but unfortunately, it can't infect Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Director Prando, you have won the prize.", Du Lin's politeness, Prando is even more embarrassed, he is tight with a smile Staring at Du Lin, I want to see how he made a move, but Du Lin’s next sentence made his face color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
