			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has his own judgment on how to do one thing. He believes in his own judgment. In the dream, his wonderful life in decades has made him more aware than him. See more and more bizarre things here. Hellman’s current decision is what he wants to do, so he is happy to be a listener for the time being. After all, there are a lot of things that are easy for them to do but they can’t do anything, like The survey will tell you about the scandals of some big family members and how to use these scandals to ignite public opinion. He gave Hellsman so much money, he should take up his responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as Hellsmann’s plan does not violate his own perception of things, Du Lin will not object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Du Lin can sneak in the Emperor to meet the nobility and entrepreneurs, Nicole apparently fell into a trough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was lucky enough to survive the attack. This is what the workers’ union’s lawyer told him. It’s not a fight, but a fight. An attack, a sudden attack, and an immigration attack on imperial citizens. As for the reason, it doesn't matter. What is important is that the seven imperial citizens died from the attacks of these immigrants. What is even more terrible is that these murderers have now become victims, and many people stand on their stand. Supporting them, this is simply a contempt for imperial law! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the lawyer said and the facts, seven workers died, and now the family of the seven workers has hated Nicole. They also hate immigrants who don’t keep their hands, but they hate Nicole even more. If he didn’t plan such a terrible revenge with his ass, there wouldn’t be so many things going on, their family members too. It is impossible to be killed by a violent immigrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a party to the “victim”, the workers’ unions helped the workers who survived the bail and they obtained temporary freedom, except for some Still lying in the hospital for treatment, everyone else returned home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After drinking a little drink, Nicole felt that he should do something. He is not a person who is not responsible. If he is doing something wrong, then he should be himself. Awkward apologize. He took a bottle and found a home of a worker he knew. The guy had returned to the embrace of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood at the door and knocked on the door, not long after, the hostess with red eyes swollen opened the door, and the mournful expression after seeing Nicole Suddenly became disgusted, and Nicole didn't even have a "sorry" to say that the export of the hostess would close the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole, standing outside the door, sighed and looked at the closed door and shouted a sorry, but in exchange for a response to "Get out of my house." He actually feels very uncomfortable in his heart, but he can't do anything except to apologize now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, every household is not willing to give him a chance to apologize, including those injured workers, he went to the hospital to see these people They have also been driven out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the street, he was pouring wine, swaying, walking aimlessly, he was not sure where he was going, He only wants to find something to vent. In the aimless movement, he kicked two dogs and one cat, and smashed the stove of a tramp, but he didn't feel better in his heart, but it was even more uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a slightly remote street, he sat down on the phone booth, sipping his tears and sipping a strong drink with tears. The regret that made him suffocate filled his heart. If it was a little calmer at the time, why was it so impulsive, and Nicole was even more sad when he thought of those companions who had lost their lives because of their own claims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is getting late and the number of pedestrians on the road is getting less and less, although it is one of the most prosperous cities in the west, it can be dark after the road There won't be too many pedestrians because it is not safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger in the West is that people here can legally own guns and buy enough bullets. Some social activists, including some politicians, are condemning the specialties of the cabinet to the west. Preferential treatment, as well as the inaction of the state governments in the three western states. These people think that the reason why the west is so chaotic and dangerous, the most important reason is reflected in the problem of the proliferation of guns. Everyone has guns that seem to strengthen the safety of ordinary people, but those criminals also have guns and ammunition. They will become more dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad guys dare to throw pistols in public and use life-threatening methods to search for money. Do people dare to do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s dare. After all, it’s the West. It’s the code of conduct for defending your rights with bullets. But the problem is that the bad guys will always pull the guns better than the good ones. The difference between the good guys and the bad guys can't be distinguished. The protective effect of firearms on the people will always be on the passive side, and will not become a measure to actively protect their own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the west, a large number of social activists and politicians are calling for a large-scale ban on guns, but the results have been minimal, and people gradually understand the truth, that is, after dark, it is best not to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already more than eight o'clock. In some bustling cities, this time is only the most exciting start of the day, but it is already late enough in the west. Things that are more than fifty meters away after darkness have become very vague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nichols in a drunken state lying on a pile of vomit, squinting without any meaning, then he felt The light in front of him was blocked by something. He opened his eyes effortlessly and saw two fifteen-seven-seven-year-old children lying in front of him. The two men's hands were flipping over his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, he understands what these people are doing, they are robbing a drunkard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nichol’s old and new resentment broke out together, and he waved his hand on the head of a big boy who screamed On the sidewalk, another boy also fled a distance in horror, watching vigilantly at Nicole who wanted to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is spinning, but Nichol, who has not rotated himself, has climbed several times and has not climbed up. He has drunk too much since Du Lin invented After the distillation method, the degree of various types of alcoholic beverages has increased a lot, making it easier for people to get drunk. He didn't notice that the two teenagers who had not left were flashing terrible cold eyes. He was still trying to get up, his head suddenly sinking and squatting on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched his head, the bright red blood made him a spirit, even the drunkenness went to three points, he grabbed the bottle in his hand and lost it to a teenager. Go, and then start to regret for drinking and not returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second thing he regrets in the past few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two teenagers holding a stone, a person holding a steel ruler with a foot long against his head is a violent, bloody flow The land did not stop them, and the young people in violent state were even more difficult to get out of this situation until they determined that Nicole would not move again, only to lose the stone, and the other was to hide the steel pipe. In the pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly smashed all the pockets of Nicole one by one, and found three three-thousand-thousands and then quickly left. In the process, Nicole occasionally trembled and twitched, and initially scared them. Jumping, and later became accustomed to it, they did not realize that they had hit a series of hits on Nicole's back, which is the most vulnerable part of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two teenagers quickly joined the darkness with three 30s, until the next morning, someone called the police on a remote street. When the man was found facing down, the police knew that Nicole had been killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can extract from the scene to the evidence and some people's testimony can be sure that the murderer is two young people under the age of twenty, a height is about About one meter sixty-five, one about one meter seven two...", police officers' agents are explaining to the workers' union lawyers some news that is currently being received. Nichol's news of accidental death was quickly found in the workers' union. There, there must be their eyeliner in the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers’ union’s lawyers are very dissatisfied with these seemingly official content, asked a male lawyer in his thirties, “Is it possible? Two immigrant boys?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agents suddenly became alert. If the incident was really done by immigrants, then obviously they were playing with fire, but from At present, the information in the hands is still unable to identify the ethnic groups of the two boys. It is unlikely that the immigrants will be immigrants when they meet inside the police, because the immigrants will not go deep into the city in the middle of the night, and they are equally dangerous to them. . The bigger possibility is that some young local gang members, from the pockets of Nicole being looted, the chance of accidental robbery is even greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have got the testimony of a shop assistant, who sold a bottle of six wine to Nicole that night, but now on Nicole’s body Did not find any change, so the police think this is more like an accidental robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a hard scalp, "We have no evidence to prove that the perpetrator is an immigrant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The lawyer smiled and said, "But you also have no evidence that the murderer is not an immigrant..." He said, he nodded. "Okay, thank you for notifying us, thank you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the fourth day of the incident, a message was heard that the murderer was two young immigrants. This news caused the direct opposition of ethnic rivalry that was originally dissatisfied. The working class asked the immigrants to surrender the murderer. The immigration can only deny this and the problem is further intensified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
