			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everyone will spit in the first killing. Some people will have vomiting desires and put them into action, but they will be strong. Endure the desire to open your mouth and swallow back the things in your mouth and throat with great perseverance... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is just a joke, and all Buddha saw Savi just stunned, and then he walked over to give his brother an unexpected move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi has considered a variety of possibilities, such as being beaten by the Buddha, being beaten by him, or being treated indifferently, he has already done Ready. Perhaps it is unwise and impulsive for an adult to think of such a move, but he knows that he has not slammed into the wall without hesitation, and he has gone through the past on the premise of preparing for the collision. The boiling blood was rushing under the successful bonus. He was a little timid and looked at his brother very proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, when Dufo approached him and stretched out his arm, this dare to save Du Lin and other people’s boys with homemade incendiary bombs, scared Close your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the imaginary slap or fist, he greeted a warm hug, and he was surprised and surprised to open his eyes and look at the usual stern brother, no I dared to look at the smile on his lips, but for a while it was a bit stunned. He felt that Buddha had given him a slap and explained how dangerous his move was, what terrible consequences it would bring, and then swearing him for a normal meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warm hug does not seem to be the habit of the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he considered whether the Buddha’s brain was a little bit abnormal, Savi ushered in a second hug from Doolin’s hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good guy, really have you, you saved us all!", Du Lin did not blame his praise, he said nothing at all Exaggerated, Savi really saved all of them. Under the awkward confrontation before, it will not take long for the other party to think of it when they return to hell. It can be said that the timing of the arrival of Savi is particularly perfect. They may go to hell with Du Lin earlier, and they may see the body of a place later. The whole opportunity was just a few minutes, and Du Lin had to thank God, in this most important few minutes, Savi came here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving companions embraced Savi, and when Savre’s mouths were closed, Doolin did not forget the “small firefighters” who had envious luster in their eyes. He embraced everyone, one. Did not leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it is very presumptuous, I would like to ask you any plans before you come. After all, today's things are very dangerous, and there may be some unforeseen accidents at any time. As we have encountered.", on the return trip, Du Lin could not help but ask. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only eleven-year-old children can walk on the fire bombs for more than a dozen kilometers to "rescue" them, definitely not made by the heat of the brain. There must be a detailed plan and implementation plan, and this is where Du Lin is curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the little friends are concentrated on Savi, and some of the reddish faces that have just been dyed by the fire have been dyed with a shy pink color. Brown hair with his head down, some embarrassed. Another little guy on the side immediately revealed his extroverted characteristics after a short contact, and rushed to explain it. "Mr. Doolin, Savy had such a plan a few days ago, and then we are ready for everything. Come, it’s that simple!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Right, Savi is our captain, we are all members of the 'rushing team'!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be infected by his "answer", the little guys screamed, until Savi raised his hand, they closed their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the Buddha and saw that Savi had a very high position among these teenagers. As they said, Savi is the stormtrooper. The captain is the most core person. Savi stopped and looked up at Doolin with a slight head. "Mr. Du Lin, I... can we join the fellowship? I dream of becoming a member of the fellowship, for the rise of our Guar. Fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also stopped and frowned slightly. This little gesture made the surrounding teenagers ring their drums, "become a fellow The members of the meeting are very dangerous. They can make a living anytime and anywhere. We lost two compatriots not long ago. This is not the first time, and it is definitely not the last time." His eyes stayed on each teenager for a while, then One by one pointing at them and saying: "You...you...all of you, maybe one day, leave us and leave the world for a variety of reasons. This day may be very long, and it will be long until you die." Come, but it may be very fast, maybe a few minutes later, after a few hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never felt that there would be any great places in my country or in my hometown. We are just doing things that our ancestors did not finish. No one dared to take the first step before, I dare, and I also took a lot of danger. Like this time, if it weren't for you, I almost died here, so I thank you, and I must also tell you that it is very dangerous. As you said, this may be a battle, as long as it is fighting. There will be sacrifices, no one can be spared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said so much, the teenagers of the stormtroopers were sighing and sighing, obviously Du Lin refused them in this way, but what they didn't think was that Du Lin's words changed quickly and they were beyond their imagination! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So why not? Even sacrifice, no matter which one, is meaningful in my eyes. If one day I die, I I believe that some of you will inherit my will from my death, inherit the ancestors and the fighting spirit of the first king. We never give in. One day, when we or the enemy have enough blood, I firmly believe that when that day comes, Our guerts can also straighten their own backbone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not something I can do alone, it needs everyone's help, I Welcome, and there is good news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words came to a pause here, and the teenagers slowly laughed at the stunned and anxious expectations of the teenagers. I said the following words, "I agree to join the fellowship, and agree that you will retain the stormtroopers. Maybe one day in the future, there will be a miracle that I believe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The escort of Doolin’s police car encountered an attack or more than seven o'clock in the evening It returns a special Nile, the prison has not been seen escorting police car that may have occurred accidentally, he sent two cars with a rifle guards along the way to see the final battle scene and found the body of one. They only fed back the news that happened here to the city of Tener, and it was the first time that it was rumored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know if Du Lin died? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is good enough, at least in the private wine industry. Ernst first went to find Prando to seek out the exact situation. Karur temporarily held a party and invited some heavyweight distributors in the city of Tener. While drinking wine, Zion looked at the close-knit eyes with his faint eyes, and he was getting closer and closer to the dancers as he continued to squander money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor was somewhat surprised, but he did not pay attention to the news at all. Even before this kid bought a piece of worthless oil painting at the charity party with 10,000 pieces, even if Du Lin’s experience was equal to him’s personal delivery. He was not very concerned about the gallows. He is the mayor of the mayor. How can he have time to manage the life and death of this private liquor dealer? Is he still going to chase the kid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne looks very calm, if not her nails have been embedded in the palm and pierced the skin, maybe no one knows her at this time Intense emotional swings in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando sat in the office of the Regional Police Director and looked at the dark sky outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler breathed a sigh of relief, and he was eating dinner when he got the news, adding a steak to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is the society, not because there is more than one person, or one less person, the world will change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to those who are of vital interest, such as the Guars in the slums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Ellis, who was so embarrassed to lie in the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to avenge the boss!", Ellis, who vomited in the mouth because of the painful crying and snoring, lifted his arm and rubbed it red and swollen. Eyes, this consistently feels the modest and gentle team leader also reveals a sly face. He gasped and twitched from time to time, and at this time he was full of revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just a bit of light in life, just a little hope in the future, actually it was cut off like this? How can he tolerate the guy who destroyed everyone’s dreams and continue to live in this world, he said in a positive tone: "Absolutely the mayor, must be his moving hand, only he can power to mobilize so many gunmen to drag Live our actions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, the entire farm was turned into ashes. He has worked very hard to resist the invasion of the gunmen, but the other party has reinforced a group of people, in order to prevent these people from getting or discovering the secrets Du Lin confesses, he must do so. He used a fire to ignite the pastures that were covered with grass in winter, turning everything into an ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
