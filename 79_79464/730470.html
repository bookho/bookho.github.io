			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet nights of the farms in the suburbs are a bit horrible, the silvery moonlight is spread over the burnt ruins, and several wild dogs follow the faint rot in the air. The stink was found and I was constantly looking for it on the ruins. It seems that what was discovered, a wild dog speeded up the excavation, and then stuffed his head into the pit that had just been dug out, happily groaning. A strong smell began to spread out, but for these wild dogs this is undoubtedly the sweetest taste, because this taste represents food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodies in the cold winter can be preserved for a long time if buried in the ground. The wild environment is like a natural refrigerator, so that the speed of decomposition of these bodies is reduced to a minimum. Coupled with extremely low temperatures, the mold activity in the soil is extremely slow, and most of the bugs are also in hibernation, which makes the wild dogs find delicious food - a large piece of natural corruption like jelly The meat is mixed with the surrounding soil and presents a black-red color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More wild dogs have joined this feast, ignoring the changes in the surrounding environment, it is not easy to find something to eat in the winter wilderness. They have been hungry for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two consecutive gunshots, two wild dogs screaming and curling on the ground, madly licking their limbs, the wild dogs around them are like crazy in the dark. Running towards the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice and Dufour carried a heavy steel box and went to a low-lying place in the ruins, opening the cellar covered by weeds. The manhole cover, throwing the box in. After a sigh of screaming, it was a muffled sound. Both boxes were thrown in, and the people standing on the ground just got in through the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil lamp is lit, there is an unpleasant smell in the cellar, the air is like mold, but at this time everyone’s eyes are concentrated on those two On the box. The box was made a bit rough, unlike the things that the nobles used to have a beautiful shape, but it must be said that such a box is practical because it is a piece of steel ingot that is dug out, there is no weld gap, the only gap is the box. There is a gap between the body and the cover that cannot be inserted into the banknote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grant, how do you open this stuff?", Du Lin played with two, in addition to discovering two keyholes, looking for the surface of the box Less than anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant is the escort who survived the looting of the escort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a person who speaks and talks. He said that the other person came out and he let him go, but he did not say let the other person leave because he I need to use him. When Ellis told Du Lin that all this was behind Prando's black hand, Doolin realized that he had not much time in Turner. If he does not avenge, Prando will take the initiative to find him to kill him. His existence is a great crisis for Prando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in order to survive, for revenge, he must kill Prando. Prando is not a knight in the legendary novels that even the dragons are not afraid of. It is not an unscrupulous old man who can hide in the sky all day to peek at human beings. It is just an ordinary human being. But what if I kill Prando? He has absolutely no way to continue to stand in the city. No matter whether it is the mayor, the member of parliament or the managers of other cities, he will not let a little punk who dares to take action on their class to continue to live in the world, and even more let him let him go. The city continues to struggle, he must leave, and it is far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he has decided what to do and will leave after he finishes, why not maximize the benefits? A little inquiries, you can know that the Imperial Bank’s vault stores a deposit of one million yuan to prevent sudden disasters or runs. If you can take the money, then no matter where Du Lin finally chose to stay, You can restore your strength and power as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sure to win the treasury of the Imperial Central Bank! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he needed an insider to help him solve problems that outsiders couldn’t solve, so Grant was pulled by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a brief ideological struggle, Grant finally calmed down a lot, accepted the guidance of fate, and became a matter of course. He pulled out two strings of keys from his pocket and inserted them into the keyholes on the left side of the two boxes. "There are some very small words on the side of the keyhole. These words are known as the sender and receiver of the box. The key of the issuing party is here, but the key of the receiving party is in the hands of the head of the treasury of the Central Bank of Ordos." He twisted the key and pushed the lid hard. The lid did not move. "Only two The lid can only be opened after the key has been rotated at the same time. Otherwise, there is basically no way to approximate the box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safes used by banks to transport money and valuables are naturally strong and strong. In addition to preventing the robbers from opening the box as quickly as possible, it is necessary to prevent internal personnel from working on these money and valuables. It is not certain whether there will be a private open box in the long escort process, so the design and use rules of the box are well established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the Buddha and glanced at him. When he got his arms up, he gave Grant a punch. He hit him on the floor and painfully licked his nose. The blood flowed out of his fingers, but he did not dare to do anything, and dared not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know why you want to be jealous?", Du Lin took a clap and stood up, smoking a cigarette to his neighbors, what Grant wants to explain. When Du Lin shook his index finger, he took a cigarette and took a sip. He continued: "If you don't have the key to Orodo, you can't open the box, are you?", Grande nodded, Du Lin laughed. Said: "Please tell me, how do you put things in this box and then re-lock the box?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his hand The key, "I didn't feel any elastic lock spring when I screwed the key, which means that the box could not be automatically locked after being opened and loaded. Someone must have done this, but You didn't say it. Did you forget it, or did you deliberately deceive me? Tell me who that person is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the vault administrator, Tnel There are three administrators in the city’s central bank vault, and the key to open the box is in him. Three people who. There is only one key, who is on who is on duty. After learning about this character from Grant's mouth, Doolin arranged a two-step plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to find a locksmith to try to open the box, if it can be opened - no matter what method he uses, then the plan ends here. But if you can't open this box, you need to take the second step, which is to find the key. The key is not easy to get, because any one of the three administrators is missing, or the loss of the key will cause the central bank to be alert, and the big plan for Du Lin to execute his reservation will be a great obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how to get it, this is definitely a process that needs to be carefully planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Du Lin returned to the prison alone, the warden did not see him, inconvenient and did not want to see. Not everyone has enough chest to calmly face a person who threatens himself while taking his own family life. Of course, he agrees with Du Lin’s request to visit relatives and let him see the madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman was previously said to be the head of the Imperial Bank of the Imperial Bank of China, and was later sentenced to life imprisonment for burglary and first-degree murder. It needs to be explained here that the biggest difference between life imprisonment and one thousand years of imprisonment is that life imprisonment cannot be reduced, but a thousand years of imprisonment can be reduced. Perhaps no one can go out for hundreds of years in prison, but at least give The hope of this group of scum can be alive, so that they will not break the can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the madman, Du Lin let the prison guard leave the room, only two of them in the room, in this relatively backward world of technology trees. Although there is something in the bug, it will definitely not be used at this time, this place, on this matter. Du Lin took out a few boxes of cigarettes and pushed them over. "Things are ready, but they can't be opened!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mad turbid eyes lit up, he would smoke They all stuffed into their arms and then lowered their voices. "Do you really do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still a fake? They took away what belongs to me. I will naturally get it back." Du Lin took out a box of cigarettes and opened it. He handed over a past. "I have two questions. The first question is whether the box can be opened without a key, the second one. Question, you have finished the words that have not been finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman of the unkempt greedily sniffs the taste of tobacco, then clicks and enjoys the suck One bite, slowly appealing, "If you can afford time, go to the steel mill in Guri, they have a way to open the box, but most of the things inside the box will be damaged during the opening process. As for the next Things...", he was silent for a while before he slowly said: "That is an old building!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Old buildings refer to the Empire’s largest and richest monsters before the Great Patriotic War. They built an independent building and used it for banking. On the ground, the bank's overall structure has three floors, up to nearly 20 meters. In the underground, there are also underground buildings that are almost 20 meters deep. In addition to the vault, there is a complete set of living systems, including a storage pool, a food storage room and a crystal storage room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the central bank’s architectural blog is completely stripped from the world, it is a huge cube, the upper part is not described, the lower part is a There are only two cuboids for import and export. An import and export is inside the bank, and an import and export is connected to the sewage pipe. The sewage pipe is designed like a bite gear, and it will be engaged once every three minutes. The purpose of this is to prevent some people from entering the real bank through the sewage pipe, and part of the reason is to crush some large pipes that may cause blockage. Rubbish. It is basically impossible to get into the bank from the sewage pipeline. Those who want to store a million deposits are protected by millions of buildings and mechanical structures. They simply don't care that it is worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
