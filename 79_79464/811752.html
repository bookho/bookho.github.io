			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin quietly read the contents of the note and couldn’t help but smile. "Mr. Doolin, you are the most despicable person I have ever seen." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin's polite counterattack, "To each other, Mr. Kevin, you may be the most shameless person I have ever seen."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and smiled, and Kevin shrugged his head and shrugged his head. "So we can become a despicable pair of good friends. I like your note. It is worth 10,000. I thought you would run into trouble, but it seems that you have planned everything. Then I will deepen some work for you and try to get him turned over!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin glanced at the note again before loading it into his briefcase and sandwiching it in a book Bible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content on the note is not complicated. In the strict sense, there are only two words, which add up to ten letters - family or yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Du Lin’s last sentence to Juan. He has to make a choice, either Doolin points his finger at his family or he chooses to “discard” He himself, he has only one way to go, and there is no second choice. There was a note in the cigarette box that Du Lin gave him. Some things were said on the note. Finally, Juan made his choice. He ended his death with his own death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have struggled at the last moment, but when he thinks about his family and his children, he suddenly wakes up. He is old, what if he lived for another ten or twenty years? Still not to be the nourishment of the earth? On the contrary, his family, the future, and later, there are children and grandchildren. He didn't have to take his family to bury him because of his timidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death requires great courage, and it’s better to end your life at this time with a painful struggle for ten or twenty years. When Juan took the last cigarette, he told him in accordance with Du Lin, took a pencil with an eraser from the cigarette case, wiped out the contents written by Du Lin, and then wrote a copy. The suicide note, a small ball was formed, and the oil wax outside the cigarette case was melted with a lighter, and the suicide note was swallowed into the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know who Du Lin was going to do this time, and he didn’t want to know, because everything had nothing to do with him. Then he sat on the edge, his buttocks a little hard and slipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan died of suicide, but Du Lin could not give up such a perfect opportunity. This is the set he gave to Amp and took the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he left the small tail and he thought it was very clean, but as he thought, there is no absolute perfection in the world. There are always some missing things in the crime. Instead of passively letting these people look for clues madly, it is better to take the initiative and throw them into the pit to bury them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan’s death will definitely touch the nerves of Amp and his investigation team. Since they have targeted themselves, they will naturally pay attention to what happened here. everything of. When Juan died, Du Lin gave them a reason to come to the investigation. When they found that some things were not as simple as they thought, they would take the direction of the case from the time and the pressure from the top. The problem with the jewelry store was transferred to the death of Juan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because investigating jewelry stores and related things can involve a lot of virtually meaningless accounts, names, and water, they don’t have that much time to go to one Investigation and evidence collection. However, in the direction of the death of Juan, in the face of some evidence that Du Lin deliberately left, they will take the initiative to jump into the trap. Once they think they have enough evidence to sue Du Lin, it means the end of their trip! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t expect Kevin to come to Anpte, and that just happened to allow him to focus more on other things. There is Kevin, I am very happy that Amp will definitely play. He is the kind of person who likes to ponder, just like Kevin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constituting an ordinary person may be just a "judicial error," but it is a "political mistake." The former may be reprimanded by the superior, while the latter must pay the price. In addition, Kevin, a lawyer who is proficient in various laws and loopholes, has arrived. If Amp knows that he should be proud, he is not facing a "good person" but two, he should be proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hired another hundred people from the fifth district and sent them to the island. Now the island has been modified by Du Lin. It is called the island of paradise. There are no beasts on the island, not even small animals, mostly decaying plants and plants, and some things like mosquitoes and flies. The trees that can be used for construction are trimmed after being cut down, and will be used later, and those that are not used will still be used as fuel for heating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of 120,000 bottles of wine has been boxed and ready to go. In this month, Du Lin has received a lot of calls, these calls are all about the "fire" feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first second of those wines entering the urban consumer system, like the invasion of foreign cells, the white blood cells began their work. Many places have been rushing for several games, each winning or losing. These compatriots are still somewhat vague about the concept of Rush. Sometimes you are not hurting people, they will be afraid of you. When there are enough interests to drive, as long as they cannot completely destroy these people from the mind and the body, they will never be afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin does not remember who said that the gang is actually the original capitalism, and has never progressed. This sentence does have some truth. As long as they can bring benefits, they dare to do anything and dare to do anything. Law, morality, and ethics are fundamentally not binding to them. They are not like those who have evolved capital, at least for society. A little deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this involves another word, a sense of responsibility. Only when you have a certain strength and wealth can you breed a conscience for the society. Otherwise, how can the world in the dream have a "rich and conscience"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since those people still don’t know how to do it, then Du Lin had to go out and teach them how to play this game! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s departure did not alarm anyone in the investigation team, including Amp, who did not think that Du Lin would leave Irian at this time, he felt that the investigation The arrival of the group will definitely make Doolin feel the pressure, whether he accepts it or not. After the arrival of the official document, Amp immediately arranged each person's work. As their investigations began, they soon discovered another problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who registered the jewelry company is a local, but he is not here now, but in the federation, he started his family immigration from a year ago. The federation, that is to say if you want to find this person, they have to go to the federation. Obviously this is impossible. It has been more than two months. The investigation team has not had any effective results until now. The above people are already impatient, and it is even more impossible for them to go to the federal side to investigate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has already involved external matters, and it may take several months for some approvals and coordination. After dismissing the idea of ​​Amp on the phone, Amp could only temporarily lay down the clues to trace the gold robbery to nail Doolin and turn his attention to the embarrassing thing of Juan suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day of the melting of snow and ice, Amp came to the roof of the bank building with his team members and the police. They carefully removed the already hardened ice cubes and did not damage the scene as much as possible. The only thing to be thankful for is that the weather after the snow is still very cold. The ice and snow fall on the ground and quickly freeze, so that the dust on the roof is not damaged too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here, here may be the trace of the wrestling!", a member of the team waved his hand in surprise, and soon Amp rushed over, he was half-baked On the ground, look carefully at the traces of the ground that have been wet with snow. Although it is very vague, it is not difficult to find that there is a less obvious shoe print in this floating ash, as well as traces of people rolling over the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the team members to print the shoe down, and then told him to go to the police department’s evidence department to pick up the shoes that Juan wore when he died. After he told him, he continued to observe the trace carefully. I don’t know why, he always felt that he had ignored something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more ice is being thrown up and thrown away, and more and more traces appear. The entire investigation team is very excited, which means Juan It is very likely that he was thrown away, not by himself. Once you have found enough doubts and evidence, it is enough for the colleagues on the emperor to apply to the court for a summons to summon Du Lin. As long as Du Lin went to the Imperial Capital, how to interrogate specifically, is it not for them to be the master? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, after the photo was washed out, Amp sat alone at the table, illuminating the photos with glare, he flipped a few pages of the police about Hu Ann suicide record, the brow slightly twisted. His fingers knocked on the police transcript. He was very strange. Why didn't the police investigate the details of the roof and ignored the first scene. The only thing in the transcript that recorded the roof was that there was only one sentence - no one or thing was found on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the traces on the ground be invisible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked the information of the case handlers and called a police officer to send support to him. He wanted to check the police officers. It was not related to the problem of collecting money, perhaps the police were also bought by Doolin. With such an idea, he immediately let the police who protected him leave, and these people said that they were still monitoring him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This once again made him feel the heavy pressure from the local protection policy and the power of Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
