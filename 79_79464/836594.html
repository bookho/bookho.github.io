			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three patrolmen patrolled the streets, several old people stood on the corner of the street and frowned slightly. One of the white-haired old men was carrying a cane. He stared at the pale goatee and jumped in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I said, the mayor is absolutely not well-intentioned, have you seen it? Now even the police have appeared, which shows the city. The law and order problem has already threatened everyone's life!", the old man is the elder of this block, his son is doing a little business in Nam Lindes, the family is average, but it is much better than other people. He is not the oldest, but he can also go to the top ten. There are prestige on weekdays, and many people are willing to go closer to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the park, he has about three acres of farmland, this demolition plan to destroy his farmland, he will naturally be unhappy. In fact, this kind of people who take advantage of it is really not too small. No one has ever stressed the problem of the park, so there is no contradiction. But as Du Lin’s notice was sent out, the contradiction was there and it was constantly intensifying. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these patrols on the streets is not to threaten the elderly who occupy the public land, but to deter the arrival of the city from Odes to the city of Otis. Some madmen. But the old man interprets this discovery as another kind of signal, and thinks that Du Lin may be targeting himself. Who makes their own family in this film is one of the best, who makes himself have a certain prestige in this film? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stupid mayor must want to intimidate others by hitting me, I will not let his conspiracy succeed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man squatted on the floor with a cane. "You can't let him go so far. Once he really intends to flatten our park, how do we get there?" "What?", his turbid eyeballs showed a lustrous green light, and looked at other people with a pitiful look, then said indifferently: "I don't care, my child will mail me back ten times a week. Block money, there are some meat and canned fish, enough for my life, but what do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is getting bigger and the street corner is gathering The people are a little more. Many people surround him in the middle and listen to him. "Do you guys and old bones have to go more than ten miles to go outside the city to open a wasteland? Even if you have that ability Going over, can you do it? Going so far every day, if you accidentally fall on the road, you will think like the old man with a bad temper. Have you considered the consequences?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man with a stinky temper was a neighbor of them. When it rained last time, he came out to buy salt, his foot stepped on the mud, and then fell. His family sent him to Nal Lindes, spent more than 80 yuan and then pulled back and died. The old man’s family was in poor condition and could not afford the expensive treatment. In addition to his age, this half-life was basically gone. He still lie in bed and can’t even sit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this guy, the envy of the crowd reveals a sad look, and also feels that the old man is right, after all, everyone is old and old What about the legs, what if you fall? It doesn't matter if you are yourself, isn't it a problem for the children? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man snorted and slammed the ground with a cane again. The slight discussion around him stopped and people looked at him. He lifted his chin slightly and said in an inherently arrogant attitude: "We have to give the foreigners a color and let him know that a foreigner wants to be in Otis. He is not qualified enough!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say?", someone in the crowd shouted a scorpion, which is the unique way that the city of Otis handles things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t rely on the City Hall, they don’t rely on courts and judges, and there’s no police for a long time, so the elders in each neighborhood are like a The small emperor, one block of the block, has a high prestige and also has certain "execution" power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course let him understand that the Otis is definitely not a good one!", the old man waved a cane and said a go with me, with Everyone is heading in the other direction. At the same time, in the mayor’s living room of the City Hall, Du Lin met with the Nano Lindes businessman who came to discuss and cooperate, which is exactly the game. Li's boss, a middle-aged man named Edgar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Mr. Edgar looks very well-dressed and handsome, like a gentleman more than a smuggling gang leader. Today's weather is not cool, he also wore a gray formal suit, one hand squatting on the waist, one hand with Du Lin's hand tightly held, and also slightly bent. There was a humble smile on his face, and there was no arrogance on the faces of smugglers, like businessmen or politicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took his hand and introduced him into the living room according to his arm. Some dilapidated sofas and a tea table with a corner made it look here. Something is unsatisfactory. But regardless of Du Lin, or Edgar, there is no attention to this. They sit directly on both sides of the coffee table and face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Doolin, in fact, before you came to Otis, we have heard your reputation!" Edgar was able to speak, and he appropriately released a sigh and a hint of expression, " Honestly, I have never thought of a young man. Young people like you can make such a big name, but when I see you, now, I believe!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half of this guy said it was true, and half of it was fake. It is true that he did hear Du Lin’s name. After all, he swept the private liquor market in more than 50 cities and established a very stable sea smuggling channel. It is shocking! His means, his wrists and his style all make him feel his strength. Everyone thinks this guy is not a good person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the fake, that is his compliment to Doolin, a person who used to get used to the wind and rain in his forties, especially the one who did his job. See more and more than the average person. Surprised by surprise, but absolutely not as surprised as he did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early years, the Derrick gang was incomprehensible. Derek himself and Du Lin were similar. The guy’s reputation was passed abroad, and finally it was not because Maniac to lawlessness, was the army destroyed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Edgar's view, fame is a good thing, and a certain reputation is enough. If the fame is too big, it can only lead to disaster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waved his hand and smiled and lifted his legs. "Mr. Edgar’s praise made me a little shame, I just helped some people find them. The way to go, that's it." He paused and started the theme of today. "This time, let Miss Sally ask you to come over. It is something that is inconvenient for people to convey. You know, sometimes tone. Different from the context, it will result in a completely different interpretation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edgar nodded, this is not Doolin, like the word bastard, sometimes Intimate people will also call each other a bastard at some point. This is not a swearing or offensive language, but a very intimate name. But if there are two people who are still unfamiliar, and suddenly someone said a bastard, it must be a provocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard Ms. Sai Li say that you have a little thought about the special tax?" Du Lin looked at the door of the living room, and both of them took two cups of coffee. When he came in, he stood by the wall and stood in the corner. He retracted his eyes and continued: "Do you want a lower tax rate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
