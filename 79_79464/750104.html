			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man spoke first, and he pondered for a long time before he licked some dry lips. In fact, fruit and water cups have long been placed on the coffee table, but none of them have ever drunk water or licked a fruit. The old man stood up politely and introduced himself after the ceremony. "My name is Lati. People call me Latty. I lived in Irian for nearly 50 years. I can say that I am a qualified local." Man." Sco, who sat on the side, nodded. He explained a little for Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days, Irian was not a bustling city, there was almost nothing here, except for the weeds that were tall and the bushes that were never cleaned. There are also countless mosquitoes. The only place that is satisfying, or slightly more fancy, is that there is a deep-water port where you can dock large vessels. At that time, there were not many deep-water ports on the East Coast, and there were fewer, only three, the three most prosperous cities on the East Coast. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, many freighters were docked here in Irian, and the goods had to be transported to other places after being unloaded, so the bottom of many societies saw the factors that made it easy to find work here. Gathering around this formed a community-like lake area. They were the first inhabitants of Irian, and as more and more people lived here, the inconvenient living conditions made them decide to renovate here. At that time, the political New Party had begun to quietly exert a force. A nobleman who failed in the political struggle moved his enclave near the core of the Empire to here. He looked desperately like a wilderness and took out a lot of his own. Save money to the workers who live here and let them build a small town here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Irian was truly born. In the subsequent Great Patriotic War, the unlucky aristocrat was recruited into the army and became the commander of the second detachment of the Third Fleet of the Navy, sleeping forever on the seabed. After the new party came to power, Ilyan, the land of no-ownership, was controlled by the New Party and invested a lot of money to become one of the main ports defending the empire. In the past decade, the Empire has opened up two other super military ports to release Irian from militarized control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an excellent foundation, Irian’s development is very rapid, especially in the policy of the two previous city managers’ policy, in the Irian area. Construction and economic development have brought great benefits. One policy has consistently ensured that the region has not stopped at the speed of development and construction, and today has Ilyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling didn't know much about this. Scott explained a little about it. He immediately understood it. Rather than having a unique geographical environment, Irian had two practical city managers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men’s whispers are separated, and the old man continues: “The environment in which the compatriots living here and the compatriots living in other places may not be the same, so You may not know much about our pursuit. We don't need any great or great life. We just want to live here safely and live this life. My knowledge is not very high, I said that you understand. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded his head. This is a vaccination. It also shows that there are smart people in this group of gualts. This wise man is very clever in using this sentence to block a lot of unrealistic things that Du Lin might promise next. Explain the words of Ratti’s old man in a simple and common way, that is, “Don’t be with me. Blowing, I only need to be practical." He raised his hand and asked Latti to sit down and replied: "You are an elder. All elders should be respected by people. I understand what you said, and this is what I need to do. Now we I will not mention this topic for the time being, and you will see it with your own eyes.", he said that he looked at the other two, they all shook their heads, and Du Lin began his own rhetoric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the ancient history of our Guartes, there are many slang words full of wisdom, one of which - when the nail penetrates the palm of your hand, Even if you pull out the nails, you will leave scars." He paused and gave the three representatives a time to think and understand. When they understood it, Du Lin continued: "The riots that have happened this afternoon have subsided. But the negative impact is still there, and we need to pay attention to another thing. Who directed this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He definitely points Head, "I used the term vocabulary because I think it's all a conspiracy. There are a handful of people who want to provoke a turmoil that shocks the entire empire by assassination, blame, and framed. The despicable purpose of man. It is conceivable that if I did not quell the riot today, the Navy will certainly suppress the riots. There will be many gualts who die in this conflict with no reason and necessity, then who is it? Yes "Yi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't be me, it can't be me, then who is it? Who organizes you to convey appeals through such irrational actions?" Who is standing up to mislead you when the big guys are just guessing and doubting? I don't know, but I believe you know, some people know. These people are despicable, they want you and me. Cracks, mutual distrust, and even hostility. To achieve this goal, they are even willing to sacrifice the lives of their compatriots to accomplish this purpose. Your enemies are not me, but these people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"And this is precisely the reason why I am talking to you. This is not the end of this matter. Someone must pay for it. Those who have hurt you, those who have deceived you, and who have assassinated Mr. Abyan. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven’t talked to Mr. Abbey and haven’t met, but I learned from someone else’s mouth that it’s a very good one. The guy, his temper is very gentle, he has been running for the rights and welfare of his compatriots. He is the role model of all Guartes. I always hope that I can sit down with him and have a good chat.", Du Lin's The voice is very low, full of a kind of hateful regret. "It is a pity that this wish can no longer be realized. I think I should do something, that is to find out the murderer, for him, to recover for all those who have been hurt. Lost fairness and justice, revenge for them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words are very emotional and the content is very moving, and Ratti’s head bowed and dried up. Eyes, turbid eyes, reddish His lips trembled slightly. "You said it is very correct. This is what we hope. We should solve this accident friendly and sensible. I will convey it back to your statement."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at Scott, and the latter was somewhat inexplicable. "The eighth district is about to break ground. I am actively preparing for the bidding, and more than one project. Once successful. After that, I am willing to provide a full-paying job for all my compatriots living in Irian City. I will refer to the standard of treatment set by the trade unions and even a slight improvement. The working hours will be increased to at least ten hours per day for eight hours. Five points, lunch and dinner, and other benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, all this must be after we find the murderer and the maker of the riot this morning, Let's talk about this in more detail. As for how to find the murderer and the turmoil, I believe that Mr. Scott and the city hall he represents will give us the perfect answer. Is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurt nodded again and again. "Yes, what Mr. Doolin said is exactly what I want to say. For any criminals and criminal acts that have destroyed the prosperity, stability and tranquillity of the Irian region, we will definitely hit hard. We absolutely I will not let go of a bad person, nor will I misjudge any good person. This Mr. Rati must be very clear. Next, our investigation team will go deep into the fifth district to collect evidence and investigations. I hope that you can let everyone cooperate. Even if there is any problem, you need to be calm and sensible. Look for me, or Mr. Doolin can!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
