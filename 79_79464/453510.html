			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the early morning newspaper boy threw the newspaper outside the door of No. 117 Queen's Road, the door opened a slit, and one with too much body hair appeared black. The hand slid out of the door and grabbed the newspaper and took it back. The newspaper was placed on some old tables after passing through the hallway and a door in the hands of men. At the bottom of the table edge is a layer of dark putty, which exudes a strange smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About ten minutes, a young teenager walked into the restaurant. He sat on the chair at the table and picked it up and rolled it into a stick. The newspaper unfolded, and the first page of the newspaper used black and bold fonts to report the most eye-catching things in the city of Tener yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death of the Color Devil<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a terrifying title, if you don’t know it, you must It's a movie or a novel, not a newspaper. Du Lin nodded with satisfaction. The newspaper was very accurate. After he said a thank you, he took his eyes from the Buddha and took a warm drink. The untreated and skimmed milk is heated to evaporate some of the water. After a little concentration, the mellow taste is fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze began to read line by line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A murder occurred in the city late last night, but it is unpredictable that the deceased is the real 'murderer', and the murderer is the victim. After the reporter’s follow-up and interviews with police officers, the truth of the murder was ascertained. Morris, who is known as the gang member of the leather pants Morris, died in a hotel room. Before his death, he also brutally invaded a female student..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire report revolves around the death of Morris and the collection of conjectures and materials. The information including the girl named Nasha was pulled out. She is not a Tener, she is just going to school here. Her home was in the capital of the empire, her father was doing business, her mother was sick, and Nasa, who was unattended, was sent to the country of Turner. If you have not yet dissipated the Morris soul when you read it here, maybe he will sigh, this is a reincarnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, Nasha kills, Morris is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, the murder scene at the wrong end is not like Nashua’s initiative in the newspaper, she doesn’t remember anything. The city of Tyrol’s city prosecutor Domir also briefly discussed the murder in the second edition of the newspaper. In his opinion, Nasha apparently concealed something because of the evidence collected from the murder scene and the scene. In the case, there should be three people in the room, not two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Domir prosecutor also said that even if it is stimulated, it is impossible for a person to completely lose the memory of a period of time. At the same time, from the way Morris died, it is not like a girl who has just been raped. Can be made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Domir’s prosecutor thought that Nasha was lying on this matter, she hid the most critical evidence and thought it might be a premeditated murder . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin threw the newspaper on the table, he had to admire Kevin, the name of the lawyer is not a random call. He did know how the reaction and thoughts of the prosecutor of the company would be clear. It is no wonder that there was no case in the city of Tener that he could not win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when Kevin said his plan, Doolin felt that there was a certain risk. From now on, this guy should be almost a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, a thousand flowers are spent to save the heart, the next thing to see Kevin himself to operate. If he fails, his entire life will be finished, which is why Du Lin feels relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the time, it’s almost eight o'clock. According to the plan, the 30,000 bottles of wine that belong to him now have entered the temporary warehouse of the station. According to the agreement between him and the supplier, he needs to pay the deposit first, and more than 2,000 yuan will be seen in a flash. There are not many complaints about the three suppliers who only give 10% deposit. After all, they ask Du Lin to buy their things, even if they say that they sell half to half, they will not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further said that such a large supply, it is normal to only deposit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, 30,000 bottles of wine silently entered the temporary warehouse of the station, perhaps Dolin, ten days ago, did not think that only a short half In the month, you can make your business so big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a sale of 100,000 yuan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, good, then lift a little more... well, don't move!" Under the command of Doolin, the teenagers will have a large distiller The accessories are hoisted and the pieces are installed. These things don't necessarily know what it is, and don't need to know what it is. Just knowing that this thing is a good thing is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
