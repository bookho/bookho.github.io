			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris never put the Guars in the eye, a group of failed races, and the Empire broke the average division throughout the empire. It is difficult for any city to make up 5,000 gults. In the face of such a group, Morris does not need to think too much. So he knows that Du Lin’s method is that the method of catching Hu En is indeed a suitable solution, and he has not considered the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three-day time arrives, he takes someone to take back the farm and then sells it. At that time, he can at least get the benefit of 150 pieces, which is what he cares most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Own wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a conscientious gang member, Morris’s daily life is very regular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will go out on time every morning at around 9:00, and he should get up before 8:30, and he has not appeared in advance for three days. Or delay the situation of going out. When he went out, he wore a sweatshirt and jogged to the seventh street, about two kilometers away from the apartment where he lived. After entering the deli shop, he will put on a variety of attractive and gorgeous clothes, powdered his face, and then with a few men began to collect debts in various parts of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lunch is usually eaten at the home of those poor debtors. They will return to the deli at around 4 pm and settle the rice bowl in the deli. When it’s completely dark, go back to the “Tropical Jungle” and play until after twelve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropical Jungle is a popular underground dance hall. It is said to be a underground ballroom because it never limits the number of people, and can go directly at any time. Whether you are a person or a group of people. Regular bars, dance halls and other entertainment venues have strict safety and fire protection requirements, such as the maximum number of people, so many bars and dance halls often have a long queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the tropical jungle does not have these things. The tropical jungle is in the air-raid shelter under the 11th Street Bridge across the river. The original organizers are a group of exotic costumes, set on the face. Some nails were taken away from a group of young people who were eccentric in the mainstream. They will have music that is noisy for most people, but with a strong sense of rhythm, singing and dancing in the bomb shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gradually, this culture called "punk" is gradually being worshipped by young people, and people are constantly joining them until the bomb shelter becomes a holy place for young people. You don't have to pay expensive tickets here, you don't need to wait in line to wait for the sex, just bring a dozen wines, or some drinks, cigarettes, plus some talkative, it is easy to integrate into this special group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which world, there is always something that makes people feel like nothing, when more and more young people start to integrate into the tropical jungle, think of it as midnight In the Holy Land, the punk cultures that were once worshipped by them were excluded. It's like a drop of ink can really change the color of water in a small bowl, but replace this small bowl with a fish tank and replace it with a lake. A drop of ink can't change anything, but it will be assimilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of mainstream cultures have poured into this pond, and the original punk culture has once again become a holy place for mainstream culture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris will play here very late every day, if he meets the right girl, he will leave early. However, his taste is very special. He likes those young students. The higher his degree, the more interested he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky gradually darkened, and Morris once again drove with a man to the cross-river bridge on the 11th Street. After he locked the door, he walked along the spiral staircase of the maintenance passage of the bridge to the river. He walked less than 100 meters along the river, and his ears could faintly hear the best music. There was a sly smile on Morris's face, and as he walked, he twisted his body as if he were on the dance floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward for about ten meters or so, there is a rusty iron door, the moment of pushing the iron door, the music has gradually become clear The sound suddenly magnified, and a strong smell of wine went from the dark to the middle. This wine smell is also mixed with some sweaty smell and some inexplicable taste, Morris has long been accustomed to. Walking through a channel that was about 20 meters dark and down, it came to a huge empty space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the many air defense facilities in the city of Tener. It was once a guarantee of people’s lives, but at this time, it seems to be the most brilliant time. No difference, just as crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people spontaneously brought in some stones and boxes from the outside, as well as the steps and facilities that were previously there, like a small arena. In the dim light, in the music of the world, countless young bodies danced wildly in the middle of the open space, venting their emotions. Even if the face-to-face is very ugly, the "dance floor" of the other's face, the men and women unloaded the camouflage of the day, and indulged their youth and the youth that is about to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some girls have long been screaming, screaming, shaking their heads and squinting, as if they were in the clouds. Men may reach out and lick their oil on the girls, but who cares? No one knows who is after dawn, this is precisely the true essence of the tropical jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discharge, indulgence, all negative emotions are evaporated immediately after entering here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris laughed and squeezed into the dance floor, huddled with these young men and women and vented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the passage of the black hole in the distance, from time to time, the red-haired voice is dispelled by huge music. For these people, It is heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris, who has been swaying for a while on the dance floor, has never found a goal to start. Those who are too unrestrained do not like it. Maybe this has no culture with him. There is a relationship between culture and the awe of the upper class. He really likes those who have culture, and the moment when a literate person rides under him. At that moment, he feels that he seems to be omnipotent. He will use his own skills to tear up the girls' academic qualifications, culture, and social status, just as he can conquer the whole world. Suddenly, unintentionally, he saw a girl sitting quietly on the edge of the dance floor, with a pair of glasses and a long ponytail, very Intellectuality. Morris didn't know what it meant to be intellectual. He only knew that this girl attracted herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One person?", he squeezed over and sat directly next to the girl. The girl glanced at him and moved to one side, keeping a distance from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl refused very decisively and pointed to the dance floor where she could not see who was who, "No, there are my friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris also moved over and once again sat down with the girl. "So what? I am fortunate to be your friend? Ms.?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that Morris does have some capital, and that it’s a good line plus some ostentatious expressions that really make some girls interested in stimulating interested, especially those who are prostitutes . The more the girls who are suppressed on weekdays, the more indulgent they are here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl once again moved to the side. "I don't like to make friends with strangers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the girl escapes, the more interesting Morris feels, the more her heart The more itchy. Do not say that there are deaf factors in the human bones, and those Morris who are sent to the door in the dance floor can't look at their eyes. Instead, they are not willing to communicate with him in depth. The more he hopes to succeed, the more he hopes to succeed. ? Of course, if you say something nice, it is a men’s desire to conquer. Men are not interested in things that are not difficult. Only things that are difficult to overcome are conquered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Morris, people know me!", Morris moved again. "Hey, you know my name, then we are now." "Friends!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl sneered, "I don't know you, and, trouble you are far away from me, I don't like you." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are repeated refusals by the same girl again and again, even if Morris can't stand it. His face is thick, but this attitude is too hurtful! Just when he considered whether to use other means, the girls’ friends might be tired and come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of three people, two girls, one boy. All three were covered in sweat, one of them was wearing tight-fitting clothes, and the two spurs on the chest made people feel dizzy with shaking. Morris glanced at him and licked his lips and moved his eyes to the faces of the three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All young people are young, and they don’t have the enthusiasm for entering the society. The best youth of God is painted on their faces, let Morris There was a feeling of embarrassment in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also young, but now he is not young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy looked at Morris a little surprised and asked the girl: "Your friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Before the girl replied, Morris stood up and extended his hand. "Yes, we are friends, it’s nice to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The boy stunned and seemed to be not familiar with the etiquette between adults. He was slightly slow and reached out and Morris shook hands. It may be that the sudden use of adult etiquette gave him the illusion that he grew up. He was very friendly and sat next to Morris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
