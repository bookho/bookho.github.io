			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinner was held as usual. The investors in the city of Otis and the imperial pillars of the upper class participated in the dinner. Princess Feriga’s visit allowed them to The face is very faceless. In their view, the greatness of the city also has a contribution they have contributed. Otherwise, relying solely on Doolin, there is no way to build the city so quickly. Everyone feels proud of themselves. And proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felica and Vitor were late in the fifteen minutes after the start of the dinner, which of course might be a horrible aristocratic etiquette or social rule. For example, a woman who is not married should be late for a while. Harry still greeted him as he did during the day, and when he looked at Doolin, Ferrika and Vitor also looked at Doolin. They want to see if Doolin will become like the Harry, using civilized social etiquette to treat the Princess of the Fatima family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin will never disappoint, he smiles and walks toward Felicia, his actions are destined to make these people feel surprised because he He extended his hand to Fei Lijia. "The dinner is more exciting and brilliant because of your arrival. Welcome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is unbelievably watching Du Lin stretch out The hand, Vitor's eyes also showed an incredible look, Fei Lijia hesitated a moment, reached out and Duolin simply shook, touched, no pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your hospitality, I feel the passion of Otis, I am very lucky to be here, I have seen so many interesting things, thank you "Entertainment!", Fei Lijia took a nod after retracting her hand and walked straight toward the middle of the hall, as if she came here not because she wanted to come, but the people of Otis who invited her to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry smashed Doolin’s sleeve and pulled him aside. “Hell, have you forgotten what you said in the afternoon?”, Harry I don’t understand whether Du Lin has forgotten it or intends to do it. “You can’t reach out to an unmarried young girl, and it’s still a noble aristocratic woman. It’s very rude!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and reached out to the waitress who was standing with cutlery and some supplies. The waitress was surprised, but still smiled and shook hands with Du Lin. "I am very embarrassed to ask, are you married?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This waitress looks like she is only in her early twenties, she shook a little shyly. Shake his head. Of course, she would not doubt whether Du Lin was fancy himself. This is simply impossible. The plot in the Cavalier novel will never be staged in reality. She has already passed the age of believing in fairy tales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Dolin nodded his head, he let go of his hand and then looked at Harry with a slightly open mouth. "Oh, I don't think my behavior is rude, and I believe that this lady did not think that she was being shaken by me. I am humiliated, is that the case?", he said that at the end of the day, he looked at the waitress, and the waitress smiled and nodded, then left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very smart, knowing that leaving at this time is the most correct choice, and staying is very likely to offend someone. If it is not Doolin, it must be Governor of Harry. No matter who is that, it is not a small waiter like her who can offend. Maybe they won't remember themselves, but some people will remember themselves and win their favor by hurting themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrugged his shoulders. "There is no doubt that she is not angry, and she may feel that she is being respected because of social etiquette such as shaking hands. Then I "When I shake hands with Ms. Fei Lijia, how can it be rude?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a nobleman, a princess!", Harry immediately responded and blurted out, " You can't replace a noble princess with a waiter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and retorted, "Now is a new era, the class of nobility is With the insistence of great leaders such as Magus, all of us are equal, and the aristocracy has become a thing of the past! I have insisted on my views before the cabinet has issued a formal statement that it should retain the aristocratic class. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that this is not just a matter of "noisy", and the arrival of Fei Lijia really made him feel a little unexpected, the same in the face For the most powerful family in the north, if he performs The past is not the same, it will make people wonder if he is not a "bully" people. The reason why he has been strong enough before, just because the people and family he faces are not enough to make him feel fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a bad sign. Some people’s minds will be burned again. Desires need only a little bit of driving force. Become a blazing flame that burns the world. In order to avoid the flames burning themselves, Du Lin must have a maverick style, letting people know that no matter who they are, he can't change his persistence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry shook his head and turned away. Doolin’s statement made him feel that he was also humiliated. The nobility has always been a nobleman. Even if there is no aristocratic class in the social class of the empire, everyone knows it. In the past they were nobles, and now they are still nobles, but they are more low-key, more convergent, and give up the name of the past, nothing more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Harry's departure, Du Lin snorted. As long as there is such a person as Harry, the problem of class can never be eliminated. The old party’s "social elite class theory" is attractive because it allows some people to stand in their camps because some people want to consolidate and elevate their social status, with a dominant class independence. Outside the ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood in the distance and watched Ferrie’s in the meeting room and talked with the local high-ranking people who had communicated with each other, not Losing grace and kindness is really appealing – attracting idiots who have money but don’t know how to improve their social class. Many businessmen want to end up with one or two great aristocrats to improve their “status”. Thereby seeking greater convenience in the mall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you go?", Buddha stood next to Du Lin with a plate, and he smacked at the side of Fei Lijia. "That But the Royal Highness of the Princess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't know, she is only the granddaughter of the Duke, and His Royal Highness can only be called the royal princess!", Du Lin is also a current school. Use, some words that Harry said at noon, he now tells the Buddha, and suddenly there is a sense of superiority in IQ. It is no wonder that people like to educate others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha shrugged indifferently, stuffing a shell of meat into his mouth, and the soup flowed out of his mouth. "That and me." It doesn't matter, I am just a civilian!", he said that he and Du Lin looked at each other and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago they were still on the streets of Turner, but now they can have a princess in the same room, this change makes them feel hard Confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, your brother is coming, that is Merlin!", Buddha said this thing at this time should talk to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin’s girlfriend Su Rui heard that Fei Lijiagong mainly went to the city of Otis to investigate, and immediately begged Merlin to come over. After seeing Du Lin’s “decent” and knowing Du Lin’s identity that day, she was very loyal to Merlin. Finally, I really caught a prince who was riding a white horse. How could he let go of the life of the upper class and slip away from his side? Su Rui is a very realistic girl, and she never deceives herself at this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being entangled for two days, plus Merlin did have something to say to Du Lin, they came to the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I didn't contact Du Lin was because I couldn't get in touch. At that time, he just left the office with Harry. He answered the phone with Dove, and Dove had his own business. He transferred this information to the Buddha. Just after welcoming Merlin outside, they all brought them in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foshan refers to the side of Felica, Doolin I looked at him in the direction he pointed, and immediately saw Suri excitedly standing behind Fei Lijia, and Merlin stood side by side with her expressionless expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that someone is looking at himself, Merlin looked around, slammed his head and said Su Rui, and quit the crowd and walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two walked to the side of the VIP room, the lingering eyes of Felicia saw Du Lin’s departure, and she frowned at inadvertently. Then the face smile was restored, as if the scene of the change of expression had never happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there something?", sitting on the sofa in the VIP room, Doolin sent a cigarette to Merlin, and the two brothers smoked for a while. Merlin annihilated the remaining cigarette butts in the ashtray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his mouth and rubbed his hands for a while before he spit out what he was going to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suri is pregnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin, who just knew this, was a little scared. He was only 22 years old, although he should have children according to the age of Ziyan Town, but this The life in the metropolis made him realize that he was still a young man. He should have some distance from the word family. He didn’t want to get married so quickly. He even thought of letting Suri get rid of the child in his stomach, but he always Unable to make the final decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, it’s also a child, the Xerma family has never had the habit of abortion, their brothers and sisters add up to a large group, and no one is in the stomach. It was killed. If he does this, maybe Mr. Kemma will kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just stumbled, as the father who is about to become two children, he is already very indifferent, "then born, then sent back."
