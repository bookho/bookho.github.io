			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Scott’s answer ended, there was a slight commotion in the venue. Many reporters began to work hard and all the shots were aimed at him. Most of what he said just now has a bottom in mind, and official speeches can always be guessed. But his last words really made these reporters feel excited, this is definitely a big news. Whether or not it will eventually become a reality, the mayor of Doolin will become the focus of the news in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with many merchants, criminals, or other professionals who can’t keep up with the empire, they often leave after losing the soil and space to survive in the empire. Empire, go to the Federation to seek opportunities. Similarly, there are many similar people in the Federation who will come to the empire, hoping to find the glory of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of these people are the most eye-catching, the first is the federal businessmen, especially in the southern cities, often seeing some hanging federal The business organizations of the Chamber of Commerce brand, these institutions are mixed, some are legitimate businessmen, but there are also some inferior businessmen mixed in. The business practices they engage in, the goods they sell, and more or less can find some problems. Only so far, after the incident, they will not be further processed except for compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category is the gang of federal people as the main group, or even the only group. They are the most common in southern cities, occupying some neighborhoods for illegal trade. Or sell some contraband, organize a woman with technology to solve the problem that some doctors can't cure the men. Sometimes they practice more than the empire's local gangs, because they are outsiders, they need to expose their minions to deter other gangs who have ideas for them, and they don't care to make a mess here, because they are not raising their home country. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these people, everyone has long complained, but because of the law and the extent of these people’s sinister treacherousness, there is not so much good treatment so far. It is difficult to find their evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after Scott’s attitude to the mayor of Doolin, everyone felt that the mayor’s courage was too big, he actually thought It is necessary to do something that the official top management can't do. There is no doubt that in the future, he will not only be a news person, but also a thorn in the eyes of the federal people in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have to say that his sayings and practices do give people a feeling of raising their anger. They should have done this before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short record, another reporter held his arm high, and Scott used the expression on the faces of these reporters to distinguish the purpose of their speech. Some people look dull, these reporters may not answer well; some people are excited, no doubt they are like a big news; some reporters are slightly more normal, choose them at least not let themselves too Unsightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Scott’s choice of eyes, he pointed to the ninth position in the sixth row, a reporter with a slightly thinned eyes. The reporter stood up and glanced at the book in his hand. Then he asked: "Hello, press officer, I am a reporter for the Wenleles Industrial News. I have some different data here. Some people think that The official may have concealed the true number of deaths. How do you think about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott’s face is quiet, but his heart is relieved, this is It is the key test point that has been drawn before the preview. Just as reporters have similar speculations about what the official press officer will say, the press officer will have a preview of the questions that journalists may ask before the press conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I feel ridiculous about the question you raised. From the beginning of the collection operation to the present, I believe that everyone has seen the wounded injured. After registration, I was sent to the hospital. I also saw bags for temporary storage of bodies outside the canyon. If your primary school teacher is not lazy, you can go to the site to count, or take our registration book to count all the hospitals. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott raised his hand and let him sit down, his face said calmly: "There are always some people who hide in the dark corners and try to use shame and tricks." The act of going to hurt a just cause! The first thing we need to do now is not to consider attacks from the political arena, attacks from the capitalists, attacks from a small group of conspirators. We should put all our attention on search and rescue. At work, I hope that more people will receive rescue. This is the brilliance of human nature and the one we need most!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest For your question, I He felt very...", he smiled with a low head and a mockery. "Do you want to use the number of those who died and their experiences as an excuse to attack the city government of Otis? Or to reach you other Unspeakable conspiracy? You and those behind you and your problems are really shameful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly it became the focus that made the reporter of the Industrial Newspaper somewhat unprepared. His face turned red and he avoided the gaze from all sides. Yes, Scott is right. He intends to use a frightening title and an exaggerated number, and with Scott's speech, to make a big news. But he did not think that the news officer of Otis City actually said this at the press conference, so that he did not have a little retreat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will certainly not know that he has been blacklisted, and no matter what happens, the industrial newspaper will be excluded from the press group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reporter stood up and asked questions. Scott answered their questions one by one. If they answered positively, they would answer positively. If they could not answer positively, they would steal the concept. This trick has long been a good time when he was working at Irian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the press conference, Scott took off his jacket and returned to his office to change a neat and clean dress. In the hour, his shirt was wet with sweat. In the face of reporters from the newspapers of the empire, he is absolutely not as easy as he is. If you answer any of the questions, first of all, he will be a shame and defeat in Doolin. He has no retreat, and secondly, he will make Du Lin a harlequin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not a good person. This is the consensus of all the high society of Irian, after he killed Juan and killed the provincial sages who planned to march. Everyone knows that this guy is a bad person, or a kind of heart-wrenching one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott soon appeared in front of Doolin, and Du Lin was on the phone. He saw Scott coming in and pointing to the sofa in the distance. I walked into the restroom with a phone call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he is talking to the chairman of the joint construction company, this is their fifth call in three days, the result of five calls is almost always reflected in At this press conference. The core of this press conference is actually only three. The first one is that the mayor of Doolin is selfless and willing to do what he can to do for all the imperial people, and to take responsibility, is a just official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that joint construction is a responsible enterprise. They do the wrong things. They are willing to pay compensation according to the law. They will never evade. Any fine, even if it goes bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last and most important one is to conceal the death toll and reduce the death toll of more than 1,300 people to more than 200. Of course, this does not mean that the death of another thousand people really does not exist. In fact, it exists. The families of these victims can get 8,000 yuan of compensation, but they are always the unlucky "20 percent." Under the guidance of public opinion, people will no longer pay attention to the number of deaths and whether these people have received compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be more aware that Du Lin and United Construction have the courage to take the courage and dare to face the responsibility of disaster, which is equivalent to playing for them all over the North. Mainland advertising! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why you want to conceal the number of deaths, on the one hand, if the actual number of deaths is announced, it is very likely that the projects running through the two mountains will be stopped by public opinion. The project of killing so many people in the accident is a scourge in the eyes of many social moral figures with a sense of justice. Secondly, it is to re-integrate the stock price of the joint construction workers, and the joint construction workers are the rewards for concealing the death toll. Free construction of the railway for the city of Otis, excluding material costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who spoke on both sides of the phone counted on the phone and felt that this thing could be done, and that a bad thing would soon turn into a good thing, they passed The benefits of this accident far outweigh the benefits they lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a business, a big business! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the call ended, Du Lin came out of the restroom. He put the phone on the table and went to the sofa to sit down. "How? Also used to Is life here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott smiled and nodded. "What else can I say besides saying 'adapt'? Go back? Of course not!" He straightened his back and asked with some worries: "Would you be hurt by this accident?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also nodded, "Of course If so many people die, I will definitely have the responsibility to be relieved. Some people will not be able to stand up to the minority, and there are some enemies in the imperial political arena. They will certainly not miss this opportunity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you may be transferred?", although Scott got the promise of Doolin, but still a little bit of pain, "the next mayor Is there any news about who will take over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
