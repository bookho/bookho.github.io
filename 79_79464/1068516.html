			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor glanced at Perito, the smoky meeting room was filled with unpleasant smell of smoke, "Improve the insurance industry's margin to ensure that it can be owned when necessary Sufficient money is paid to the insured. I must let you know that I have no trouble for any of you. This is a prerequisite for imperative!" Taylor is much stronger than Felice, he knows better. How to establish an industry standard and access system, and know the benefits of doing so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is more like a standard professional manager. He only has work in his head. He climbs up from the bottom with his own ability and advantage. Every job is a battle. If it fails, he may lose everything, which makes him have to go all out. And the kind of shareholders of Phyllis is not a kind of person at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belito also nodded. Taylor just gave him a strong hint that he knew he should stand up at this time. His perception of Taylor has been polarized, both like Taylor's professionalism at work and his strong aggressiveness. The former can make all the things here quickly get on the right track, let the insurance business quickly set up and enter the operational state, the latter means that his opponent has become a master with a sword from a fool who has not got a good sword. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes the difficulty of customs clearance. Except for those masochistic, it is clear that Perito is not a masochistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I very much agree with Mr. Taylor’s opinion that Mr. Roel’s long-lost behavior has reminded us that if there is no strong margin, It may be because of the fraudulent behavior of a certain person or an organization that puts the insurance company on the verge of bankruptcy. Gentlemen, the purpose of sitting here to discuss these things is not to find a way to force ourselves to go bankrupt, but to earn more. More money, then we must be prepared to resist the risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has proved himself in business, I don't think I need some words. The cumbersome repetition, everyone should be very understanding. Risks and opportunities coexist, the greater the benefits, the greater the risk we bear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In an emerging industry, if a company is forced to bankrupt because it cannot pay the insured's insurance claims, it will bring huge risks and negative impacts to the entire industry. People will directly link insurance business and fraud. Mr. Taylor’s proposal to increase the margin is not to make it difficult for you, not to let you leave, but to protect our mutual interests. We change our mindset, if you are still in the insurance business, but we are because of this The reason for bankruptcy is implicating you, I am afraid that you are also extremely unhappy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor nodded and took over the topic from Perito. "Yes, Mr. Perito is very correct. Only when the industry's ability to resist risks is sufficient can it bring us a stable and sustainable speed. The huge market for development. And I think the margin I proposed is very reasonable. We can learn from the data of Mr. Mennon’s policy of operating the three guarantees that at least 30% of the guarantee amount can be spent. The previous period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people who met for the first time cooperated very well. They sang together and said that they wanted to expel the "bad money" in their hearts. For these people to consider, of course, it is undeniable that what they said is also part of the facts. Judging from the current data of the three-guarantee policy left by the Mennon, there is a 10 million enough to support the insurance company's business to run normally. They even have more ways to continue to operate this margin in half. Insurance business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that it is impossible to do everything according to people's best ideas. What if there is another mine disaster? Now those who are mining have bought insurance. A mine disaster may affect 300 to 500 people. It will take out millions of claims at a time. Furthermore, what if you have a natural disaster? For example, in the earthquake, once the earthquake has occurred in the western part of the mine, there will be no more than one or two, three or five, maybe a dozen or even dozens. How can I claim if there is not enough margin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are many unforeseen but absolutely highly probable things that require insurance companies to have enough capital to fight the disaster, and Taylor asks for a margin increase. Not only is it responsible for itself, but it is also responsible for the insured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of words said that several other people in the conference room were in silence. They really couldn’t sit here if they could get a deposit of 50 million. The South has a variety of physical industries that are more suitable for them and have bright prospects. It is worth investing. The reason why they compete with the two major banks and Du Lin to snap up those contracts is still a speculative act. Now they are half-successful in speculation, but the other half is not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an idea here that can be offered to you for consideration!", Taylor waited for about three or five minutes when no one spoke, Taylor smiled and broke The calm in the conference room, "two ideas, the first idea is that the imperial central bank will acquire the existing contracts in your hands through cash. The price can be discussed in detail, and we will operate with the greatest sincerity. Another one The idea is to replace the equity of our established Yaoxing Imperial Insurance Company after the contract in your hands, so that your things are still in your hands, but you don't need to worry about the 50 million guarantee." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please believe us, our sincerity is very good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belito frowned, he and Taylor had not met before, but he knew Taylor people. Taylor’s reputation within the Imperial Bank is not very good. It is a very mild statement to say that he is ruthless and unreasonable. His start and the central bank’s last internal resource rectification and elimination have related matters. He has caused many people to lose their jobs and sneak out. Some people even The imperial central bank has been working for more than 30 years. After a year or two, it is necessary to retire to get a pension. He has also found some reasons to kick it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a cold-blooded executioner, a butcher, cruelly depriving many people of hope. However, everything is positive and negative. The central bank’s board of directors really likes Taylor’s ruthlessness. He saved the central bank a lot of money and made some complicated things simple. People thought that he would end up for various reasons. Was kicked out, I did not expect the council to recruit him to become a partner, even the worst one, but that is also a partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a monk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this meeting, Taylor and Perito had a phone call, and Taylor took the initiative to call Perito, saying that some of this meeting would Said things, both sides first ventilation. Most of the things were done according to the two people before the ventilation, but the last one, there are some differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time Taylor’s statement was to find ways to force these retail investors to unite to form a company, then turn the parties into three parties, and then they would cross the company’s margin and market value. Holding shares. The South Bank and the Imperial Bank are obviously thicker, and they will be able to get more shares in the third company with the least effort. The two sides are working together to achieve the goal of directly controlling the third company. In this way, the entire insurance industry is equal to only two of them, and an awkward Taiwanese company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is very interesting and has a high degree of enforceability. Perito considered it and gave it a positive answer to Taylor. But I didn't think that sitting at the conference table, Taylor was actually playing with Yin, and he bypassed him and wanted to swallow these people into his stomach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belitto can guess the minds of these people, as Taylor said, they have not lost anything, but they have gained a more stable Backing the mountain, a bigger market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
