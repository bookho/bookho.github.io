			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you hold a knife, others will be afraid of you. They will satisfy all your requirements, give you wealth, give you power, give you status." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will deceive you, let you fall into the trap of lies, gradually become numb, become friends with you, become brothers, until you forget how you changed "They become theirs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then you will put down the knife in your hand, put down the knife in your heart, you become them, and finally they are swallowed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They won’t kill you, it’s too low-level, he will make you a real one, and then watch out for them with those who have a knife. Although you are still alive, you are no longer your own!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, people, can't forget this, can't forget their mission, can't forget their own The purpose, can't shake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the old brothers in the room, sitting on the table with their legs crossed, hands put The letter knife with a light golden wooden handle, his expression is very serious, but when he looks up later, the face is abruptly smiled. "So we can't put down the knife, we have to hide the knife, let They thought we were them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fellowships remain unchanged, and all core members are transferred to the upcoming gods, I will later bring the fellowship The new constitution of the meeting will be given to you and then sent down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fellowship is the sharpest knife in the hands of Doolin, and the knife that can kill people. The knife was wary of the nobility, including Magus, who was alert to the knife. For the present world, you can worship a totem, a statue, a history, or even money, but you can't worship and fanatic to believe in a living person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the church has lived for so many years without being killed by the cabinet is that the church has no power and no influence, according to the data published by the current church. The power of the church in the empire is still quite large. Many capitalists are believers in the church. After all, the church has a very broad congregation, especially at the bottom of society. Joining the church will give people a good impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason they can exist is because God is dead, and worshiping a dead person does not have any value, except to restrain himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest difference between normal religion and cult. The formal religion worship is the god of the mythology, or some kind of belief. In short, it is a dead thing, an empty thing, but the cult worships a living person. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead god is dead, there is no lust, but he holds the greatest faith, and the church leaders who manipulate the church in the name of faith cannot Violating their own or previous high-level teachings can only deepen the positive and positive aspects of persuading people. The power in their hands will be taken away by faith when necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the living people are different. When people are alive, they will have lust, and they will have impulsiveness and will be irrational. In this case, they will use the power in their hands to create something horrible, with terror consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the world does not oppose freedom of belief, but there is a premise to ensure that the belief is a "dead person." [In fact, there are some very few cases that are not listed here.]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association is not a religious organization. When Dolin establishes a fellowship, fill out the application form. It is a social organization with mutual help. Now is the time for it to truly play the role of a social group. As for those core members, it is to join the gods that will be established later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus promised that Doolin would legislate to affirm the equality of the imperial public and the faith, and use written records to confirm whether it was the Ogildin or The Guarts are all imperial citizens. They all have the right to enjoy all the rights that the Empire has given them. They must also bear the corresponding responsibilities, and the faith will be released. Allow all believers who have their own beliefs to form a religious organization and build a real cathedral after registering with an upcoming religious council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally improve the social welfare treatment of non-mainstream people, this is also a means for Du Lin to put down his knife, Magus will not become because of Du Lin His niece is a partial preference for him, and he will only be stricter to him. It is just that some things can be easily exported, and they can be "speaking deeply." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was never a guy who would completely obey the arbitrariness of others, and the two idiots of Woodwood and Codor told Du Lin with bloody lessons. He believes that when he puts down the murderous knife and puts on expensive clothes and walks into the hall, he will not be applauded when he greets himself. He will only hang his rope or imprison him forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat to others is also a manifestation of self-worth, but this value is not liked by everyone. If you set foot on a higher social class because of this unlovable value, you mistakenly believe that you can throw away these things. That is truly ridiculous and stupid. Du Lin will not give up anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not ask for hurt, but seek self-protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reform of the fellowship will not be so obvious. On the surface, the Guarts are twisted into a rope, but it may not be. People are selfish, and they are not kicked into the quagmire and stepped on their feet. They may not believe in the identity of Du Lin’s Messiah. And more importantly, there are many descendants of traitors in the empire, such as Heidler. Their father or grandfather gained success in the empire by betraying the overall interests of the Guars. These people will not feel encouraged by the emergence of a Doolin who can lead a large number of Guarts. They will only be afraid, only Will worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one day, the group of Guarts rises again, what should they do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long history of the Guar, only one faceless person survived, and other fraudulent betrayers who accepted the trial of the gods died in the sun. Next, they will not think that they must be the lucky ones, so blocking Du Lin and letting him fail is obviously the best way to meet the current interests of these traitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are many other ideas in this area, especially since he started to slap on the traitors. Dulin would not move them before. Because the political environment of the empire requires them, the politicians of the empire...that is, the cabinet headed by Magus needs these "typical" existences, their existence tells all the Guartes, the empire is willing to accept them, and allows them Boarded the high position. This will greatly change the mood of the Guarte group. This is definitely not a joke, even if their identity is a traitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provincial sage is actually the same, and some provincial sages have become celebrities of the society and become a member of the upper class. Their existence is also an example. The provincial sage, as long as they work hard, the upper class may not have their place. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it is different. Once Marquez has legislated to guarantee equality between races and freedom of belief, a whole series of changes will take place in society as a whole. This change may not be easy to show at an early stage, but as people try, the trend of racial integration will become more and more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone's rights and obligations are the same, no one will encounter unequal treatment, what is the difference between the Guar, the provincial, and the Ogdin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, these models, the value of these examples is greatly reduced, and even some of them may be kicked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a blatant violation of the new bill, but a manifestation of respect, and even those members of the race who are waiting to be merged will not be angry. On the contrary, it will be louder and better! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics has never been clean, not simple! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Du Lin is ready to work on these people. He is better than the official hands. For these people, kicking these people is a kind of Acceptance and recognition, then why do you want to do it for the official, Du Lin can use this opportunity to deepen his influence in the Guar people, let people confirm that he is the Messiah, because he has disciplined those traitors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All Buddha...", Du Lin looked up and glanced at the Buddha who leaned against the door and licked the apple. The latter waved his hand and Du Lin laughed. With one voice, he shook his head and said, "Heidler has helped us a bit. I am very grateful to him for being a compatriot in the city of Tener, including what we have done, so I will give him the greatest gift. You will stare well. He, I will personally send him to the trial seat, don't let him run, and don't let him die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, boss!", < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ellis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Du Lin’s name every time, a certain social The traitors who were once advertised as "successful" in these fields will be tried by the gods. Doolin is not afraid that these things will be too big. Magus will understand his ideas. The cabinet and politicians will not be overly targeted. . While the Guarts hate hating these people, they are also disgusted by the mainstream mainstream society. Treason has never been an honor, even if their actions helped the Ogildinians to ruin the kingdom of Guart. The imperial people will not like these traitors, and even hate them like the Guarts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is also one of the characteristics of politics. Personal love and hatred will not affect the implementation of the overall benefit plan, and people are willing to call this behavior mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
