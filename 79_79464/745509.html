			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for two days, Albert only slammed the doorbell outside the Doolin estate, and soon a maid drove a car. The car designed for the manor came to the front door and opened the side door for Albert. Sitting in the car, feeling the brackish sea breeze blowing over the face, the heat in my heart also cooled a lot. He curiously looked at the maid driving the car. She looked twenty-five and six years old, and she could look good, but she looked a bit old-fashioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change a suit, carefully dress up and do a hair, it is definitely a rare beauty. What kind of beauty is this beauty when she is running in front of the clothes wearing the maids? Albert couldn't help but ask, "I am very eager to ask a question that I shouldn't have asked. How much salary can you pay for working here every month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Perhaps; because Albert is able to get the owner to enter the estate is one of the few guests, the maid answered a number, one hundred without a slap. This salary can't be low, of course, it can't be high, at least not Albert's salary is high. The purpose of his question is to evaluate this. If he gives up his current job and works wholeheartedly for Du Lin, he has no future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks there is, a qualified former gold salesman and a social elite who is about to become a manager must have more than a maid. More, he sorted out his hair and patted his cheeks twice to make himself look spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car took five or six minutes to stop in front of the amazing building. He checked his instrument again and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat on the sofa in the lobby on the first floor and looked at a book of philosophy, called "From the Heart." The book, Albert, said that it was said that a book written by a mental patient after he was discharged from the hospital caused a sensation in the world and soon retreated. Du Lin looked up at Albert and pointed to the sofa next to him. He carefully folded all the pages of this page and then folded the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you let me do, I’ve all done it." Albert took out a form and unfolded it and placed it in Doolin. In front of the table, the table shows the location, scale, popularity and construction price of the 16 theaters. It is very concise and clear. Du Lin gave him a review after carefully reading it, doing a good job. This made Albert very excited, he took out another document and pressed it on the form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my analysis of these industries overnight. According to my judgment, the overall cost of these theaters should not exceed 200,000, and there are several cinemas..." He removed the report and pointed out that the data is not very The good ones, "These are in the fourth and fifth districts, where the level of consumption is not high, and the ability to accept movies as a pastime for entertainment is not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp Du Lin nodded. He did not deny that the cinema here is like the Grand Theatre of Tenell. Most people can afford it, but they are willing to go and not willing to The money in your pocket is wasted on watching others jump and jump. Isn’t it better to buy some money for wear and tear? The same is true for the poor here. Even if the higher levels of consumption make them more than twice the wages of the poor in other places, they still have a hard time living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has heard of an advanced rule about Irian’s life. It’s a very simple matter to upgrade his social status. It is enough to buy a house in the administrative district. Many people save money and use all the money they need to spend, in order to change their social status. But they don't understand the truth. Their way of saving money will never run cpi, and it is meaningless to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came here, the price of a house near the second district on the edge of a district was about 38,000, but it has risen after half a year. By the age of forty-one, the increase in terror has made saving money meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment and asked: "Do you think that the company has a market value of over one million?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert immediately shook his head: "No, there’s not much money for the construction of the cinema. The only thing worth the money is the land beneath their cinema. There is only one in the area. There are three cinemas in the second district. The other cinemas are mainly concentrated in the third district. These plots are very valuable, but the current price will not exceed 500,000.” Albert felt that his tone seemed a bit big, he actually put five Hundreds of thousands of people made a small number, do not know where the courage emerged from the place let him dare to say so. He sneaked a glimpse of Doolin, which should be given to him by the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, you can treat 200,000 as 20, so 500,000 is naturally a small amount of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s statement Doolin has understood that the biggest net asset of East Coast Entertainment now is those land, which they have overestimated the company by more than one million. Can not be said to be excessive. There are also some intangible assets, which makes Du Lin's interest a bit more. Swallowing East Coast Entertainment, and then continue to build several cinemas in the same district, while winning some projects in the eighth district, by expanding to the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The embryonic form of an entertainment empire looms over the surface, and then it will be of great benefit to him to set up a film company, a broadcasting company, and a media company. The benefit is not whether these things can be profitable, not how much profit can be brought to him, but because he can quickly expand his influence through these things. Many people who live at the bottom of society don't pay attention to why the governor is taking a table today, but they will pay attention to a certain sneak peek and be caught. Pan-fun is a trend, although this trend is not obvious now, is it just the best layout time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded frequently and approved Albert’s work. "You have worked hard these two days, and your work is temporarily put in, I still need you to help me. Do one thing.", Albert slammed his heart and slammed his head. "Going to the East Coast Entertainment Company, I think there are some problems with their plans for the IPO. Can you find out if you can find these problems?" If necessary, you can use a little money to open the mouth of the insider. This is done, I will give you what you want!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert Almost immediately saluted, with a pulsating heart, assured Du Lin that he could complete the human task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Doolin, Albert immediately found his mentor since he was a practitioner, even though he never admitted it, he thought he just pointed out Arber In a few words, there is still a long way to go before the mentor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two found a seafood barbecue shop, Irian was on the beach, the cheapest food is seafood, but beef is much more expensive than seafood. The two had an oven placed on the beach, a little far from the crowd. Albert's "mentor" was called Ivan, a middle-aged man in his fifties who was gray and bald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very thin, but looks very spiritual and his eyes are extraordinarily bright. While he was playing with the raw seafood still struggling in the dining car, he looked up at Albert. "Say, is there any problem that needs me to help you? I don't believe you guys will have time to waste eating barbecue. In fact, at this time, can't you sell more products?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert is a professional sales company, there are two in the company. More than a hundred salesmen, their task is to sell the employer's goods as much as possible. The value of such a company exists in order to reduce the unnecessary expenses of some enterprises. If these enterprises employ one or two hundred salesmen themselves, it will be a huge expenditure. Some small enterprises or even the total number of workers themselves do not have two hundred. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
