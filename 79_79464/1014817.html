			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military vehicle was unimpeded on the edge of the square in the city center. After military control, the military requisitioned two commercial buildings around the square as a temporary headquarters. Easy to control the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman followed the two soldiers and brought a room on the second floor. He frowned and didn't go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Mayor, why don't you come in?", Lieutenant Lieutenant stood in the room looking at him, the doorman already knew the female officer on the road. The name, she is called Mary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to interrogate me? Or do you want me to cooperate?", the doorman chuckled a few times, and the laughter was filled with a mockery. There was no sofa in this room in front of him, no coffee table, no display and green potted plants, only one table, three chairs, and some recording equipment. These people were the prisoners. He was particularly angry in his heart, but at the same time he was very curious. What happened to the military to dare to interrogate him as a prisoner, is there something wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his position, he already knows that the impact of the gap in information is definitely not as simple as a few words. He stares at Mary Lieutenant, Mary. Lieutenant really laughed this time, and laughed very generously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You misunderstood, sir. Because we just came here, didn't focus on the layout of the room, if you think this room is not suitable for you Status, you can go to see another room, or choose one directly, I can guarantee that all the rooms are similar.", these words are very good, explain the reason for "slow down", and gave the door A farmer's ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman showed a stunned look and then stepped into the room. He won't really go to see if other rooms are all three tables and three chairs, which will only make him shameful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the three were seated, Lieutenant Mary took out a few transcripts on the table at the doorman. "Last night we knew that Matthew was Immediately after the assassination, he rushed to the scene and took some evidence and photos..." She pushed Matthew’s photo of her death to the front of the door, the photo taken at the scene of Matthew’s death, Matthew leaning on In the chair, his throat was cut open and he could even see a part of the throat. At the same time, a knife was inserted into the eye socket on his left, which was very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a few photos of Matthew lying on the dissection table. The dagger inserted in his eye socket has been taken out. After the traces are compared, the military thinks that the dagger is the dagger that cuts the throat of Matthew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only evidence we found on the scene was two, one is a very shallow shoe print, and there is a cigarette butt that has been exhausted. There was no obvious discovery." Then Lieutenant Lieutenant took out a certificate from the document. "We then investigated the record of the Telegraph Office. In the five minutes or so before Matthew was killed, he was working with Mr. Doolin. On the call, we also asked Mr. Doolin, who gave a positive answer and told us that Matthew had asked him for some things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to here Some of the strange smiles in Mary, "Mr. Mayor, do you want to know what they said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon frowned and leaned back, hand The elbow was supported on the arm of the chair, his fingers were pinching his chin. He looked at Mary Lieutenant with his eyebrows and hesitated for a moment. "What did they say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What did they say, we will wait a little longer to say it.", Lieutenant Mary directly opened the topic, which made Mennon heart Give birth to faint anxiety, he felt Mary lieutenant or military set to eat their own, allowing him to become more than just a little shortness of breath a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Lieutenant asked again: "According to our understanding and information provided by some witnesses, Mr. Matthew went to your office yesterday morning?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I let him come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary’s lieutenant nodded, "You have happened Quarrel? Or fierce conflict?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon shook his head and said, “No, the atmosphere of our speech has been very good, very peaceful.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So can you tell me why Mr. Matthew has gone all the way while cursing you and Mr. Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The doorman stunned. At that time, he felt that the atmosphere between himself and Matthew was as peaceful as he said, no quarrels, no conflicts, and even a little more intense tone and movement. Why? Matthew will marry himself and bring Du Lin? He quickly reacted. "Because I told Mr. Matthew, Du Lin hopes to solve the dispute between him and the West Mine in two ways. A good, a bad one, maybe Mr. Matthew misunderstood me. Meaning, so I have some dissatisfaction with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers around Lieutenant Mary are quickly making notes, and cameras and tape recorders are running around. The Imperial Cabinet and the Ministry of National Defense are very concerned about the turmoil in the west. It has always been a "lawless land", smuggling, murder, population trade, gang fire, collusion between government and business... the bad things that can be found almost everywhere. Once the turmoil in the west is intensified, the west will quickly enter an "anarchic" state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, it is highly probable that something unacceptable to people will occur under the intervention of external forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war between the Empire and the Federation ended 22 years ago, ending with a war on the bright side, where people can’t see it. The war is still going on. For example, the extremist religious organizations that occurred last year created a horrific suicide incident. One hundred and ninety-four people died from the brainwashing of this extreme religious organization. After taking poison, they shouted on the street that "the end of the empire will soon Come," and then die into a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Military Intelligence and Security Committee investigated the tragedy and found that the top of the extremist religious organization has fled the empire, and found out that behind this organization, there are some The federal consortium has been supporting their activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many similar things. Some foreign consortiums support the extremist organizations in the empire through funds or materials to carry out activities such as destruction, incitement, riots, etc. The empire's calm, creating turmoil. Once there is an uncontrollable turmoil in the west, these external forces will take the opportunity. They may not be able to declare war on the empire positively, but they can achieve the purpose of separatist and even split empire through the means of capital and even human assistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the top empire of the entire empire is very concerned about these things in the West, especially involving almost all the forces in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary grinned. "So what about the afternoon? We have more than one testimony and witnesses here to prove that Mr. Matthew went to you again in the afternoon. The office, when he came out, was ashamed. After he went home, he was assassinated. You think Matthew’s death...”, Mary’s lieutenant smiled. “Is it related to you?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These words you should keep asking Mr. Doolin who is on the phone with him, not me!", Mennon sneered and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our people are also asking about Doolin's related things!", just don't know why, Lieutenant Mary's eyes are a little helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, the military’s people stood in the hospital ward and asked almost similar questions. Their initial plan was to bring Doolin back to the headquarters. There, Du Lin may answer their questions "seriously". But what they didn't think of was that the appearance of a person made them feel nothing at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when they really wanted to do that, a person walked into the room, his name was Thomas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Thomas is not the Colonel Thomas of the past Irian Naval Base, he is now Major General Thomas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old commander felt that he had to wait for two months to wait until the formal adjustments before giving up a bit of greed. It’s better to retire early and fight. Report to the Naval Headquarters. The Navy Headquarters naturally agreed to the application and requirements of the old man, not only to approve the retirement of the old man, but also to allow Colonel Thomas, the "gold medal salesman" in the navy, to pass the threshold that he could not cross for a lifetime and become the navy. Major General. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin called, he came, and at this moment is cutting Apple for Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a "military squad" here to guarantee Du Lin, how can these big soldiers in the Western Army Military District dare to take Du Lin? Unless they want to go to a military court, the charge is to incite the naval opposition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current navy is a piece of rotten meat, stinky black water, has become a tool for the Navy's high-level money. But let's give up, after all, the Haiphong Treaty that has just been signed has not been stripped from people's shallow memory, but it can be said that it will not give up. The performance of the Navy has made the Ministry of Defense also a real headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence no longer allocates funds to the Navy. The Navy has found its own way to collect money. Now that the Navy is the empire’s navy, it is better to say that the Navy is the Navy’s general. The entire naval system is eating the money of the navy generals from top to bottom. It is these people who have saved the entire navy. Of course, no matter how they got the money, the money is not legal. Everyone must admit that it is because of these people that the Navy has not completely dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
