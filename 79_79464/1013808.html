			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come in!", Du Lin sat in a formal position, and all Buddhas let the door open completely, sitting back on one side of the bench. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital environment here is good, of course, more reasons may come from Doolin’s willingness to save money. Seeing the face of money, Du Lin enjoys what ordinary people can’t enjoy. Medical treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major medical groups are a special enterprise that makes a lot of money without making big money. Even the middle and lower levels of society always ignore the annual income of these group companies, only those who come out every day. The stockbrokers at Xie Lisi Street knew the horror of the medical group. Even the worst medical group's stock price is maintained at a high price of more than 20 per year. They do not lack the “dumping” land. Those who are sick have to enter the medical system, no matter what the doctor says. All must believe, and repeatedly remind yourself that as long as you take the medicine, you will be better. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the previous year, a scientist studying biology in the United States published a paper that had not been able to cause a sensation to be killed by some groups. Of course, in order to compensate the scientist for so many years of research is not in vain, the Imperial and federal medical groups raised 10 million to completely buy out the cost of this paper and all the research results of scientists, so that scientists have gone to a prosperous life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what exactly is a paper that can make a medical group so nervous? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the content of this paper is not complicated. The scientist’s research direction is through a series of studies on a series of organisms, including people. Through his six years of observation and experimentation, he has discovered that most organisms have excellent self-healing ability, and some have terrible self-healing ability. In this paper, some examples are given. These are not enough to make the medical group stunned. What really scares them is behind these examples. It also lists a special creature like human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists say that 67% of the diseases known to humans are cured by the body’s own immunity, including some A disease that costs a lot of money. In the case he observes, the concept of a person’s physical condition is infinitely good or strong, so the body’s ability to heal itself and fight against the disease is enough to expel the disease and heal the wound, and Produce an antibody that immunizes the disease the next time it encounters the disease, or reduces the appearance of the disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great thing about this paper is that once the content of the paper is detonated and confirmed, it is the interests of the medical group that are the first to be affected. The medical group warns people everywhere by newspaper or other means every day. If you are sick, you must go to the hospital for treatment, otherwise you will definitely die. This is not to say that this statement is wrong. Of course, if you are sick, you have to go to the hospital. There is no logical or moral problem. The problem lies in some exaggerated diseases that have the same characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is when they break out, it will bring more pain and suffering to people, and it will make people want to end the current bad situation as soon as possible, thus choosing more expensive Medical plan, taking more expensive but actually not very useful drugs. This is also one of the biggest sources of income for the medical group. They only need to pack a few cents of tablets into tablets for a few dollars, and then slowly, after the weak therapeutic effect of the tablets and the self-healing state of the human body being activated. Look at the patient's recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients may be distressed by the money they spend, but they get the improvement they think is equivalent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this paper is published, a few patients who are not so willing to pay for it may buy some cheap pills and wait at home. Days let self-healing immunity complete what it should do. As long as one person does not go to the hospital to complete the process of onset to cure, and soon those patients who are distressed with money will follow suit, which is simply the end of the current medical group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for the rich, the money is not money, but how many rich people in the entire empire are sick every day? How many people are there for the sick poor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These large-scale consumer groups are the real source of income for medical groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a room like Doolin, the cost of a bed every day and all the equipment costs up to fifteen dollars, not including the value of more than thirty dollars a day. The cost of medicines and the cost of care for twenty dollars a day. It seems that the hospital has indeed made a lot of money from him. One patient has provided more than 50 to 60 medical expenses to the members every day, but only two of the senior wards like the entire member are using. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One lived in Doolin, and one lived in a doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cheap ward downstairs has lived for more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason for the good ward environment and facilities, which are all costly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman looked at it casually after he came in, and gave a bunch of flowers in his hand to the Buddha. They all looked at the flowers in their hands for a while. Only after returning to God, he should put these words in a vase. However, there is no such thing in Doolin's ward. He thought about it and then walked into the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I can't come to see you in the first time, you should have heard...", the farmer caress his injured shoulder, "I also After the shooting, these hateful black and evil elements are too mad. When I resume my work, I will clear these people in the first place, and I will settle in the west and give an account to all those who have been hurt!", There is something in his words. The doorman believes that there are many things that Du Lin intervenes. What he said is Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also heard that he didn’t blame what’s rude, but instead of the common force, “Yes, Mr. Mennon, you said very much. Ok, but I think I should add a little more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is there anything to add?", the doorman looked around, no chair, Had to continue to stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem of the official!", Du Lin looked at the doorman with a smile and smiled. "All the chaotic places have the same characteristics, the officials' inaction and Dereliction of duty provides a hotbed for all black and evil forces to let them infinitely breed. If you can't solve the problem of officials, even if you catch all the bad guys, the next bad guys will soon appear. These bad guys are not their own want to get bad, But some people who are worse than them have created such a special environment, forcing them to become the 'bad guys' in people's minds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally wanted to Dooling, I didn't expect to be stunned by Du Lin in turn. The farmer immediately shifted the topic. "Is there any need for me to help? Here is the place where I am familiar and working. If there is a saying, you are Guests, I must help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes turned, not to worry about the inexplicable demonstration of the doorman’s move to him, whispered: “Exactly, I have a trouble, I hope that Mr. Mennon can I solved it." After Mennon nodded, Du Lin said his "encounter" during this time. "Do you know that I bought ten mines from the West Mine? Yes, it is the West Mine. As an intermediary and I signed an agreement, but these mines are all waste mines, they have been excavated, they are not worth a penny. Obviously I was deceived, and it is still an authoritative organization in the west. The behavior, I hope that you can help me get back to justice and give me a fair and just result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mennon didn't want to solve any trouble for Du Lin at the beginning, but when Du Lin touched the topic to the West Mine, the Mennon suddenly stunned. Although he has now got rid of people's stereotypes about the Kadima party, he has further shaken off the influence brought by the bloody dawn, but he has also turned himself into an arrow frame on the full bow. He must do something to be able to reflect his own value, so that the empire's high-level people can truly realize that he is completely different from him in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West Mine will start, obviously a good idea, this empire is only a minority empire, there should not be an organization like the West Mine, they have To counter the official strength, manipulated the mineral trade of the entire western region, and caused great damage to the three western states. If you can take away the West Mine, you can at least prove that his doorkeeper is still in the heart of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of weighing the pros and cons, Mennon nodded and his expression became serious. "I will personally ask this question, I will definitely Give you an answer. No one can violate the law and go unpunished, no one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin grinned and grinned: "Yes, no Man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the doorman left, Du Lin wanted to laugh. He dug a pit, and then someone ran over to ask him, can this pit jump? Will you fall to death when you jump? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Du Lin told him that this pit can jump, not only can not fall below is a good thing, so this person jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman just left, and the Buddha came out with a trash can. The white trash can has a green stroke that looks like a clean feeling, but now the trash can becomes a vase, and the flowers sent by Mennon are inserted inside. "How? Look good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a very serious look at it, "Good-looking!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the farmer was discharged Now, he is all motivated, and Shapke pushed him to the edge of the cliff waiting for him to turn his head, but he jumped directly. It looked like a dead end, but Powell’s call was like saving him. The New Party is willing to accept him. For him, it is the most important and most necessary thing to be realistic. He knows that he is considering whether to quit his position as a leader of the Kadima Party and his identity within the party when necessary. Expressing your loyalty to the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
