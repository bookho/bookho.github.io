			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the intensive outbreak of various problems in the western part of the country, the Tusi church’s party was suspended for two periods, the new city of Villier Long is said to be on the road, and the meeting of the Tushen is about to begin. Notifying Doolin that this news is not because of his temporary restrictions on the freedom of life Angela, nor the gods of the gods, but Henry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry seems to be a bit out of business, but there is definitely a comparison with Kevin in eating, drinking, and playing. After just resolving the misunderstanding, Henry smiled. this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know that the Tudio will hold this meeting, which is said to be the largest gathering of the year, because the last two meetings were not held, so make up for all Congregation, do you want to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Henry’s mysterious expression, Du Lin is also a bit curious about the Tuss, so huge. The unidentified religion of the purpose is hidden in the west, can the empire not know? If the empire knows why it is necessary to indulge the development of the Buddhism, if you don't know what kind of power can keep all the participants in the mouth? We must know that there are always some people in the world who sell their own interests in exchange for their own interests. And Du Lin believes that not every invitee will like the Tushenism, so why do people who hate Tushenism do not inform? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very strange thing. The power of the local gods is huge, and it may be involved in ordinary people, capitalists or government officials. In the future, he will continue to develop his own business in the west, and it will inevitably have to deal with the Tuss. The last time Doolin forgot to ask Henry about the gods of the earth because of too many things, just as he got a head, Du Lin asked by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry’s understanding of the Tuss is very fragmented. There is no specific set of things. In Henry’s description, the Tushenism already exists at least fifty. Over the years, I have not heard of any negative news and deeds until now. Everyone gathers together for a month, eats, drinks, and plays for two or three days, and does not have to bear any expenses. Many people are happy to become the gods of the gods. They don't want any money, they don't ask the church to help them do things, and even allow to believe in multiple religions. This is simply the wonder of the religious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those other religions, such as the Odindin’s Church of Heavenly Lord, the descendants of the old man of God, shouted to clear the infidels every day, Let the gospel of the Lord's glory be filled with humanity. Even the gods believed by the Guarts tell the Guarts to destroy all the false gods and purify the believers of the false gods. Only then can the gods come to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what religion, there is an obvious feature, that is, it is exclusive. Anything that is not mine must be something bad, something wrong. But there is no such thing as the Tushenism. This religion, which is called "the seat of the Mother Earth God", looks like a playground for the rich. It can be played in it without paying any tickets. It can also be more Many powerful people know, is there really such a good thing in this world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obviously impossible, all actions must have a clear purpose, this is Du Lin’s personal feelings of “so many years”. They are able to maintain such a huge consumption, which means they have a much larger source of income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very interested, want to take a look and see what the gods are doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first week of the week in May, and four days after Wednesday, four days later, the meeting of the Tushen will begin, all invitees They must arrive at the meeting place before two in the afternoon. After more than two o'clock, the door will be closed and everyone's entry will be denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Du Lin has arranged for the vast majority of things, he needs to be honest for a while, so that the three days are very, very fast. Every day except sleeping is eating, occasionally turning around and enjoying the happiness of local shopping, there is nothing else to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth morning, Angela was released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is the day of the gods, I am going to see, you go with me.", Du Lin just gave a simple command, just Let Duff take Angela to pick clothes. Although the west is lagging behind in all aspects, there are still many business centers in these “marginal” cities near the south central. The vast number of mine owners in the west have attracted a large number of businessmen to come here to earn more money with their own praiseworthy goods. In the face of not many picking mine owners, they don’t mind spending some money, which makes Vanlier a seat. The city's commercial center is very developed, not even weaker than the developed cities of the East Coast and the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before Angela changed to a very stylish and bold summer tidal suit. The design of the fully open back makes the whole piece of clothing look like a red The handkerchief, torn a corner of the diagonal, while lying on the neck, while lying on the waist. This kind of art does not seem to have any artistic atmosphere, full of decaying vulgar and ugly clothes and a black short skirt that may not be short enough, plus a pair of high shoes, a total of one hundred and seventy, no wonder people It is said that the rich man’s money is good, and the rich woman’s money is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a very ordinary car and follow the guidance of Angela to the place where the gods meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Doolin did this and wanted to bring the person who monitored him to that place, whether they knew that there was a god, this now they know Then, as long as you watch them do nothing, you can guess what the Tusi religion has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the gods organized the party was in the mountains of Yamato, not far from the Wagra Mountains, and belonged to the site of the Tushen. The mountain is about three hours away from Vanlier. After entering the mountains, there is a very wide driveway that rotates to the gathering place halfway up the mountain. Tushen likes to dig holes in the middle of the mountain, according to Angela, she Some of the known altars of the gods are in the mountains, and they are all halfway up the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere to go, when the car slowly drove into the parking lot, coming out of the car, Du Lin looked at the car parked around and felt a little shocked. He didn't know how many cars were parked here. It was a mountain body, and it was full of luxury cars. There should be hundreds of cars. Seeing so many cars, Du Lin looked forward to this gathering of the Tushen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian walked through a corridor under the guidance of a believer, then stepped on an upward conveyor belt and moved about five on the conveyor belt. In a minute or so, I came to a very luxurious front door. The door looks like gold, with some totems he doesn't know on the door panel, and a lot of gems. If this door is really made of gold, the wealth that the gods have is definitely an amazing number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the gold robbers worth 30 million yuan from the bank, and that pile of bricks may only have so many of these half doors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this door, all the moments of the eye are completely different from what you saw on the road before, just like returning from the wild age to the civilized era, luxurious decoration The wide grounds and beautiful decorations make it look like a palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a total of eight areas...", Angela whispered to Dulin about everything here, her expression is a bit complicated, just now When the girl was ready to come back, she was forced to retreat by Angela. She now has a bit of chaos in her mind, especially seeing everything here again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
