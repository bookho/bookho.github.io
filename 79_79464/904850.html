			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving Ornes and Solo, Doolin had a hunch that someone would soon interfere with it. He hadn't waited for a long time, almost thirty minutes, and Harry's phone call came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that Soro went to your side, isn't it?" He did not directly talk about specific things, but adopted such a roundabout In this way, he knows that he is actually not ruling, and he does not want to be too stiff with Du Lin, so he adopts a relatively moderate tone, which is not so aggressive. As a governor, this has been very mild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sat on the chair and ordered a cigarette. He tilted his legs on the table, leaning back slightly, pressing the back of the chair. After some tilt, "If you mean to destroy two people who are building my city, then yes, they are coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence smashed Harry Let's just say that what he originally wanted to say can't be said. He can only scream twice. "You should understand that we should maintain a high degree of consistency in the fight for the northern consortium. This is not because I am embarrassing you. Even Maggs would say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northern aristocrats actually prefer the old party, because many of the old parties themselves are born in the north, in the past For a long time, the northern aristocracy was the most "orthodox" aristocrat of the empire. The southern aristocracy was only a group of guys who had gone the dog, and the discrimination and opposition between the north and the south have always existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northern Nobles believe that the northern talents are true Odins, true empires, and the Southerners’ ancestry has been gualt and other races. The blood is polluted. In addition, the place where the empire is vacated is in the north. Without the northern aristocrats and nomads and those who are snowy, it is impossible to have a vast glory empire. In addition, the emperor sealed many large aristocrats in the north, which further aggravated the confrontation between the North and South nobles, and there was a war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the distance between the South and the Federation and other countries is closer, more new things and international culture are accepted, and ideas are more open and open. With the support of the southern aristocracy and the consortium, the new party has enough enthusiasm and capital to overthrow the decadent royal rule, and the whole empire has entered a new era. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several seniors in the new party have used their own status and status to draw some people from the north to support them, resulting in the new and old parties. The strength between the two is not balanced, which is why the old party in the last general election did not exceed 35 percent of the votes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Harry said that there is nothing wrong with it. Even if Magus is concerned about this matter, he will let Du Lin find a way to find a balance point, not because of some trivial things and the unpleasantness of the northern nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Harry’s rhetoric, Du Lin snorted, “If a person breaks into your home, yell at your home and try to More people come to 'correct' the gap in your choice of furniture, you want to do what he wants, and even more disgusting is that he and the people he called told you to do this to make your home better. Let everyone be more united.", Du Lin played a ash, a smile, "Do you want to thank him and yell at him? Thank you for giving me such an opportunity, even if you have not used them for a penny. Haven't eaten them a grain of wheat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Harry, Mr. Governor, here is the special administrative region of Otis, I hope you can understand this, I I did not do it for myself, but for the city, for this empire. I can actually understand you. When he talked to Magus last time, he inspired me a lot of things that I had not thought of before. You are a nobleman. But I am not, your set is used on me. Not right. If you think that my actions have undermined the New Party’s strategy in the North, you can protest and complain to Magus, this is your power.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But I will never give in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have not let a step in the Great Patriotic War, even if we die, we will not withdraw from the line of defense, so I will not give in, this is the Guar, the governor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin bibibibi said a lot, let Harry be annoyed at the same time Realizing that he, including Magus, and Doolin there is still an invisible gap, and this barrier is called class, invisible class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is a big aristocratic person like them, he will understand that their political foothold is not what a city will look like, but to observe What an empire will look like under different political ideas. For Harry, a city concession is a concession, and the impact of the aristocrats in the north on the old party is definitely more important than the license of a casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hymn consortium can stand on the side of the New Party in a clear-cut manner, then the new party will have a lot more Austrian aid, while the old party will have less help. The difference between a negative is definitely not a star or a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of the invisible class that is the barrier, so that Du Lin's vision is still limited to a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's words made Harry feel a little disgusted with Doolin, a disobedient guy, and disobedience means hard to control. In the heart of Harry, Du Lin has been crossed out from his successor list. What he and Maggs need is an obedient jealousy, a leader who can be left without their opinions, and not an opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So his tone also began to cool down," Doolin, you need to think calmly, when you stand on the entire empire level, you will find you How naive is the current behavior. This is not a problem of grabbing cakes. What we need to discuss is the political trend of a country. You should not go against the trend, otherwise you will overturn the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled innocently. "Mr. Governor, this is where our gap lies. I have my principles and persistence, and you can say higher benefits for you." Unconditional compromise, we are different." After the completion, Du Lin hung up the phone and let the other Harry on the phone look at the receiver that had cut off the signal. He didn't understand. How did Du Lin dare to hang first? His phone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing the courage he got from where? Is it the goddess of Leo in the mythology? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are hundreds of millions of plans, and everyone has turned their faces. Anyway, he has so much money in his hands, he can’t go to the federation, there’s The initial layout has been completed, and he can continue along this line and stand on the side of the federation, which in turn threatens the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as these people have no problems in their minds, they know what to do. Du Lin did not intend to follow the footsteps of the New Party from the beginning, and even less likely to become a new party. A small soldier. This is just a platform for him. He needs to experiment with something that is not available in this era, and then accumulate these as experience and then go back and develop his own route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that big plan is his amulet in the experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang’s phone call, Du Lin also clearly knows that Maggs will call him soon, but he believes that he and Magus The exchange will not be as much anger as Harry’s. Because Magus is more aware of what went wrong in this empire, he also knows what the empire needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry screamed that he was standing on the level of the empire, but he forgot that the empire was facing an unstoppable expansion of capital power, and that all of this could be said to be their new party members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old aristocratic capital group in the North and the emerging aristocratic capital group in the South are more difficult to deal with than pure capitalists, because they have already penetrated this society in the past few hundred years. In all aspects, in order to defeat the capital power of these people, it is necessary to initiate a revolution, but this change is unwilling to see. Just out of the shadow of the war, all levels of society need to recuperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stimulating the economic recovery is the most important thing at present, but it will also bring more benefits to the capitalists while stimulating the economic recovery. Let them become more inflated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s work in Otis is to find ways to curb the unlimited expansion of capital power and return the benefits to the pockets of the lower middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minority possesses the vast majority of wealth itself as an unhealthy manifestation, and now Harry is still unclear about the consequences of his doing so. There is also a speculation in Dooling that perhaps Harry is not the "successor" chosen by Magus. He used to have a strange feeling, but he couldn't tell the truth, but as things happened today, he connected some of the previous clues together to form a complete shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry has a consortium behind it, but there is only one behind Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One and the capitalists and capital forces "same and confusing" and use capital to strengthen their own strength. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another has been trying to curb the expansion and expansion of capital power, the political ideas of the two people are completely different, how could it be possible for Magus to die like a son? The old fox who can come up with political means will regard Harry as his successor? Doesn't everything that he does now become meaningless? He tried to bring the dog chain to the capital. In Harry's hand, he might just let go of all the dog chains and run wild with a group of mad dogs. Why did such people pick up the class of Magus? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, on the level of Magus, at the top of the real tower of the empire, there are some unknown stories! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
