			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A business class must have a name, not to pull up its own grades, or to charge more. Mainly for legalization. After all, Owena brokerage company, including all similar brokerage companies themselves, is not an illegal organization. They strictly do not involve any illegal transactions. They need to pay taxes for all businesses. Tax evasion is illegal. . But it is not illegal to run such a business that Du Lin needs. It is not decent enough. Many companies are reluctant to turn themselves into a company specializing in pimping business. This will not have better development and future. They need to change slightly. a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, many companies tend to have some operating income that is not in the "list". This part of the operating income is not subject to tax return, then the money is illegal income. This is why the General Administration of Taxation has been actively negotiating related business with the two major banks after Du Lin’s idea of ​​invoicing, such as the invoice itself and check settlement information, through which to find those companies that have not filed tax returns or Individuals, then let them know why the General Administration of Taxation was called the first line of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ovina brokerage company and other brokerage companies do not want to go to the blacklist of the Imperial Tax Administration, and do not want to go bankrupt because of huge bills, so they have every business income It needs to be reported to the General Administration of Taxation for tax filing to ensure that there is nothing to resent the company with a resentment mentality. One person turned around and took the company out of tax evasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement that was placed in front of Dooling was to deal with such a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a labor dispatch agreement. Owena Economics sends a group of artists who meet the requirements of Du Lin to participate in the internal activities of the company. How much money, as to whether the artists have done anything they should not do, and have nothing to do with the Owena brokerage company, already clearly stated in the agreement that the artists need to do the work, such as dancing and singing or showcasing what design All things happening outside the agreement have nothing to do with the brokerage company, and the brokerage company has to recover the losses caused by these artists for personal reasons to discredit the image of the brokerage company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How should I pay?" Du Lin did not understand these things, but with his ability to understand, he thought that there was no problem with this agreement. There is no other place that makes him feel inappropriate if there is a problem that pushes all responsibility to the artist and the employer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager of Zi Mao’s manager suddenly became vivid. There are many brokerage companies on Xie Lisi Street. On the one hand, they are doing normal entertainment business, while on the other hand, they are dedicated to the seniors of Xie Lisi Street. Various brokers in the office building. These talents are real rich people. Many people may think that it is best to spend dozens of pieces or one or two hundred pieces to find a skilled woman in the best nightclubs. It is because they have not been there. Here, you are not exposed to this level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brokers often call to book a "show", giving them tens of thousands of dollars, the best resources of the entire empire are concentrated here, In order to serve those who have money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear guests, what are your requirements for the performers?", Zi Mao manager took out a pen and a book, looking charmingly Dooling, if the business is made, he gets more commissions than he pays a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the posters of the youthful and energetic girls on the walls, blurted out without much thought, "Young, beautiful, man To be tall, you must wear high heels, but also cute, do you understand?", Zi Mao manager nodded again and again, this he knows very well, when Du Lin said that young and beautiful is cute, he knows this type of artist too, Du Lin Very satisfied with pointing to him, "very good, I like your attitude. I heard that you still have stars here, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;紫毛The manager stunned, and the one in his heart almost came out of his mouth. This is definitely a big deal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of girls who are dispatched from here use the model as the identity backboard as a publicity, which can increase the value and grade. After all, the Empire fashion circle is so big, even if it is dispatched. It’s no big deal to go out one or two or two. But if you talk about stars, it's really not much. At least these people have to perform a movie, so that people can see this face at the very least. Of course, the grade has increased several times, and the cost has increased several times, not only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, sir, please trust the strength of the Owena brokerage company!" At this time, the manager of the purple hair cheered up and raised his chest. "In this piece we are "The strongest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, I want to...", Doolin’s heart counted a few times. "Nine female stars, preferably the face." The familiar one, there are ten artists, yes, don’t you have a supermodel? Open a price.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager's heart thumped, and he suspected that if he could not relieve his emotions, he would die here because of a heart attack. This is definitely a big order. This year's task is estimated to be completed ahead of schedule, half a year ahead. He asked Du Lin to wait for a moment, then pulled out the basic roster from the shelf that visited the roster and asked Du Lin to pick it. Du Lin was not very familiar with this aspect. He gave the work to the president's nephew. The two men spent a long time in the side, and finally decided the 20 places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, the individual information of these people was selected and read to Du Lin. He looked at them casually and asked again when he looked up again. "How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"80,000!", the purple hair holding the calculator smashed the list of expenses, "Supermodel 12,000 This is the current standard market, your friends selected nine second-line female stars, which is 54,000, and there are ten models, which are 10,000, adding up to 76,000. The extra four thousand pieces contain transportation costs, as well as some arrangements and props. We also have two masters and some props for play, which are one-off. Finally, there are spare people. The cost arrangement includes drivers, chefs and ingredients, as well as six staff who set up the venue, and ten cleaning staff who are responsible for cleaning the site. By the way, we provide ten temporary guarantees for important customers like you for free. Personnel, they will be responsible for the safety of the venue, will not let you take a break I was disturbed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very satisfied, this is attitude, service attitude, all aspects are for the guests and do everything the best Only by having such a service attitude can we do our best. He took out a checkbook and owed a 50,000, a check for 31,000, and placed it on the table. "As soon as possible, it is best to leave with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the extra thousand pieces, the purple hair manager almost bit his tongue, and he nodded and nodded immediately to start to arrange the dispatch, and soon the appearance of the 20 beautiful and messy girls In the garage, four vehicles were seen in the modified van, and follower Du Lin came all the way to the Oak Bay villa area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s license plate number has long been recorded here, and the security of the villa area is not surprising, and it is often seen here. The Oak Bay Villa area, which is the largest and most luxurious of the Emperor's capital, is always the most lively place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to open the door!", Kevin, who heard the sound outside the door, took the initiative to open the door, and then the eyes were coming out quickly, he exclaimed exaggeratedly. "My God, what have I seen? I came to heaven? Why are these everywhere... beautiful angels?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You let go, let me see!", Adams couldn't help but ran over to open Kevin, and then looked at the outside scene and took a sigh of relief. The girls were so beautiful, and there were several Adams. I have seen it on the screen, especially if there is a girl who is particularly tall and looks like one meter eight? Still more than one meter eight is the most eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not the most beautiful one, but she is definitely the best in every aspect, including her temperament. The lawyers of other law firms couldn’t help but come together. After reading it, they felt that they might have died. Otherwise, why can they be in heaven? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and walked over. He had been hugged by Kevin before he could say anything. "How is your leg?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leg?", he glanced at the crutches that had not followed him in the place, and then laughed happily. "Forgot the damn scorpion, Kevin today." It’s a hero, a superhero!” He tapped the shoulders of Doolin twice, and only he and a very small number of people have this power. “I like your surprise, you are the one who knows me the most!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linyi’s laugh, “Superhero? No, I think you might become an indefatigable public servant during the delivery period!” He looked at Adams Wait, "Well, guys, pack yourself, then start the carnival!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Do you need to arrange in the villa?" The young man at the scene asked, he has been doing this for many years, his name is Matthew, the ideal is to be a star, although now The work is not his favorite, but he felt he was not quite off only to become a star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said with a nod. "Of course, according to your best plan, the other is not a problem..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the group of "boys" came out of the villa, the yard was already set up, including the colorful lights on the side of the pool. It was like... no, it was a At the scene of the large party, Kevin took for granted the supermodel that was about half a head taller than him. He was full of peace and harmony. At this time, Doolin took a suitcase and walked to the table in the middle of the yard, and put the suitcase on the table to open it, revealing a brand new inside. A banknote of 50 yuan denomination, "Girls, let your male partner have a night that cannot be forgotten, this money is yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
