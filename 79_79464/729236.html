""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kent is just a driver, he is not a captain, so most of the time he is the one who obeys the order. It is obvious that the captain in the carriage did not want any explanation about the bumps. This is not the first time the road is covered with stones, but this time the stones are denser and larger than before, and the road conditions are not very good. . According to the Code of Practice of the Imperial Central Bank, the escort car is absolutely not allowed to stop in the process of arriving at the destination after leaving the bank garage. It’s just that the rules are so, not everyone will follow the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kent was very obedient to slow down the speed and found a relatively quiet and stable terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he violated the rules, he was also a bit timid, but gradually getting used to it, the long-distance road must be excreted or rested, two days away It is impossible to finish running in a short time, and it is inevitable that there will be several stops on the way, and it will become numb over time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escort car slowly stopped at the side of the road, the car was opened from the inside out, and the four escorts did not follow the requirements of the rules and regulations. Wearing bulletproof vests, they took off their heavy equipment and ran out of the compartment wearing underwear. In the past seven years, no one dared to rob the ruling car of the Imperial Central Bank, which also caused them to slack off. The weather was a bit cold. One person was responsible for cleaning up the water stains in the carriage. The other three went out of the car and ran outside the car. They took out the little brothers and excreted them happily towards the roadside grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked about interesting things to each other, and did not notice that in this wilderness, there were people who should not have appeared here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first second of the gunshot sounded, Kent launched the escort. He did have a lot of violations of the escort rules, but that doesn’t mean he put the manual on it. All the requirements have been forgotten. The first priority in the escort workbook is to ensure the safety of money and valuables transported inside the train. In the event of an emergency, the vehicle cannot be parked anyway and the speed cannot be slowed down. At the same time as the car started, the guy who cleaned the water stains in the compartment closed the compartment door for the first time. As for the results of the outsiders, it was not in his consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the atrocities of the robbers can save the money and valuables of the car, he will definitely be rewarded after returning, and the family members of those outside will receive a large pension. Moreover, the gunshots sounded, and those colleagues who did not even wear bulletproof vests must have lost their jobs. He did not need to delay the valuable time of closing the compartment doors for some dead people. The guns rang in succession. Kent was sweating. He put the helmet on the steering wheel and buckled the bulletproof vest. The guy in the carriage was similar. He panicked all the equipment and put it on the tight end. The rifle was sitting in the carriage and shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way not to be afraid, the robbers who dare to rob the Imperial Central Bank are absolutely impossible to leave any living, this two people in the car are clearer than anyone else. As the largest bank in the empire, any behavior that harms the interests of banks means pairing with the largest financial group in the empire. It is a challenge to the largest economy of the empire. Even the ruling party may not be able to resist the offensive from the Imperial Central Bank. . In order to ensure safety, the robbers will avoid accidental leakage. The killing is undoubtedly the best choice. The only hope for the two people in the car is to be able to travel to the next city smoothly and safely. In the city, not only the police, but also the gendarmerie, the garrison and the bank's own security system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them, three former colleagues who were still alive fell to the ground, and the expression on their faces was fixed in the one they returned to the embrace of God. moment. Ellis scratched his head and dragged them into the grass three times to cover up the harvested hay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, not only is he alone on this road, no one knows where these people will get off the bus, the madman in the prison does not know, he Straight to say two possibilities. The first possibility is to leave the city shortly after, because these people must strictly follow the time specified by the bank every day, starting from the first cup of milk in the morning and about an hour and a half after they leave the city. One and a half hours is enough for the body to analyze the moisture to store excess impurities and excess water in the bladder. Together with the escort's subconscious mind on the need to excrete as little as possible during the escort, they may be in two hours to two and a half hours. Next time the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a possibility that they have already excreted before the escort, so the place to be prepared should be around four hours by car, probably close to noon. When they need to dine, they also solve these excretion problems. So here only Ellis is alone, everyone else is arranged in the back. It’s a bit risky to be alone here, but Doolin believes that once an “accident” occurs, the drivers and escorts on the escort will definitely think they have been “ambushed”, and the road is not very wide, it takes more time to turn around. And space, so they will move forward in the first time, so here only Ellis is alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter wilderness was very cold, and Ellis glanced at the three bodies hidden by him. After driving from a hidden slope, he drove down the road and chased it. He doesn't need to deal with the bodies deliberately. The coyotes and some scavengers and insects living in the wilderness will help him solve this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Kent has been driving from the incident for almost ten minutes, about six or seven kilometers, his heartbeat has not been calm, and the hand holding the steering wheel is also Violent shaking. The transparent mask on the helmet was a little fuzzy under his breath. He had to open the mask. At this time, a faint gunshot sounded and the front windshield of the truck was covered with cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of the escort car obviously took into account a lot of things that might happen. He pressed a button under the steering wheel, and the cracked glass smashed into pieces. The block slides out of the hood along the gap between the two ends of the barbed wire. Before he could see the road ahead, the two homemade burning bottles with the lights were lost. Inferior glass bottles are not as strong as those filled with wine, and the power of collision is almost instantaneous. The flames that burned in an instant burst into the cab through the wire mesh and ignited the entire cab. Even if there were bulletproof vests facing such a dense fire, there was no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kent screamed and smacked the flame on his face and body. He opened the lock of the safety lock with one hand and pushed the door open directly from the cab. Go out and roll on the ground. The unmanned escort car was completely out of control in the direction of less than 20 meters on the road covered with large and small stones. One rolled to the ditch on the side of the road, rolled for two turns and then dumped on the ground. He also continually tumbling in the wilderness to extinguish the flames on his body. The cold winter can not be used to make the soil full of water like other seasons can be extinguished by tumbling, but some dry grass is ignited, and the fire will soon A certain scale, even the screams have been suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that Kent doesn’t want to call, but that he’s a mouthful of flames as if he’s going to drill into his throat. He can only make some meaningless sounds and slowly fall down. on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame and the smoke column attracted the attention of Ellis and Doolin and Dufo, and the two groups arrived at the scene one after the other, and they all took pictures. After taking Savi’s head, a group of people gathered outside the escort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin knocked on the door of the carriage, and the dull voice silently told everyone how thick and solid the carriage was. When the door was knocked for the second time, a dull response came from the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is outside?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound line has been somewhat distorted through the layers of the car, but does not prevent people outside the car from clearly feeling the trembling sound line. Hidden fear in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have two choices, open the carriage, we take what belongs to us, you take your precious life. The second choice, we will I will get a fire around the car, and after you have cooked it, I will drag the car away. I believe that as long as it is made by someone, there must be a way to open it. My patience is not very good, leaving you with little time for selection. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The looting of the Imperial Bank of the Imperial Bank is only the first step of Doolin’s revenge, and he needs to get back the money that belongs to him. He put almost 70% of the funds in the account of the Imperial Central Bank, but after his accident, these treacherous bankers used him directly to store "criminal funds" on the grounds that Du Lin was "investigated". The account is directly frozen. Ok, this is fine. The problem is that after he was released from prison, the Imperial Central Bank still did not unfreeze his account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe someone has greeted the bank to do so, or it may be that the head of the bank in the Tener area wants to greedy the Du Lin bank account that is close to ten Ten thousand savings. This is definitely not a small sum of money, even for a bank owner, this is an amazing number. Regardless of the reason for the other party, in short, they have blacked out Doolin’s money, then they have to pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escort in the carriage quickly decided between the possibility of being dead and being absolutely cooked. He opened the carriage and wore only a pair of shorts. Holding his hands and squatting, he moved out to show that he was harmless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddhas took him aside, and members of Airlis and other fellowships rushed in to move the two boxes out and throw them in the car. After that, he quickly left, and there were only Du Lin, Dudu, Savi, and the escort who shivered because of fear or cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do with you?", Doolin shrugged his shoulders. "I am a talker, I said if you open the compartment." I will let you go when I come out, but you should know that I will obviously leave a curse when I do this. What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy’s legs are soft and sly On the ground, his upper and lower teeth slammed against each other. "I swear, I will never say anything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
