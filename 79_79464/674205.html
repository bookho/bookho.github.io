			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will give you what is yours. I will not give you, you can't reach out!", speaking, Du Lin will press under the palm of his hand The two hundred pieces pushed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyelids, Dalley’s grinning grin was already a little wet, and for this reason, the smile was sprayed with some droplets. He happily held a stack of banknotes in his hand, just like holding the most precious treasure in his life, and then properly put it into his pocket, and he did not feel patted. Then he sat down honestly and straightened his waist, desperately trying to make a very serious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head, perhaps because of Deir's sissy look, so the big men were calmly letting their wives go to the art gallery. Join a tea party. But it also gives those women a chance to completely release themselves. His finger clicked on the table, the sound may not be loud, but it was a bit dull, but it was enough for Delier to concentrate on what Dulin would say next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Vivian and other husbands do what they do every day, say what makes you feel excited, record it for me. You can rest assured, even Vivienne The lady knows that this will not cause any dissatisfaction with you. I have had contacts with Mrs. Vivian and established a relationship with friends. For this, I will give you two hundred pieces a week, if you can tell me Some news that I am interested in, there are other bonuses." Du Lin always believes that money has an unparalleled status in this society. No one can easily refuse money. If there is, it can only explain the money that tempts him. Not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delier thought about it and accepted it happily. Eight hundred dollars a week was not a small number for him. Not only does the money allow him to continue to look forward to more high-end art, but he also has extra money to keep his skin and hair and spa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded hard, indicating that he had picked up the task, there was no danger, and there was a lot of money to take, why not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stretched out his index finger and swayed. After a moment, he looked up and looked at De Lier, smiling. "You can leave now." Remember your mission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier was thinking about one thing when he left, the original meaning of being able to leave by shaking his finger, he still The first time I knew that he had to remember this little action and its meaning firmly, this is also the harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivian’s desire to engage in a feminist movement is actually a suggestion that Du Lin gave her. From a system perspective, the feminist movement clearly has a fierce conflict with the values ​​of the old party. In the feudal monarchy, women are just men's companionships, like a pair of collars or a pair of cufflinks. In addition to the beauty, body, origin and education to make men's charm and success, there is not much use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, sorry, breeding the next generation is one of the main jobs of women in the old society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of feminist independence and movement is to break the shackles and labels imposed on women by past society. At this stage, maybe the big men are only doing this as women. Bored to the extreme game. But when women think they have gained independence and have a certain social status, women who are full of enthusiasm will inevitably pursue higher goals - political power. Think about it, it has always been seen by these old party elites that women suddenly stand up and overthrow their understanding of this society, overturning their three views, and even can be said to be against their political program. What a serious one What? Coupled with the help of Doolin in the back, those decent big men will definitely have a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, they still have no way to slap these women because they have their wives, their daughters, and even theirs. mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use persuasion to stop this group of women who have gone crazy for "realizing their own life value"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe some people may stop in time, but Mrs. Vivienne will not. As long as she does not stop, the fire will burn more and more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at this time the mayor wants to get married with Mrs. Vivian, it’s impossible, because Mrs. Vivian has suffered two injuries. She will not be stupid enough to be hurt again. In a brief conversation with Doolin, Mrs. Vivian has clearly understood that in this real and realistic world, only when you hold something that others are craving, others will bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a problem between men and women, it’s a political issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor of the city soon discovers that there is finally a group of uncontrolled people in the city who are doing something uncontrollable, most The fate is that he is likely to be black-faced for these people and these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't long before De Lier had just left, but he had pushed his face in a gloomy face. Maybe he waited outside for a while. Du Lin’s original relaxed mood also became dignified after seeing the ugly face of the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha is a very cheerful person, even if he faces a reward from the mayor, he has not revealed such an expression, which means what must have happened Things are getting him, let Du Lin, let their careers encounter a crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha did not sit too politely across the opposite of Du Lin. He closed his mouth and thought for a while before saying: "We sent to Guri. The team was robbed, ten people died, all the goods were robbed, and the car was lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the current Tener City private liquor giant The cooperation agreement, every five days, they go back to the surrounding cities to smuggle a batch of high-alcohol. Each company provides goods and accompanying persons in proportion to the share of shares. Guri is located in the northeast of Tener, about a hundred kilometers away from here. It can be transported by truck in just over three hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guri has no clear camp and is the object of competition between the old party and the new party. In this city, the mayor is a new party, but the following department heads are 70% of the old party. These old parties, with the old party members as the core, are working with the mayor of the new party to wage a life struggle. The high-level environment is chaotic, and the underlying social environment is also changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the formal business philosophy, such a chaotic market is very unfriendly to the involvement of capital, because no one can guarantee that legitimate businessmen are in such confusion. The normal operation of the environment continues. But in fact, merchants like the chaotic social environment, and only in such a chaotic social environment can the role of money be above power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s private wines are very popular here, and it took only two weeks to basically defeat the local private liquor distribution from top to bottom. Business. In the face of these foreign products with moderate quality and excellent quality, local private liquor merchants can not organize effective defense measures to deal with the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has been guarding against the possible dog jumps of these private drinkers, so he has already sent escorts. Every five days, there will be two trucks full of boxed “living materials” to go to Guri. In addition to the two drivers, Du Lin also arranged a total of 12 escorts. Six of these people are from Doolin here, four are from Ernst, and the rest are from Karur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to some sharp knives, these people are equipped with two pistols. Even so, ten people could be killed, indicating that the other party not only figured out the route of transportation and the situation of the escorts, but also how many weapons they had. If it weren’t for the group of stupid smugglers who couldn’t do business, they suddenly had the wisdom, then it’s very likely that the information was flowed from within. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two goods, worth about 30,000 yuan, the loss of money is a small matter, the dead ten people are the big trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much has our person lost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two dead!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Durlin suddenly took a sip of cold, this is really troublesome! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble comes not only from the outside but also from the inside. Du Lin sent six people, plus Ernst and Karur's people and drivers, a total of fourteen people. If Dooling’s calculations are not wrong, all who survive are his people. It is reasonable to say that this is a good thing, but sometimes good things can become bad things. He can't explain to the fact that the goods were looted with Ernst and Karur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the people who survived are his people, Ernst and Karur are likely to suspect that Du Lin has swallowed the goods and killed them. Those who died of them created an illusion of being robbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a small amount of money, and the other two of the 30,000 yuan are split in half. In this city that has already felt backward, you don't need to pay too much. You can find a person who dares to do anything for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there is no way to solve this problem well, there will be cracks between the Big Three and even a real battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell who is moving?", thinking of it, Doolin’s eyes have become more and more, "For example, their accent, they The way to call a companion, the vehicles they use and the weapons they use, are there any clues that may become a murderer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Doolin Next, Dudu slowly shook his head. "The other party's technique is very professional. The whole process has not said anything. Before that, they must have done a complete plan and practiced more than once. The speed is very fast, the cooperation is very good. Ok, there are seven or eight pistols, about ten people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
