			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, the sun shines through the clear glass window, and the quiet room exudes a feeling that Du Lin has never experienced before. People are calm, and there is a hint of peace in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen many girls who have a strong desire to express themselves in the process of contact, they are always very active and full of Passion, becoming wild, also escalated the battle into a tough battle. Perhaps for most young people, such a fierce night is the perfect interpretation of young people, but these things may not be suitable for everyone, and not everyone likes this night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya is a different woman, Du Lin stretched out her hand and touched her hair. The gentle and watery process last night made him very enjoyable. . If the other girls are a volcano erupting, they want to burn everything with enthusiasm and destroy the barrier of reason. Then, Natiya is a small river, there is no trace of turbulence, but quietness can make people feel a kind of warmth, and even this warmth finally evolves toward the great word of "love". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't need to express herself through wild movements, passionate shouts, and the kind of tranquility is a little addictive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a gentle woman, gentle like water, hot spring water. Inclusive of you, make you warm, but not intense, like a whisper in the ear of the woods in the autumn, making people heart-thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opposite direction, Natiya first blushes, she glances at the time, turns over and does it. "I am going to have some breakfast, you will rest." For a moment." She slammed her heart and said this sentence. After she left Du Lin last night, she knew what would happen, but she did not refuse. During this time with Du Lin, she was deeply attracted to Du Lin, a young and mature young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can give Natiya a sense of security that she has never felt before, and occasionally she can’t help but feel the little flirtation that makes her enjoy it. It’s not a kind of The blunt thing, very soft, unconsciously touched her equally soft heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has passed the young and crazy years, and now for her age woman, a calm life is the perfect pursuit, she enjoys the present Work, and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is not a reward, nor a regret, so it happens naturally, just a desire, a human being's most primitive impulse to a good yearning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Natiya left, Du Lin moved around for a while, and the naked body stood at the window and pushed open the window, letting the fresh air out into the room. He ordered a cigarette, the quiet community did not have any noise, the verdant vegetation covered most of the sights, and occasionally there were several birds hovering in the distant canopy, which made the time seem to be at this moment. It’s slow to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cigarette smoked in half, Natiya came back, she said a little shyly, "Melissa has already done it early, you want now Going to eat a little?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smashed the cigarette in the ashtray at hand and turned to the sofa. "Why not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than 30 minutes, the two went downstairs. Melissa was a little bored and was playing with her hair. She knew what happened last night because she was Inadvertently, when she went to the bathroom, she passed the master bedroom. She didn't feel that there was anything about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt is not a man for Natiya, this is more clear to Melissa than Natiya. Natiya spends most of her time working outside or on a business trip. On the contrary, Melissa is often at home. She knows more about Walter than Natiya. She knows what kind of man it is. Just obeying the fact that Walter has been taking care of her for many years, and as a daughter, she embraces her father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until she was on the bed belonging to Walt and Natiya’s bedroom, she saw Walter and another young woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all hate and disgust break out, young girls don’t hide their thoughts like a long-time old man, young people’s dislike performance It is more intuitive and expressive, and they will not enlighten themselves until they have resolved their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Melissa’s heart still has a hint of revenge, and of course she will not show it. She still understands this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been waiting for a few hours, this is our lunch." She complained, of course she didn't know what happened just now, why? Wait for more than half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natiya smiled and didn't talk. Du Lin asked with a joke. "Is it so long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa gave him a glance She started eating breakfast. She didn't mind that Du Lin appeared here, but it didn't mean she was willing to accept a sudden increase in the family. There won't be too much resentment against Doolin, but there won't be any feelings at all, especially if she feels she is evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast is very simple, breakfast bag with fried eggs, smoked ham slices and some vegetable leaves, served with a glass of milk is almost the standard for middle class breakfast. Unlike those who need to pay a high degree of repetition and heavy physical strength in exchange for a meager salary, they need a lot of protein and amino acids at breakfast to ensure a full day of energy and physical strength. The middle class has no physical work, so they pay more attention to balance. And style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more stylish than using milk in the morning to paste a bit on the mouth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a few days to start school, do you need me to send you?", food is not a word, it is a similar religion in Doolin's dream. One of the connotations of culture, there are actually some similar requirements in this world, especially some aristocratic families who obey the rules, also require that they should not talk as much as possible while eating, and women are even deprived of the power to speak during meals. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the male aristocrats can say a few words while the aristocrats are dining, and the women are constantly holding a smile, not because they don’t talk, but the so-called etiquette. Allow them to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not all meals are like this, such as a warm meal for ordinary families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa put down half of the milk cup, sticking her tongue and rubbing her lips. "No, I will take the train with my classmates." I will come back later on the weekend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin heard that he couldn’t help but want to interrupt, when he sent Freena to the Royal College to go to school. All are accommodation, except for the one-month holiday every month, the other time is in the school, why is it different when it comes to Melissa? Is it not enough money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked this question, but the answer made him feel a bit strange, not that the money was not given, but Melissa’s study was very good. Originally under Du Lin's arrangement, she was going to special classes, but all students, whether aristocrats or special classes, had a simple test after entering school to determine which class they were assigned to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a special class, there will be some differences, because there are always some students with special skills who really want to learn, instead of coming over to a mixed diploma, which needs to be identified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa relies on the highest scores, so she is assigned to a formal class, with one day off every week, the last week of each month is Two days of vacation, so that there are five days in a month, you don't need to take classes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you only want to rent a house for five days... It’s not that Natiya can’t afford it, just that it’s not necessary, now the money in her hands Still not plentiful, she did not sell the house in Steri, and chose to keep it. This will make her pay a heavy home loan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she still owes a lot of money to Doolin. Originally, Doolin meant that the money would not be replaced. It would be a natural excuse for other women to agree. Come down. But Natiya is a very independent woman. She refused Doolin's request and strongly believed that she should bear all the expenses, including Du Lin's 90,000 debts for Walter. She also made an owe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, emphasizing that money is meaningless to yourself does not require Natiya to return the debt, that is the insult to Natiya personality, so Du Lin was happy to accept it, and promised to wait for her hand to be a little bit. Different people should be treated differently and with the necessary respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this Du Lin smiled, he made a suggestion, "I don't want to use the villa in Oak Bay for a while, let's make Melissa weekend. When you go there to rest, and in the Imperial City, you don't need to go back and forth, and it's very convenient to study and live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal makes Natiya a little heart, This is not a gift or alms, she is hesitating, and the girl is excited at once. She stayed there for a while, knowing that it was a very upscale neighborhood. The decor of the villa was also very luxurious and exquisite. If you can bring your classmates to play there on weekends, it is definitely an enviable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, she looked at Natiya with a look of hope and prayer, holding her hands in her arms and looking pitiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya looked at her daughter and looked at Doolin again. Finally, she agreed. "Okay, but you have to know that it is Doolin." Mr.’s place does not allow you to bring some very active classmates to party without our knowledge.” She said that she thought about it and added, “The car in the garage is not open, those are coming to you. It is too dangerous to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
