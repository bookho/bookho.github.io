			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the problems that are currently faced, Julio has discovered other issues that are more intimate than the official and capitalists of the southern cities. The capitalist seems to have a little attitude towards the official... cold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s cold. In yesterday's conversation, Julio more than once thrown these questions raised by Doolin as a topic, and asked the capitalists present to solve how. If it is in a developed city in the south, there will definitely be a lot of capitalists standing up and saying that they are willing to take on these problems and give a solution as soon as possible. The cooperation between the city hall and the capitalists is almost semi-open, and the capitalists are happy to help the city hall to solve these problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of the City Hall, there is no need to use a penny of public funds to solve many problems, especially medical problems and basic protection of citizens’ lives. It is the most profitable two areas, but it is also the two areas with the most investment. It is likely that Medicare may invest millions or even millions of dollars, and there will be subsequent uninterrupted investment. People say that the medical group recognizes money and does not recognize people, but ignores the input and cost and the cost of maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new hospital has been in use since its inception, and it will take about three years, or even longer, to start earning money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the merchant’s point of view, the project investment that is going to be carried out is endorsed by the City Hall. In addition to ensuring the safety of the project, the Imperial Bank is also happy. Grant loans to such projects. Compared with the somewhat rigid businessmen in the north and the middle of the empire, merchants in the South are more inclined to invest in capital. In layman's terms, merchants in the North will come up with real money to do things. Why do you do this is actually caused by many reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have aristocratic background, there is money at home, there is no need to find someone to borrow money to do business, their self-respect and pride do not allow them Opening the word "borrowing" to others will hurt their self-esteem. The same is true for those officials. Their rigorous and careful attitude will never accept any risky investment. Even if a project can't be done, it will never let the project risk it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the environment in the South is different, merchants are more inclined to the game of capital, and the example of not doing things well is to inspire all businessmen’s dreams of making money. It also provides a very complete template for these businessmen. With the endorsement of the government, the merchants can borrow a large amount of funds from the Imperial Bank or the Southern Commercial Bank with a contract of intent signed by the City Hall, use these funds to develop the project, and finally return the loan after the profit, which is The favorite way for southern businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the least amount of capital, the biggest project, this is the means of the capitalists in the South, which is why Henry told Du Lin that the merchants in the South are the liar. Because this group of Southerners always think about how to do things without spending money or spending less, it will inevitably make Henry, who lacks social care, feel that he has been deceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julio is somewhat puzzled by the collective indifference of Western merchants. As long as anyone proposes a solution that seems to work, he is willing to nod. People come to do it. The problem is that no one shows positive desires, are they not interested in these things, or are they keeping them silent? Julio thinks that the biggest possibility is the latter. He is an outsider. He has been here for less than a week. No one knows which step he can take, and naturally he will not blindly bet on himself. He also maintains the mentality of running a city in the South, but ignores the very different economic ecology of the South and the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires a process, a long process, and only after a complete understanding of the economic ecology of the West, Julio can understand how badly he is now. Of course, before doing these things, he must first settle the other thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the blinds and looking at the cowboys and miners carrying the shotgun outside the city hall, Julio felt that his egg had a faint sorrow, a little pain . The desolateness of the west and the predators in the wild make it possible for almost everyone in the family to have shotguns, which is specifically permitted by the state government. Village towns outside small cities like Tenell also allow the formation of militia and the possession of shotguns in order to protect people's lives and ... property security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse thief is also a predator, so it is not a strange thing to have a shotgun in a family in the west. But when the group of people were carrying guns to demonstrate outside the city hall, Julio could not calm down. He had never seen such a violent citizen. Do people not say that the western folk customs are simple? Why does the simplicity he sees and his understanding of simplicity seem different? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people all started because of the death of the doorman and the fact that the Kadima Party was arrested as a fuse. The three-guarantee policy has become a spur of some people. No one will continue to be responsible for them when they are "completed", and no one can ensure that the three-guarantee policy they have purchased can continue. This seriously hurts the feelings of the westerners, undermines the Westerners’ trust in the government and the implementation of the policy, so there must always be people responsible for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This responsibility did not belong to Julio. The death of the Mennon was an "accident". The members of the Kadima organization were killed and arrested. It has nothing to do with Julio. It is the collective annihilation of the three western states. It can be said that From beginning to end, nothing has anything to do with Julio, but he has become the first person to face this matter. Someone said in private that the reason why the doorman was finished was because he blocked the road of Julio. Who had the most benefits after the death of the doorman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, of course Julio, did not see that Julio has become the mayor of the city of Villier, sitting under his ass But the chair that the Mennon used to sit before, don’t ask him to trouble who to find trouble? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the encouragement of such rumors, some westerners who felt that they had been deceived and treated badly came to the city hall with their shotguns. They Need a statement, an arrangement. It’s impossible to inexplicably lose a lot of rights and not even say a word. As the biggest beneficiary, Julio always wants to say something? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are really stupid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is not that there are some idiots and idiots, but there are still many smart people. The bad influences and consequences caused by the ups and downs are impossible for them to be carried by ordinary people. Throughout history, no one who has been ruthless for political events is an ordinary civilian, even if there is, under the influence of some special forces. They have also become special people with "political influence." But more, the politician who is justified is still carrying this pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julio didn’t believe that the Westerners would be so arrogant at first, until he had an arrow in his knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should find a solution to solve this problem as soon as possible, I don't want these impulsive git to continue to appear outside the city hall...", Julio loosened Fingers, sitting or standing in his office, five people, all of whom are his private team, or called a decision-making group. This small group is very common in the South. Whether it is a businessman or a government official, they are used to hiring some smart people to form a group to analyze problems to help them improve their work efficiency. It is said that Magus also has a private similar small group, which is called a think tank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man standing next to the wall with a glass of wine is the first to speak. He is a social elite graduated from the Economics Department of Southern Business University and is employed by Julio in his The decision-making team served and provided some necessary economic assistance. "Boss, I flipped through some of the files left by Mr. Mennon. In this area, I found that nearly 2.2 million people in the entire western region purchased three hundred and seven. 100,000 copies of various types of insurance, and paid for these insurances for between 48 months and 77 months, the total amount of more than 80 million yuan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“There are about 60 million yuan invested in the construction of 13 cities, the largest of which is spent on land replacement and construction of commercial centers. There are also more than 23.5 million for other uses, including nine More than one million in the CCP’s imperial central bank account, the account has been frozen, and the remaining 10 million have no specific documents to prove the flow of these funds, but they have disappeared.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, even if those people lower their demands, they can quell the problem by returning the money they paid. You, the City Hall, including the state government, are not capable of taking out the appointment at one time. One hundred million of funds are used to return all Western citizens who participate in the three-guarantee policy. So if you want to say that the refund will suspend the three-guarantee policy, you will not be able to pay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Julio suddenly felt a pain in his head, the egg did not hurt, but the headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred million funds? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can he get a million yuan of money, even if he sells it, he can sell millions or tens of millions of dollars, the muscles in his eyes Uncontrolled, I took two shots and looked at several other people. "Gentlemen, then how should we face the next disaster? Money, we certainly don't have it, even if the cabinet agrees, it is impossible to allocate one hundred million. The funds are used to calm the anger of the citizens, and we are afraid that we can get less than 20 million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a 30-year-old dressed in formalwear The young people in the deputy social elite smiled. "Mr. Julio, in fact, we should think differently, the doormen can maintain the three guarantees policy, then why can't we maintain it? According to the data just now About 10 million or so, we can continue to maintain the three-guarantee policy without problems, and we can get more profits from each year to develop the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Julio nodded and nodded," It is indeed a solution, but it is also the most unsuitable method. The foundation of the three-guarantee policy is based on the basis of no fraud, we know that Mr. Mennon has just been defrauded of more than two million insurance before being assassinated. The three-guarantee policy is not familiar, and the personal information of each citizen participating in the three-guarantee policy is not well understood, and there are many capitalists involved in it, which is full of various risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We may need to form a large organization to complete the handover of these things. Mr. Mennon is able to play the policy of three guarantees because he is the leader of the Kadima Party. There are people in the entire west, and each city has a Kadima party. So they have a large enough organization to do these things, but we don't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we want to do the same level as Mr. Mennon, the first thing to solve is the person who works, and then I have to talk to the capitalist and find ways to get the money rolling!"<br /><br />&nbsp "Mr., this is not an easy task, because we have been 'deficient' for about 75 million. If we can't find the money, we can't get the funds that the Kadima party was frozen. , then we are very likely to be a victim!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Julio is most worried about someone pushing behind these people to engage in trouble, if not his men tell him The Mennon drew nearly 100 million yuan from the west. He didn't even know that there was such a big pit here, a pit enough to be called the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if only one million people request a refund, it’s enough to make Julio helpless. He doesn’t have the money to run these things. He doesn’t have a farmer. The foundation, not so many people are willing to do things for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julio’s legal counsel thought and said, “The only way now is to ask the state legislature and the cabinet to challenge the three guarantees policy and ask the state government And the cabinet formed a investigation team to in-depth investigation into the three-guarantee policy bill passed in the state legislature, whether some members involved in the crime of duty. My personal opinion is that some people will receive the benefits, will let this bill pass, just find With the evidence, we can propose to abolish the application and review of this bill, and then push all the blame to Mr. Mennon and the Kadima."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what about those citizens who have suffered losses?" Julio is very heart-felt. He knows the lawyer's meaning. Anyway, he refuses to accept the bill. If he does, he will demand that the western military region suppress the riots. The consequence of this is that he does not need to take any responsibility for the three-guarantee policy, although there may be some stains on his resume, which is less important than the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal counsel smiled slightly. "Of course, they are provided with legal aid to let them sue the Kadima and Mr. Mennon. As for whether they can recover the money. How much can be recovered, that is another thing." In order to let Julio and other small partners understand his feasibility in doing so, he also gave an example, "The big scam happened in a few cases." Years ago, a group of people used some of the most common means to escape more than 70 million yuan from Xie Lisi Street to escape the empire. So far, there has been no crime, not to mention the main criminal, and even the funds have not been recovered." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
