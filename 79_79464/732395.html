			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, please help me with a savings account!", Du Lin smiled for a suit and sat in a deck, Imperial Central Banks are not the only banks in the empire. There are other banks in developed regions, such as the “Guangguang Bank” run by the old party and the “modern bank” run by the New Party, as well as chambers of commerce and other social organizations and large economies. Various types of banks opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to highlight the difference and richness of the Imperial Central Bank, there is no row of counters in the lobby of the Central Bank, only a row of decks. This type of deck is also different from the small bar in the outside or the deck in the night. Each one is a return structure. There is a set of sofas and a desk. The screen is blocked by the screen and all the furnishings. They are very high-end and full of luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone once joked about it, if you don’t have the money to go to the Central Bank to steal a set of sofas, you can change a lot of money, so you can see the central The bank’s discouragement and inexplicable self-esteem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Du Lin is a young girl who looks like only 18 or 9 years old, and looks sweet and beautiful. The central bank has very strict standards for the reception staff of the bank. If you do not complete the designated loan or loan business if you are over twenty-four years old, if you score too low, you will face unemployment or transfer to the logistics support department. Strict standards and strict implementation make every guest who comes to the Central Bank feel the feeling of a spring breeze on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl nodded, took a few documents from the desk and walked to the edge of the sofa, sitting next to Du Lin. The perfume on her body is not strong, and it smells like a kind of fragrance. It should be something of a higher grade. She placed the documents on the coffee table in turn, which explained the rights and obligations of the depositors and a lot of related terms. In fact, not many depositors will seriously look at these terms. First, the limitation of cultural knowledge makes many people very unfamiliar with the legal provisions. Second, most people think that as long as the bank passbook is in their own hands, it will not come out. What an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of this loophole that every major bank can change the money in some accounts into its own property according to the terms and conditions. For example, in Article 37, if the depositor does not specify the heir in writing and is approved by the bank, once the funds in the depositor's death account are transferred to the bank as an unowned fund, the account is specially handled for such events, and The original account is cancelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the savings of a family's struggle for a lifetime will be lost because of an accident. Even if a lawyer is employed, it is difficult to have a chance of winning, because the value of these written documents is to avoid some legal issues. In addition, the central bank itself has a team of golden lawyers. Not many people can win them in this respect. Even if the situation is not good, they can drag a lot of plaintiffs to bankruptcy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl asked Dolin’s basic information according to the process, and then asked Du Lin to sign a series of documents without any explanation. Du Lin, who took the pen and put down the pen, took out a few ten-dollar bills and some small notes and coins from his pocket and placed them on the coffee table. This was his first deposit after opening an account. The girl's face suddenly showed a sweeter and more happy smile. Each hall receptionist needs to save at least 300 yuan a month or a loan of 500 yuan. Dooling's one hundred pieces solved her urgent needs this month. In less than a week from the end of the month, the completion of this month's share is very important for her subsequent work evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, where is the bathroom?" Du Lin stood up in the corner and the girl pointed out the general orientation for him, and then continued to deal with it. Signing and stamping several documents on hand. She did not notice that Du Lin did not go to the place she pointed to, but walked toward a fully enclosed "iron house" with guards and guards. When he came in and just observed, if there is any place to go to the underground vault, it is undoubtedly this very suspicious iron house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not close, there is a guard to stop him, the guard eyes with a taste of dissent and distrust, blocked Doolin, "sorry Sir, this is not a public area, please leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not leave immediately, explained, "I want to be convenient, they said it was groomed here. Room, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard couldn’t help but laughed, he glanced back at the shovel, and asked, "You think this What kind of thing is something like a convenient place?", he said that he pointed to an entrance not far from the left. "There is that, please leave this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said that he did not return to the real grooming room after a long time. After a moment of shaking his hands and coming out from the inside, he returned to the deck without squinting, and he felt that he was always staring. His eyes were removed from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are very alert, and the environment here is destined to be a pointless. Once there is any change, the guards of the underground vault need only have a gun against the elevator to resist several times the enemy's attack. Even if you break into the underground vault at no cost, it is hard to escape. It is not far from the police station, the fire station is nearby, and the gendarmerie team only needs fifteen minutes to get there. This is doomed to have no meaning other than self-seeking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was still thinking about how to rob the bank, the girl’s voice pulled him back from the thoughts, "Sir, please wait a moment, After the manager confirms the stamp, your passbook can be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin puts his hand and says he can wait, less than a minute, A professional suit with a stinking smell of a successful person came over. He first said to Du Lin very politely, then read all the neat documents on the table and finally signed his own. The name, and supervised the girl to re-count the hundred dollars, and then placed a box next to the seat. The girl pressed a button on the box and the money on the box immediately fell into the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box is very deep, at least some of the 50-dollar coins that Du Lin deliberately put in have been waiting for almost thirty seconds or so. Any echo. If there is no special device in the box, it only means that the box may be directly connected to the underground vault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important piece of information that Schubert did not say. This is also a very important message for Dooling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passbook that recorded the one-dollar deposit was handed over to Du Lin’s hand after the manager’s signature and seal, and the manager politely left, Du Lin will pass the passbook freely. In the pocket, his eyes moved to the girl. "Thank you for helping me with this passbook. I don't know your name until now. It's really rude.", have to say Du Lin It was still very embarrassing to pretend the Sven, at least his temperament was very consistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl thought about it and said with a smile: "Do the boys now talk to girls like this?", she will set a new one. The document was put out and placed, saying: "My name is Alisa, I am very glad to meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Alisa, I remember When did you get off work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa had some accidents, and she stunned. Then, on her face, there was a smile that was full of youth. "Do you want to soak me?", before Du Lin retorted, she looked at the manager standing in the distance, whispering Said: "The bank's rules and regulations prohibit employees from interacting with customers, so...", she made a very regrettable action, apologetic smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Durin doesn’t care so much, he doesn’t really want to fall in love or get married with this girl, he just wants to know the box like a trash can Is it directly to the underground vault? He stood up, patted the corner of the clothes, and grinned. "I am waiting for you to get off work at five o'clock, and have a drink together at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Alisa looked at Du Lin’s words after he said something overbearing, and some of them were inexplicable, and there was also a slight expectation. Being able to enter the central bank shows that she has a fairly good family background. The more children who grow up in a better family environment, the more restrictions they have on the rules. Alisa is an Orodo. The purpose of her work at Turner is to get rid of her family's control over her life and destiny. In the depths of her heart, she has some intentions, and she has a rebellious mentality. She persuaded herself not to believe in the invitation of a strange boy, and kept watching the clock hanging on the wall. She didn’t know it. What happened to you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such an expectation that I can’t understand, the bell of work is ringing. After she packed all the things on the table, she made up her makeup, which led Xiao Kun to walk out of the bank door. She stood on the steps outside the gate and looked at the two sides of the street. The deep hopes in her eyes gradually faded away, and the bastard played herself! She snorted with some indignation and walked down the stairs and walked quickly toward her rented home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just... She always feels that someone is following her, but she doesn’t find any impressionful faces every time she looks back. Just when she didn't know what was going on, the loud car horn made her shiver and she was scared. She looked at the car on the side of the road. When she was ready to look at the driver to express her dissatisfaction, the muscles on her face could not help but tighten, revealing a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would marry me!", Doolin pushed the door down from the driver's seat and opened the rear door for her. "Please forgive me for being small." Joke, I just want to judge if you will refuse me. After all, being rejected on the street is a very embarrassing thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa is in a hurry A lot better, she leaned into the back seat of the car, curious to look at the car, "Is this car yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
