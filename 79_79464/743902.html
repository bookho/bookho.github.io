			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 16-year-old line of the Irian is built by the company called 'East Coast Entertainment', and the annual earnings of East Coast Entertainment have not been so good these years. However, it is OK, there will be stable income every year. The company that was once considered worthy of investment by the investment company of the Xie Lisi Street of the Imperial Capital, if it is not because their size has not yet reached the listing standard, may have been listed on Xie Lisi Street. "Albert knows that Du Lin is interested in these theaters and immediately collected a lot of information, not only this year, but also the information and financial reports of the previous five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These things may be trade secrets for some ordinary people, but for people like Albert, you only need to pay for this information. A little price can be. He is very willing to pay for this kind of early investment, because he knows that if he makes this sale, his return will be hundreds, hundreds or even more than his investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the reminder of Jose, Albert turned the chair over. He was amazed at the luxury of the interior decoration of the car, and he was amazed at the fact that the chair can be rotated. The mind. There is a table between the front and rear seats. He puts these materials on the table. As a gold salesman, he has a high professionalism and professional ethics...maybe. Du Lin took a close look at each document and then put it down. If you only follow these written figures, the book on East Coast Entertainment should be sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about this question, decided to ask Albert, "If the company’s economic situation is as perfect as stated in these reports Why do they need financing to have funds to transform the theater's playback equipment? You know that 200,000 is not a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert laughed Two voices, my heart once again had a huge leap in Du Lin’s guess. What is 200,000 is not a lot of money? It’s as easy as saying that the twenty dollars in his pocket are not a lot of money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he remembered what the predecessor who took him on the road said to him. In this life, as long as he can hold a golden thigh, nothing else needs to be done. Considered. Albert's fiery gaze paused slightly on Doolin, and he lowered his head and became more humble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The East Coast Entertainment has three founders, one of whom left the company early this year and sold the shares in his hands to two other founders. People, so they say that there is not much liquidity in their hands to transform and upgrade the theater, so they plan to find another partner to solve this problem. One, or more, it doesn’t matter, the key is that "Pay money.", Albert took out a newspaper from the briefcase and placed it on the table. There was a half-page in the newspaper that specifically said the gossip of the East Coast Entertainment Company’s equity change, saying that it was because of a woman. The star caused problems with the friendship between the three good friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling just took a glance and put it aside. He wasn't sure if it was a scam, but in the scam he knew, there were some scams that were laid out for more than five years. The five-year operation was only for the final blow. He believes that in the world of dreams, someone can turn himself into another person for 60 million, and it will be five years. In this world, some people can do these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this reason is also decent, but there is also a doubt. If the purpose of repurchasing shares is to ensure the integrity of the company, then why sell it now? Everything that Du Lin experienced in a dream can be much more sophisticated and advanced than some things in this era, so he will think this is a doubt. And as an entertainment company closely related to the film industry, how can it be possible to replace the upgraded device when it comes to the end? These are all doubts and are loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature in the car is very pleasant, at least five degrees lower than the outside temperature. It is not that this car has black technology similar to air conditioning, but there are stored ice cubes in some parts of this car to solve the problem of overheating in summer. There was already sweat on Albert's head, and he took a few more pieces of paper on the table, all about the founders of East Coast Entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin casually looked through it for a while, if the other party is a liar, the information is absolutely perfect, can not find a trace of problems, so it is also white Look. When he put down the information, he suddenly asked, "Is the three founders all local? Have they established a family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very Strange question, although Albert did not understand why Du Lin asked, but he nodded. "They are local celebrities and have their own families and families. What do you mean?"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "The complete social relationship structure represents a person's sense of responsibility to the society. Responsible talent is a useful person, you may not Understand what I said, but remember it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next in the silence, in the eyes of passers-by, this silver house In the middle section of Third Avenue in the second administrative district of Irian, the door was opened in front of a four-story building with an East Coast entertainment sign. The company's signboard is a bit old and looks a bit weather-proof. In fact, these signs are not old, they were done the year before, but the air on the coastline is salty, and these signs are old and taken for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert took the initiative to open the door for Doolin, and the first impression of entering the company was like visiting a museum. The lobby on the first floor is very empty, the marble floor is well maintained and can reflect the shadow of the chandelier on the ceiling. Around the floor are neat display cabinets. There are a roll of film reels in these display cabinets, and each film has a small card under it, annotating what movie is in the film disc, which year, starring Who is the director and how many box offices are sold in the theaters of East Coast Entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there were customers coming in, the receptionist at the front desk immediately greeted them. The blue-blue professional jacket and the exquisite ladies’ shirt made this lady look very So capable, she has a long hair with a linen color. When she laughs, she is very moving. The facial features are like living. She did not bother Du Lin's visit to the counters, but just followed them quietly, until Du Lin took her eyes back from those exhibits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, may I help you?", she was slightly under the body, during which time she felt the body of Doolin. The momentum is very strong, it should be a big man, so her attitude is also very low. "You can call me Lilith, I am very happy to serve you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Albert stepped forward, blocking Lilith and Doolin, Du Lin is his client, and also intends to treat Du Lin as the only customer, how could a company's front desk reduce his value? ? After he was polite and greeted Lilith with a smile of rejection, he explained his intentions. Upon hearing that it was an investment, Lilith was more enthusiastic. After notifying the company's founders, she took the two to the living room on the second floor and gave them a fragrant coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on, all this seems so formal, that is, Doolin himself has some doubts about whether he is a bit too jealous, can be placed in a company The display cabinet to show the glory, and in the hall that came in, shows that the founder of this company is very valued for history and honor. Is there such a culture and heritage, is it a pity to be a liar? But sometimes when a person starts to suspect something, all the possibilities will become less certain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the founders of the "Bearded Eric" soon appeared in the conference room, wearing a blue-and-red plaid short-sleeved shirt, beach pants and A pair of sandals, messy brown hair and hustle and bustle can't tell who is who. He wears a pair of black-edged eyes, some fat, and it seems to have some artistic taste. He warmly greeted him and shook hands with Doolin, then asked the two to sit down. "Hello, I am Eric, a filmmaker." He shrugged his shoulders like a hill shivering "I heard Lilith say that you want to invest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
