			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Ophelia for two days, then met with Magus and asked about the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus asks Doolin, are you afraid of the challenge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin answered, not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs asks, then will you lose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s answer is still no, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he went back. Magus seemed to be scorning his timidity, actually telling him that the competitor did not represent any political significance. Can be treated as an isolated incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an answer, Doolin continued to expand his influence in the next propaganda campaign, so that the entire state of Abiloo has only one voice, that The sound is called Doolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when the situation was good, some problems also occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these problems are not from the west, but from the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time because of the accounting company’s accounting jump, the unexpected issue of the modern currency company was used to make false accounts, and misappropriated some money from the company. After the person went after the matter, he temporarily put the matter down. In his opinion, the problem would not be too serious. After all, he stayed in the city of Otis for so long, and sent the Todd family to hell. These people in Otis knew it, they wouldn’t do too much, unless they didn’t want to live. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin never deliberately shows his fierce side, even no one has seen his cruel side, it is because all the people I have met Go to see the gods, or God. But this does not mean that he is really as harmless as he has shown. He is not only harmful but also terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, he does not think that someone will put himself in danger for some benefit. Money is good, but money is only valuable when it is traded. If you just put the money in the bank or hide it somewhere, they have no meaning like a piece of waste paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that no one would do stupid things, and these people beat his face very decisively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the question of tracing the false accounting of the token company, the two auditing company professionals invited by Du Lin suddenly left and refused to explain any reason. Down with the entire company to reject Doolin's employment, not willing to serve him, which makes Du Lin realize that this is not only a little bit of problems for the token company, it may involve more problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, Du Lin’s main profitable industry is in addition to his own private liquor brewing and sales, smuggling channels and sales channels, in Irian The region has the television group under his name and the three operating industries in the eighth district, as well as the income of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these industries, Doolin earns at least $78 million a month, with Otis's revenue being the highest. Of course, with the speed of the TV group's layout, the TV group will definitely become a hen in the future. Even so, the benefits generated by the city of Otis every month are definitely a huge asset that cannot be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the whirlpool of wealth created by gambling is terrible, and millions of dollars are spent every day, some of which are personal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the big problem in the city of Otis, it means that his current industrial blood supply system will be out of balance, before the TV group begins to generate huge profits, he Either find a new blood circulation system or spend the old money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he knew the news, he directly pushed down some of the next schedules in the West and rushed back to Otis with a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he does not know who is doing the ghosts inside, he can have more or less a fixed number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming, the whole city becomes more and more lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who have been to Otis will tell their friends that the city will only show its true colors at night, and the whole city is covered with colorful neon lights. At the moment of lighting, in any corner of the city, people are applauding for such a beautiful landscape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucius took a look at the night scene outside the window, laid the napkin and picked up the knife and fork. Three years ago, he was only a gang leader, relying on some skilled women and some scammers in his hands to live a poor life in Nano Lindes. At that time, people didn't quite see him, even if he was a gang leader, but after all, he was making money from those women and by making scams. The money was not "hard", and naturally it would not make people feel how much he had. Pay tribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look today, he is sitting on the tallest building in the city of Otis, while overlooking the night view of the city, dining with a female star. He wore exquisite costumes and waved silver tableware. He also had a noble aristocratic accent in his conversation. Who can believe that he only used it for three years? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's starfish is good, it was shipped from the beach at noon, and it was still alive when it was delivered to the kitchen." Lucius insisted on it. The actress smiled, and the actress also nodded slightly. The fish pieces placed in the plate in front of them were worth 39 pieces here, accompanied by other meals and red wine. This table has at least two hundred dishes. the above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor can never imagine the happiness of the rich, when they are still licking their fingers and calculating whether they can save a piece or two today when they are hungry, They need to look up to places that may not be seen. The rich are spending a lot of money. Maybe someone who has lost twenty, fifty or even one hundred on the ground will not bend over and kneel because it is too shameful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dinner was prepared for the actress, Lucius intends to invest in a movie, he does not understand this thing, but Since the six major companies launched a new collaborative model called packaged services, more and more people are trying to put their money into the film and television circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t need to do anything, just make a male and female protagonist, then determine a script and investment quota, and the rest is waiting on the big screen. Scroll out the first name - the employer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two years, there have been many changes in the film and television circles. Especially after the feminism is popular, the status of actresses in the film and television circle has risen, but it is male. The market value of the stars began to decline. More and more women are beginning to occupy the main position of society through the way of manufacturing consumption, and there is also a significant improvement in the box office of the movie. Those films that show the independence of women's roles can always win a good box office. Even if they can't make a big profit, they can protect themselves. This makes a lot of people tempted, which has caused the actress's pay and status to rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, I have to mention another person here, Mr. Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jack provides the most solid foundation for the current glory of the Empire Film and Television Circle, no longer faster than this money-free way of no consumption or even money More reliable operation, in just one year, Mr. Jack has shot more than forty movies, which is called the model of Irian! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know much about movies..." Lucius laid down a few fish steaks and put down the cutlery. "But I have a question, why do we need a provincial actor, and honestly I don't like the province. Yaren."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actress also put down the knife and fork, and the majority of female stars in the face of the gold can not refuse, she is full of napkins The lips, which made Lucius a little disappointing. "I don't like provincial people. The whole empire has no one but them. But, Mr. Lucius, you may not know that the provincial sage has been more than once. Protested against our work and believed that the current film is discriminating because of the lack of provincial figures in the film. In order to avoid problems caused by the protests of these people after the filming, and to get more from the provincial At the box office, so in most movies we will arrange a less important protagonist or the first supporting role for the provincial sage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucius reveals a stunned look , Masato is getting stronger now joyous, anyway, as long as they feel that their glass heart hurt, it will pull this group of people everywhere demonstrations, slogans name of racial discrimination forced to obtain benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People don’t like them, except for themselves, they are complacent about their ability to compete for their own legitimate rights. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people think that the provincial sage is a cancer of the empire, and there is even a theory. If the provincial sage asks for independence again, they will find an island in the open sea to put them all. Pack and send out, don't make silly repression! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a joke. About 70 years ago, the famous provincial independent organization called on all the provincial sages to stand up and fight for freedom. And got a petition, intending to sign all the provincial ambassadors in the empire, and then re-establish the provincial kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later this organization was defined as a terrorist organization, which was cleaned up by the Imperial Secret Service. The middle-level cadres were wiped out by a net. The top and heads were hidden in the caves and resisted. More than ten days later, the group committed suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the last very active independent organization, but unfortunately the empire did not realize that the provincial sages were definitely not the bricks of the empire, but the cancer, otherwise They may not agree with their request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think of Otis?" Lucius asked as the actress sitting opposite him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
