			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this?" Du Lin, who is doing a round-the-world trip, looked awkward after hearing the news. He didn’t think it was the most war-torn at this time. The right time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways, the federal government is indeed in extreme trouble, the financial order collapses, the economy is retrogressive, and many people in the sorrows are like refugees. The rice is almost impossible to eat. It is clearly an economic power but a decade of financial tsunami that has brought the economy back a decade. This is the weakest time in the federal economy in recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some very helpful sentences, there is often a turning point. This turning point is called but. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it is precisely because the federation is now in trouble, and it should not be the cloud of war at this time. The reason is simple. If left unchecked, the federation may take longer to recover, let the market regain prosperity and re-stabilize the financial order. In this process, the country will gradually undergo some changes to adapt to the present and the future. It can take five to ten years for the federal government to regain its face without the intervention of external forces, but this does not mean that the federation is a weak country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depreciation of the currency and the increase in inflation are ultimately due to the issue of the additional currency, and the value of the national credit system can not afford the federal shield, the value of money depreciated, does not mean The value of gold, silver, copper and iron is also devalued. It does not mean that a piece of material is needed to build a shell. It will take three or five copies now. Things are actually there, and it’s only the Federal Shield that is worthless. It doesn’t include anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is interference from external forces, the whole federation will unite and the nationals will be monopolized in the war. This time there will be no consortium to interfere with them, affecting They, they can concentrate more on removing all the enemies inside, evaporate them directly in a rude, barbaric way, and then unanimously. When the public opinion is all on the side of the federal wartime government, there will be a terrible thing that erupts, that is, productivity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people no longer need factories and countries to pay them wages, they are willing to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people no longer care about what they lose and what they lose, everyone is fighting against the intruders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unprecedented cohesiveness allows the federal wartime government to fully grasp the human and material resources of the entire society, and has a lot of privileges. The financial economy that they might have needed to recover for a long time will soon recover after the war. Especially when it is affected by the war, when personal honor and disgrace and gains and losses become less important, the power of the whole society is enough to change many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the war broke out, it is entirely to the federal welfare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small country diplomat who was chatting with him shook his head with a smile. "The situation is still uncertain. I heard that the federal soldiers robbed the merchants of the Empire. I also killed a few businessmen, but none of them were killed..." This is a bit cold-blooded. If they are killed, there will be no such thing happening, but things still happen after all, the diplomat sighed. Tooth, continue, "The empire here requires the federal to hand over the murderer, but the federal side refuses to admit that it has done such a thing, both sides have strengthened patrols and defenses on the border, and then..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The border line is important if it is placed in peacetime, but it is impossible for every inch of land to be guarded. Most of the time, except for the patrols on the border, the land and sky. However, after being in a state of tension, the number of people patrolling the border became more and more, and it was inevitable that they would encounter the other patrol. According to the folks, the border line, which had nothing to do, is now getting nervous. The soldiers who work overtime patrols are not very comfortable. It is inevitable that they will blow their beards and then squabble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military is always a bit bloody, especially the Empire and the Federation have a history of war, so I don’t know which key person opened the first shot, things will change. I have to be confused. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire now requires the federal to hand over the soldiers who robbed the merchants, and also asked the federal to hand over the patrol squad that took the lead and let them go to the military court of the empire. This kind of request is indeed a bit too much. If it is solved privately, it will not be too much trouble, but these requirements are officially issued in the form of a diplomatic note. The Federation cannot agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalemate of the Imperial Ministry of Defense in front of many journalists claimed that if necessary, the empire would discuss the dead border guards through armed warfare. Go back to a fair. It is also necessary for the federation to hand over the people and avoid the greater and more terrible consequences of the two countries because of some personal mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more people know, the less likely the federal is to pay, not only the federal but also the empire that claims to be handed over. All this is an empire's conspiracy, turning black and white upside down. If the empire does not apologize to the federal and hand over the people, the federation is not afraid of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The border between the two sides of Chen Bing, the atmosphere of war is getting stronger and stronger, and large-scale wars may break out anytime and anywhere. Now the southern empire of the empire has begun to go north, leaving almost the five cities close to the federation. The cabinet that had just been fished from the federal sea was rich, and it also gave resettlement costs and measures. It is said that the people who were placed in the west were the most! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the negotiations after three days are not able to reach a consensus...", the diplomat smiled again, "maybe a war will happen!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire and the federal war is a disaster for these small countries. First of all, they need to stand up, no matter whether they are out of the army or not, they must stand in line. It doesn't matter if you stand in the wrong place. Anyway, you will not be a small country in the end. If you stand up, you will not have much benefit. At most, you will get some money and the other. Don’t think about it. The consequences of failure are too serious. If you win, you don’t have much benefit. Really fuck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, all the small countries feel helpless and sad, the national strength is not strong, there is no status in diplomacy, there is always only the right to choose, no choice for others. Power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also sighed, he asked, "Do you think the war will break out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The diplomat nodded. "It is very likely that it will break out. You know, the Empire and the Federation have had such a history. Now there is no shortage of the main war faction in the Cabinet and society..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful empire was invaded by a second-rate small country, which became a shame that the imperial people could not wash, and the society advocated great revenge. Now that the opportunity is coming, some people will always make trouble. . There have been many parades in the empire, especially some veterans, wearing washed white ruling uniforms, wearing military medals standing outside the city halls, holding veterans’ rally, demanding the cabinet and the federal war, they are willing to do so. The first time I rushed to the front line and released the hatred of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A faint sorrow made Du Lin have no thoughts to continue talking. After he left the diplomat, he closed the door and was really fucking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to do something!" After throwing away those troubles, he began to think about how to gain more advantages in this war. People are willing to wage war and advocate revenge. This is a big trend, he Will not violate this trend, then it is necessary to follow the trend. After thinking about it for a while, he picked up the phone and just got ready to dial it out, but he quickly put it down again. If you want to do it, then you can make things happen to the best of your knowledge, or you can't show your own value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, Doolin accelerated his "tourary process" in the North Continent. As he went to a country, he would publicize that the federal government did not announce it. The brutality and cruelty of the invasion of the empire, people also got some old photos and interviews, rented an exhibition hall for exhibitions. Of course, these photos are actually fake. The camera was not so clear more than 20 years ago, and many of them were destroyed or naturally destroyed except for a few pictures. While holding such an exhibition, Du Lin spent a lot of money to acquire a large amount of supplies for the assistance of the Imperial Army and the Navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs shook his head and didn’t talk after he knew the news. Anyway, this little thing would definitely not let go if he saw the benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside story of the federal financial tsunami has been exposed. Du Lin’s personal image has taken a new step in the empire. He bought a large number of newspapers. Used to self-proclaim, touting himself into an imperial hero who won the federal economy with "economic war." Many civil society organizations are supporting Du Lin, and even the quiet churches are standing out. They have to give Du Lin a Medal of Mercy to honor his contribution to the Empire. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is using his own money to assist the imperial military, which has led to a donation in the society, especially the fellowship, openly collecting funds everywhere. Putting a fixed donation box, it also says "even if you only donate a dollar, it will become a bullet to take away the enemy's life" similar to the slogan of inflammatory. But everyone is eating this set, and these people are still promoting Dooling’s past and present. A full-fledged self-improvement of the young people who have achieved the dream of the Empire is just a matter of life. ad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effects... It’s still good. Every day, a lot of donations are sent to the Ministry of Defense’s account through fellowships and other civil organizations. People already know the answer, and the war will definitely break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is actually very simple. If the cabinet does not tend to war, they will not accept these folk war donations, and there is no single benefit other than finding fault. . Only when the cabinet wants to fight the war and decides to play it, they will take care of the donation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
