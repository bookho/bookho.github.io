			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are water dispensers in the bank, but there are no cups near the water dispenser, and the drinking water outlet of the water dispenser also restricts other vessels to receive water, eliminating passers-by. Come in and get some water to drink. Capitalists are good at providing good services to customers who can make a profit for themselves, but they are not philanthropists, and they don't even want to drink for those who can't create benefits for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This water dispenser must use the standard cup inside the bank to receive water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not too much hesitation in the girl, since a child dares to sit in such a place without panic, and the price basket he carries, It means that he does have the ability and the possibility to become the next customer of the bank. According to the rules and regulations of the bank, this child is also one of the objects she must receive and strive for as a client. She smiled and took a glass from the cupboard and walked to the water dispenser ten meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Savi pulled out three balls from the fruit basket, knocked the pull ring on top and placed it in Doolin. Tell him the box like a trash can and press the button. The whole process took less than five seconds, and no one even noticed what he did. When the girl in charge of the reception turned back, Savi was sitting on the sofa, and she did not notice that the fruit basket around Savi seemed to be a little less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give, your water.", the girl's money came, put the cup in front of Savi, Savi's face is finally more A trace of expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a smile, "We can talk about things that are related to the business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the underground vault, the staff was surprised to see that three things that were emitting yellow smoke fell from the sorting place. They were not sure what it was, but everyone knew that when a pile of banknotes began to smoke, absolutely Not a good thing. A staff member pressed the emergency brake switch, the conveyor belt stopped, and the underground treasury also sounded a harsh buzzing sound, which was separated from the staff in the upper bank hall by the thick concrete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The designer of the design bank's underground vault almost took everything into consideration, but did not consider what someone would throw down from the sorting box. So even if the underground vault has a lot of contingency plans, the first time I encountered such a situation, it was a stunned look. The guards gathered in the past, and the manager who had already planned to let Du Lin and others leave also panicked and ran to the sorting office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin turned and opened the second "empty box", which contained five gas masks. Savi lost a nerve gas. This gas is not fatal, but it has a very significant The characteristic is that it has good diffusivity and paralysis. This poison gas blocks the signal between the neurons after an excessive inhalation, allowing the person to be in a "squeaky" state, which can be delayed for about forty minutes after the inhalation is stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer they are, the faster they fall naturally. The staff in the front row looked down straight and the manager immediately realized the danger of the smoke. He did not hesitate to let the guards open the fire-fighting device. Although the water mist could not completely block the spread and spread of these smokes, it could minimize the poisonous smoke. In less than a minute, more than twenty people have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water mist slowed down the spread of smoke and gave the manager and the remaining guards a sigh of relief, they are planning to return to the above to feed back to the top and temporarily close At the time of the bank, they saw five "guards" armed with rifles and gas masks. If at this moment they don't know what happened, then it is really too small to see their IQ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange of fire started from the first second of the two eyes, Du Lin pointed to the three sprinklers over the sorting site, and Ellis was too high. At the muzzle, Du Lin's tactics are actually not complicated. As long as they are trapped near the sorting site, the poisonous smoke can solve them. Ellis's shooting was not very accurate, but fortunately there were enough bullets in the rifle's bomber. After a dozen shots, he finally succeeded in destroying the three sprinklers. The jet of water mist turned into three straight water columns, and the uncontrolled poisonous mist spread again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the staff at the sorting office did not have such good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange of fire lasted only less than five minutes, and the entire underground vault began to be filled with faint yellow poisonous smoke. The manager fell to the ground and looked sullen. Looking at the five robbers wearing gas masks, the excitement was black. He will not let go of these robbers, especially Schubert, but the bank's staff, actually colluding with outsiders to rob the bank vault. In fact, even more terrible is that he as a duty manager, actually brought this group of robbers into the underground vault, if Schubert can not escape, then he just wants to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not only a one million guarantee, but also a half-ton of gold bricks that have just been transported to deal with the revolutionary army, which is worth 30 million gold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he is finished, he has struggled for more than a decade and this time has come to an abrupt end. The violent bank executives will never let him die, they will vent their anger of 30 million yuan on him. Will let him leave the world. His wife and children are finished, and his entire family is over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eyes of despair and resentment, Du Lin emptied all the things in the two boxes, and several people quickly tidy up the already wet bags. The code is placed in the box. Money is good, it is not very heavy. It is not good to buy those bricks. Each brick weighs 50 kilograms. The higher the density, the harder it is to use force. Fortunately, except for Schubert. The children of the poor are born, and there is always some strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not have too much time after putting the BRIC code. In the original plan, they had five minutes to open some personal vaults and collect them. Among the valuables. But with this $30 million worth of bricks, they no longer need to do that kind of work. They pushed two cars to the elevator, and when Du Lin was ready to take everyone away, he suddenly realized that he couldn’t get out of the bank, and even the elevator would be discovered one by one because Their clothes are all wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not consider having such a large area of ​​fire sprinklers in the underground vault, so did not bring clean clothes to replace, but fortunately there are several guard stations In the position is relatively high, and did not get wet by the water, it took a lot of hands and feet to put on some clothes that are not fit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elevator is closed, the manager’s grievances are isolated, and everyone’s heart in the elevator becomes calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an almost perfect robbery plan, but after such a time, I would be very difficult to use the same method to go to the treasury of the Imperial Capital. It is. When the elevator reached the first floor, Du Lin took a deep breath and drummed it on the chest, pushing the trolley and went out. Just when they thought there should be no mistakes, a guard who was outside the elevator door suddenly made a noise. His words made everyone's heart lift, and Schubert even shivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the one of the cart, wait a minute." The guard looked confused and walked over to Du Lin’s group. He had a hint in his mind. Intermittent inspiration is erratic, and he always feels like he has seen this guard somewhere. But the problem is that this guy listened to the manager saying that he was from Orodo. He had never been to such a big city. Then when did they meet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
