			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, the weekend morning is always able to enjoy the peace of mind after a busy day of work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Warren went to the inbox outside the garden in his nightgown, and greeted the neighbor who was correcting the lawn, and then the new one. The newspaper was taken out of the armpit, carrying the fresh milk on the green lawn, and talked to the neighbors about a few stock market matters, and then slowly returned to the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife opened the player with a pillow, and then stuffed the tape that had been seen at least three times into the machine. After the short music ended, those few The familiar voice appeared in Mr. Warren's ear. He smiled and went to the table in the restaurant to sit down. His wife liked to watch the tape produced by the Empire Star, especially those sitcoms. He also saw it. It was really interesting. I really don’t know how the scriptwriter is. Thinking of these interesting stories and becoming such a sitcom, it must be a person who is equally interesting in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the Emperor's Morning Post. The first edition used a black and bold font to describe the ballot battle between the new party and the old party. It seems that this name The reporter forgot that there is also a Kadima party who is also pulling votes in a crazy way. He read every word in the newspaper very seriously, and then turned to the second page after each picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second page is basically some foreign things, such as the scandals of the top executives in the United States, certain high-level people are ruined because of certain things, or It is a country that is farther away from the drought, how many people have died of starvation. Before there is no further media and media to let the public know about new things abroad, newspapers are the only window in which they explore the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second and third pages were finished, Mr. Warren blinked. He took a sip of milk and picked up a slice of bread in the milk sauce. Wipe it off and eat it bit by bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened the fourth page, he was immediately attracted by the above content - discrimination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know when to start, there are always such a group of people around us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are lazy and rarely see the hard work of these people. It seems that they always hide in a corner and keep children, so that the burden of the family is heavier and they can barely make ends meet."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are stupid. The literacy rate among these people is generally not good. It can even be said that literate people may only occupy one percent of this group, or less. They are not willing to take the initiative to accept knowledge and do not want their children to learn. Knowledge, they may feel that illiteracy is also very good, at least not an extra expense for the children to go to school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are disgusting These people often appear on the side of the street, or stand, or squat, their green eyes always stay on the wallet of the passerby's pocket, as if they don't know when they will grab it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have all sorts of shortcomings that seem to have become the most useless group of people in the world we live in. If you read this article carefully, then you I should understand who I am talking about!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Warren put down the newspaper and looked at the slightly yellowed ceiling under the smoke. Long sigh, yes, Know, the article said, is that Walter melon people. I don't even need any reminders. When the article describes these shortcomings, his first thought is the Guar, who feels ashamed of his own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-educated Mr. Warren has always considered himself to be an ethical and positive social elite, but this article is a short line of words. Let him discover a self he has never discovered before, he will discriminate against others, and even one person. What went wrong? He fell into meditation, he never subjectively discriminated against anyone, never. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this article made him realize that he has a kind of disregard for this particular group of people, a discriminatory mentality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the Guarts look like this in the newspaper? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the main military service in the Great Patriotic War came from the Guars and the provincial sages, who contributed a lot to the Great Patriotic War. Including their lives, but even if this step is done, it still won't be respected by people, but become a person on the edge of society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present peacetime, there are many gualts working in important positions, such as the police, such as doctors, such as electricians. Their hard work seems to have been habitually neglected, so that many people may not know what these guerts have sat on weekdays and start to blame them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn't figure it out, picked up the newspaper and continued to look at it. He wanted to know what caused it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is very fruitful, and it directly cuts off selfishness and cruelty in human nature. Discrimination against the Guart is not a Guar. Some kind of characteristics that can be discriminated against by people, but this society needs some people to become a foil and become objects of discrimination, thereby raising the social status of another group of people and the social responsibility they bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even an incompetent Ogdin person can show absolute confidence in the thunder when talking about the Guar people. This is the mainstream of the society. The spiritual needs of the species are affirmation of the disguise of self-worth. They need to prove that they are "superior", prove that they are not the most useless to the whole society, and emphasize that a group of people who have been imposing various labels is not as good as themselves, to highlight their contribution and responsibility to society. Because there is a group of people who can be accused anytime and anywhere, people who impose various ideas, do not need to bear any moral pressure on the public, which makes them more unscrupulous to add labels to this special group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unfair to the Guar people. They have done a lot of things for this country, but they have encountered such treatment. This is a wayward distortion, or Moral sorrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with the case, a pile of deeds, constantly analyzing an ugly social phenomenon, and let Mr. Warren feel that he should do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t imagine that if one day he tried his best to do his job best, but he was scolded by his boss because of his ethnic relationship, and he was ridiculed by his colleagues. What kind of terrible life is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly ate the breakfast table early, changed a suit and the wife gave a greeting and left the house, what he wanted to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article has had a great response in society, because most people will not point the Guarts to this at the first time. The object's press release was linked, so some people who kidnapped morality and were also abducted by morality stood up and called on the society to give the Guarts rational treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this article, some places even appeared the Guar parade, adding something else to the empire during the election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some social activists with morality and social responsibility stood up and published their own views in the newspaper, taking the initiative to stand for the Guar. And criticize some ugly phenomena in society, calling on everyone to be an empire with good morals and correct values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin threw the newspaper into the trash, which was the benefit of hiring Nasha as the vice president of Empire Star Media. He deepened and George. Family links, publishing such an article that may have political problems is no longer a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that an article and a fund for donating to various social organizations have triggered a social phenomenon in which people are discussing the Guarts. The Guarts have also become synonymous with vulnerable groups. At this time, in order to prove the universal values, there is no big problem. It needs to prove that most people are not eroded by this terrible thought. To reflect the positive image of the empire, some typical examples must be erected to refute certain speeches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin may not be the highest-ranking Guar, but he is enough to be a model, a model of political correctness. Before the tangible evidence can be found to prove that Du Lin abused his power, no one can speculate on him to launch a public opinion attack, because this is the opposite of the trend, and will be rejected by the "moral people" from all walks of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a group of white monsters with several black monsters. In order to reflect the principle that everyone is a monster and should be united, some white monsters stand. Come out and tell everyone that the black monster is also white, but the angle you observe is not the same as ours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was then Du Lin providing 8,000 jobs to the entire state, allowing more people to stand on Doolin’s side, and those social activists thought Du Lin’s Explain that his three views and his character are an excellent mayor who conforms to universal values. Especially after Du Lin announced all the contents of the agreement and the content of the negotiations, people are more willing to believe that Du Lin did not sell the country's interests. This is just a business, a deal, and nothing more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you find out who is manipulating this matter? No one else has indicated, I believe that this kind of report is impossible!", Du Lin I couldn't help but complain when I was talking to Magus. "I just did what I should do, but I was hurt. It is unfair, Mr. Maggs."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no ups and downs in the voice of Magus in the receiver. He chuckled twice. "We have arranged for people to investigate this matter. There should be a message soon. In fact, you don't have to worry at all. No matter how volatile the public opinion is, it will not change my understanding of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
