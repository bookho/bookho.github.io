			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman was always aware of what happened outside the world during the restricted operation, and the commander did not give him a go, but did not say that he would not read the newspaper. He can also call the outside world in the environment of recording and monitoring. After all, what Mennon said is also a mayor, but also the leader of the Kadima Party. He still has some important work to deal with, and the command is not close to human feelings. These things will still give him some convenience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened outside, the farmers are very clear, and very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the West Mine will be finished, and he knows that if the people of the West Mine are really finished, these bastards will definitely drag themselves down. In the special environment of the west, many forces have cooperation and hostility, but it is not so easy to make it clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most typical example of the Mennon and West Mines, if the Mennon died, the executives of the West Mine may hold a grand The celebration celebrates the end of the doorman's death. The bastard has made a lot of policies to make the executives and mine owners of the West Mine very unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the minimum salary, the minimum job system, and the like, as long as they can make them unhappy, the doormen are very happy to do it, and the West Mine will also give The doorman has found some trouble, but this does not mean that there is no cooperation between the two parties. As long as both parties can cooperate with each other satisfactorily, they are still willing to try to get the benefits they want once in a while, and taxation is a very important one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the West Mine will have to firmly grasp the pricing power of the West Mine in the western mining sector, even if they face the door farmers and other large mining group companies Time is not allowed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This actually involves things that outsiders don’t understand, but the Mennon is clear, and he is also one of the participants. The problem is taxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to make 10 million yuan of income into 5 million and then reduce the tax from 3.5 million to 1 million? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves a floating indicator - the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Mines will firmly control the pricing power of western ore resources with its own strength and strength of more than ten years of operation, and they claim that this is the guiding price. At the same time, they will also tell everyone that this is the final price of this year. No matter who buys it, no price fluctuations are allowed. Even if the two sides of the trade are in the relationship of the executive members of the West Mine, then in this case. Prices will not float, except for some of the extra-line transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to constrain the free trade of the market, leaving the entire mining resource market dead and lacking competitiveness. There should be many mine owners who are very dissatisfied with this practice of the West Mine, and even take the initiative to leave the West Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron ore is only a dozen yuan a ton outside, but the quotation from the West Mine will be forty yuan a ton. This fucking monopoly will cause many mine owners to suffer huge losses... but it won't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually another thing that continually seduce the mine owners to follow the ass of the West Mine, and enjoy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very complex economic ecosystem. Simply put, the West Mine will help almost all mine owners by controlling the price of mining resources. Save a lot of tax. For example, the price of copper mines is rising rapidly this year, from 145 last year to 220 tons per ton, but the price set by the West Mine has not changed much since last year, only increased by five. Money, one hundred and fifty pieces per ton. But at the same time, the bauxite mine plummeted because of the discovery of the huge veins of the Yagur Mountains, from sixty-two dollars last year to ten dollars this year. However, the price of bauxite in the Western Mining Association is only two yuan less than last year, and it is kept at 60 yuan per ton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately only a fool can use the so-called guide price to buy a premium bauxite from the west, instead of choosing to add less than thirty-five dollars per transportation fee. Tons of imported bauxite, but there is such a fool, because this is the trick that the Western Mine will be able to monopolize the western mining industry and hold all the mine owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a customer traded under the supervision of the Western Mining Association at the price of normal market transactions, he purchased 10,000 tons with 2.2 million yuan. Copper mine, but what is listed on the contract is that he only bought 4,000 tons of copper ore worth 600,000 yuan, and also purchased some resources with a very low tax rate but much higher than the market price, such as aluminum. Earth mine. In the end, the total amount of the contract must be replenished to 2.2 million, and the supply and demand sides completed the transaction under the witness of the West Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tax return is filed at the end of the year, they will tax 2.2 million separately, and the empire has a certain degree of resources for the development of construction. Dividend-free dividend policy – ​​This article needs to be stated separately. Each state of the empire has its own laws, and the empire recognizes the legitimacy of state law as long as it ensures that the Constitution and the Basic Law are also incorporated into the content of state law. The specific data on the tax issue does not exceed the upper and lower limits set by the Imperial Tax Administration. Generally, the Imperial Tax Administration will give the approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the operation of the Western Mining Association, the enterprises that have demand for ore have purchased the full amount of copper ore they need at the normal market price, saving a lot of time and transportation costs of imported freighters, and enough with the door farmers. The friendship, they have no loss in the real benefits, in addition to they will have another extra income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, for the miners, they might have to pay a tax rate of 2.3 million in the amount of 2.2 million non-ferrous metal copper ore. To pay the tax, but in fact, in all the documents, the mine owner only sold 600,000 copper ore. The original 700,000 tax that would have to be paid now only needs to pay tax of 210,000. On the other hand, the door farmers have formulated the development of aluminum baux in favor of social development or to find other reasons, and listed bauxite as a special resource that has positively promoted social development, and reduced it by 20%. The tax rate of five is only 10%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine owner needs to pay a low-cost tax of 160,000 yuan for the sale of bauxite, plus the previous 210,000, a total of 30% of the tax Ten thousand, the tax that is required to be paid is reduced by 400,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the other bauxite mines on the other side also need to calculate the cost. For this transaction, they must pay at least 25,000 tons of bauxite. The accounting cost is 250,000. In fact, the mine owner saved 150,000 yuan in taxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but is it only possible for the mine owners to follow the West Mine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, it’s not over yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be follow-up play here, for example, the mine owner responsible for providing bauxite cannot fulfill the contractual commitment to pay enough bauxite, the mine owner is willing Pay the liquidated damages and return the bauxite to the company that purchased the money. They will strictly follow the contract process to complete the transaction in compliance with legal requirements. But the money will not really return to the hands of the demand side. The money will go back to the mine owner’s pocket after the West Mine has turned around. Of course, the liquidated damages are paid. After all, people are playing with them. There is always a point in such a game, isn’t it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the tax generated by the sales of 160,000 bauxite mines can be refunded, and 160,000 yuan will be returned, assuming that 50,000 is a liquidated damage, then mine The Lord finally got back 110,000. 50,000 plus the previous 20,000 tax in the deal they saved 510,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
