			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bottle of bottled wine is taken into the wooden barrel after being taken apart, and then someone puts the barrel into the distillation room, and then pours the wine in the barrel In the distiller. The whole process is divided into many steps. The more people are used in front, the fewer people are used later. This is for confidentiality. As for whether or not to keep this secret, Du Lin is not optimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guars who have no choice but to join the "gang" are indeed very loyal, but now does not mean that they can have such loyalty in the future, especially It is through the distillation that when the fruit wine worth about two dollars is turned into a bottle of ten or even higher-priced high contraband, the huge interest in the hearts of these poor teenagers is enough to change some people in a short time. Values ​​and outlook on life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loyalty, nothing more than the price of betrayal is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once someone thinks they have mastered this method and has tried it successfully, Du Lin can imagine that there will be a group of people who will secretly leave. Take a distillation to find their future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can guarantee that everyone will always be loyal, so for confidentiality, this is the same thing in Doolin’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, selling this highly private wine is not his plan for his future, just to raise a certain amount of money and build his own power. He even hopes that someone can steal the school and then go out to the independent portal, then he can rely on these people to integrate the high-alcohol private sales industry in the Yaoxing Empire and implement the standard and access system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the temperature in the distillation room rising, a damp heat hit, let Graf take off his clothes and stand naked next to the huge distiller At the moment when the first drop of crystal liquid with a strong scent of scent dripped from the faucet, Graf's whole person trembled with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what a high degree of wine, this is simply money, it is gold! About 150,000 bottles of fruit wine can be used to make 40,000 bottles of high-alcohol, and if you don’t sell more than one bottle, you can sell ten dollars. This is 400,000. Within 400,000, Du Lin’s cost of 120,000 was eliminated, and the profit was... He licked his fingers, about 250,000. He took 40%...100,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, his breathing is rushing, but that is 100,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Graf dreamed that he became a monopoly, he did not have 100,000 pieces in his dreams, but this is 100,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Graff, who is excited to be lost, Du Lin is very calmly looking at the distilled alcohol in a faucet. Maybe others think that this is a huge profit and the market is huge, of course, there is nothing wrong with it, but compared to the business giants in the business association, the money has not been put in their eyes. Since learning to read newspapers and reading books, Du Lin has finally had a preliminary understanding of the entire empire and even the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most profitable industry in the world is always a monopoly of some industries, such as military industry. Various war machines printed on the front of the star, especially the AT-11 war machine and the AT-12 mobile bearer platform, which are currently the most installed in the Yaoxing Empire, each cost more than 200,000 stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very expensive? A machine is so expensive, and even more terrifying is that the total number of empire installations has exceeded 6,000. This is still reported in the newspaper. Those that have not been reported? What can be assembled at any time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this industry is too high-end, it will take a long process of accumulation and precipitation to be able to set foot, then food, clothing and accommodation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Du Lin was that the most famous ready-to-wear store in the entire empire was not a chain store, but a tailor shop belonging to a tailor. Up to the emperor aristocracy, down to the civilian population, the clothes they wear are either made by themselves, or they are paid by the tailor, go to the store to buy finished clothes? Sorry, there isn’t a so-called “department store” in the entire Yaoxing Empire. The ready-to-wear garments hanging in the tailor shop also need to be lucky to buy the fit directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is clothes, shopping malls, or food, shelter, and travel, every industry in the eyes of Doolin is undeveloped Diamond Hill, and It is also a high-purity and high-content open-air diamond mountain. You don't need to dig, just knocking it down can make a person, a company, become the most influential brand in the empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the high-alcoholic "small business", Du Lin really did not take it as a treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water droplets gradually turned into turbulence, and the strong scent of the wine permeated the entire room. Looking at the filled half of the barrel, Du Lin immediately tightened the faucet, pushed the half-barrel "alcohol" down, and then poured it into the blending. Good juice, stir, precipitate. It takes about three hours, and the alcohol that has been poured into the juice becomes the favorite snow elf and first love, and then filled into the bottle that changed the bottle and label under Dolin's strong request, and sealed the lid. A bottle of high-quality fruit wine worth ten yuan was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Doolin asked the three major suppliers to produce bottles and labels in strict accordance with the style he needed was also to confuse the audience. Although he did not regard making private wine as his main future industry, he may avoid some troubles and still have to avoid it. When some special people began to have an interest in these wines, they got the bottles and saw the labels. They only thought that the wines flowed from abroad, and they would not consider the “production” of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they go abroad to look for it, I am afraid I can't find this high level of fruit wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is just the first experimental production. After determining the process and standards, Doolin will not come over often without problems. Almost everyone was shocked when a dozen or so barrels of high-quality fruit wine were introduced from the factory building that was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not shocked that there are so many highly private wines, nor are they shocked by the value of these things. What they are really shocked is that Du Lin made these high-alcohol method. They hand-picked a bucket of low-grade fruit wine into it, and when it came out, it was a high level of fruit wine? I am afraid that magic is not so magical, this is not a cup, not a bottle, but a dozen barrels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few tons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha’s face, a light cough, the teenagers realized that they were a little shameful, and immediately took back their surprised expression, standing on one side. Dudu was actually very shocked, but he did not show it, hiding this shock in his heart. He has had a lot more things than other teenagers, and he is a prisoner, so he is more aware of the profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once someone knows that in addition to using Dragon Blood, there is an easier way to turn low-alcohol into a high-alcohol in a very short time. I am afraid that the wine merchants of the whole world will become crazy. There are two reasons why the price of high-alcohol has been high. One is that the expensive price of dragon blood is soaring, and the second reason is that the high-alcohol is brewed from the beginning to the market, which is at least half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
