			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry seems to have heard of Doolin’s statement, and immediately the shackles of the eyebrows have been resolved. He looks at Du Lin’s smile, for his own language and Behavior apologizes, "I am just...", he shook his head. "You know, my father sometimes has a bad temper, so... I hope you can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin looked at him with the eyes of a child with intellectual disabilities. "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are really not important, and Du Lin thinks Henry There is a little mental retardation, of course, this may be related to the level of contact with him is too low. The Western world is said to be called the "world." In fact, the biggest power here is the governor, and the Kadima Party. Their powers and grades are too low-level compared to those of the Imperial. Henry has been working and living on the western side since taking over the family business. He does not understand and can't read some signals from the top of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thinks that his father’s friend’s alleged blame does not mean that he was involved in collusion with the western capitalists, but because it was caught in There are two reasons for the high-level political struggle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that after the Ministry of National Defense has formulated a strategic plan, it needs a cabinet approval. Magus’s power is great. It can be said that military and political affairs are caught, but many times he There is not so much energy to take care of all aspects, so there will be a cabinet and ministers and various official institutions. These people will deal with the complicated and complicated little things for Magus. Finally, some things that need to be signed by Maggs will still appear in front of Magus and wait for him to sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you don’t need to sign, you need to let him know, especially the current turmoil in the west, which has become the most concerned place in the cabinet. Any wind and grass will not let go of the cabinet, how can it be ignored that the plan made by the Ministry of Defense has been revised? Even if someone doesn't want Maggs to know, the Minister of Defense will let Maggs know that the reason is that he doesn't want to swear for any of his men. He told Magus about the change. The problem later was the question of Magus or him. The problem under his command, he is just a "incompetent" megaphone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of incompetent megaphones in the official organization, but that doesn't mean they are really incompetent people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the cabinet can pass, Magus can nod, then the problem is not something for someone, it is the problem of Magus. He agrees with the plan, his opinion is the final opinion, and he should be responsible for the final opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the high-level officials are fighting in invisible places. The civilians headed by Powell and the aristocrats headed by Magus are fighting against each other. The following party seats and the Prime Minister’s seat are the core contradictions. New party insiders. The guy who spoke for Henry is very likely to fall into such a struggle, or that he has already stood up before the incident happened. There is no right or wrong in the political struggle, only the enemy and me. Then when the things he promoted had a reversal of public opinion, it just gave his political opponent an excuse to attack him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, this is just a complaint, this is not asking, not chasing, just complaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin believes that the guy complains that the steel tycoon has pulled himself into the whirlpool, but definitely not complaining that he is going to be unlucky, otherwise he will definitely make more decisive Disposition, and it is impossible for Henry to know. Dooling felt that this might be a test for Henry and his daddy, trying to see if his son grew up in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin sighed sincerely for Henry’s dad, and the bastard did not notice such obvious problems at all, so he only had this life. Can be in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course Henry should also thank Du Lin well, otherwise he will not be able to mix in the name of the steel tycoon, he will not be in this life. I want to compete with his brother for family property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today Henry brought Du Lin for this thing, and now his affairs have been solved, and it is the turn of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time Doolin was going to find a time to talk to Henry alone and talk about the gods. Last time, because he was too many people, he was not very good at speaking. Now there are only two of them, and Du Lin thinks that Henry is a very good person, so he needs to ask some questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of silence was less than ten seconds, and Du Lin spoke. "Do you know the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry stunned and then nodded, "Yes, I know, why, have they been looking for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean they have looked for you?", Doolin touched the beard on his chin, which would become his future troubles, because his beard was a bit thick, but he didn't want to have a blue chin. Dove told him that there is a very good hair removal clinic on the side of Irian, which is very convenient. Although it will hurt for a while, the boring hairs are indeed gone and will not grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry’s expression became a little awkward. He lowered his head and rubbed his hand against the lips and coughed. “What should I say?” He looked up and searched the brain for some words. “This is a very interesting one. Organization, you can meet a lot of people here, of course I think their chef is good, and the event is also very good. Yes, they invite you to the next party?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin thinks this may be really a fool. It is no wonder that his brother is doing business outside, which requires a shrewd brain, and his poor mentally retarded child will be sent to the west to support the elderly, but he still feels His contribution to the family is not lower than his brother, I hope he can be happy all his life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, they invited me, but I'm not sure what other intentions they have, so I need to find someone to know." Du Lin decided to temporarily throw some thoughts about Henry in his mind and intend to use Henry as his good friend. "How long have you been in Tushen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do they have the means to collect membership fees, or in the name of religion or charity Auctions?" This is also a means of making money for illegal organizations with religious flags. People always have love. The richer people have more love, which is also the most contradictory part of human nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capitalists may use as many methods as possible to exploit as many as 25 points from the workers, but they will be very generous when they need charity. Donate hundreds of thousands or even tens of thousands of donations and say that they are good people? It was the devil who was joking, but to say that they were bad guys, they did indeed act for charity, no matter what the outcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry shook his head and said, "No, there are no things you imagined. Do you know how we call the gods?", Du Lin shook. Shaking his head, he said with a big smile: "We call the gods of the gods as entertainment gods. Every month they hold a grand party. You need to dress up a little and wear some props that can cover your characteristics. For example, the mask. Then we will enter a huge party scene, and the next thing we need to do is to enjoy ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't mention it to you Have you ever made any requests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Required? No, no, this is why everyone is willing to join, entertaining to death!" Henry raised his finger to the ceiling, his face showing a happy smile as a believer prayed in front of the gods and received a response from the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more so, the more Du Lin felt that there was a problem with this Tushen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grand mask party is held every month, and such a party can make Henry’s son of a steel tycoon’s second generation feel interesting, then hold The cost of such a party is probably a staggering number. Once a month, twelve times a year, where the money of the party is from the party, why they are holding such a party, whether there are people or organizations supporting their behavior, these are unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that some people are unwilling to participate in this Tudio, then do you know what happened to those who did not participate?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry recalled and said: "Some people will refuse, but some people are not willing to participate. Anyway, they have not encountered any trouble. I remember that several people have left the west, so "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in an inconspicuous city in the southern empire, Mr. Roel walked with a wide-brimmed hat wearing a windbreaker with a neckline The imperial central bank, he has been for a long time, more than half a month, and his mine can not dig out any news has been thoroughly spread. The creditors were searching for him everywhere, and they also offered him a reward of 5,000. Anyone who brought him alive to a designated location in several cities would be able to get a reward of 5,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must leave the empire immediately, it is too dangerous here, as for the idea that he originally intended to return the money swindled to the creditors is also in these days. The smoke disappeared. How could the money be returned to those people, and he intends to rely on the money to continue to fight in the Federation as a start-up capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to send money to this account.", Mr. Roel coughed, he put a federal account on the table, this is him Let him go to an account registered with the wife of the Federation. With the signing of the Monetary Memorandum of Understanding, cross-border interbank transfer business has been opened between the imperial central bank and the three major federal banks. Of course, this transfer is a bit slow, and an additional fee of five thousandths is required. But before the good life begins again, these are not problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
