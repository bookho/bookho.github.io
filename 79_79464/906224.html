			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you refute Harry's face?", the tone of Magus in the receiver did not appear to be harsh, or blunt, still the same as before Very affable. I can even think that his expression at this time is very calm, and there is no strong emotion reflected in his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has long had a hunch about this call. Now the status of Magus in the new party is temporarily unshakeable. People say that Harry is the next one. The prime minister’s strong competitors have ignored one point. If Magus does not nominate Harry, how much more might Harry be a "powerful" contender? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game between the high level Du Lin can only see a silhouette through a layer of yarn, perhaps Magus has his own ideas, even Harry It was just a smoke bomb that he released, or a bait. Du Lin had too little contact with him. The time in the New Party was too short. There were a lot of things in it, not to mention the stakes, but he had a faint hunch for four years. It is absolutely impossible for Harry to board that position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason for the hunch, but Du Lin believes in his own hunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what he guessed, it’s not wrong that Magus is Harry’s close comrade, so he’s refuted Harry’s face, Mag Then, when he calls again, he will not let Du Lin feel the accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled a few times. "It is true. They are going to take a good hand in my hand, but I don't want to give it to him. This is a piece." Very simple thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the person who came..." After Doolin answered the question of Magus, Magus also laughed. "It turned out that he, he and his two younger generations have been fighting for more than ten years, still fighting, this is his last chance." Then Magus elaborated on the Solo and Cape family. Insider information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo’s other two competitors are his younger generation, who must call him an uncle. The owner of the Cape family once talked with Solo privately. He is not too young, even if he is arguing for this position, he will decentralize it in a dozen or twenty years. The speed of a family's highest power turnover is too fast and can have a big impact on a family's overall plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the nobility, it is not uncommon for a thing to operate for a few years or more and only to produce results. Sometimes there are things that they will run for generations to produce results. But every time the result will make the family go to one of the two paths. Either fly to the sky, let the strength of the family go up a step, or fall into the trough, the benefits of return can not make up for the loss, the family strength plummeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the Cape family is willing to give an extra 1.5% of the family equity to Soro, let him give up and continue to compete with the owner, but by Soro Refused. His eyes have been staring at the huge shareholdings belonging to the owner. Although this part of the equity belongs to the “public” shareholding that the “owner” can hold, there is too much improvement in the family’s status after possessing this part of the equity. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family member system represented by "branch" can get more benefits and benefits from it, which is why people compete for their position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Soro has been fighting since then, until recently the family of the Cape family is not in good health, ready to hand over the power in their hands, three The competition between the heirs has entered a fever. If it were not for the Cape family to try to avoid escalating conflicts between family members, I am afraid that three people have already produced a result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin blocked Soro’s mission, he will not be reconciled, the cost of losing a point is too great, he will definitely try his best to let Du Lin give way . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Magus also told Du Lin that he would not put too much pressure on Du Lin, these northern nobles are unreliable and let Du Lin’s good Do your own thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked a lot, which made Du Lin once again clearly feel that in fact, between the high-level inside the new party, not only the origin, but also There are more factions, but he has no contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Magus for his bottom, Du Lin was full of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days, when Soro’s agent team came to Otis and met Du Lin, Du Lin directly ruined them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, he didn't leave even a little room, telling us directly that this is impossible!", Solo's grandson - Solo's generation It is relatively high and not very old, which is a very common phenomenon in the big family. Sometimes a white-haired old man would call a child called Grandpa, and others would not be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soro has the possibility to climb the family, and naturally there will be a lot of relatives around him to serve him. Members of the big family are not very well mixed with everyone, and there are very marginal characters. Some are because they don't have the ability and they don't want to suffer. They hold the equity in their hands and don't spend it. They eat and drink all day long. There are also some who have offended the current authorities and have been swept into the garbage dumps and become marginal people of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some ideals and ambitions among these people who want to return to the core of family power, so it is best to hold these possible "next" There is no one way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on his face was a little angry and a bit weird. "I swear, I put myself in a very humble position all the time, to him. They used the honorific words, but his attitude was too much... Yes, I said, I should say what I should say, but he is not at all tempted, but he still asks me. I left. This is the first time I have been driven away. I am very uncomfortable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has never been so much compared to the grandson of Soro The things, experience and experience are not rich enough. After talking with Du Lin, it was not long before I was invited by Du Lin. He thought that Soro didn't talk about it because he didn't have time, and with the reputation and status of the hymn family in the north, there was basically nothing they couldn't talk about. He remembers the lessons that the elders have summed up, and regards this lesson as the truth of his own life, that is, the enemy who can't find it with money. If the money is not enough, he adds power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his words, he highlighted the hugeness of the hymn consortium and the Cape family, and told Du Lin faintly if he did not cooperate, he would set up for him. A lot of enemies. At the same time, he also euphemistically said that if Doolin is willing, he can occupy a certain proportion of the shares in the casino owned by the hymn consortium, the free one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good words are all said, only in exchange for a word Doolin - go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him feel humiliated, humiliating, and his family name was smashed by Du Lin, and his grievances were difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment he hung up, Soro asked him to stay in the same place, and he would call him later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin refused our cooperation again, and Harry did not get through." Solo said as he shook his head, at first he thought Du Lin just didn't want to take out the profits in his pocket, so he sent his own grandson to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big men don't do their own dirty work, so his grandson is dedicated to doing dirty work for him. In simple terms, it is coercion. This kind of thing is not suitable for people like him to do, because he has no retreat between each other, but let his grandson do, and everyone still has a little affection. If he can cooperate, Du Lin expresses his dissatisfaction, then he will let his grandson and others suffer a bit in front of Du Lin, and calm Du Lin's grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin disagrees, nothing will happen to him, that is because his grandson did not ask for it because of some extreme Emotions, arbitrarily made claims, have nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes frowned at his mouth, and it was a headache for a guy who couldn’t get into the water. He took a sigh for a moment. I looked at Solo calmly. Soro kept pinching his chin and thought about it. He noticed the eyes of Ernes. He looked up and looked at each other. Soro picked up the phone and dialed the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will give it to you, I hope you can let me see the answer I want!", after that, Solo hangs up. He looked at Ornes and said: "Some people don't give him a good look, he will feel that you are intimidating him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornes Smiled and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandson who hangs up the phone here has a light breath, and there are six people in the room with him. This is not the first time he has done it. But it is the first time to target the mayor of a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to find two cars, I remember that there are our partners in the middle of Linders." He pointed to one of them, that person Standing up, I immediately turned and left, and then he pointed to another person. "You go together, Parker has what we want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at the other After leaving, the last three people in the room looked at the last three people in the room and shrugged their shoulders. "In the next three days, I felt the habits of Doolin, we need to create an accident!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they have to give Duolin a little bit of a look. For the Cape family, Dulin’s role is not much different from that of ordinary people. For a long time in the past, wars often occurred between nobles, possibly because of some trivial matters, possibly because of disputes over interests. They even dare to attack the nobility, even the nobles dare to kill, let alone a small person who is ordinary and can no longer be ordinary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
