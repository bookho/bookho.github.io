			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Aaron, please be self-disciplined and respect the respect of others who can win." The guy who inserted this is much taller. He looked down at Aaron with a scorn and disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people in Nano Lindes know that Aaron is a jerk, he always allows his own temper, only Klaus can control him. In these years, Klaus did not give this brother a small butt, and apologizing is a common occurrence. Someone once said that if there is no Aaron, maybe Claus has gone one step further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this step goes, everyone has their own opinions, but one thing is the same, Klaus will definitely be better than now. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron stepped back halfway, his face was full of a sly look, and his arm swung away toward the tall, tall face. Also on the one hand, "Who are you riding the horse, is there a place for you to talk here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall one is also looking up and hiding Aaron’s sudden attack. His arm twitched and his hand suddenly caught Aaron's wrist and pulled up. His expression gradually became cold and he laughed twice. "You have to thank you for having a good brother, or today is the last day of your life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The sentence was clearly threatened with threatening intimidation. The people around Aaron immediately surrounded them and saw that they were going to start. Aaron suddenly yelled and asked Chester: "Who is this guy?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chester smiled and replied: "Our newly established Weidun Security Company Supervisor, and Captain, Mr. Spike."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron’s eyes flashed a sizzling look, and he licked his lips and looked at Spike’s face, "I won’t get into trouble with this guy?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chester laughed, "You can try!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually Chester Being indulgent in Aaron, as a dirty and dirty, he naturally knows that Andy Brothers seems to be planning to take over the operation of the public transportation of Otis City, if it can be made here. Fallon shot, regardless of whether the final led to serious consequences, they will be out immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Doolin, he had a deeper view of Du Lin. Many people may still be on the surface to pay attention to his age. But Chester has already discovered through a short conversation in the morning that Du Lin seems to There is a "stereotype" that is difficult to describe. His stereotype is that he will set a rule that looks fairer and that everyone must abide by. Within this rule, even if the blood of the killing is a river, as long as it does not violate his rules, then he will not say anything, nothing will be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breaking his rules and not causing any consequences, he will immediately shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of his own rules of the game, he is like an inelastic steel plate, rushing to hit the head can only hit the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Doolin knows Aaron’s representative of the finalist in the city hall, he can imagine how angry the young mayor will be. This is not to give him the face of Chester and the boss behind him, but not to face the city hall of Otis, not to give him the face of Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he didn’t stop Aaron at all. As for his colleagues, he is very confident about Spike. If this small scene can’t cope, how is it possible? Selected supervisor and captain of the company? That is the power and the general manager Qi Ping's position, and one or two! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment Aaron’s remaining hand was inserted into his pocket, and he hit the tiger and punched Spike’s head. Although he often seems to be "indifferent", he also knows what kind of troubles he will cause when he intercepts the "businessman" that the mayor receives at the entrance of the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spike seems to be as scared as he did not fight back, and did not evade, this big man’s heart is more cunning than his rough appearance. . He was born with a fist from Aaron, and pointed out that the five protruding metal nails on the tiger pierced his scalp in an instant, and the bloody squid flowed out. Just when Aaron himself did not understand what happened, Spike grabbed the hand of Aaron’s wrist and pulled it back. He reached out and grabbed Aaron’s neck and held him in front of him, fast. Retired a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around Aaron’s men suddenly stupid, and even some people took out their guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the situation is going to escalate, Klaus, who has been standing in the dark, swears, and follows the alley, "misunderstanding , are misunderstandings!", he said, while approaching the location of the incident. He opened his hand and walked over to Spike. It seemed that he couldn’t feel the tension at this time, as if he had not seen what had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's all a misunderstanding..." His hand pressed on Spike's arm and grabbed it with a little force. He said sincerely: "My brother is too impulsive, and I am rude to him." You apologize...", said that he let go of his palm, calmly took out a checkbook from his pocket, wrote a thousand pieces, folded it and stuffed it into Spike’s pocket, then he smiled Headed and snorted, "Would you forgive this young child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spike was under far pressure from Klaus More than just the pressure on Aaron, the Spike's eye is not worth mentioning, and really makes the Andy brothers famous - the notorious is actually Klaus. This guy can use all the evil and vicious words in the world on him. It’s a miracle that Klaus can live so far, but it’s also a miracle. The two miracles made Spike have to let go of Aaron’s hand and spread his hands and shoulders. Take a few steps back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took his handkerchief from his pocket and covered his head, and stood back behind Chester. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the rumors, Klaus reprimanded Aaron and went to Chester’s face with a sincere smile. “Very very sorry. He is this character, and he doesn't know if he hopes to get rid of it." Klaus seemed to be very tired and sighed, took a box of cigarettes from his pocket, and went to two to pass to Chase. And Spike, after apologizing to Spark for a smile, said to Chester: "Let's find a place to sit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ces I was not afraid to agree to this proposal. After all, he is also a half gang member. In addition, everyone in Nami Lindes is a local snake. It is not without a hand, and they are very familiar with each other. He is not afraid of safety. The Di brothers gave him a black hand. Kill him, Andy brothers will run, not only his boss will find Andy brothers, Mayor Doolin will also find trouble with these two brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Andy brothers will not only move him, but also protect him well. If he is in his own hands, it’s really a mouthful. Not sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chose a cold tea shop on the side of the road and sat down. As the development of the city of Otis was in full swing, people suddenly found it here. The best thing to sell is cold tea, in addition to cheap food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called cold tea is actually smashed with some wild berries and a small amount of rosemary, and the iced water is used to wash the stirred drink. This cold tea has a fruity smell, sour, and a little sweet that you can't feel, at least not pouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very simple cold tea didn't expect sales to be very hot. If the workers on the nearby construction site were really thirsty and unwilling to drink well water, they only needed five cents to buy two big cups. The ice cubes that have been smashed into ice are mixed in the juice as if they can freeze the hot summer. The two cups are filled and the whole person is cool. So as long as there is a place on the construction site, there must be such a cold tea shop, and there is more than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Chester and Claus entered the cold tea shop, Klaus’s men immediately sat opposite the guests who stayed in the store. Seeing that it is not a good way to go, all the guests left the coin and immediately got up and left. In less than a minute, the cold tea shop was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More terrible is that three people are standing outside the gate. When someone looks over here, they will immediately go back and let the boss I can't cry when I cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus asked for two large glasses of cold tea, and asked for some broken ice, and then paid ten dollars. "You don't have to find it, but we need to talk about it." Things can't be disturbed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss suddenly smiled and said that changing his face would change his face, while nodding his head and walking to the door, hanging the sign of the business, the whole cold tea shop There were only Klaus and Chester, and everyone else went outside the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it? This stuff can't be eaten in Nano Lindes." Klaus puts Chester's cup down and raises his cup. Drink a half cup, then take a sigh of relief, and still have a whistle, "Hurry, give it a try, drink it with a big mouth." He licked his chest. "It feels like swallowing the winter into the belly." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Chester doesn’t have that, he just took a sip, nodded and put his head down, tilted his legs and looked at Crow Sis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus knows that it’s hard to make Chester’s face look good, so he didn’t mind, “Frankly, we should They all came for the right to operate public transportation!" He looked directly at Chester and was stared at by the man whose reputation was bad. Chester actually had a little scalp and he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus smiled and nodded, thanking Chester for his frankness, "Have you got this project?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
