			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, a escort slowly entered the city of Tener from outside the city. Some early risers were already very accustomed to this distinctive car. Familiar with. It is quiet like a fish in the river, quietly swimming in the river that belongs to it. When the special escort arrived at the gate behind the bank in accordance with the established route plan, the guard who was in charge of the guard stopped the car. Even though he knew that the car was the own escort of the Imperial Bank of the Imperial City of Tener, the strict rules and regulations allowed him to complete each step in strict accordance with the process specification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stranger in the cab, he has not seen it, but he does not care. There are two days from Tener to Orodo, and it is four days to open again. The bank's rules and regulations do not allow drivers to drive the escort for a long time, so as not to appear dangerous on the road. In most cases, the people and cars here are passing by, and then the people there are escorting the boxes that need to be transported to Tener and the cars here, but the people here will rest for two days. Go back here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there must be someone here to come back with the car, to prove that there is no accident in the entire escort process, and also to prove the identity of these vehicles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard came to the back, knocked on the carriage and showed his identity, the compartment door opened, and Schubert looked tired and helplessly laughing. A smiley guard is very familiar, and the round trip of four days can really make a person exhausted. He sympathized with Schubert and then looked at the other three guards sitting inside the carriage. The indifference of the faces of the three faces and the attitude of ignoring him made the guards somewhat helpless, and confirmed the identity of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who come from the branch are all virtues. They always feel that they are superior and stupid. They don’t have to think about it. If there is a difference, they are just one. Guard? There was also no good-looking guard who hooked up several options on the access control list, took out the key and opened it, letting the escort drive in. After the car turned away and disappeared into the garage, he pushed the door and hid in the guard's booth. He continued to browse a somewhat old adult pictorial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good thing, it can refresh when you are sleepy, and you can spend your boring working hours, which is the most favorite of most guards. One of the things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the escort entered the garage, the receptionist on the bank appeared on the unloading platform in time, and a manager of the bank took it from Schubert’s hand. After taking the list, I frowned. There was something on the list that was not applied by Tenell before, but it was sent. On the contrary, there are two kinds of application materials that are not on the list. If the list is not mistaken, it means that there may be a lawsuit to fight in the next period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This list lists some of the valuables that customers store in the bank. Some people have higher requirements and are more troublesome. They are required to store things in the Vault of the Imperial Central Bank branch in Canary. In fact, don't think about it carefully. What is the difference between the insurance of Tynel and the insurance store of Orodo? The construction and construction schemes on both sides are the same. There is no difference at all, but it is necessary to increase the transportation risk manually. This is really a move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is some resentment against this requirement, the Imperial Bank’s service concept of being a guest is God’s service, and every branch and sub-branch is trying to solve the customer’s The constant and continuous efforts have also led the central bank to continue to lead the entire banking industry under the new party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The declared items did not come back with the car, and it is very likely that some of the big names of the branches were fancy, or involved in certain cases, temporarily detained. . This kind of thing has not happened once or twice, and it has long been taken for granted. Once there was an old man who stored a crown of a certain country in ancient times. Later, he was spotted by a big aristocrat. He detained the crown on the grounds of "suspected tomb robbery". After the death of the other person, he entered the process and eventually became this. A very famous collection in the Grand Aristocratic Collection. As for the items involved, there are more. Not everyone has the ability to confront the giants like the Imperial Central Bank, and often they can only swallow after receiving a compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager saves the original list after signing the list, returns the copy to the driver, and the copy needs to be brought back to the branch of Ordo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the protection of three guards, the two iron boxes were put on the cart. According to the normal procedure, this escort should be over. These guards from Orodore will return to Orodo after a day off, but because there are several items in the list, they You also need to see these things in the library and collect the signatures on another document before you can leave, so they will, along with the manager, escorted the two iron boxes into the underground vault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin held the gun, lowered the hat, stood behind Ellis and Dufo, and slowly entered the bank's hall from the back door. He saw Alisa at a glance, and the whole person of Alisa looked listless and looked at the bank's dome in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since she woke up from her sleep that morning, the whole person was not good for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she is not very concerned about the loss of a thing, a girl is already 19 years old, even love has not talked about a poor person for the young people in this society, some of her classmates, friends in the ten When I was five or six years old, I experienced that link. Only after she dragged on for a few years, she completed this feat in a stupid way. What made her feel bad was not her physical and psychological changes, but Du Lin’s bastard disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did everything as if he was trying to lie to her for the perfect performance that she had done for the first time, so that she hated the teeth and felt the society. The complexity. Only the injured chicks will understand the safety of the nest. At this time, Alisa has already written a resignation letter. She will return to Orodor and will no longer be willing to stay in the same city as Doolin’s bastard. Inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been looking for Du Lin in the past few days and has inquired about this person, but her life circle is exceptionally small and naturally does not receive any news. Sadness is definitely there, but it is not necessarily sad to say how sad it is. After all, it is only the first contact, it may be gentleman, very humorous, very considerate... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a damn guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She regained her gaze, and she was going to wait until the manager said that she was leaving the place that made her sad. She feels that she may soon forget the unpleasantness here, but it may also be remembered forever. Just as she was sorting out the documents, a group of people passed her by. She looked up and looked at the back of her closest to her. Just the moment the person walked by her, she smelled it. It is called "Du Lin". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mistake, it must be that bastard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is both happy and a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t Dulin be a rich man? Why did he wear the bank guard's clothes and the manager to the elevator at this time? Her heart floated a little uncomfortable feeling, I don't know if it was a sense of heart, Du Lin just looked back at her at this moment, their eyes met in the air, and Alisa's full-hearted resentment disappeared without a shadow. Without a trace, his eyes have become hot. But soon, she became calm under the slight shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes were exceptionally strange, indifferent, without a trace of affection, and even gave her a message to drive her away. She stared at Du Lin, and Du Lin pulled down her hat again and went back, leaving her with a firm and straight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
