			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing the fake and shoddy tokens to replenish the market economy and game rules of the cholera city of Otis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the question Dulin considered last night. First of all, the local and foreign capitalists can be excluded, because the city of Otis is a very large market, as the current empire The only "special zone", many things can only be sold and operated here. This is destined for a group of people who will swallow the entire empire's spending power in this place. It can be said that it is a market that cannot be seen at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, those capitalists will only think about trying to get a little of their own industry here, and making money with the big trend, it’s impossible to add to Du Lin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the Cape family, Doolin did not suspect the suspect, because this means looks very powerful, but very disgusting, at the same time It will also tarnish its reputation. Casting tokens may seem like a joke, but it is only for capitalists of the size of the consortium and the gate. Once they arrived at the Cape family and the status of the sacred consortium, they did not bother to use this low-level way to impact the city of Doolin, which is related to credit issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The currency has not been a joke since ancient times. Whoever has touched it will lose its credibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this has nothing to do with their original purpose. If you sell fake tokens and you can wash their money, then I’m afraid to think about money laundering too. Simple. Not only can they not clean the money in their hands, but they will have more money to take out. As for revenge on Doolin’s previous actions, it is unlikely. It is like if the mythical dragon is angry, it will not run to the enemy's head to pull a bubble, but to bite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Du Lin changed a topic, the city of Otis is built and brilliant, who is the most harmful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the level of Doolin, there are only two situations that will lead to enmity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either to plunder the interests, or the interests have been damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the city of Nano Lindes will be the most injured city, because the cities of Nanondides and Otis are too close, near It takes only three or four hours to drive. This means that the river that once flooded into the Lindes and brought a lot of foreigners and funds to the city turned into the city of Otis. Coupled with the proximity of the two cities, even if some people go to Nano Lindes, they will consider whether to stay in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a famous special zone, a famous gold cave. In contrast, Nano Lindes, no longer has the reputation of the Empire's belly star. When the railway in the east-west direction is repaired, the title of the hub will be robbed by the city of Otis. The once brilliant nano- Lindes will begin to go to the end, and finally become a city waiting for death in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Coster’s ambiguity and conviction, Du Lin felt that this person was in Nano Lindes and was closely related to the future of Nano Lindes. When he faced a situation that was difficult to solve, he would consider trying to use some means to defeat the reputation of the city of Otis. Even if he can't be ruined, he will also suck blood on the city of Otis to feed on Nano Lindes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor of Nano Lindes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, any conclusion needs to be verified repeatedly, and Du Lin will not make a blind decision because of his own guess. He found the one in the casino. The gentleman who used the large denomination counterfeit currency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman seems to be more likely to communicate than Mr. Coster, perhaps because he is aware of the seriousness of the matter, so he is willing to cooperate with Doolin instead of confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came to Otis before a friend of mine told me that he still has some residual tokens in his hand, considering that he will go next time. All was not converted into cash. He heard that I wanted to come here to play, so I gave these tokens to me." This gentleman has not been treated in any way, this guy has a family in Nano Lindes Small companies, small in size, support more than 50 people, assets just over one million, not too big or too small is considered a rich man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished his words and raised his hand to do what he wanted, and let it go. Du Lin saw his nervousness. Under the light, there was a layer of sweat on his forehead. Du Lin took a handkerchief and patted him on the shoulder. "What misunderstanding we can just explain it, you can tell me. What is the name of his friend, how many tokens did he give you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course can...", the person answered very quickly, can see him I didn't know that I was using counterfeit money, so he hated this friend in his heart. "We all call him Louis. He gave me 50,000 chips."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You gave him 50,000 pieces of cash?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy shook his head a little embarrassed and his expression was awkward. "He only received me 40,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your cooperation, these days You are staying here for a while, and there are many interesting places in the city of Otis waiting for you to discover.” Du Lin stood up, and the head of the hotel behind him took a tray and walked in from the door. The trays were neatly arranged. There are a lot of chips flashing with silver, these are five hundred denominations, adding up to exactly 50,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these things, the guy who was hurt by a friend is a bit overwhelmed, and those who have a little value are more aware of Doolin than the bottom layer. many. Nano Lindes has always had many people of various identities, and some of them are "bad people." It is common for these people to rob and kill people, but it is difficult to bring them to justice because there is no evidence. These people are walking around in Nam Lindes, but here, one by one is like Du Lin's grandson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t mistakenly think that these people suddenly become law-abiding, that’s not what they can do. It all means that they are afraid. People exist, so they dare not let it go here again. If the city of Otis changes because of who, there is no doubt that the young mayor in front of him, plus some rumors, so he knows that Du Lin is very powerful, very powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready to be slaughtered, but he didn’t expect the script to turn around here. He was a little overwhelmed and looked at some chips. Look at Doolin, "These...is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the initiative to extend his hand. "I am very sorry to have delayed your time. These are used to make up. Your loss, this is not your fault, but the fault of others. If you consider the responsibility, I and the city of Otis will have some responsibilities, so these represent my apologies, I hope you can accept."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook hands with Doolin, his expression became natural, and his muscles were slack. He was terrified when he was asked to come out of the casino and was locked in this room. Especially when the person in charge of the casino told him that the tokens he used were all counterfeit, he had a hunch that he might not be able to walk out of Otis. But now, he is too narrow to estimate the character and character of a big man. He is very ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he accepted it and asked some investment questions. Compared to the bustling city of Otis and the reasonable mayor of Doolin, he felt that it would be a very good idea to relocate his estate to Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also answered some questions about him and then he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went out, Du Lin told him, "As he said, we are close to the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people behind him are high-paying managers, and the most trusted people under his own hands. Some of them understand what Du Lin is saying, while others are blindly believing Du Lin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to create five hundred counterfeit coins is definitely one of the top-level management and even the leader in this fraud organization. The average person can't get the fake currency of this denomination. At the same time, this is the beginning of a deeper "invasion" after the other party has not heard about the counterfeit currency from the city of Otis. They need more accurate feedback to determine how to further disrupt Doolin's plans and to suck blood in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only 50,000, and soon they will not be satisfied with such a small amount of 50,000, only need to steal from the city of Otis every day. Take 100,000 pieces, one month is three million, and one year is thirty-six million! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in a fully enclosed factory on the outskirts of Nam Lindes, huge rolling machines are working crazy. A piece of metal plate was placed on the console by the worker. As the twins in the reaction chamber of the rolling press reacted quickly, the workers pulled the chain hard and slammed a loud bang. The head of the rolling press was shot from the inside of the rifle like a cannonball, turning the metal plate into a piece of token of 500 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tokens lost the fixing of the surrounding material, fell into the conveyor belt at the bottom of the machine, and then entered the assembly line with more than a dozen workers working. These workers took a sickle and a sandpaper knife and knocked off some of the raw edges. Finally, these preliminary processed tokens were polished and trimmed, and finally they were placed neatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man in a flower shirt with a moustache is smoking a cigarette, constantly squeezing those neatly stacked chips with his hands on his face. expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the current factory production speed, a batch of twelve chips can be completed every ten minutes, that is, six thousand dollars. One hour is 36,000 pieces, one day is... He thought about it, about 800,000. No business has ever made more money than this business. If his brother-in-law told him that he had to control the pace and quantity of the shipment, he had already sent a box of tokens to Otis to consume, and he did not need him. Staying in this damn place waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
