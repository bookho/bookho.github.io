			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second week of the new year, at 9:30 am on Monday, in a huge classical auditorium next to the Imperial Palace, with a thick bell ringing, inside the hall The gentlemen and ladies have sorted out their dresses, checked the documents they carried with them, and entered two different doors. This is the venue for the party meeting. In the past many years, members of the royal family have watched operas or circuses in this place, and occasionally they have held dances here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the New Party came to power, it was transformed into a complex building with many functions, most commonly used for meetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor lobby is connected to three larger halls. The New Party and the Old Party have set up the venue for the party meeting here, and they can set foot on this place. It means that it is truly in the center of politics. Only politicians who can participate in party meetings are the real politicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the outside...but just getting started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus sits at the top of the huge round conference table, on the left hand side is the chairman of the New Party Committee, the Count of Odga, or a hereditary replacement. That kind of thing, but it is a pity that he personally cut off this hereditary replacement. Now there is no aristocratic identity. As people here often say, everyone is "equal." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second position on the right hand side of Magus is sitting on Powell. According to the truth, the ruling party’s party whip can be regarded as the third person of the ruling party. Sitting next to Magus, but because of some inexplicable problems, such as Powell's reluctance to sit with Magus, he is now sitting in the second position on the right hand side of Magus. The vice chairman of the New Party Committee, who was sitting there, sat next to Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of forty-eight seats in the entire conference room, and there are fifty-two seats on the wall. During the normal meeting, the party sitting against the wall People are not allowed to take the initiative to speak on the main topics and processes of the conference. Only when they enter the discussion process will they be eligible to raise their hands. Many people refer to such an intra-party meeting as "the forty-eight people on the tower". This is obviously a kind of ridicule and embarrassment, but it is very accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people sitting against the wall are always showing their intimacy to the colleagues sitting at the table. In fact, they don’t want to sit there chairs all the time. On, that is the real core! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry was sitting on the 19th seat. He was still a long way from Magus. He wanted to talk to Magus before the meeting, but he didn't know why Magus came late this time. It was time to enter the hall, and he did not have the opportunity to go with Magus first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone was in place and sat down, Magus gently patted the microphone in front of him, and the entire meeting room was quiet, only The breathing of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I am very happy to repeat it once again if I say no more than one hundred times. Thank you very much for being punctual." It is very important for us to participate in meetings within our party. It is for everyone. Next we will discuss some of the proposals submitted by the Imperial Parliament tomorrow, and some things that we need to decide, before the end of the meeting. I hope that everyone can try not to leave their seats, do not walk around and maintain the order of the venue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So next, we enter the conference An agenda, we will submit the final review, supplement and discussion of the draft anti-corruption bill of the proposal of the parliament tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Magus have just ended. The vice chairman of the New Party Committee sitting on his right opened the folder and began reading the draft of the Anti-Corruption Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill was first proposed by Maggs in July last year, and the Ministry of Justice subsequently added and finalized 33, 79, mainly The purpose is to restrict and limit the erosion, bribery, and purchase of capital officials against government officials! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether in economically developed regions or in underdeveloped regions, capitalists always wave their cheques to buy local officials and legalize themselves. Or illegal business escorting, through this means unrestricted expansion of their own power, against other people's business, resulting in some places there will always be a few or a dozen outstanding enterprises, almost completely monopolized the local The operation of the same industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at some reports alone, it seems that the economic construction of these cities is perfect. Perfect tax payment, perfect leader enterprise, perfect economic form. But all of this is false and deceptive. When a city's industry is controlled by individual companies, the damage is far more than the “constructive” they show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a kind of destruction, the destruction of red fruit, and the market that has lost its self-regulation will soon be on the verge of collapse because of the greed of these capitalists. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of submitting this legislative proposal is also to cooperate with the Anti-Industry Manipulation Act to strike against multiple unscrupulous capitalists at multiple levels. From the current social form, it may have a great impact. After all, the Empire did not have an accurate control over the "income" of officials. As long as they can build the city better, their personal legal and illegal income will not be included in the evaluation system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And people are used to obeying some of the rules of the aristocratic era, it is not normal to do something to spend some money? Even if you want to open up wasteland, you have to pay a little land for the nobility on the territory. Isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this set is no longer applicable to the current social form and the international situation. Officials are no longer like the nobles of the past, and may not be in their lifetime. In exchange for places, they tend to leave after a few years, and don't care if the cities they have run will leave huge problems because of some of their ruling methods. Anyway, as long as they did not break out when they were in position, as for the future, take care of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under such circumstances, it is imperative to formulate a set of laws that can bind officials and capital forces, and this agenda is at today’s meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Vice-Chairman of the New Party Committee read the draft of the Anti-Corruption Bill, the Vice Minister of Justice sitting on the wall stood up and he started for everyone. Explain the meaning of each piece of law and its standards. Every time one is explained, everyone will raise their hands to vote. If there is no problem, they will move to the next one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire process of interpreting the content of the bill lasted for nearly half an hour, with a slight modification and three additional clauses. The new party has passed all the members, and the rest is tomorrow. Formal submission and voting on the Imperial Parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second agenda is also about a new motion submitted by the Parliament tomorrow.", Magus took a sip of the cooled coffee and moistened the scorpion. "The Anti-Industry Manipulation Act has been compiled and supplemented over a period of time. It will add more content. After thinking with the colleagues in the cabinet, I decided to rename the supplemented bill to the Anti-Industry Monopoly Act. After the legislation was submitted, the colleagues of the Ministry of Justice explained the contents of this aspect carefully..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter about tomorrow’s imperial parliament has been said to be more than one o'clock in the afternoon, and Marques paused the meeting for a while, and everyone needs rest and meals. At two o'clock, the meeting continues. The following content is about the transfer of personnel within the party, the allocation of resources within the party and some other issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the favorite content of politicians who sit by the wall. Maybe they will sit at the table next time they come here for a meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powell, who had been silent for a moment, suddenly opened the microphone in front of him, and after a brief two murmurs, the people in the conference room looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the second party meeting last year, Powell barely spoke very much. I didn’t expect him to have something to say today, some people secretly look. Going to Magus, everyone now knows the "disharmony" between Magus and Powell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus smiled and looked at Powell and smiled and said, "What? Mr. Powell seems to have something to say, just today, everyone is here, everyone. May wish to hear what Mr. Powell wants to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powell couldn’t see any expression change on his face, he nodded. "Thanks to the leader for giving me this. The second chance...", he said the moment of this sentence, some people realized that today's meeting may be more exciting than usual, the grievances and unwillingness to express in this sentence, almost every statement. Magus smiled and couldn't seem to understand what Powell said about shit and kept looking at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have always had a problem. I don’t know if you have discovered that the age of our political party members has been trending from the past 50 or 60 years old. Young. I am not denying that young people are not good, but young people have not experienced more things, no more mature thinking ability, lack of a time accumulation, so often they usually perform well, but when something happens, it must be "The big thing." He chuckled, but no one in the entire meeting echoed his laughter. Even the politicians whose civilians were born were tightly closed. Today, he said that these words are not mad at them, so They will not make a statement until they have figured out the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powell looked at Magus. He said this to Magus. Magus smiled and pressed his hand on the edge of the table, backwards. Leaning on the back of the chair, "Mr. Powell, do you mean the mayor of Otis, Mr. Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
