			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any brothers and sisters in Amp, or a teacher or classmate who has a very good relationship?" Du Lin was trapped in the sofa and he raised his hand. Raise your finger, "or man and woman who likes him, man and woman he likes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing I think is possible after Chalin’s thoughts What he does not let go is Amp's "relatives", of course, it may be a classmate, a partner, a mentor, or even an opponent. At that time, Du Lin’s stocks in the Imperial Capital that caused many people to suffer economic losses spontaneously stood outside several official departments to demonstrate. In the face of the surging public opinion, the top empire pushed a high level and pushed Amp into the trap. Can't climb too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s hands and feet are very clean when doing these things, but no matter how clean the way things are done, it’s impossible to let people not “guess”. Idealism is a terrible thing. I think you are a bad person. You must be a bad person. Some people think that Du Lin has caused all this, so he hates Du Lin, and ignores that Du Lin has always been defending himself. The real killer of Amp is the deputy minister who recommended him, and him. Perseverance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this mysterious man is trying to avenge himself, and for whatever reason, he began to follow himself along Amp’s plan. Although knowing that this will not have much impact on him, it is still a very troublesome thing for Du Lin. It's like having a mosquito flying around him, occasionally screaming about his existence. Du Lin can kill the mosquito in a slap, but it may miss a mosquito behind the mosquito. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can find out this person, go to the ground to find out whether this tracing against him is a personal act, or an official or unofficial organization with a clear purpose Behavior is very important to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion of capital power to activate the "autonomous thinking" of imperial citizens, the emergence of feminism is only a result of long-term accumulation, all walks of life Trade union organizations, as well as more non-governmental forces, are constantly accumulating strength. The emergence of these people represents the progress of society, and it also means that society will move toward a "transparent society" that is not very bright. People's requirements for the social environment will gradually increase, which is actually not a good thing for Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people will stand up against something under the influence of certain emotions, and then force the official to make concessions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with the continual formation of new departments to suppress various organized crimes, Du Lin has a sense of urgency. He believes that he has long hanged names in these departments. What is lacking is only a suitable time. , a suitable opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more you are in this situation, the more you have to figure out who is a friend and who is an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin couldn’t have thought that Doolin had so many thoughts in just a few seconds, he thought for a moment and shrugged his shoulders, “according to my Zhianpu is not a gregarious person. He is always different from others. He can be said to be a transcendent person. This guy is not tempting, either in his early years of study or later in his work. Like..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp was a super school when he was at the Royal College, and his subjects were excellent. He used almost all his personal time in his studies, and his feelings towards the people around him were relatively indifferent. This made other students feel that he is not a good person. At the same time, some talented students think that Amp is a low-profile person. a performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially after the war broke out, when the students of the Royal College were passionately discussing the trend of the war and discussing how to defeat the enemy, at the Students’ Union At the party, Amp announced that he had joined the army and rushed to the front to fight for his country. It is like a group of young people who play the savior on the mouth, but Amp has given a mouth to beat them all, so he has no good friends and no good friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who hate him are too late, how can they become friends with this kind of person without a brain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the problem, the problem is great. After returning with the Medal of War and the merits, Captain Amp decisively retired and became a prosecutor. In a more humiliating way, the entire state’s prosecutor system was lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he is constantly cracking the old cases that are giving the prosecutor a long face, but in fact people compare him to other prosecutors. At its simplest, Amp has cracked a case of a chain of perverted murderers. The case was seized from the first case to the murderer for seventeen years. In the seventeen years, the imperial prosecutors lost to this perverted murderer again and again, but they were caught by Amp without much difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to proving that Amp is very powerful, it also proves the incompetence of other prosecutors from the side. The more cases Amp cracked, the less he was gregarious, and his own arrogance, the upper and lower levels smiled at him, but he was intimately greeting him and his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin heard of Amp for the first time, in amazed sigh, Kevin finished the life resume of Amp, he said this to himself. The opponent knows very well. Because it is an opponent, one day there will be face-to-face battles in the courtroom. There is no harm in understanding more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a good person, but he is in the wrong place!" Du Lin summed up for Amp. "You know him so much, go." Check to see if anyone has a very good relationship with him, so good that he can avenge him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin smiled at Du Lin, "瞧I will know from the horse that one day you will talk to me with this kind of voice. I am not a friend, is it a subordinate? I remember we said that I will not call you a boss!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to correct you, how to call me and our relationship has no connection, another point, we used to be friends, now is family! Kay Wen, you are my first non-Tern family, I cherish this, I hope you are too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin listened to it, I don't know what I thought. "So, should I be moved by the nose and tears now? Ok, well, I know, trouble you. Touching me with such numbness, I can't control it!", his mouth was slightly upturned, and he stood up with a cane. "Three days, wait for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice, who is inquiring about the news, is sitting in a rotisserie on the side of the road and eating barbecue. His eyes are on two people across the road. The two have been Du Lin gave his address a nephew. Ellis was not sure what the two men were doing, but they would never be with them. They may be protecting the bodyguards of Mr. Lapuan’s family, or they may be other people who have interfered with his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Averys is very serious, can be said to be a straight young man, Du Lin will explain his tasks, he will do his best to complete, so there is There are some modifications available. Originally, I saw a simple job in Doolin, but because of some other things, I had some small accidents, so that Ellis thought that if I didn’t take the two people away, he couldn’t quietly hear the pull. Mr. Pu’an’s address and family status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, Ellis found a local fellow church and borrowed a few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night replaced the day, the pedestrians on the street became scarce. The weather has turned cold, and it’s getting colder on the empty streets of the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two young people in their twenties are sitting in the rotisserie, they have a charcoal fire and an oven, and they roast themselves around the oven. Eat, so that you can fill your stomach, it can also bring a touch of warmth to the oven to dispel the chill in their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two people have already turned two laps here, and they have learned from the roadside business or the neighbor’s mouth by side-clicking, Mr. Lapuan is there. He is a salesperson who sells business for a steel mill. Some people still have some envy when they talk about Mr. Lapuan. Mr. Lapuan’s salary is very high, because he can say that he can sell a large amount of steel every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that they plan to change houses next year and go to the edge of the upper city to buy a better house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These information can only prove the existence of a "name" and the relevant information under the name. As for how to judge the specific content, they need to go in before they can Get the final conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the details, such as the location of the photo, the contents of the home decoration, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason they have not been in is that Mr. Lapuan’s wife and two children are at home, and they will go to school after Monday, Monday. Have plenty of time for them to explore the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, three or four young people poured into the empty barbeque shop, they sat aside, screaming for barbecue, one of them After a lap of cigarettes, I stumbled and then walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, friend, can you borrow a fire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at this The young man who came to borrow the fire was very honest, with a silly smile on his face that looked like it was harmless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
