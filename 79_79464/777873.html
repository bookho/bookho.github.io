			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke threw a huge fish bone of the size of a beef rib in a trash can, and he took a towel from the dog’s leg around him. The face wiped his hand and lost it. "This thing is delicious. Take one when you go." He ate a huge fish in the ocean. This fish has about five tons to eight tons after adulthood. In addition to the delicious meat, fish oil also has high economic value, and the refined oil is often used in precision instrument parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and glanced at his friends and asked, "Did you see Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp His friend shook his head and told the truth that Irene was so rare that he was rarely seen as a local, and he was also very interested in the events held here. Not only him, but also a lot of Irian’s celebrities came to the beach. He has already seen several. “You seem to be in a hurry? Don’t worry, you will definitely see him at noon. Today’s emperor’s people To come, Alexander gave them a lunch dinner, and Du Lin will definitely participate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Georges family’s feature agency is like a sale Commodities companies, only their products are time-sensitive "news." In this era of transportation and liaison is not convenient, it is difficult for people living in the north to know what happened in the south, so what should we do? The local newspaper printing agency or publishing house will purchase the news through the feature publisher and then re-edit or directly forward it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The George family was able to monopolize the newspaper industry to become the largest trust, and it was rooted in the three special syndicates in his hands, Syndicate, who held the vast majority of the news of the entire empire. Hotspots, if any news publisher wants to fool the reader by editing its own story, it must become his partner and buy a press release from his hand. Think about it. Hundreds of newspapers in the entire empire need to spend dozens of dollars or even hundreds of dollars to buy news from his hands every day. How much income can he earn every day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some newspapers themselves are very clear, as long as they send out reporters to get rid of the control of the George family, the problem is that a news of only five dollars is sent out. Is it worthwhile for a journalist to consume dozens of dollars across several cities or several states? Even some news is not interviewed by anyone who wants to interview, and it needs a certain relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the communication and traffic problems are not resolved one day, as long as there is no other tycoon standing up to face the George’s feature agency mechanism, the George family will continue to rule this. industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, for the Irian Food Festival, Alexander spent 3,000 yuan to invite reporters from the special publications to interview. It is conceivable that after the interviews with these reporters, most newspapers and publications that lack news content will be published in Yili tomorrow. Ann Food Festival news. Therefore, Alexander attaches great importance to this, and he will not hesitate to pay the price to receive the reporters of these special publications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke has no idea about the shallow depth of water in it. He smiled and grinned. "Well, then I will go around and eat at noon." When I went to the hotel directly," he separated from his friends and walked around with the dog's legs in the food festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke is a speculator, he has not received a high education, so sometimes it is somewhat unacceptable. He patted his ass and looked at the bustling beach. He couldn’t help but feel that his small kingdom was located in a remote part of the west. How could the eastern coastal area flourish? While sighing that you must move to a bustling place, you are also considering whether you want to build a bustling center in your own small kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he considered the feasibility of the incident, his dog’s leg licked his sleeve, “boss, look over there!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke was impatient and his thoughts were interrupted, but he still looked at the place pointed out by the dog's legs and his face suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-story and three-story visitors are watching the crew’s filming. Freena is tasting a food in front of the camera, and her face is filled with joy. There is no doubt that this is for the 50,000 temporary additions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director shouted after the stop and let the cameraman clean up the track and equipment, they will go to the city to continue shooting. It is not a loss to exchange 50,000 pieces for a two or three minute shot. After all, everyone thinks that this colored film will inevitably become a "classic" that can never be erased in the history of film. All of the first time is always the most memorable thing. In such a film with historical significance and great value, there are two or three minutes of footage. The director thinks that the advertising fee of 50,000 yuan is a bit less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freina is discussing the following shooting activities with the director, a look is a bit stunned, the guy wearing a t-shirt and a white hat squeezes from the crowd come out. His eyes swept away from the faces of each member of the crew and continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the reporter just arrived at the man to prepare to stop him, he pushed the record away in the palm of his hand, followed by someone standing in front of the record, almost his face pressed against his face, and his face was awkward. It’s about to feel like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Durin?", the man took off his hat and swept the trousers. The big thorn stood in the shooting scene. "I am looking for him." A little thing." His temperament and his attitude set off the fact that he is not like a good person. He developed a kind of temperament that he couldn't say in his own world. It was like a vulture, hazy and boring, and he was afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The travellers who were originally planning to leave have stopped again. It is the commonality of all human beings, or the commonality of intelligent creatures. Of course, some people feel that things don't seem right, and they ran towards the nearby temporary security guard post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a conversation between Freina and the director. She was not only the heroine, but also the producer, and also the film and Du Lin. The bridge between the connections, she has to and must stand up at this time. "Hello, I am Freena, do you have any questions?" It’s our investor, he’s not here right now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This uninvited guest is Luke, watching Freena’s delicate little face, the more he wants to get angry, The thing that was originally of my own was taken away by the guy named Du Lin, and the victim himself lost 500,000. The previous investment in Corinna was a soup. The woman is now as unreasonable as a madman. He is impatient. He has not been treated like this in his small kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment can affect a person's personality. Luke, who originally planned to sit down with Du Lin and talk about it, almost forgot his thoughts. Pick, "Isn't he here? Yes, take me to him!", he said that he reached out and grabbed the wrist of Freina. He has always been used to it, regardless of other people's ideas. And he thinks that Freina is just a actor with no fame, even if it is rude and barbaric, it is no big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena made two steps, said with a cold face, "Please pay attention to yourself." Luke raised his hand and swept the past. Although Freina had already raised her arm very quickly, Luke broke her hair and was brought to the ground with great strength. There were exclamations among the surrounding tourists, and some of the young people on the side of the crowd had a little admiration for Freena, and they suddenly crowded over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that Luke, a hostile from all directions, realizes that this is not his western kingdom. No one knows him here. He can't order anyone other than his own. Looking at the angry faces, he screamed, and the daunting gaze prevented a few young people who were eager to try, and then left the crowd with their dog legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone helped Freena, and she squeezed her smile and said that she had nothing to do, while finishing the broken hair. She was very wronged, and she felt that she had a black pot for Du Lin, and she had already had tears in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a policeman coming over to ask, the police chief and Scott have explained them, and it is necessary to ensure the stability of the food festival. If something goes wrong, they must be punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin "coincidentally" met Nasha and Chris, but this time it was different from the last time he saw Nasha, first with him. It’s not Chris, but Nasha, who is always very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have met, the last time I came.", Nasha’s opening remarks were very concise, and she looked up and down Du Lin, which was a bit rude. "Have we met before that? I mean at Tener, have we met or talked?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin Shake his head, "I'm afraid no, this is our second meeting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha did not think that he was true because of Doolin’s denial She took another step forward and lowered her head slightly, her eyes fixed on Doolin's eyes. "But I think we met, just in Tyne!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s pretending response was a surprise, then frowned and pretended to think, Nasha did not bother his memories, waited for a minute or two, Doolin insisted on the previous statement They have not seen each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, his heart was still a bit unexpected at the time, when Nasha was so drunk, even her clothes were stunned and she didn’t feel anything, she How did you think about this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Doolin’s negation, Nasha feels that Du Lin’s voice is so familiar, and the same familiarity with this voice is that she regrets. A lifetime of night! Her face changed, and the guess in her heart blurted out. "You were there that night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
