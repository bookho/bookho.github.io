			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the sizzling sound of the burning wood caused the people in the house to start tossing and turning, the temperature of the space increased quickly, and Alex was covered in sweat. Wake up in the violent cough, the whole house is full of smoke, even if it is one meter away, it has become blurred. He immediately pushed a wife around him, picked up the kettle on the bed and poured the water on his clothes. He covered his nose and nose with wet clothes and pulled his unconscious wife to the balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows on the first floor and the crevices associated with the outside world spurt black smoke, and a trace of flames looming in these smokes , a fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jumping down!", Alex snorted again, his wife woke up in horror, and she looked back at the bedroom with some panic. Alex knows what she is thinking, but it is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jewels that Alex gave her in these years have been placed in her dressing room, which has a lot of expensive clothes and jewelry, at least a dozen Million. In the study room next to the dressing room, there is a safe with more valuable things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how precious these things are, they are not as much as one in ten thousand of their lives. His wife immediately flipped through the guardrail and slowly lowered the guardrail on the balcony. Until the hands clasped the floor of the balcony, the legs had fallen to just over one meter from the ground, and then released their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire also alerted the neighbors. Someone had already reported the fire, and the siren of the fire truck in the distance was particularly harsh in the middle of the night. Alex doesn't know how Ed's situation is, now he can only manage himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of jumping from the second floor, several people rushed out from the main entrance on the first floor with a wet bed. Ed was awkwardly panting, water stains and dust from the air burning on his face painted a surreal painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can it be a fire? Did the kitchen fire in the evening forget to go out?", Ed took off his coat, wiped his face clean, and finally wrapped his jacket. Your own left hand. When he opened the bedroom door, his hand was burnt by the metal door handle, not very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex shook his head. "We didn't cook at night, it was a fast food called from outside.", who is kidnapped, who still has thoughts Slowly making a delicious dinner in the kitchen? Alex called some food directly from nearby restaurants, so the kitchen could not have an accident. And here is the upper town of Orodo, which is also developed by a very strong developer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fire alarm bell in the kitchen. Once the glass tube in the bell bursts due to high temperature, the bell will ring immediately. The alarm bell did not ring, indicating that there is no problem with the alarm bell itself, that is, the fire may be artificial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adults tend to have more mature ideas, not because they know what they are when they are old, but because they have experienced more, and have heard more, have Enough experience accumulates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brothers looked at each other and immediately realized that the fire was most likely to be related to the kidnappers who kidnapped Alex’s daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their goal may not be Alex's daughter, but Alex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide pulled Alex aside and whispered, "Have you recently offended someone?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the nature of Alex’s work will reach out to some large land developers, these merchants are tens of millions of investments, if their filings are Alex The card is a bit, maybe it can really do something like this. In this society, those big capitalists who are wealthy are either nobles or wealthy. Either they are from the road, and they have quickly completed the initial accumulation through bloody means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that there are no legitimate legal businessmen, but this kind of person is a minority after all, just like a very famous big capitalist in the empire, who is very good at being interviewed. Many times. He always repeats his resume and gives the general public a very positive and positive feeling, which is called the first generation of the dream of the Empire Dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally a farmer who made a living by planting pumpkins. He also often talks about his entrepreneurial experience at some similar tea parties or invited to students. Time to talk - I am a pumpkin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ignored how he became a famous big capitalist from a farmer who planted pumpkins because that history was not easy to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps someone in his time can still remember that there is a gang called Pumpkin Park... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex frowned and recalled the work during this time. He finally shook his head. "All the documents are finally approved in the hands of the governor. And I didn't get rid of other people's knives from behind, not because of these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Alex also put forward his own opinion, "Will it be the ghost of the lawyer named Kevin? We only had a conflict with him during this time! There is a Buddha called Vivien. The person who used to be a gang in the corner of Tener, then did not know how to make a fortune, is he doing it for Kevin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is this possibility..." Eide suddenly closed his mouth and a firefighter came over to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, I am very sorry, do you still have anyone left inside?", the firefighters need to confirm that everyone has escaped, and if so, they Just start the fire. If not, they will arrange for people to go in and search for the victims trapped in the fire – a lot of water vapor will affect their sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex reached out and shook hands with the firefighter. "You came very timely, there is no one inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firefighters are not very good at words, smiled and left, the water column has been poured from those broken windows, the fire is more intense, a burst of black smoke Out, there are a lot of lively residents around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brothers looked at each other, Alex went to his wife, and Ed called his man and took a car to find Vivi Ann. Whether or not this is called the Buddha, he will not let go of this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three abuses from the country...only! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood in front of the window on the third floor and looked at the villa on the opposite side of the community road that had become a ruin. The house with all-wood structure alternated between cold and hot. There has been irreversible damage, the fire in the house has been extinguished, but the house has also produced a slight tilt, and with the ugly twisting sound, one side has collapsed. The onlookers retreated a distance, and he also observed several people leaving the three cars to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha stood behind Du Lin, a dark red light in the faint light suddenly became red, and quickly annihilated, "You This method is quite useful. Now it is my turn to play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin adjusted Ed from the military district by kidnapping Alex’s daughter. Then a fire separates them. Now is the best time to start. Dooling didn't know where Ed went. He thought that Eide would most likely go to the hospital to find Kevin. At this time, if you don't doubt Kevin, then the two brothers are the mentally retarded duo. So Kevin has been transferred, and Ed will only go to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Be clean and neat, you can try to give him a decent way to die. After all, he is Vivienne's brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Dudu did not answer, smirked and then turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Alex looked at the fire where the fire had been extinguished. Please ask these firefighters to get his vault out, there are many important documents and some Valuables, other things burned him does not matter, the key is the things inside the safe, some can not go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years of sitting in the position of the Imperial Land Resource Management Office, Alex has also collected some benefits, in order to avoid forgetting who sent it in the future. Self-respect, who is disrespectful of his attitude, he recorded all of this in a small book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes newspapers will expose some corrupt officials and detonate their "books". Many people don’t know what emotions to use to face these corrupt officials. Under the "books", in fact, they just have no actual experience and experience. Some people have sent money but have not asked you to do anything. If you forget it in the future, it is very likely to be a problem. Or there are three or five people who give gifts in the day, and the things they send are different. It is impossible to open things when giving gifts, and the one-to-one display is for the corrupt officials who collect them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remember the wrong person who sent it, there will be problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at this time, they need a small notebook to record when they have collected what, what is the need of the other party, this is a corrupt person Required course! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of firefighters, his safe was finally found in the ruins and dragged out. He repeatedly thanked the firefighters and then let his wife stare at the safe, and then prepared to call to send a truck to transport the safe to another house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the child of the Governor, the descendants of the great aristocracy have great power, and he certainly cannot have only one house, just at this time, one The fireman came over to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All politicians can do it, that is a hypocritical smirk, he said thank you again, then quietly looked at the fire helmet Firefighters wearing firefighters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
