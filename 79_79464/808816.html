			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you dare to come here to see me?", Juan gnawed his teeth as he spoke, and every syllable seemed to have exhausted his strength from the cracks in his teeth. The same, his eyes are stunned, like a hook with a hook on Du Lin's body. "I can't wait to kill you to vent my resentment against you!" He took a deep breath and came. Du Lin sat down on the side of the sofa. "I have never hated someone like this, you are the first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn't care Smiled and laughed and asked: "I should be proud, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?", Juan kept himself as much as possible. In his sensible state, his hands clenched his fists on his knees and his body leaned forward slightly. This made the Buddha begin to pay attention to this guy. A blade that was only two inches long did not know where he suddenly fell into his fingers. Even if you look closely, you can't see the narrow and unspeakable blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan has no time to focus on the Buddha, he still looks directly at Doolin’s eyes, hoping to find something from Doolin’s eyes. "Why do you want to frame me? Is it not good enough for you? Is it not sincere enough? Even if we end up separating because of disagreement, it is because we have their own ideas. In the process of our understanding, I dare say I never thought about killing you! But you see, you have framed me more than once, set the trap and let me step on it. What is it all for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Du Lin was dumbfounded. He pointed to Juan. "If you want to know, then I will calculate it with you, lest anyone say that I am bullying the honest man. I am not willing to bear this crime." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, when we first cooperate, you want to press me. I have already invested in East Coast Entertainment. You still want to swallow it." This is the first point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Second, in our next cooperation, you always want to take the lead and get the initiative. But you forgot that this business is not your business, it is my business, but you forced it in and wants it. Exclude me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third, in order to achieve your personal shameless purpose, you even want to kick me out, so you chose us. Each company is established."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Juan, you are not innocent, you worse than me, but your bad last failed it is such a simple thing!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Juan muscles of the face and shook it "?? East coast entertainment company that Eric is the person you I am afraid that is a million eventually fall into your pocket it" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head. "I am not familiar with Eric. He also lied to me for running 200,000. I can't find him. It doesn't matter to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you dare to admit it?", Juan was laughed at by the shameless anger of independence. "You thought I couldn't break your ugly little." Thoughts? Because I saw it, I didn’t like you, I didn’t want to cooperate with you.” He licked his fist and squinted. “You are a villain, Doolin, you are a mean and shameless villain, I have never seen you like this scum! "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" each other to each other, "Herr tilts his head and look to the Al Aires! "I'm going to pour a glass of wine, I am a little thirsty." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "No, this is my home, all my things are, I do not Allowing you not to move anything here!", Juan angered, stood up, his face flushed, he snarled at Doolin, but Du Lin was still indifferent. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; his lower lip, "You are wrong, Mr. Juan, this is not your home, which is the bank's collateral, can make you live here Because you used to have a good relationship with the bank, it doesn't mean that you are different from me. We are all 'guests' here." He said with a brow, "Oh, yes, I suddenly remembered Is this operation in violation of the bank's regulations? I will talk to Mr. James about this matter, I hope you can find a place to put your family in as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Lier thought poured a glass of wine and placed it in front of Du Lin. Du Lin sat on the sofa and looked at Juan, who stood up and angered, but gave him the illusion that he was overlooking Juan. . He was carrying sip of the wine, "although you have to say is not a good person, but your eyes can still wine collection, and want to try it?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Juan didn't answer, staring at Du Lin with a gaze that wanted to kill Du Lin. "You will have retribution, there will be! I want to tell everyone about your true face, you are a despicable liar." It will be difficult to walk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Juan, you seem to have forgotten, I am the 'victim', I was kicked out of my plan by my business partner, people only have sympathy for me. And you, they will forgive your madness Language, and please remember that in this society, only if you have more wealth than others, you will have credibility if you say it. Otherwise...", he smiled, "all shit!" Hu 微<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan gasped slightly, he stared at Du Lin. "You don't care too much about Du Lin, they will take you away sooner or later, design You will be guilty of all this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Juan, we are different! You can be taken away, but I? Impossible, you "He's dead." He said suddenly, "You told me that old friends have forgotten what to do this time. As a friend, Mr. Juan, I decided to pull you. This is what I do. The friend’s last duty.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan was still angry, can hear this sentence When he froze for a moment, I doubt their own ears have a problem, or a problem with the Turin mind. The two have already formed a dead revenge. Now Du Lin has said that he wants to pull him. Who is crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan silently, Du Lin continued to say: "I asked people to estimate a price for your 'industry', the market value is about one hundred About 800,000, but you know, sometimes the market value does not represent money, it is only a price estimate. I will give you 1.2 million, leave the money with money, this is your last road." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said, is this the last one I pulled you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan really was Du Lin’s shamelessness was shocked. He also reacted at this time. In fact, all the performances of Doolin in the early stage were disguised. His real purpose is here. Buy those theaters from his hands at an ultra-low price! Du Lin didn't even think about cooperating with the George family. Everything he did was to get himself into this trap. Juan, who figured this out, didn't understand everything. Instead, he did not understand everything. More confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you spend so much money on Zhou Zhang and Kung Fu? What is the point of doing this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes were restored to the Qingming after a moment of confusion. "This is impossible, even if these industries are in my hands, even if I give them to others, I won't sell it to you, never!" When he said this, Juan suddenly felt a bit of pleasure. Hey, your plan fell through, and I let you fall through. The thrill of revenge has never made Juan so comfortable, and his mouth even picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up with his legs and shrugged his shoulders. "I am kind, but you don't seem to accept it. It doesn't matter, I believe you will accept it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Huan’s shackles are low: “Never!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got on the bus, he asked Du Lin softly, what is this? In a special sense, Du Lin smiled and did not confuse him. He only said "you don't understand." Yes, at least Du Lin seems that even if he explained, he did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy for people to break out of the power that ordinary people can’t imagine in desperation, if Juan can really squat and sell these resources to the George family, or Selling to other people, he will soon be able to make a huge sum of money. With this money, whether it is used to retaliate against Doolin or to re-develop elsewhere, it is a hidden danger for Du Lin to be unwilling to let him see. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, no more than before, when the people in the Imperial City have not paid attention to him, he did something that he could not see light and did it casually. However, those in the Imperial Capital have no evidence and conditions to summon Du Lin, so Du Lin can not completely solve the trouble of Juan with means other than "legal." As long as Juan is dead, he can prove that he is murder. As an "important witness" in the financial fraud case, people who have had conflicts with Juan will be included in the suspect, and they have the power to summon Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Juan always has to solve, but can not leave a handle, the only way is to give him hope, and then personally annihilate this hope. At that time, even if he did not collapse, I am afraid that it will fall into the abyss of despair, and will never climb again, and it is even more impossible to bring any substantial threat to Doolin. Waiting for the limelight to pass, find a chance to dispose of him, this matter will come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before that, be sure to find a way to hang Juan and give him hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Du Lin’s departure, Juan was suddenly desperate, just like seeing the light, he realized that he was not alone, regardless of the time is already late. Immediately, I called the lawyer of the George family delegation and said that he wanted to sell the theater resources in his hands. The representative of the George family will naturally not say no, this is what they hope. The two sides did not entangle for too long, the George family gave 1.6 million this price that Juan could not refuse, and reached an agreement on the phone, the other party will rush to Elian and Juan to sign the contract as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
