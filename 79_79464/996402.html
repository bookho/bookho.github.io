			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know how many slaves are in the western part of the empire?" Ten people shook their heads. They were not familiar with the empire, and they did not volunteer to come to the west. Compared to the West, their original idea was to go to the South or East China Sea. It is said that making money is simpler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin answered this question for them. He was in three fingers. "According to some unofficial statistics, it is not low in the western part of the empire." There are 300,000 slaves from all over the world. Many of these slaves, like you, left their hometown with great dreams, wanting to make a difference and change the fate of themselves and their families. But they are all here now, both It’s better to die in the mines in the west, and become slaves!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Du Lin’s blundering, he’s been doing it on the East Coast. The sale of smuggling channels is still a bit of an understanding of the other ways of life on the sea. The most worthwhile thing about this is the smuggling of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These professional population trading organizations are recruiting around in some countries that are poor or backward or frequently in war, taking advantage of the local people’s desire to change their lives and destiny. All kinds of good-speaking sayings such as high salary, high welfare and high treatment have attracted a large number of people who are willing to go abroad to work. They will sort and classify these people, and the name is also very simple - different jobs require different types of work, the industry must need those strong and strong, and the light industry recruitment is sure to be a delicate and patient girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the finer, there are, but not many, if the locals listen to their deception, believe it is true, basically can not escape the slave to the end. These population trading organizations will conduct a physical examination of “going to a big city”. When they get on the bus, they will find that they are not going to be a big city, and they are not doing physical examinations. Instead, they are the beginning of their miserable life. They will be assigned a number like a farm animal and then divided into more specific organizations on the next level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they will enter the quarantine process, and although the sale of the population is illegal, everyone is still very responsible. It is not responsible for these people, it is responsible for money, and once there is an infectious disease in the closed environment of maritime transport, the epidemic will basically die if it spreads. Such losses are unwilling to be encountered by any organization and are not willing to try. So there will be a very strict "quarantine" process. Then they will separate those who have gone to school, have a little culture, and ordinary people, and do not give these people a "commodity" riot that may not know what will happen later by language or intimidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a joke to have a riot in the sea, because even if it is a population trading organization, it is impossible to find support anytime, anywhere. In the event of a riot, there is only one end to these goods, and that is death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the place is over, these goods will be sold to those who need slaves for hundreds or even more, and these major consumers are not The west is in the south, on the east coast, and in all economically developed regions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the selected ones will be thrown into the west to be disposed of as garbage. A person’s head is tens of dollars, and several people count the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a non-existent transaction, only need to pay some management fees, bear a little shipping fee, and then it is huge profits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The western cheap slaves will not be valued by all the miners, nothing more than a few dozens of slag money - if you open a gold mine, you may only have one life. Value the price of a piece of gold ore! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out a box of cigarettes from his pocket and ordered one. The cigarette was sandwiched between his fingers, and the movement of his arm as he spoke The rising smoke is constantly changing. "I always believe that the moment when everyone is born is equal and there is no difference. The slave should not appear in this world. This is the retrogression of civilization, gentlemen. You have experienced this kind of pain and suffering in person, and you should know more about the despair of these people than I do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was born in the country, my father, My grandfather and even my ancestors were all farmers. I want to change my destiny, use my hands, I chose to challenge the fate to arrange for me. I am very lucky, I did it. Then I started to think, I should Do something meaningful, because money, power, and status should not be the whole of a living person. I should have a more noble pursuit, and then I decided that I would challenge myself and challenge the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "I want to lead all oppressed people, those who are enslaved, and those who are treated unfairly to do something. Even if we are broken, at least we face the injustice of fate and face the indifference of society and do our best to growl." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I came here and came to the west, I realized that there was such a barbaric act in the civilized world. It was terrifying." It’s cold sweat!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I once complained why I would come to the west. Why don't I stay in a more prosperous place, see you, see the people below, I understand why the gods let me come here!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s tone became very hot. “Because there are you, because there is something I need to do, so the gods chose me, let me see and let me come. Change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you may ask, why do I not release all the slaves here immediately?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this question is thrown out, the ten people who are still willing to believe have some intentions, because this question points directly to the key point of all the words in front of Du Lin. Since you want to change, why not make changes immediately? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Du Lin’s speech that he is fainting, but he must say it now. He said it and told others that even if every word and every word have the same tone, the feelings for people are different. Putting it in the hands of others, this may be the edge of destroying Doolin's "hypocrisy" face, but he said it himself, that is to protect his toughest shield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because even if I immediately released these people outside, I just saved these people, and there are 300,000 slaves waiting for the light in the west. On the day when I entered the black mine hole, I couldn’t release 300,000 slaves. I don’t have this power. Even if I die, I can’t do it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;" Moreover, even if I release them now, it may not be a good thing for them, because this is not your hometown, not your country. Many of the stubborn people here have accepted the shameful beast. Acts and thoughts. Maybe these people outside can get back to less than one-tenth of the family, and others will die in the western part of the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need What is done is to change, change people's minds, put the beasts in cages, and release civilization from the box made of gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the day 300,000 people who are accepting unfair treatment can usher in the true sunshine "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you, will be the warriors who will return the civilization, this is what I saw from you!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have the good qualities that everyone will praise, firm, tenacious, courageous, persistent... and only with your help, can I bring change to the west. Gentlemen, your work should not be in the mine. Instead of digging the ore, the cave used to fight for the 300,000 victims of barbaric enslavement in the western world to fight for a return to civilization and to the bright road!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will tell you what to do, will point you in a direction, and then you can only see your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I know this is a very presumptuous request, but I also hope that after you have empathy, you can think for the slaves who are suffering in the west. When you are put together by Andorra in chains, they are locked in the mine. When I work, I am also looking forward to the light with everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods brought me here because of you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can, I hope we can change the West together, change the empire, change the world, make the world less torture and pain, a little warmer and more sunshine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is A very hard, even life-threatening career, if you are willing to do something with me, stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't want to, I will still According to what I said, give you and the locals almost the same treatment, let you continue to work here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A full of thorns, doomed not The road that is not peaceful is not at your feet. You have the right to turn back, but believe me. Going on this road, you are greeted with a future that is many times more brilliant than you expected!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten young people in the room may come from different continents, different countries, different cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may have different beliefs that are completely different or even completely opposite, and some may have no faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, at this moment, in the second that seems to be frozen, they forget all the beliefs of the past and forget that they used to be in the mine. The God who is constantly praying in the cave but unable to do it, the Lord who rescues them is not the god they believe in, but the person in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
