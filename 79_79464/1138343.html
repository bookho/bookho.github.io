			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Chap open?", Rani sat on the sofa after finishing the day's work, and the busy work made him physically and mentally exhausted, mainly spiritual. Aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must be between the hard-working lawyers, trying to put out some of the things he wants from the mouth of their agent, although this is very Limited, and most of the time there is no utility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Chap seems to have become an important core for solving the case. Rani feels that he should turn his direction and continue to make Chap open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he communicated with the Ministry of Justice. If Chap is willing to cooperate with the investigation, they will give Chap a guarantee of pardon and ensure that he is on trial. Safety before the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for after? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is his own business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...", the agent he was facing was awkward and his face was not good, which made Rani realize that something unexpected might have happened. Things, he immediately sat up straight, his expression became serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his gaze, the agent can only tell the truth, "Chap is dead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Rani did not immediately anger, but frowned and asked, "How did he die, did the murderer catch it?" In fact, Chap’s death at this time is not necessarily a bad thing, because Chap The refusal to cooperate also caused everyone to break their brains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Chap’s death is exchanged for an assassin who might speak, this is also positive for the investigation, especially Rani’s inner heart. When I thought that this might be Doolin’s handwriting, there was still a bit of calmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s intervention will pick up his unlucky egg between Du Lin and Magus, which is a good thing for him, of course he Will not show it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent continued to keep awkward. "We are not sure if he was murdered. The forensic doctor has already done a basic identification. They think that Chap is It was suffocated. Today's meal is a bit hard and dry, and it is stuck in his throat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chap naturally secretes saliva and esophagus The intestinal fluid moistens the bread, makes them swell, and destroys some subtle evidence. With the disappearance of the bald cook, the investigation bureau cannot put all the blame on itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They won’t admit to Rani that Chap’s death is entirely caused by the incompetence of the local investigation bureau, they need to excuse themselves, then obviously die Accidents are the most appropriate excuse. Of course, they did not give up the tracing work of the bald cook, and also reported these matters to Rani. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rani gave the local investigation bureau a "waste" evaluation, and then summarized the news and reported it to Magus, who gave him a The unexpected reply is to let him contact Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reply can be said to be very unexpected, because Rani always thought that this was a disagreement between Magus and Doolin. I didn’t expect it. Behind the investigation, Du Lin did stand, but Du Lin stood on the investigation team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasingly complicated situation made Rani’s brain start to be a little bit uncomfortable. He called Doolin on the basis of Magnus’s embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation is like this, and now our investigation work is in a deadlock. Lord Maggs thinks that you may be able to make a breakthrough for our investigation work. So, there is this phone call.", Rani's tone is not intense, on the contrary, it is still very dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may have something to do with his status. The Imperial Tax Administration is itself a slightly insignificant department, at least in the past. It was not until the establishment of the SAR in the city of Otis that it was a little better. The huge tax revenue from the city of Otis every year made the Imperial Taxation Administration look good. They could not solve all the financial needs of the imperial economy every year, but at least they could solve it. In part, this made Rani's life a little better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you want to let him take the initiative to detect this case, he may not be so worried. From the current situation, it involves this. The composition of the personnel in the case is very complicated. There are local gang leaders, well-known entrepreneurs in the city of Otis and even in the middle of the empire, as well as politicians in the emperors and other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
