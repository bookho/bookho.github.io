			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state government’s response is very fast... No, it should be said that the response of the farmer is very fast, according to the “three guarantees policy” agreed between him and the locals. The death compensation will be compensated according to the upper limit of the compensation clause in the current law of the empire, that is, 8,000. Ten people are 80,000, and one hundred people are 800,000. According to more than 300 people reported by Mr. Roel, this will be a compensation of 2.4 million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,400,000 is not a small number, and many people can’t see the one-fourth of the two hundred and four hundred thousand in their lifetime. Now the money is about to be taken out of the pocket of the doorman and become the money in the pockets of others. The only thing he was fortunate was that he had ordered the current compensation to temporarily stop the direct issuance, and must investigate the cause of the accident before making the payment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a natural cause, so according to what everyone says, money will be handed over to these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for natural reasons, it’s worth discussing the amount of money, which is also a way for the doormen to think about saving themselves, and his inner bell Also rang. This is obviously a premeditated "accident". If he can't come up with reasonable evidence to prove that the accident has other insider, he must pay the full amount of money. This will allow some people to use their pockets as a bank to withdraw money anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roel mining accident has caused many problems for him, and the impact in the west is very bad, but it also gives the doorman a rare opportunity. As long as he can find traces of the traces left by Roel, those who are ready to move will calm down, because they may not be able to get the money easily! The doorman will let them know how stupid it is to attempt to save money from his pocket through this naive means. He will definitely let Roel regret coming to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rescue team arrived at Roel Mining, they said that there was no way to complete the rescue operation in a short period of time, according to some people who escaped from the mine hole It may be that the pulverizer exploded due to improper operation, causing the frame inside the mine to be broken, and then a large area of ​​landslide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the bauxite mine has a "soil", it does not mean that the bauxite form is like mud or sand. Dig out on the wall. Moreover, it is impossible to have a complete deposit under the mine. As the geological changes, large stones may appear. At this time, the crusher will work. Put the pulverizer on the surface of these large stones and start the pulverizer. The high frequency and high intensity vibration can quickly crack the stone and then transport it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better the performance of the pulverizer, the greater the risk. It is necessary to know that the catalyst that reacts violently reacts with the high energy generated by the twin crystal in the closed metal kinetic energy bin. If it cannot be released, it is likely to explode. . According to the instructions of the crusher, this stuff is always harmless, because the kinetic energy will push the crushing head to work when the violent reaction occurs. However, if there are some problems in the process, such as stone debris or mud stuck in the connecting rod, the power in the kinetic energy bin can not be released, and death will come! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing can't be said to be common, but it is definitely not a rare thing, so the grinder in the mine is used by someone, and the maintenance is done to avoid similar Accident. Even if the mining is a slave, a very professional local miner will be arranged to take charge of this matter. It is necessary to know that once a problem such as a landslide occurs, the manpower, material and money consumed by re-opening the mine hole are Those who do not want to see it will seriously delay the quantity and time of mining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if nothing happens, slaves are slaves, and shredders need money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stuff is more expensive than slaves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rescue team discussed the mine for a while and felt that there was no need to rescue it. It took at least a week to dig the mine hole with the existing machinery. time. Those who were buried deep in the mine in a week were starved to death if they were not crushed to death. In the end, Roel and the rescue team and representatives of the state government jointly signed the abandonment of emergency rescue measures, and also announced that there were no survivors in the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can save the rescue team a lot of money and get a safer rescue environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to dig all the holes slowly, and on the third day, a body was dug up. The body had long been under the pressure of great pressure. His face was filled with blood holes pierced by sharp stones. The only one that could distinguish his identity was the dog tag on his neck. With the discovery of this corpse, more and more corpses were gradually dug out, and the more the corpses were destroyed, the more they were destroyed. In the mines below about 50 meters, basically the bodies were A soft, large piece of meat, if it is not the skin that wraps these pieces of meat together with the bones, it may not even be visible to a human figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 266 certified bodies were dug up in half a month, and now Roel put the baton on the doorman Hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still not paying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin would have liked to go to see the excitement, Roel is still very smart, perhaps the word cheating will be born in this matter. However, it is a pity that his excitement can't be seen, but he has to be seen by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of the Imperial Capital sent him a summons to enter the court of the Imperial Supreme Court before 9:40 am on Wednesday, and he will be against him. The accusation of Donald and the Cape family of the first trial of his attempt to assassinate the attempted attempt. During this time, all the things were run by the lawyers, so he didn't know much. If it wasn't for the summons, he didn't know that things had progressed to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why the lawyers team dragged down as much as possible in order to drag the first trial of the case to more than a month. They constantly submit evidence and modify the evidence. The Emperor of Life empire can see what these people are doing, but he does not like the attitude of these lawyers to the law and the court. Finally, they have to tell them that if they play this set of tricks, they will either withdraw the case or directly pronounce it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the lawyers team ended the happy time of fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just got off the steam locomotive, the representative of the lawyers group greeted them, and after they greeted each other, they walked outside the station and said About the matter of the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This life-time judge took the initiative to ask us to enter the trial process, so the time was delayed by nearly a month than we planned, we have studied your side Evidence, witnesses and testimonies, it is not easy to drag the case down in court. For this reason, we have worked very hard and time to develop the current plan...", the representative of the lawyers group is also The major shareholder of the law firm is habitually exaggerating the "difficulty" of the case, but he forgets that his clientele is not the ordinary rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s foot stopped and stopped looking at the lawyer who had gone back three or four steps before returning. “I’m not giving you money to tell you guys. How hard it is to do, you just let me see the result." He looked at the lawyer intently. "If you are going to waste your tongue on this worthless thing, I will consider changing a lawyer's group." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious face of the lawyer immediately changed into a smile. "I think I understand, Mr. Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed to him before continuing Take the pace and move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two people left the station, some people greeted them. They were the presidents and agents of the Imperial Capital. They were accompanied by Du Lin last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't take your car, I will go to the court at 9:20 tomorrow morning, I will leave beforehand, goodbye!", he clicked Heading toward another car parked on the side of the road, which made the representative lawyer somewhat dissatisfied, but looking at the agency fee of 800,000, his dissatisfaction quickly disappeared. As long as he has money and is willing to give him, then he has nothing to accept, even if the money is too high, he has to pay for the customer to discuss all day, even if the last two are tired in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just preparing to take his eyes off, and the glimpse of the corner saw a patrolman sifting a luxury car, which is the latest urban law issued by the Royal Capital, namely "Russian congestion road vehicle parking rules." <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more people in the city, and vehicles are often found in some areas with dense traffic, such as the city’s downtown, stations, commercial distribution centers, etc. Arbitrary stops cause traffic congestion. After the eleven hearings, the emperor issued this rule, and the temporary stop time of vehicles on designated roads is not allowed to exceed fifteen minutes. Otherwise, it will be punished by multiplying the excess time by ten dollars, and the maximum limit is one thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule was strongly protested by car owners, but in the face of more car-free people, it is clear that they are not strong enough. To this end, the mayor of the city has carried out a special equipment laying on these roads. Once the temporary parking space is stopped, a timer will be activated. After fifteen minutes, the panel will turn red and continue to time. On every road that is easily congested, there will be patrols on the road. The patrol will find the red timer and copy the license plate number and record the number according to the timer number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timer will not change back to its original color when the vehicle leaves, staying red and timing outside the normal parking time, the patrolman needs to use the key to screw it Can be reset. Then the license plate number and time of the violation of the rule overtime parking will be sent to the Imperial Metropolitan Police Station, and the owner will be notified to pay the fine. If the owner refuses to pay the fine, the police will file a lawsuit and will not only have to pay a fine but also go to jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
