			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff’s gaze was taken back from the street, and it was a pity that he continued to wipe the display in Doolin’s office with a rag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several large construction sites nearby. Every day, a lot of floating dust comes in from the window and falls on these old furnishings and furniture. If you don't rub it, you don't need an hour or two to get a layer of white floating ash. If you rub it, wipe it once every hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, closing the window can solve these troubles. The problem is that the old house itself does not have a wall cooling circulation system. Once the window is closed, the room is hot. It's like an oven, and it will soon be unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that some people have been fainted in the downstairs, but it is timely to find out, otherwise it is really possible to have problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hot finished?" Du Lin lay on the dilapidated sofa and looked at the ceiling and asked. From the time when Dove suddenly turned his attention to the window, he knew that there would be a lot of excitement outside. He didn't care what happened, he just wanted to rest and rest now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous work made him exhausted, and this time he understood where the fatigue of the officials came from. No matter what happens, you must stick to your position, because you don't know when someone will call, and you don't know if the person who called is a big person or a small person. What they say is important or not important. Plus, in the case of Doolin, it can be said that it is a trivial matter to ask for, so this time is really embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff’s nose squeezed out the sound of “Well” and continued to wipe the display cabinet on the right side of the Doolin desk against the wall. There is actually nothing to show in it. In addition to a "Certificate" issued by the four layers, it is commended that the Otis leader has repelled the evil thieves and is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talk to me, what happened?" Du Lin changed his position, lying on his side, his head resting on his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually a small door not far from the side, there is a lounge after the small door enters, which was in accordance with the "standard" when building the town hall building at the time. Built. There is a small lounge in the main city management member office in each city's town hall. There is a bed in the lounge, a separate bath room, a desk and a bookcase, and there is no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original bed, Doolin, was already lost, and almost all of it was emptied by insects. Finally, the worms were starving to death. When they were thrown out, they fell on the ground and shook them. The dried worms were like sunburn. The dried wheat kernels flowed out of the breach and scared Natalie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a bed inside, Du Lin doesn’t want to go to sleep. He thinks that sleeping on a sofa is actually more comfortable than a bed. Maybe it’s because the sofa is cowhide, more than a bed. Cool a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devo wiped the display and said: "Mr. Chester and his follower who had just left had a little trouble at the door, Chester's The class was broken, and then someone came and opened them. Now they are in the cold tea shop diagonally across the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin is time Of course, urban public transportation is always a big fat. Many citizens stupidly think that the city hall will suffer, and then curse those who have obtained the right to operate. In fact, there are many doorways. This situation is better in Irian. Irian is a tourist city. All things related to the image building of the city are the most important. Therefore, the operation right of public transportation is still in the hands of the city hall. The operation of public transportation by the City Hall is naturally cost-effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in other places, including the Imperial City, the right to operate public transportation is tightly held by businessmen. Like Mr. Chester, who just appeared, he came up with the idea that if the City Hall subsidizes 20,000 yuan a month, they are not only willing to return it to Duolin privately, but also willing to take out five points and ten points. the benefits of. The former is for Du Lin, the latter is for the city hall, and it is also the city development supporting the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is no idiot lunch under the sun. If Du Lin is willing to accept this condition, then at least before he leaves the city of Otis, the public transport operation right must be Chester and all the bosses behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So some things are absolutely not as simple as they seem to be, Du Lin has no interest in this proposal, he is not here to make money, but It is to lay a solid foundation for the future, so he will not touch the corruption, and even if he is willing to touch, no one can afford the price that makes him feel excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chester then made a suggestion, that is, not to subsidize the city hall, still give the city hall ten points, but in terms of management and operations, The City Hall has only the power to direct and advise, and does not have the power to intervene in practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Du Lin agreed, and if Chester and the boss behind him did not do this well, there would be some "furious citizens" to let them know that they had offended the public's end and price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Chester was chosen as the first short-listed representative was because the tenders they gave were serious and serious, and they were not meaningless things like the format. It is their attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They promised to introduce twenty new buses for operation immediately after winning the bid, designing four lines to ensure that there is a shuttle for no more than fifteen minutes. Passing the upper and lower stations. Moreover, they will eliminate the passenger cars in service every five years. This is very sincere. The 20 cars are worth about 300,000. If they are eliminated in five years, they will use their own knife to cut meat on their own bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin likes those who are happy and sensible, so let them be the first to be shortlisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked up at Defu, Dove just bent over and rubbed Duolin’s chair, and the short skirt wrapped the arc for Du Lin. With such a moment of disappointment, he soon returned to God. "You also wiped the day and took a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff straight up and rags After wiping it clean, put it in a cool place, and it will take a long time to dry in the current temperature. After she dumped the sewage, she suddenly sat on the opposite side of Du Lin with a blushing face, slightly containing the lower jaw, which made Du Lin realize that she might have something to say and immediately sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boss, I am very grateful for the job you gave me, and I am very careful to do my best to do my job." She spoke I haven’t watched Du Lin at the time, which made Du Lin’s mind guess what was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devo actually has some understanding of Doolin. After all, he has lived together for more than a year. Although nothing has happened, he can live in the same day every day. Under the eaves, many things can't be hidden. She knew that Doolin didn't like to bend around, so she said the words directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One thing makes me very embarrassed, it is like this, you know that I have a brother and a brother, my brother has a job now, but my brother... "", her mouth slightly raised, she looked a little bit reluctant. "He hasn't worked yet. His parents have been asking if he can get him to work here. It's not important to live, sweeping the floor, and so on. Give less, mainly to train him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called exercise is actually just an excuse. Du Lin knows very well that this thing is not so clear when it is unnecessary. Perhaps in the Defu family, the daughter is working for the richest man. The salary of one month is 120, and they all catch up with the income of the whole family. Everyone will not disapprove of this money. It is even more unlikely that they will feel more money. In their opinion, Doolin can give Dev such a high salary. Maybe there is something between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the lost and the things that should not have been lost have been lost, it is better to create more value for your family, such as let her brother also Doing things for Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister can take one hundred and twenty for a month, and the younger brother takes half of the head office? In this way, the two brothers and sisters add up to one hundred and eighty, which can be regarded as a middle-to-high-end income in the middle class. In the future, if the daughter has such a trace that she may become the wife of Doolin, it is good to have her brother to help her. So from the beginning of the city of Dove to Otis, I have been writing to urge her to implement this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now because the phone line is connected, she called a phone call last night to let them not send a letter every day, so it will inevitably give people a A very strange impression, I did not expect her parents to tell her that her brother had left the day before yesterday, and estimated that today or tomorrow will be able to reach the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people coming, she doesn't want to say it, or she can't drag it, she can only say it with a hard scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn't like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his dreams, he has always possessed hundreds of billions of assets, but his wife, his cousin What are the cousins ​​and more relatives doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dry warehouse manager, and still the kind of "comic you play" warehouse. Daxie specially built a large warehouse for the placement of these relatives. There are four warehouses in total, and every day there is something to pull in, and there will be something to pull out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, these tightly packed boxes are filled with sand and stones. These boxes go from here and will be unloaded in another warehouse after about one kilometer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this is to prevent these relatives from using the relationship of relatives to dictate the company's affairs, but also to take care of the feelings. According to the relationship between generations, the highest month is seven or eight thousand, and the least is three or four thousand. Nothing is needed all day, just stare at the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
