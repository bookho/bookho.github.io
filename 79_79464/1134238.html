			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin also did some research before making free decisions for elementary and high school education. At present, the total population of the Abiluo area is about 1.3 million, of which the educational age is about 300,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But less than one-eighth of those who are truly educated, that is, only 30,000 to 40,000 are eligible for education, and the population that is educated In the middle, the number of people receiving advanced education will be further attenuated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of families let their children drop out of school after they have finished primary school, even if they are not high, they will be able to go to high school, and they will be able to go to college. Less. The lack of educational resources leads to the lack of teachers, which is the cause of the other. The other reason is the contradiction between the cost of expenditure and household income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the current educational rules of the current empire, the cost of completing a child from high school to high school to college is about 6,000 to 7,000. Before the university, that is, from primary school to high school, this stage needs about 2,700 to 3,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average income per capita in the Ambiou area is low, the average family is calculated by two people, and each family’s monthly income is about 80 to 100. Blocks are not equal, which is significantly lower than the wage level of developed cities in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Ilyan’s minimum monthly income has risen to 63 and 70, but in Anbilouo it is only between 40 and 50. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After removing the reasonable expenses necessary for families such as eating and drinking, each family can only provide one or two children to complete basic and intermediate education, and wait until At the university, most families can't afford more than a thousand tuitions per year, so there are only two universities in the eleven cities in the eight cities of the whole state, and the two universities in the empire are not ranked in the rankings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, these numbers come from the very magical word of "per capita." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the depth of educational resources in the Ambiou area and increase the number of school-age populations, it is imperative to implement free education. The potential of an area is mainly due to the degree of industrialization and education. If Du Lin wants to produce a perfect answer in the next eight years, then he must increase the proportion of these two aspects! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a lot of money, but he doesn't mind. He will issue a series of policies to encourage private capital to invest in education. For example, funds invested in educational resources can be used as part of the tax. Duolin itself is a big taxpayer. There is no connection with his promotion of free education, at least he thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin shouted for free education, the cowboys in the square were stupid and embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is the most backward and remote part of the empire, people can still understand how terrible the impact of education on the future of life, and they are constantly Show the gap in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who has only attended elementary school can only do the most basic work after adulthood, in exchange for a modest reward by selling physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a high-end knowledgeable person with a degree at a university is very likely to squeeze into the middle class of society in the five to ten years of entering the society. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income of high-end knowledge talents will be that these can only be said to have experienced literacy education, only the income of basic knowledge residents is dozens or even more than 100 times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that any family wants to make a huge change is to climb to a higher social class and upgrade to class. Only a huge change can happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not poor, if it’s not backward, and who wants to have your own child, like yourself, bend down in the farmland in the cold winter or the hot sun, in the pasture Is life like a dog in a mine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even even more tired than a dog, there is no dog to eat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just liked Du Lin before, now, there is a firm, want to support him, the impulse to vote for him can even Said to be a belief! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Du Lin, I understand the free education you said, but who will solve the money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Someone raised this question, which is also normal. Any policy will be questioned to a certain extent before it is promulgated and implemented, and even a dozen to dozens of hearings can be determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disagreement means that the people have ideas, this is a good thing..., yes, good things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and answered the question. "Part of this money goes from the finances, if the finances don't allow it..." he said After a pause, many people held their breath, and he pointed to the sky again and shouted in a very firm tone. "Then I will come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A bang of the whole square is boiling up, many people can't believe their ears, what the great Mr. Doolin just said, he wants to make the money, but does he know how much this money is? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in fact, this is also a misunderstanding of free educational resources. The entire western region is currently registered and has less than 1,000 teachers, so they are one. Ten thousand people are better, they are ten times more than the total number of people, and their wages are increased to normal levels. The salary that needs to be paid every month is seven or eight hundred thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the cost of various depletions and repairs in various schools, including the necessary physical education resources, and the expenditure on education per month is about one hundred and twenty About 100,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, please note that this number is a figure that has been turned ten times. In fact, in the current situation in the west, there are 100,000 pieces per month. It is already very amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have more money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much, just Du Lin’s taxes on business taxes paid every month in Irian’s, more than three million, and With the rapid growth of TV Group's business, this number is very likely to break the 5 million mark next year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TV Group headquarters was moved to the Ambiou side, and then the funds invested in education offset the tax, and Du Lin also earned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these people in the square are not clear about this. Their only thought at this time is that the greatness of Doolin is too much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an old man with a cane walked under the escort of several young people to the podium. At this time, it is really necessary to have such an old man. He absolutely It’s not an actor or a local, it has a high prestige. When the old man was young, he worked as a local police sheriff and did a lot of big things. Some of these things have been adapted into a script to make a movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood under the podium and looked at Doolin. The wrinkled and slack muscles on his face slid down to the side as he looked up. There was a thrilling glow in the muddy eyes. "Mr. Doolin, you can come to us. Commit and promise that you will not deceive us, will you fulfill your promise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand, facelessly facing the microphone, at this time At this moment, it seems that there is only one voice in the whole world. "I swear, in the name of my surname, the first king and the gods, I promise that every sentence I have just said is true, as long as I can become the state of Abilulu. Governor, this will be my first regional policy to be enacted and will be written into local law!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a cowboy unloads his back The shotgun carrying it, shot a shot at the sky, and shouted a "Du Lin", the entire square instantly became the world in the dream of Doolin, the country, the day called "year." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the different sounds produced by different types of firearms fired one after another, people pulled the trigger, whistled or shouted Du Lin’s name. Rejoice in everything he said and the future he can expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly Du Lin realized that perhaps the former governors, including the current governor, were not inaction, but they were too afraid of such a scene. There are the most tempered cowboys here, as well as completely uncontrolled firearms. The bullets that fly around are the real melody here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes it here, likes people’s love for him, likes the bullets to tear the whistle of the air, he also believes that here will be a paradise, really Happy land! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Ambilou! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the world of Doolin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s ridiculous!" The current governor listened to Du Lin’s speech and everything that happened on the spot, and couldn’t help but say this. words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, in terms of a politician with normal mentality, normal thinking ability and normal three views, his evaluation of Doolin is in place. It’s ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
