			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought that Kevin would spend most of his time working and eating in Otis. After all, he did this in the past few years. Like the paradise that Kevin pursues, he has everything he needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin’s action really made Du Lin a little surprised. This kid, in addition to going to the court every day to look at some books sent from the emperor’s side. He rarely went out to relax. Sometimes he only asked Du Lin to find a bar to drink some wine on weekends. He talked with some technical girls about how to make their technology to a higher level. For this reason, Kevin did not hesitate to go there. demonstration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Doolin’s view of Kevin a bit different. In fact, Kevin is a very capable person, he is only obscured by his own success. See the eyes of the road ahead. Now he has found this direction, so he will run wild again in this direction, no longer confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the file is constantly appearing in front of Kevin. He uses his position as a lawyer to analyze these files, and then he The judge’s position looks at the debates of both sides before making their own judgments and sentencing standards. I have to say that lawyers and judges are different. When he is a lawyer, he has only one choice - to help his employer to win the most "justice" and then let "justice" fall into the other's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judges are completely different, inferring from the confession, expression, attitude and details of lawyers and witnesses, the most realistic way of the case, and then giving a fair and reasonable Referee results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very difficult, very difficult, this is not a beauty pageant, beauty or ugliness at a glance, each agent in each case will use the greatest ability to prove himself The employer did not violate any law, or the other party violated the blame of the day, even if it was only a small case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him very interested, almost all of his time spent on this matter, so that he often forgets time. He also found the feeling of constantly filling up his knowledge and making himself grow up quickly. I have to say that this feeling is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all because of Doolin, because of Otis, he believes... No, he is convinced that one day Du Lin will be able to fulfill his promise and let him Become the Minister of Justice of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 1st, all the projects in the whole city of Otis were officially launched. At 8 o'clock in the morning, countless balloons hang on the sky with ribbons. If there are no curious birds, it may be more successful. There are flowers everywhere, and the city of Otis has become a sea of ​​joy. There are a large number of people flowing from the station. A large bus coming from all directions is full of guests, and the whole city is boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first day of business, Doolin will definitely not stay in the office. Since the last assassination, the strength of the guards around him has been strengthened. a lot of. There will be at least four or six people around him, and there are ten to twenty around. Kina took these people to practice crying, and the effect was really good. At least Doolin did not find those "dark lines" hidden in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Kina said that no matter what happens, these people will not leave without permission. Their only task is Du Lin’s safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s first stop was the Good Luck Casino, a huge compass sign with a layer of gold and sparkling. The shape of the casino is a boat, a gambling boat sailing in the sea of ​​gold coins. It didn't take long for Dulin's speed to drop down from the gate. There were so many people, people everywhere, people everywhere were screaming and ecstatic laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire has never had a gambling ban, but the city of Otis has opened, and many people have hailed it as a sacred place for gamblers, calling it a casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaming industry is actually just a project in the city of Otis. It does not represent all. There are more entertainment projects outside, enough to satisfy any tourists. Claim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only saw the slot machine, and one of the heads of the casino hired it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mayor, we may not have enough chips." He was sweaty, but his face was hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are so crazy, almost every incoming visitor will redeem three or fifty chips, which has caused the casino’s warehouse to have some chips. . If you don't replenish your chips, you may be redeemed in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Dulin has a rule for the city, all business practices can or must be settled with chips, and then these chip-holding investors arrive at the settlement date. Then use the chips and Du Lin's token company to settle the cash. This will prevent some sudden behaviors and also constrain the arrogance of these investors in Otis. If they don't want to lose a lot of money, or if they are even profitable, they must follow Du Lin's rules of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account the explosive influx of tourists at the beginning, Du Lin has already issued over 10 million chips through his company, and the total number of chips in the city has exceeded 25 million. It is not enough. This made him very happy, because after redeeming the chips, it basically means that the money will inevitably be consumed in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to take the chips away? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible, no one will bring the equivalent of money and money to places that are worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of the full business of Otis, the city’s total revenue may exceed 25 million! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry’s face with Du Lin’s face is red, how much tax can this levy on the horse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 million? Still 10 million or more? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin patted his shoulder and said a little loudly in his ear: "I understand, you call the token company and let the other side Send two million tokens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young manager left after nodding, and Larry went to Du Lin’s side. "It’s incredible, you are How did it do?" He looked at the overcrowded first floor lobby and couldn't believe his eyes. If someone tells him that a city has a total income of 25 million a day, he will seriously consider it before trying to believe it. But here... he did not hesitate to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not far from them, a row of slot machines called “three companies” are full of people, they will not hesitate to pay a chip of denomination. Stuffed into the coin slot and exchanged a chance to pull the pole. Most of these people are looking red and red, and their eyes seem to be straight. Whenever someone screams of surprises from the side, they will urge them to hesitate, and then firmly put the tokens in, and then mechanically repeat the lever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This machine, Doolin, let Stan love what they did, it is too simple for these scientists to get such a small machine. They used three sets of gears and one pallet, as well as some other small parts and a set of formulas to make this console. The formula of the game machine is not complicated. When the token in the tray of the game machine weighs more than ten pounds, the three sets of gears will bite, and the turntable is more prone to "linkage" when rotating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a linkage occurs, it is easy to have a high-level "three links." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, when the weight of the tray is insufficient, the gear may be bitten when the turntable is rotated, and the prize is returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the conclusions of Stan Ein’s many attempts, the return rate was half and half, and I ate 1,000 tokens and spit out 500. Although the conclusion is not very accurate, the random nature is too large, but in general it can guarantee a profit rate of at least 20%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are dejected to leave, and those who take over them quickly get high rewards, which makes many people even more crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not accidentally say that Larry’s problem was: “It’s the root of the whole human being, if you can use one dollar for one. With 10,000 chances, many people may use 9,999 pieces to gamble on this opportunity. Because they are caught by them, they essentially 'win'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it’s greedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Du Lin is not very convenient to say, after all, this is a casino, so many tourists who are shining with golden light are making rapid blood for the city, they Should not be greedy people, they are all angels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry disappeared after turning around in the casino, Du Lin gave him 500 chips, he found a place on the second floor and some People played cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prosperous world today not only attracts ordinary tourists, but also attracts many tycoons and wealthy people. Du Lin is busy with these one morning. People communicate, only now have some time to go around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the casino, he chose to go to the amusement park to take a look. There is also an amusement park in the city of Otis, but there is no clear theme in the amusement park here. Refer to the theme playground of Irian and add some game equipment. The foundation here is actually much better than Irian. There are some star chasers on the Irian side, but there are no restrictions here. If you want to pursue happy people, they will appear here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the casino is a paradise for adults, then this is the world of young boys and girls and children. The screams and the screams of joy accompanied by the mechanical operation can be heard everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
