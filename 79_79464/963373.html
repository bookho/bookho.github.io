			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world has a total of seven proven land areas, three of which are in the East and four in the West. The Yaoxing Empire and the Federation are located in the northernmost of the four continents. On the other three continents, there are many people, many countries, and many...wars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the Eastern messengers who have come to this continent look down on the environment where wars are constantly erupting like beasts. This is also known as the people on the northern continent. On the other three continents, they are more barbaric and more backward. So far there has not been a unified civilization, even if it has not appeared in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap in technology, the cultural gap, the gap in social structure, and other reasons make the North continent occupy a very important position in the Western world. Among them, the Yaoxing Empire and the Federation are the best. There are still three countries in the east that continue to the south, and through a narrow "corridor" you can enter the East. The war between these countries has basically not stopped. This is also the reason for their lag in all aspects. There is not enough time to develop science and technology and civilization. Naturally, in many places, there is no comparison with the northern continent that has unified the mainland civilization several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are still five countries on this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why merchants suddenly want to buy islands that they have been too lazy to look at, are also related to a naval battle last month. On the other side of the strait, two countries broke out because of "the other side invaded" their own fields. There were many people fighting in this war. After fighting for more than half a month, the two sides also rushed out and began to discuss who won. Who lost, who cares who is ignorant. In the process, they discovered that the Western countries did not have a clear division of the site at sea, so no one knows who the two patrol ships violated. The territory of others was countered, and in short, this matter has been nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until a while ago, those countries believed that they should join the territorial sea in addition to the well-defined territory, and initiated relevant content to invite major heads or foreign affairs of the countries. Representatives participated in the discussion and research, and they intend to sign international laws and conventions on territorial waters in the Federal State of Komoi on the 2nd of next month, February 2nd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the incident broke out, the merchants knew more than the people of the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they even got some of the conventions that had been finalized, one of which was The content is how many kilometers of the country's territory extend out of the country's territorial waters. If there are still islands on this sea, then the island will continue to extend outwards as the new "land-based". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small accident here, because there are more islands on the western continent, and several countries have fought again in order to compete for these islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thought after the merchants knew the news was that the island was worth the money, because the island represented the "territory on the sea" and the empire would attach importance to these islands. Get up, no matter how these islands are finally dealt with, in short, the money that can be bought and sold is a good business. A better business is not necessarily money, but something more valuable than money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they made a time lag and wanted to buy a little island in their hands. As for whether they want to operate on their own, or to use these islands as a bargaining chip and the Empire to discuss the conditions to get another benefit, it is not clear, because they must first have an island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horthington and Dooling did not know this thing. After the imperial royal family was lifted high, the whole country and the outside world had very little contact. After the economic depression and the Great Recession, the focus of the cabinet is not on foreign and foreigners who may not be able to deal with each other for more than a decade. Their focus is entirely on a series of societies that revitalize the economy and revitalize the economy. The problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few people who know these things in China, but they miscalculate the purpose of Doolin’s purchase of these islands. If he just wants to make a fortune, The island may be sold to these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he not only knows the word of the territorial sea, but also knows how convenient a full private site can bring to himself, or even a very extreme word. If Doolin finally can't get along in the empire, the federation may be able to wage war against him. reason? The islands close to the empire's coastline are the reason. After mastering these islands, the federal encirclement and distress of the empire on the sea will be unprecedentedly improved, restricting the development of the empire's sea, which means that it has taken a knife in its own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So no matter what, Doolin will not sell these islands, no matter what price the other party offers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he returned to the manor at night, Jose had already waited for him in the manor. He came over and sent a message. Nasha wanted to see him tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin left Irian, the manor was vacant, and Jose bought the house himself, in the second district. He has a lot of money from the golden robbery, although he is certainly not as thick as the Buddha, but there are always four or five thousand. It’s just that he feels that the house in the second district is more affordable than the 20,000-odd house in the first district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just happened to have something to say to Du Lin about the private liquor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winery now has more shipments than before, but the near profit is less than before. Doolin has not said anything about this, Jose feels income. It is your responsibility to lower yourself. Although he did not know exactly where the problem was, but Du Lin gave him the job he did not do well, which meant that he was negligent and he was responsible for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem caused by restrictions on culture and knowledge education. Du Lin has been asking them to learn, but not everyone can learn. Including Harvey, every week except for regular militarization training on Wednesdays and weekends to ensure physical fitness, the rest of the time, Du Lin invited several teachers to teach them. However, the effect is very "extinguishable", and this group of bastards have forgotten to learn over there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving Jose’s confusion, Du Lin’s rest, the taste of the sea is not very good, he is not seasick, but he can’t resist the kind of bumps. People have a particularly difficult feeling, he needs a good rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at noon, he followed Jose’s message to a restaurant next to Imperial Star Media, and at lunchtime, Sha appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Nasha saw that she was much thinner than the last time she was in the emperor, but the temperament was more mature. All her relatives can say that she left her overnight. She not only wants to maintain the brand of the George family, but also finds ways to re-lighten this sign. Her task is very heavy, and there is no way to relieve stress. I can only forget some troubles through constant work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am late!" Nasha placed her hand on the table against the wall. She took off her coat and sat down. "When I was in the capital, I wanted to eat fish, but when I arrived at Irian and wanted to eat steak, did people have such a contradiction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged. "This shows that your work is not enough!", looking at the confused Nasha, Du Lin said with a smile: "Because you still have the mood to consider the problems that philosophers need to think about, so I think you have not tired yourself. Bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men ordered some food and other waiters to leave, Nasha sighed, "full intervention in the company's management I found this to be a very troublesome thing. There are always some inexplicable contradictions between various departments. Even if I solve these problems, there will still be new contradictions, just like someone who is right with me does not want me to relax. Can you ask a question, how do you manage your industry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
