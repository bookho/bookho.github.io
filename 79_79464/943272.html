			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to know how the police chief died. It is said that some special exhibits were left on the scene, aren't they?" Hunter took out the pen and This book, looking at the opposite man with a burning gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man once again tore the tie and untied the first button on the shirt, so that he would be more comfortable. "It is true, some scenes left behind." ......", the two people talked at the same time stopped, the waiter pushed the dining car to put a fine piece of food on the table, and hope that the two guests can have a good meal memories before they leave with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the waiter left, the two men again talked about the inside story of the attack. After the waiter returned to the kitchen and the manager said that he needed a toilet, the manager would not be embarrassed for such a small request. Now people in Nano Lindes are thinking about making money in Otis. If they refuse to let the other person leave the job because of a reasonable request, it may take a week for him to find a suitable candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter left the restaurant from the back door, walked out of the alley, and walked into a telephone booth. He closed the door of the phone booth, watched the surrounding environment vigilantly, then dialed a phone call and an inside line of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a message to sell... Yes, my ideal price is twenty... No, no more, fifteen, otherwise I just smashed the news in my stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, you know my account, yes, just two guests came from the restaurant, One of them seems to be a staff member of the City Hall. I saw him at the opening ceremony of a warehouse last year, when he stood behind the mayor of Todd. Another person looked like a reporter or a detective, he took it in his hand. A notebook and a pen. When I approached, they stopped talking, and when I left, I heard them faintly and started talking again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" , now... no problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter smiled and hung up the phone and took a cigarette before returning to the restaurant to continue working. . Many young people like him like to go to bars and entertainment venues to have fun. Naturally, they will realize that some well-informed people will take money to buy some news that is not worth his money, and it is very refreshing. Pay for this. Gradually, once he finds out what he will sell to this person, this guy is very generous, he has earned hundreds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he was back in the restaurant, in a bar two blocks away, a bar staff walked into the hall from the side door and hurried away after a moment of whispering with the bartender. The bartender puts a cup of green fruit wine worth about fifty. He walked over to the guy on the left side of the bar who was drinking alone, put a coaster on the bar, and put the glass in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifty, thank you!" He smiled and waited for the man to pay. After verifying the true and false of the banknote, he returned to the bar. In the middle position, we continue to mix a variety of wines for our guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the guest drank a cup of 50 pieces of wine in a cup, licking it, revealing a disdainful look. This wine is worth a maximum of one dollar, and all the wines have become popular since the distillation purification method. There is not much sour taste, and it will not be turbid. The sweet taste and low alcohol content make many girls like it very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the cup back on the bar, grabbed the coaster in his hand, and turned away from the bar. Just as he left the bar, a few others left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the street, Kea turned over the coaster in his hand, which wrote an address, the name of a restaurant, and two characters of Jane. description. He looked at the coaster and grinned. The guys who sold the intelligence were really able to make money. They sold fifty pieces of something, and the gods knew how much they could earn in one night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no agent for Doolin here, but it will be there soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinah and a group of security guards wearing casual clothes were on four cars, and they had a total of ten people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Hunter’s face flushed quickly recorded the inside story of the guy sitting opposite him, and every record made him feel his soul. It’s going to tremble, it’s the most horrific news of all time. He didn't even think that Todd was dead. In the official announcement, Todd was transferred to other places to serve as the new party because he had a certain responsibility, and he no longer served as the mayor but retained his level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, he did not expect that he was actually dead, and there were five hundred denomination chips on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think is the cause of the conflict between them? What made the two big men ignore the face and solve the problem in this brutal and rude way?" Hunt thought about it and raised a very sharp question. . He knows the process and results of the matter, but he does not know the reason. If there is a special reason in this case, I am afraid it will be more attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man whispered while eating a fish steak: "I don't know the inside story, but I have heard of a saying...", in Henry With the encouragement of the special eyes, he said: "I heard that the rapid development of the city of Otis has robbed the resources here, and then... Have you heard that Doolin was assassinated?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt’s eyes are instantly rounded and his mouth is closed. “You said that Du Lin’s assassination was actually done by Todd people? So Du Lin’s this time Want to fight back?", he nodded after he said it, "Yes, it is possible, that's it!", he quickly wrote this explosive news on the book, the process of recourse to the truth is really too happy. . The pleasure of being solved by puzzles is intoxicating. The truth and the truth are always in the hands of a few people, which gives him a sense of superiority that cannot be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the vast majority of the entire empire is a fool, only he and a very small number of people are smart people, this is already a kind of superiority beyond the biological class. sense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you talk about the password?" Hunt wants to make this report into a series, from shallow to deep from the two mayors. The mutual assassination attack began and the fire was burned to the New Party cabinet. Only then can his news be enough, he is safe enough, and his family can get the most benefit from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff opposite him was not willing to cooperate in this matter, Du Lin did not interfere with the federal side, but the official can, he hesitated How to refuse Hunter, the wind chimes on the inside door of the restaurant rang, and he subconsciously looked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of guys in dark trench coats with wide-brimmed hats came in from the door, they didn’t look like they came to eat. Because the front desk and the manager were all dialed away by them. Their eyes glanced at the entire restaurant and then pointed the head of the person to their table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people suddenly became creepy. They just said something that they shouldn’t have said and shouldn’t know. Now someone is looking for it, which makes them doubt themselves. Is it being monitored? Hunter immediately put the notebook into the bag and stood up, ran towards the door of the restaurant's back hall, and his town hall friend followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn, I know, I know!" The staff of the City Hall ran while bibi up. "They will let us die in the cell. I know the face of these politicians too much, damn, damn it!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly crossed the back hall and ran into the alley behind the restaurant. Their quick steps suddenly stopped, and there were two equally dressed in the alley. The guy stood in the shadow outside the streetlight, and they held their arms, revealing only two pistols in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt can only raise his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11 o'clock in the evening, Du Lin was already asleep, and Dove came knocking at the door to wake him up and tell him that Kea is back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important thing, Du Lin immediately put on his clothes and drove with the Buddha to the farm on the outskirts. In the last forage warehouse, see It was the two guys who were caught back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt has been very calm, he has not said any words along the way, in his status, the world he has seen, he knows that these people are just The lowest performer. The conditions for bargaining with them are meaningless, and they can only be discussed when the master messenger appears. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he looked at Du Lin and walked outside the warehouse while licking his hair, the heart still trembled with disappointment. One night he recorded, what he heard was related to the young mayor of the city of Otis. The other party really did not have any scruples and unscrupulously did what he wanted to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gentle, good evening, I guess you must be anxious to leave here, and I want to go back to sleep comfortably, then let us It’s a good thing for you and me to be honest with each other.” Du Lin did not intimidate them like a demon. Instead, he was like a gentleman, which made the mood of both of them moderate. The current rules of the game are that I ask, you answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first question, your identity!", Du Lin looked at Hunter, compared to Hunter is still calm, the guy who is sweating next to Hunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt snorted, and when he was about to say it, the "old friend" around him opened the answer mode. "I am the Nano Lindes City Hall." The office worker, this is the reporter on the emperor's side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
