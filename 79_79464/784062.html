			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the usual people’s perception of the Ilyan tourism season, this time has reached the last time of the tourism season, and after two months, this year’s tourism season will Completely over, welcome this year's winter break. Some tourist goods on the roadside began to actively reduce prices, and the service fee standards of some service industries were also reduced. Even the hotel room rate in Alexandria dropped by 10%. This is the last two months of the year to earn money, so these businesses are beginning to consider selling as much as possible of the liquidity of their hands in order to cope with the first month of the next holiday season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some people will choose to travel around the off-season, which will save a lot of money, and at the same time, there is no need to face the crowds of tourists, you can easily and leisurely Tourism is treated as a true tourism. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, a cruise ship slowly landed, and the passengers who slept after a night of the ladder had dragged their suitcases with three inexplicable expressions. The numbness got off the boat from the gangway and followed the stranger in front. Maybe they don't know if they want to disembark in this place, and the brains that haven't woken up are squeaking. All their mobility is completely imitated and commanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crowd, a young girl protects her belly and carefully gets out of the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The air is really fresh and unique. The only pity is that the ticket we ordered is a little late. If we can still participate here in the week The first food festival, I heard that there is no money to eat at the food festival. If you can eat it, you can participate in their various competitions. There are not only money but also various benefits!", the boy carefully protects his body Girls, don't let others close to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes his movements are large and he will disturb the people around him, but those who are disturbed always smile at them. This is a For young couples, people's tolerance for good things is always greater than that of ugly things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took the bulging belly and walked down the pallet on the side of the road, stepping on the soft sand and blowing the sea breeze, and suddenly felt a much better mood. For more than half a year, she has lived a very depressing life. Even if people can see the original action, it is a terrible restricted area. You can have a splendid private life. You can let men from all over the city come to visit. People will not have any other accusations except one or two sluts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially after the rise of the feminist movement, the moment when the first sentence of the imperial capital was shouted from the mouth of the feminist warrior, the world changed quietly. Especially among young people, they have become more open. I used to be able to see young boys behind girls. Nowadays, they only need to look at the eyes to be able to spend a happy night – maybe sometimes not so happy, and some people have natural regrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unmarried pregnancy is absolutely forbidden! This will be ethically condemned and will be scorned by people. This is a fun joke. The mistakes made by two people together must be made by a woman. Perhaps this is growth. This is equal rights, and this is progress! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa has been suffering from strange eyes and strange rumors, she does not want to give birth to this child, but when she found it is too late, or Take out this small life in the face of a risky surgery, or just give birth to ta. When Alisa first felt the life in her stomach breathing with her and heartbeat, the hesitant heart made a decision that other girls could hardly make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to give birth to this child, she refuses the mother’s request, even severs the relationship, and also gives birth to this child of her own. Yes, this is her child, not belonging to anyone, only belongs to her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy around her is a subordinate of her father’s work unit, temporarily letting him play the husband of Alisa, so that it can block those who are full of malicious Mouth and tongue. I don't know if I feel Alisa's special determination and is infected by her optimism. This young man named Dave has a good impression on Alisa until he loves it. He is pursuing Alisa, just A. Lisa has not decided to accept this man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I heard that Irian held a food festival, and her father asked Dave to accompany Alisa to Ilyan to travel around, and by the way It is a couple of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wind here is quite big, let's go to the hotel first?", Dave stood on the pallet and extended his hand, trying to pull Alisa But, but Alisa did not reach out. It seems that Dave has adapted to this kind of embarrassment. He smiles unconsciously and puts his suitcase behind Alisa. After registering a room and taking a break for a while, they started to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa’s father, Mr. Bain, is now the director of the State Transportation Bureau, in charge of the regional transportation bureau of the entire state. No one thought that an insignificant department would soon have great power and oil, especially after the new traffic law had been submitted to the Imperial Parliament, and the Transportation Bureau became a hot spot. With more and more vehicles on the road, it means that more and more people and what they are doing are subject to the supervision and supervision of the Transportation Bureau. There are too many things to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr. Bain’s family was once again revived, which is why Mrs. Bain did not break out. The vanity made her resurrected and she forgot something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked along the most lively place beside the beach, bought some small things, and ate a little bit of food unique to the coastal areas, they stopped a little At that time, Dave suddenly pointed to the building on the sea cliff and exclaimed, "Oh, is that a scenic spot? Or a private residence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin The manor on the cliff is indeed a bit horrible. After all, 350,000 is not a white flower, and it must have a little value and meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa saw it in the direction pointed by Dave, her eyes flashed, and in the sun there was like a place in a fairy tale. The white exterior and the glass mirror reflecting the sun make the entire building golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to see how?" Dave saw the yearning in Alisa's eyes and made an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa shook her head after hesitating a little. "It is obviously someone else's home. It is also white."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave can only give up, came to Irian, he realized how backward and how poor Cannes and Orodo. It's like another world. The latest cars are on the road, and the luxury cars are everywhere. The pedestrians on the road are also very well-dressed. He is very skeptical that they are rich people living here, or rich people are willing to live here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go back, it's time for lunch." Alisa regained her gaze and began to move back, and Dave followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin is sitting with Scott to talk about the mall, the total investment will not be less than 8 million, and it is possible at any time later. Need to invest some more money. This is a lot of money, and Scott thinks that Doolin can't take it out, unless he stops everything he has on hand and pulls all the money out, but that's obviously impossible. He and Juan fight to the present, no one can retreat, can only go on the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, letting Scott be caught off guard is that Du Lin actually nodded. "Give me two months, two months later, the funds will come to us, we You can sign another agreement. If I can't do it, I will give out one million as a breach of contract to the City Hall. This can be written on the agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
