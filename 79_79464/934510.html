			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Du Lin accidentally saw Freena, and now Freena and Huleina have more than half a year ago. More than half a year ago, the first feeling when I saw this woman was that she was glamorous and could detect from her temperament that the woman was "not worth the money." All movie stars are worthless, no matter how many audiences of these movie stars are in the public, how much they are loved, but at the top of this social tower, they will be classified as worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even sometimes not as good as ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are pricey, having a price means not worth it, maybe 100,000 is expensive for some people, but for those who are richer For example, 100,000 pieces are just a week's expense, and even a day's expenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite is that ordinary people are worth a little money, saying that ordinary people are worth the money because most ordinary people are priceless, and they still have their own independence. Self-respecting personality, as well as dignity that has not been hurt by myself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like in the past when Doolin went to the emperor, Kevin asked him to go to see "Opera". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Freena’s body could feel this temperament, and later she was a lot better when she was a vice president. Instead, it is an intellectuality. People often say that knowledge is wealth. This is definitely not a lie. A person learns to understand the world, understand history, understand culture, understands awe, can improve his own quality and cultivation, and is unwilling to become a filthy person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not absolute. There is also an academic community like Edward, who teaches academic papers and rolls out sheets for female students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, the bad things on her body are almost gone, just like changing someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple hug, Doolin curiously asked, "How come you suddenly have time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena sat next to Doolin and snorted. "I heard that you sold the Empire Star to the girl of the George family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, Du Lin said to her, and if she can prove that she can run a company after two years of study, and that the company can be competitive, then he will continue to give the Empire Star to her management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taste this feeling of holding important social resources and wealth. In the past, those ideals like stars became a joke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard that?" Du Lin had some surprises and soon became indifferent. After he signed an agreement with Nasha, the Empire Star Become the industry of Nasha. Whether it is for the George family's banner not to be completely broken, or for further layout in the tape market, she will definitely open a press conference to tell everyone that the Empire Star has become the industry of Nasha George. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may feel that it is unnecessary, but in fact it is necessary, which means that the "George family" found it after losing the newspaper industry. A new industry, while entering the industry with a tough stance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, this will cause some people to pay attention and prepare for it, but it will also cause some people’s attention. They may be willing to invest in Nasha and let her Try to see if you can rebuild the glory of the George family. After the Empire’s Anti-Industry Manipulation Act, all walks of life began to realize that monopoly was not as simple as it used to be. Anyone who lodges complaints is likely to cause bigger problems and effects. Some monopolies have begun to pay attention to their own methods of monopoly, and try not to touch the bottom line of imperial law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin then shook his head with a smile. "It seems that your learning results are not up to the basic standards!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that Du Lin said that Freena was a little excited, she was taken out of the Empire Star Media Company by Du Lin, just like a loser with a winner in the company. I took a turn and then packed my own things and left. Soon after she went to the Imperial College of Imperial College, she also suffered a lot of crimes. The most important point is about the terminology. There are many professional terms and expressions in the economic management system. She has never been in the high school. How can an old girl understand it all at once? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some people’s eyes, she can only get up early and sleep late, soaking up in the library every day to make up for the lessons she lost when she was young, the whole person Like a madman. The purpose of her doing this is actually very simple, to get back the things she has lost. However, when the appointed day had not arrived, she heard that the Empire Star Media Company was sold by Du Lin, and the feeling of grievance filled in her heart made her impulsively come to the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when she was on the steam locomotive, she had already regretted blindly coming over, but since she came, she always had to meet and complain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that Du Lin said that her learning results are not satisfactory. The grievances that have been calmed down have once again become a disaster. "How do you know that my learning is not effective?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I know?", Du Lin couldn't help but laugh out, "H, I just know.", not waiting for Freina to continue to ask, He raised his hand and prevented her from going on, and her expression became serious. "When a businessman sells a business that has an infinite future in the eyes of everyone, and why he excludes external factors, why does he do this?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freina replied with some hesitation: "Because he wants to change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin light Sighed, "I am sending you to study economic management, and it is the best royal college in the empire. For this reason, I have given out 100,000 pieces of sponsorship. Seeing that we are fellow countrymen, you have helped me a lot of things. I am very disappointed, really, Freena, you ran even without the understanding of a businessman. You think you do it the right? "Herr fluctuations in mood and will need to think about when you want to smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched his pocket and touched an empty space before he remembered that the cigarette was on the table at the Alexander Hotel. Freena immediately took out her own cigarette and handed it to Doolin, and she happened to pick it up. Du Lin glanced at her and let her sit down. "Businessmen always pursue greater profits, and actual profits. I sold the Empire Star because I found a more profitable business than this. At the same time, I I didn't say that I completely gave up this industry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to learn a lot of things, have time to read more books, improve your cultivation and quality, and Knowledge, don't think too much about external interference. I told you on the day you left Irian that it is yours or yours, not yours, even if you work hard, you won't be yours. , understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena was reprimanded a little embarrassed, spit out her tongue, and then she was stunned. Because this action has not been done since the age of six, when her parents "sold" her to the Grand Theatre, she never made such a mistake and spoiled her parents. The act of seeking mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin can evaluate a naive regardless of these. He took some chips to Freena. Since he came, he went around the city of Otis. It was a relaxing opportunity in the intense study. Let her go to see the city and think about why the city would be fast. The development of this is exactly the link that touched the entire empire, so that there is a new vocabulary such as the "Otis effect." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
