			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shill sisters came faster than they thought, and in the afternoon they appeared in Doolin’s manor, which was left after Mr. John’s death. Nasha’s manor was later replaced by Nasha as cash and Du Lin for the Empire Star Tape Company. Now the company can be considered a subordinate subsidiary of his company, which is shameless, isn’t it? But this is commercial competition. This is the capital rule. The winners eat all, and the losers lose everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manor has always been a dedicated person to maintain, these people are from a very old service company in the Royal Capital. In the past, they provided excellent housekeepers and servants for aristocrats and dignitaries. Now their business has changed a little, and the butlers and servants are tied together to accept the employer’s employment. Of course, this requires a lot of commission. After all, This company is also linked to the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People seem to have been fanatically discussing over a period of time to overthrow the benefits of the nobility, as well as the decay of the nobility and various drawbacks, but after the craze, they I began to worship everything about the nobility, just like before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should collect some information related to Dooling, it should not come so early.", Dinisha stood by the car and sorted out her own Clothes, she is a sister, they should make Duolin's information research more thorough, so that it will be more sure, instead of just reading the wanted information like this, and rushing over at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has a lot of contradictions in this person. This is what Dinesha discovered through the information. His performance is very contradictory. Sometimes he is A very good person, constantly attending charity evenings and donating a lot of wealth to help the poor, or setting up a free school and a price hospital to help all those who need them. For this reason, it is said that some people in the medical group think that Du Lin has destroyed. "rule". But sometimes he acts like a tyrant. He is cruel to his enemies. Sometimes those people can't be called enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The character of such contradiction itself has a standard that is difficult to judge. Too easy to appear will make Du Lin more vigilant and the difficulty of public relations. After doing the public relations ministers for these years, Dinisha has had a very good experience in public relations, and the success rate is the highest when she meets for the first time. If you can't win this goal for the first time, then the so-called tug-of-war will not take up too much cheap, because those people will think that they are like this, nothing great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cause the imperial central bank to continually ceduce interests in the next negotiations to be satisfactory, and this part of the loss will ultimately be counted on their sisters, if it exceeds the limit that the imperialist central bank can bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that is fortunate is that this Council did not give them an accurate "bottom line". The chairman said that as long as they can get some patents, other It is not a problem, this is the only good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diniya from the other side of the luxury car put the fur accessories on the shoulders, the soft fur of ten centimeters is as beautiful as when it is alive. Of course, this time on a young lady is also very beautiful. She sorted out her dress and added a little lipstick. I just said too much in the car. I need to fix the color. "Do not worry, my sister, I believe this is definitely not our trouble, and you heard about it yesterday. As long as we win Doolin, we have the opportunity to become a shareholder, and we can live the life we ​​want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one feels like doing public relations work It's a pleasant thing, which means that you have to be convinced, and at some specific moments, to promise others some excessive demands to complete the task, which is cruel, especially for women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a strong sister, Dinisha can only smile and pin her hopes on their strategies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, my beautiful sister!", Diniya carries a very nice looking, but does not appear to be a stupid female briefcase Going to the manor house, the butler had already greeted them at the door and led them into Doolin’s study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bangbangbang’s knocking on the door pulled Doolin back from his thoughts. He was thinking about other things, and he was so focused that he didn’t realize that his visitors had Appeared. He sat in the chair behind the desk, carefully looked at the two girls who were blown into the sky by Kevin. Sometimes you have to admit the authority of others in some respects. These two girls are indeed very Baton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides those who don’t need to praise and can’t find any traces of body and appearance, their most special thing is their own temperament and the identity of their twins. . Twins are not scarce, but they are very rare, just like the twins who might have distinguished themselves from others who are out of their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyes were calm, which made Dinisha standing at the door a little relieved. She had seen a lot of gaze, full of aggressiveness and aggressiveness, and that kind of gaze was like a piece of her circulation. The disgusting legendary slime filled with mucus rolled around her, she hated that kind of person, but she had to smile. At this point she gave Du Lin a high rating, at least this guy was very positive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I was thinking about something, I forgot the time, please come in...", he stood up, but did not walk out of the desk, then invited two The man sat in a chair opposite his desk and looked at the butler. "Get some tea for the two beautiful ladies, and snacks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The housekeeper owes a debt and closes the door. There are two cooks in the manor. This is a standard configuration. If you put it in before, there may be more cooks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, the two sisters sat down after the thank you, and Dini put the briefcase at her feet, wondering if she bent down intentionally or unintentionally. Waist, and did not cover his chest. It may be that she came too hurriedly, she chose a slightly looser clothes, and forgot to wear underwear, and she also forgot, so she made such a rash move. Du Lin looked away and looked away. There was nothing to look at. After all, he was the rich man who had the most fire actress in his mouth. This is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already watching Du Lin’s Dinisha’s brow slightly moved, this is one of the strategies they developed last night, first try to see if they can use them most. Something with advantages, I immediately killed Du Lin, although it is not a willing thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Plan A failed, and Doolin did not look like the three-page lace news described, full of affection for women, often everywhere Helping girls in poor areas to help them escape poverty while making an outstanding contribution to regional population growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diniya didn’t seem to know what she was doing when she got up straight, her eyes flashing from Dinesha’s palm on her lap. After that, I looked at Du Lin, and my face was filled with a smile full of heartfelt smiles. "Mr. Du Lin, let me introduce myself first, I am Di Nija, this is my sister, Di Nisha." Said that she took the initiative to stand up and reached out to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This desk is very wide and large. After all, as a place where Mr. John is working, the desk must be large. At that time, he had to deal with many very important front page news every day to determine what news can be sent out, what news needs to be modified, and if the table is too small, his work will be greatly restricted, so this table is really width. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
