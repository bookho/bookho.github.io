			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dulin and the Timamont family are married." Also in the study, the study here lacks a young and lively atmosphere, Heidler sits In the easy chair, it was already June, and his legs were covered with a thin blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his age, it is actually very hard, many good things can not be enjoyed, and his body is extremely fragile. Sometimes Heidler feels that he is living on crimes, but he is reluctant to die. Maybe he thought it would be more comfortable to do this, but it is better to be alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other gentlemen in the room who think that they are about the same age as Heidler, and the other is also in their thirties. They are all Guartes. But the materials they use for their clothes, the details of the master craftsmanship make them look like they are not Guar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Doolin, many wealthy Guarts don’t have the taste they wear now, of course not all Guars are really It is a dog's leg, mainly because it can't afford these clothes and accessories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dividends brought about by betrayal of the country have lasted for decades, which has kept them superhuman, they are packaged in various fields. The minority race is upstart, but in fact, the days have not been as happy as people think. Hostility from other people in the same class, as well as vigilance against politics, keeps them alive and cautious, fearing when they will be dragged into the abyss because of something that they may not have noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are always neutral in their political stance, not biased towards any party, not talking about other things besides business, for them, Life seems to have only money left, and be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heedler sometimes feels that he is not as good as the Guarts who live in the lower city, at least what they want to do, what they can do, Unlike him, things that are a little bit sensitive can't be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no response in the dull room, Heidler sighed. "This is not a good thing." He looked at the other two. Some turbid eyes turned a little. "You should be able to feel that the cabinet has made us less demanding in the past few years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role model should serve as a role model, helping the Guarts to be the cabinet's demands on them. Heidele has been helping the Guarts for years, such as fishing some of the criminal Guarts, for some trapped The troubled compatriots sent free help to the lawyers and provided jobs for some of the Guarts who attended school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is more than one Heidler doing this kind of thing, and many people like him are doing this, this is not what they want to do from the heart, Instead, someone greeted them and asked them to do it. To calm down the emotions of these defeated nations and reduce the emergence of opposing emotions is the meaning and value of their existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people don’t recognize their behavior, think traitors are traitors and can’t be forgiven, but it’s undeniable that some people begin to recognize their behavior and accept their help. So there are two extremes in the Guar community, which are very annoying part of these people and a part of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Graf was very grateful to Heidler and recognized the big man. At that time, Graf was charged with a fever and a fight on the defendant. The court was sent to prison for the crime of assault. It was also Heidele’s appearance that the lawyer had taken him out and ended his sentence early, which made Graf very grateful to the old gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, with the rise of Doolin, those who once let them do this, so few people have appeared, especially in these two years. No longer appear, don't give them any requests, don't let them do things they don't want to do. Behind all this is because of the emergence of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin used his unique means to quickly rise and helped a large number of Guars to live a normal and even rich life, everything Dolin did Will not let the Guartes feel humiliated, at least Doolin has not sold the interests of the country, did not betray the Guart dynasty, they are more inclined to come out of the countryside, Doolin, there will be intimacy, not go I agree with these people in Heidler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to do, means that value is weakened, meaning useless, which makes Heidler very fearful, the older the person, the more often he fears Some things, will one day when they have no value at all, the official will use them to open the knife? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler has always had such a speculation that Du Lin’s rise is too fast and has led to a large number of Guarts standing up, causing the Guar’s group to Their dependence is getting less and less, they are "unemployed." In fact, Heidler guessed that there is nothing wrong with it. Now, whether it is the president of the fellowship or his agent, it has become more adapted to the society than before. If the Guartes have any trouble, they will go to these people instead of Those traitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a good phenomenon, and a strong sense of crisis has been haunting him. He is not aware of the fact that Magus is going to legislate for a minority. If he knows, he will be even more fearful. Even so, he felt a huge crisis at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the opposite side of Heidler and his almost big Mr. impatiently snorted, "I understand what you said, but what can we do? Change the status quo? It’s not that I’m too pessimistic. Today, at this step, we can’t do anything about it.” He’s a bit ridiculous in his eyes, he looked at Heidler and said in a tone with some complaints, “You felt du When Lin is in trouble, he should clean up him, not sitting there and one... watching him grow up and threatening us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heidele smiled and didn't talk. The gentleman actually said that he was wrong. Heidler really had to kill Du Lin. It was only during that time that the Teel gold robbery broke out suddenly, and then Du Lin blinked. It disappeared. When he heard the news of Du Lin again, it was already half a year later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Du Lin became not only a rich man accepted by the society, but also had a certain influence in Irian, Heidler was very keenly aware of Du Lin may have something to do with the Golden Robbery, which dispels the unknown idea in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Doolin has a certain climate, and these hot and healthy Heidlers who climbed up from the bottom of society are very clear, he As the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and a celebrity, well-known wealthy entrepreneurs, how can you compare with a group of young people who are not afraid of death? He heard that when the gold robbery broke out, it was not just two or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes, how many years have passed, Du Lin has grown to the point where he needs to look up, it is even more impossible to say something about Doolin. I can only bury this idea deeply in my heart, and no one will tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid that someone else has missed the news and misunderstood him. He was afraid that Du Lin would really believe and then kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence is going on. After a while, Heidler whispered, "I am old, I don’t want to live like this. It’s time to be at my age. I have lived in my later years and I intend to leave the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
