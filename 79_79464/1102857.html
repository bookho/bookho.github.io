			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people in the Federation believe that as long as they have wealth, they can have power. This stupid cognition actually comes from building a nation. To put it bluntly, the power of building the hands of the national family comes from the wealth they have in the eyes of some people. It is like telling people who is the richest and who is the most entitled. When some consortia, some big capitalists have the wealth that can be compared to the national family, they begin to consider a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so rich, then when can I have power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, and now, they can train political spokespersons to help them gain indirect power, but this is not enough, they want to have more power, so much so that You can make decisions in person and decide where the future of the federation will go. What they need is to hold the scepter in their hands, not just to touch the shadow of the scepter. It is not a foolish move to challenge the authority of the nation. This is a process, and it can be said that it is a process of progress in the times. More and more people are beginning to question the president’s lifelong system, when almost everyone thinks this is wrong. At that time, it is time to build a national family to withdraw from the power stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, they are essentially businessmen, because they have gained enormous power for wealth that they can’t match for a long time, and they also have credit. It is these families that turn a group like a loose alliance into a country, but they are just businessmen. They are not pure politicians. They have a greedy nature, they want everything, and they don't want to let go. The successful experience of building a national family is like a standard process. People in a pure capital city will not consider the things behind this power. Money is the standard for measuring everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the combination of various forces and situations, a round of rebellious movement came into being. It may be possible to abolish the speaker’s lifelong system after many sports many years. This decadent system can have nothing to do with Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not here to send benefits to the country for the people's livelihood, he just wants to do something to enhance his own card thickness, nothing more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words are very transparent. He did not say those high-sounding things, pointing the problem to the core of contradiction, that is, the distribution of power. The new consortium wants to gain power, and the old forces are reluctant to give up their power. This is the core of the contradiction. A series of competitions around power, and then evolved into a series of more complex and far-reaching things, such as Said the Civil War, and now the economic output. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restart will bring severe pain, the national strength will decay, the economy will go backwards, people's lives will become difficult, everything will seem worse and worse, as if making such a decision can only bring this country Negative destruction will not bring any substantial benefits, so why do these people sit here and listen to Du Lin saying something like treason? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is because of power, if they can stabilize the power in their hands, and build their federal experience over the years, they may only need a generation to pay for the federation. At the peak of the world, the power in their hands will be more concentrated and more stable. This is like a new round of investment. There may be some twists and turns in the early stage, but the degree of profit in the later period will be much better than the present and the risk will be smaller. So why should we stick to the current mode of operation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like many people are attacking the social system of the feudal dynasties, thinking that it is unreasonable and bad rotten rule. Because they stand in the angle of being ruled, they are based on whether they analyze this matter because of the profitability of this social system, so they naturally have dissatisfaction. But if they look at these issues from the perspective of the rulers, they will only disregard the power and not concentrate enough. They will dislike that this time the people are untouchable and not docile. The way in which things are viewed differently is different. For the Speakers, they may wish to make the times go backwards and turn themselves into an emperor and the only emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten people decide one thing and one person decides one thing is a completely different experience, the concentration of power will bring more advantages, four Mr. Obviously, I have already reached a series of things before I saw Du Lin. What they are paying more attention now is how to operate this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for how many people will live on the streets, how many companies will go bankrupt, how many financial practitioners will fly in the sky, it is not important, what is important is The power in their own hands will not be violated so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, I think we can talk about it in detail, and the next plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and said, "This is what I am planning to share with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in another location, there are some People are discussing Du Lin, and Du Lin’s true intentions to come to the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information on your hands is the information I collected in the past few days, including everything that Du Lin has seen since birth. Everyone can talk about their own ideas." The young consortium has fourty-seven. Years old, for the position of the head of the consortium, forty-seven is really a young man, and other people with similar titles are over 50 years old, which is enough to show his excellence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the old gentleman’s statement, they found the reporter, Ma Jili, who reported the inside story. Under the coercion, the other party told the news that he knew it decisively. They, the internal news of the report slamming federal finance came from Doolin. Then they investigated the information of Doolin, which is the information that these people are watching now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the federation is a country that has money and happiness, and there is nothing that money can’t measure, including power that can be measured by money. It is only a high price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After paying a certain amount of money, they got this information, detailing the fact that many things may not be remembered by Doolin himself. Thanks to Kaile Mr. has a very broad network of contacts in the Empire, otherwise they will not get these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A nouveau riche, a lucky one, and a poor little man." The first gentleman who put down the information said his opinion, "a smooth sailing." Resume is also a very standard personal resume. Almost everything has the right choice and success. There is no such lucky person in the world. If this information is not forged, then there is only one possibility, he is The figure before the introduction of a big man is a standard piece." This argument has been recognized by many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was too successful, and success was like a false one, especially since he jumped directly from Irian to the city of Otis as the acting mayor. Fake surprise. Just because the mayor of Irian was afraid of Doolin’s participation in the mayoral election, he was sent to a poor and ridiculous city like Otis, but he also made new things like the SAR and built the city of Otis. Become a bustling city after the Imperial Capital. There is no one to believe that there is any official means, such as the arrangement of Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to innovate in some aspects with the help of Du Lin’s hand. If it succeeds, then naturally there will be no problem. Even if it fails, it is Du Lin. Responsibility. This kind of white gloves is very common. The more the big man who is in the high position, the more he can not make obvious mistakes on some radical problems, it is absolutely fatal. It is very appropriate to find a white glove at this time to do these things. Success will not have any effect on yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
