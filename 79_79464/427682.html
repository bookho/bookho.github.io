			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf is a bit embarrassed, the woman looks at him with a watchful look, the man looks at him with a look of hope, the problem is that he is not the one who can be the master . So he took a step back and highlighted Du Lin’s status, and he said with a sigh of relief: “This is our boss.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s face is obviously strange The expression, but the eyes become brighter. In this world where capital is king, if a young person says that he wants to buy something expensive, there are only two possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a liar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a young master of a wealthy family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to afford Graf’s young and threatening appearance, I’m afraid it’s not a liar, and even if he’s a liar, there’s nothing here. Things can arouse his interest. Just like the merchants who have asked about the price before, the high price has dispelled their thoughts, and it is better to go directly to buy wasteland than to buy this pasture like a wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the price of the wasteland is indeed much cheaper, but there is a small problem here, that is time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchasing the land is not a simple matter. Since the madness of a ranch tycoon caused public outrage, the empire has become selling land. Extra care, but also a lot of procedures. For example, if you buy a wasteland for developing pastures or develop farmland, you must first go through the approval of the “Yaoxing Imperial Land Use Office”, from the batch to the approval. If there is no problem, it will take about 20 days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a need to vote for farmers, herders, and a small number of city residents around the target land, and 60% of them will be able to proceed to the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you buy a wasteland, no matter what you do, from initiation to thorough purchase, it is impossible to have two or three months. And that's why Du Linming knows that the wasteland is cheaper and he has to come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't wait for such a long time, otherwise the three suppliers will be crazy, and he may be prosecuted for fraud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man's expression was a little flatter. He put down the lock in the door and opened the door. "Welcome to you, I will welcome you no matter if we can finally be satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He let the door open, Graf and the members of the two fellowships stayed out of the door, they were useless, but it may affect the next negotiations of Doolin, so Graf is very smart to avoid This situation appeared, he did not go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin went into the supplies with the man, and the woman stood on the side of a girl with a golden brown hair, looking at Du Lin with a longing look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been forced to make a fortune. In the spring of last year, they took 800 yuan from a man named Morris in the city, bought 60 sirloin scorpions and some necessities. I didn’t expect 800 pieces to be used for only two years. It has reached three thousand. Some time ago they took 60 of the cows that could be sold for two thousand pieces, but they only got the principal of 800 pieces, and there were 2,200 pieces of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have not been able to get even a penny, and they have reached the point where they are running out of water. The other party said that if they can’t get the money at the end of the month, they will have to go home. The women are hands-on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After welcoming a few waves of merchants and sending them away, the family has been desperate, and the man has a determined determination to die. If the other party really wants to do it, he will definitely do it. Kill one to earn one, then the family goes on the road together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he was desperate, he did not expect to have a new turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Huon." The man gave a poor quality wine to Doolin. In general, most of the country’s farmers and herders brewed themselves. Some inferior drinks, it is not important to drink well, this is one of their few pastimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand and lifted the hip flask. Huen put the jug down. He held his hands together and his fingers swayed back and forth, as if he was restless. The heart, "Actually... I know that such a price can't satisfy anyone, but this is something we can finally sell." When he looked up, his eyes were indeed a bit pity and sympathy. Lin is a businessman. When there is a transaction, it must not be moved by foreign objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just nodded and said that he had understood that the man had such a look, and said with a smile: "How much can you pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin Did not say any price, but asked: "Can you tell me the guy named Morris?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is a bit strange, but this may be The last chance of his family, whether it is straw or whatever, he must seize, "Morris is a provincial (xing) ya, running a delicatessen at the corner of the 7th Street, he has some men, special 'help' Some people who are in short supply of money. It is said that he is a gang member, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Huon’s statement, Du Lin thinks this guy named Maurice and It’s not too dark. It took two hundred years to become three thousand. The conscientious lenders are really “helping” those who are tight. In Du Lin’s dream, those financial companies are really black, and it takes only two years for a hundred to turn out millions. To say bad luck, I can only say that Hu En chose the wrong direction of investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s all about him. He took a cup and took a sip of the fruit and sipped it slightly. It’s not a very good wine, then slowly Let go, "Mr. Huen, I think I already know. If I decide to buy your farm, are you sure you will take Morris?", he took a cigarette from his arms and slowly swallowed it. Said: "I don't want to be involved in any trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huen nodded hard. "Of course, I want to end it all, Then I went back to my hometown and started a new life.” Huen’s eyes glowed with dazzling light. He realized at this time that Du Lin would most likely buy his farm, which is a very good for him. Message. Once you get rid of the heavy debts and have a little money in your hand, he can go to another city to be a carpenter, or open some wasteland to be a farmer or herder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a moment to say: "Look at the sympathy for your experience, I will give you up to 1,800." Huen’s face suddenly changed. When he wanted to say something, Du Lin raised his hand and stopped him. “If you buy a wasteland with the same area as your ranch, you only need a maximum of 1,500 pieces. And you should also understand that because you are negligent in management and repair, the pasture is almost not much different from the wasteland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used three hundred more pieces For two months of approval time, you have already earned it. After all, there is no work that will allow you and your family to earn three hundred in two months."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin closed his mouth and was not talking, Hu En immediately said: "But I owe Morris 2,200, and we still need tolls when we leave here. We need some money to start a new life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and shook his head. "You made a mistake. Sir, you owe Morris the money you owe him, not me." His. All I need is this farm, not for you to pay back and give you extra money, so that you have time to start a new life.", said Du Lin stood up and patted his legs. “I am just a businessman, not a philanthropist. If you are willing to sell this ranch at a price of 1,800, you can find me at 117 Queen's Road.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Du Lin is about to leave, Huen’s hands slowly become fists and his arms are shaking. Seeing that Du Lin had stepped out of the door, he stood up fiercely and shouted. When Doolin turned back with doubts, Hu En took a deep breath and let his voice tremble less. "I want to discuss it with my wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No problem, then I will wait outside the door for a while, you have five minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slowly closed door finally died. In that gap, Hu’s wife and daughter came over from the restaurant on the side. The woman’s face is full of sorrow. In fact, the real reason for Hu’s opening to retain Du Lin is that Du Lin’s price is the highest among those who ask for the price. Before Doolin did not come, the highest price was only one thousand six, and many people bid between 1-2 and 1400. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just counted Huon’s urgent need for a sum of money to save his family, and the fire robbed wants to buy this piece at a very low price. A farm of ten acres of land! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the money left after selling the land, it is not considered by those businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dulin said, they are all businessmen, not philanthropists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?", the wife leaned on Huen’s arms and took advantage of her daughter, and huge interest rates had put the woman on the verge of collapse. If she does not get enough money at the end of the month, she will choose to commit suicide to protect her chastity. Of course, she will leave with her daughter and will not let her daughter continue to suffer in this world. Even Hu En had a decision before Du Lin did not come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
