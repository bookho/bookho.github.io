			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, like the title of the previous chapter, Finrill cursed, it was a cannonball, an idiot! While he was looking for a bunker to prepare for the bombardment of the shells, he also found a large stone to hide behind. He had seen such a shell, and he had seen a naval battle on the sea while he was fishing, without looking for a rich man to make a vote to become a rich man on the smuggling ship. The huge cannon looks like a bean far away, but this bean will produce an explosion and an instant flame. The flying debris can be cut off by the mast. The best way to avoid it is to jump into the water. , dive to the depth of 20 meters, those shrapnel will not have the horrible lethality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is on land, there is no water depth of 20 meters for him to dive, he can only learn the sailors on the decks behind the barrels, Holding his head, the butt is falling towards the cannonball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ass is rotten, it’s better than the brain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time he is destined to be disappointed, because there is no deafening, earth-shaking explosion, only a moment of fire, he looked back curiously The shells exploded at a distance of more than 20 meters from the ground. It was a group of bad bombs. He had never heard of shells exploding in midair. Is this empire’s military procurement department receiving benefits? What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes, maybe this is also a material that can be used at the negotiating table. If the other party does not agree to his conditions, he will buy inferior shells from the military region. The thing is revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raging fire of the sky and the screams from all directions quickly made him come back. He suddenly shuddered and looked down. I have only a burning flame on the stone less than a metre. The flame is attached to the stone, and there is nothing to burn except the surface of the stone that has a black, viscous substance. He walked over and blew his blows, and his beard was blown up, but the egg-sized flame not only did not go out, but as his hair dryer became bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately bent down and picked up a decaying bark, pressing it on the fire, and rubbing it hard. He was able to confirm that the flame had been completely extinguished. When he opened the bark, some black sticky material was attached to the moss on the surface of the bark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the stone, and the bark instantly ignited the flame, and the burning of the violent, scared him to let the bark fall to the ground . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sensation like "the flame of the devil" and the "flame of hell" that human beings could say in the case of extreme fear. Those who were contaminated with flames screamed and screamed, but could not stop the flame. After quenching again and again and again, the entire valley is like falling into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was awkward, and Finnel licked his chest and coughed fiercely. The severe cough made him squat, and there was a desire to put The lungs cough up and feel happy. He wiped the wet corner of his mouth and he needed to maintain his positive image. However, he looked at the back of his hand, it was not saliva, it was blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person shouted "This smoke is poisonous" with an extraordinarily screaming voice, all those who were able to run and were not ignited by the flames of hell rushed To the valley mouth on both sides, it may be safe to run out. But it wasn’t the fresh air that greeted them, but the row of open automatic rifles that opened the insurance, as well as the weapon-mounted platform. The metal storm came to this world in an instant, and the blood gathered together like a stream, which swayed and spread on the mountain road along the ups and downs of the terrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the back of the steam, the faces of the frowning face are like the devils crawling out of hell, their fingers are tightly locked. Trigger, the bullets poured out like a rainstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them, one reporter constantly took pictures and worked hard, one of the reporters wrote -<br /><br />&nbsp "Sin is as fragile as paper in front of the bullet of justice. This group of people killed and looted in the West and murdered thousands of demons and finally waited for their trial. Each bullet represents a copy." Determined to be a sword that guarantees stability in the west and justice for those innocent victims. These swords penetrate the bodies of the devils and tear their ugly souls. Have you heard them? The devils are unwilling to swear, that It is the swan song of their indulging hell that all innocent people killed by them can see this moment in the kingdom of heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May God be with us, May peace last forever in the world, and will never stop happening like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has every person’s justice, devil or angel, not because Their instinct to judge their right or wrong, it’s just that they survive  the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, this must be a victory for the Army. The colonel’s mouth was slightly picked up, so many battles were enough to make his medal beautiful and shining. He stepped on a new step again, and the arrival of the star went one step further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unilateral killing lasted less than ten minutes, and the valley fell into a dead silence, all the sounds disappeared, only a few sprays of water The machine is working in a low voice. After waiting for three minutes, the colonel nodded. "Start cleaning up the gas, pay attention to someone who might pretend to die, and clean up the battlefield to make necessary parts to fill the gun. Soldiers." Bullets are not worth the money, but your life is extremely precious. Be sure to keep yourself safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine that sprays the mist is wearing a gas mask Under the push of the soldiers, they began to march toward the valley, and the entire valley was filled with a purple-grey smog that condensed. Of course, this also thanks to the special geographical terrain of the valley. The wind at the height cannot stir the airflow in the valley, so that these poisonous smoke will not leak out in a large area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is not much relationship between leaks. These toxic floating particles will stick to the surface of some plants tomorrow, and they are highly toxic to humans. It has no effect on plants. After several heavy rains, these things eventually enter the soil and are eventually broken down into harmless substances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of gunshots from time to time in the valley and the twisted body on the ground made the soldiers who went into the valley to clean the battlefield a bit shocking, even from the heart. Feel the fear. The word war is very close to them because they are soldiers, warriors who defend this empire from aggression, and their existence is for war. But the word is far away from them. The most recent war occurred more than 20 years ago. The blood flow more than a decade ago was just an unequal battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, in this small valley, they can really feel the heavyness of the word war and the glory that it brings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is as silent as possible, and every time they see a body, they make two shots. One shot hit the head and one shot on the chest. This is the standard for cleaning the battlefield. They learned it during class. When the poisonous mist of the entire valley was dispelled and the ground was covered with a layer of purple-gray dust, the reporters and officers outside came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good thing for the people, and the free front of the illegal armed extremist groups in the west is annihilated, creating a safe environment for the lives and property of the people of the west. This is also a huge battle. The number of killers of more than 2,000 levels is enough for the commander of this battle to receive an empire silver medal, so that the dispatched army can get a group battle flag two medals, everyone got Affordable, this is a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flashing of the spotlight makes the commander feel that he is a hero. He wears white gloves. After all, there are still many poisonous dusts, which are accidentally contaminated. It is possible to hurt yourself and wear a pair of gloves to be safe. He recruited and asked the soldiers to bring a few sentinel cards to the whistle. He pointed to the tidy body that was neatly arranged on the ground and said, "Write your leader’s number on a piece of paper. If anyone lie, then he I will also get a number plate. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several checkpoints are nodding, they are standing still, more than an hour I didn’t expect this group of people in the west to fear, even the trade that almost stopped the free front, so it was so finished? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first checkpoint received a pen and a piece of paper, and went from the beginning to the end of the soldier’s guard. The paper on the handle was given to the major. Then the second one will identify again. When the ten checkpoints were all identified, the major began to compare the papers that only wrote six figures. He suddenly raised his head and pointed to the seventh person. The seventh person had not had time to say anything, and the horrified expression solidified on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bullet penetrated his skull from behind and let him fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Major’s indifference glanced at the guy who was still twitching but actually dying. He sneered twice. “I hate to lie to me!” Then he handed one of them to a soldier, "put the six bodies together and set them aside." After he finished speaking, he turned and smiled and looked at the special agent who was photographed by Emperor. "Mr. Special Commissioner, the six leaders of the Freedom Front have all been killed. You can call the cabinet and the Western Military Region has successfully completed the cofferdam mission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Commissioner With a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, the formal dress made him incompatible with everything here. He glanced at the paper in his hand and put it in his pocket. "I will immediately call the Minister of Defense and see what I see. Yes, what I heard, a brief report to the cabinet. I have to praise you, Major Mann, your thinking is very clear, the soldiers are also very good, this will let the minister and the cabinet of yours remember Live your name."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
