			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the Otis Daily newspaper slammed Donald’s title in the short days after he took office, letting Otis There was a huge chaos, so that a large group of “innocent” businessmen suffered serious property losses, with a total amount of more than 3.5 million. The newspaper also introduced the assumption of the contradiction between Mayor Donald and the mayor of Doolin. In order to retaliate against the former mayor Du Lin, he pointed the finger at the Hite director who had made outstanding contributions to the law and order in the city of Otis. The post of Director of the Hite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he also suppressed some of the officials left by Du Lin, which also said Scott’s problem. Scott was originally a news officer and spokesperson for the city of Otis, but after Donald’s taking office, Skoll was immediately transferred to the Secretariat as the secretary-general, which seemed to be affirmation of Scott’s work. With the promotion, in fact, the Mayor of Donald has not arranged any work for the Secretariat so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the newspaper, Donald has become a very dramatic image of a villain. He only trusts the cronies around him, and he has serious problems in the perfect institutional department of the city. The mistrust, in the security incident that broke out last night, the regional police station that should have worked as a result of the revenge of Mayor Donald, caused a large number of police officers in the regional police station to be dismissed, so that the security incident should be handed over to Audi. There is hardly any police investigation bureau in the city to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such chaotic governance and selfish behaviors make it difficult for the majority of the city of Otis to accept, if the Mayor of Donald can't take further governance The plan, the law and order of the city of Otis is likely to enter a long and chaotic stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper finally remembered the Mayor’s law and order during the period of the city of Otis, which is really rare even for thieves. . Whether a mayor is qualified and contributes to a city should not be analyzed from his identity, status and background. He should look at what he has done for the city and what he lives in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of newspapers quickly attracted the approval of the citizens of Otis, because the city of Otis is a special zone, and Doolin did not establish a consultation hall so that everyone Discussing the areas where the regulations and policies are rectified, so more people are wearing thick cotton coats to discuss the matter in the square outside the city hall. This scene was quickly taken by some reporters as a picture of the contents of tomorrow's report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald was standing on the edge of the office window and looking at the hundreds of people in the square. He wanted to order the dispersal of these people, but he also knew very well that if he did, he would definitely send out the Audis. The rebound. He is now annoyed enough, not only wearing a hat suspected of planning to assassinate the former mayor Doolin, but also being smashed for the security incident that broke out yesterday. He actually understands that all of this has something to do with Du Lin, but he can't say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left a deep mark in the city. His period of administration is a perfect example, solving all the big problems that people urgently need to face. Whether it is small areas such as drinking water, public transportation, public security, or work, family income, medical security, and educational resources, it is impossible to pick up the stab in his term of office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good mayor can get the recognition and love of a city, which can be very painful for the heirs, because he will not be taken by people all the time. Compare with Doolin. Not quite okay, there will be many problems when comparing, he can't repeat construction, and there is nothing to open up. Even if the Otis market listing plan is planned before Du Lin left, everyone also Everything you know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly regretted replacing Du Lin as the mayor of Otis, this is a hot stove, I am afraid even more powerful politicians will come here with him. The same is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to do something for the city and do something for yourself, it will inevitably infringe the interests of Doolin and Doolin interest groups, so It will be like this, people don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t do anything, I’ll probably leave an “incompetent” image to the superiors and high-levels when I’m on the assessment. I already have such a good foundation. Nothing is done in a fart, why should we continue to govern in those rich places? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a very contradiction. Whether you do or not, you will offend one side. What is more troublesome is that he can't afford to be offended on both sides! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, another bad robbery occurred. Two half-year-old children, only fifteen, robbed a knife from the imperial central bank. Rich merchants, and stabbed the wealthy businessmen two knives, snatched the bag he carried with him. There are 5,000 pieces of cash that have just been taken out of the bag, and a checkbook. The rich businessman was sent to the hospital after the report was reported. Because the injury was more serious, he had already transferred to the Imperial Capital for treatment. The two young people may have realized the consequences of their actions and chose to surrender under the persuasion of their families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that they are not yet adult and have surrendered themselves, the City Court of Otis has sentenced them to three years and one year. The young man of five years was a young man with a knife attacking a wealthy businessman, so he sentenced him to two more years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem like a very common case, but if the two teenagers have Guar’s ancestry, then the case is not ordinary. The robbery, this is simply an attack! It can be said that the attack was packaged with a robbery case, with sufficient motivation, and the court will naturally only sentence according to the robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves another legal issue. If there is a premeditated attack, as long as the victim is seriously injured, it can be classified as a second-degree murder. But if it is just a robbery, it is just a robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people have read the meaning behind the case from this case, this is Doolin warning the non-commercial members of the city of Otis, do not The handle is too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puxi was too active, involved and promoted the whole process, so he died. Others are not "masterminds", but they are also accomplices, so they will not die, but they will pay the price! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing more fearful than death. The first time after the case, some members of the Chamber of Commerce immediately put themselves in the city of Otis. Industry listed sales, they can not afford to play this game, for the sake of their own safety, or hurry to run. Others chose to withdraw from the chamber of commerce, join the Otis business group, and play the game according to Doolin's law, in order to win the forgiveness of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were fewer than half of the merchants who supported Donald in a moment. The Speaker of the Chamber of Commerce also went back. Members also went back. Heidele was in his villa all day. Raising flowers and grass, I can't see him in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald feels as if he has been abandoned by the whole world, angry, and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is never a shortage of speculators in this group of businessmen. Many predators tell the latecomers in the case of a rich night, as long as there is no death. With courage, there is a possibility of great success. There are still some members of the Chamber of Commerce who are standing still and still standing on Donald's side. They have reduced their chances of going out and waiting for the moment when dawn comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity that they did not wait until dawn, and waited for the day when the investigation bureau withdrew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of the Bureau of Investigation in the early morning came to the Bureau of Investigation to prepare for the start of a day’s work. What he did not think was that the door of the Bureau of Investigation was actually red. The paint also painted a lot of difference on the wall. This makes the Bureau of Investigations extremely angry. These people dare to challenge the Bureau of Investigation directly. Do they not know that the Bureau of Investigation is an authority above the police station? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary yelled at the man to get rid of these paints and returned to the office. These days, the Bureau of Investigation is responsible for the law and order of the city. Although it cannot be said that the frequent occurrence of various types of crimes has been contained, it has also attracted 20 or 30 people, which has contributed to reducing crime rates and maintaining law and order. I didn’t expect these people’s revenge to come so fast, dare to blatantly smear red paint on the door of the investigation bureau. This made the Secretary feel worried. He decided to apply for support from the Imperial Capital and take care of the city of Otis. Criminal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the phone and dialed the phone of his former colleague. At the gossip stage before the topic started, a female employee knocked on the door and sent a Letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Secretary talked about the day while unpacking the envelope. When he saw the things inside, the phone slipped off his shoulders quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?! Are you listening?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two photos in the envelope The first photo should be taken at the Fountain Park of the Imperial Capital. It is the fountain park at the intersection of No. 1 Street and the entrance to Xiongshi Street. The area is not very large, but because of the beautiful environment, the fountain is twenty-four hours. Open, so many people like to sit and rest and play. In the photo, his wife and daughter sat on a bench and lowered their heads to read a book placed on his wife's knees. The two looked very focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But behind him, stood a man in a trench coat and a hat, holding a gun in his hand and pointing at his wife, he The wife did not even notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second photo, inside is his son, his son is sitting on the lap of the man with the gun, playing with the dangerous weapon in his hand, I showed a very happy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these two photos, there is a bullet along with the photo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
