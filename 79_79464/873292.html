			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin calmly watched Chester slowly tilting his body, then fell to the ground, and suddenly he pondered after a moment, shaking his head and lifting the phone, let Hait came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he is very surprised. He thinks that hisstery should be able to protect himself so smart, but it turns out that life safety is not smart and smart. Any relationship. To blame, you can only blame this creature is too fragile, there is no hard shell, there is no digestive juice that can be digested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hite came up very quickly, he was a little surprised to see Chester, who was pouring black blood on the floor, immediately closed the door of the room and went to Knee down at the desk and press your finger on Chester's carotid artery. He shook his head and pulled his fingers away. The heartbeat still existed but it was weak enough to be almost imperceptible, and the rhythm of the heartbeat was very chaotic, and there was a possibility of death anytime and anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a meat factory in the west of the city...", the first reaction of Hite is that this guy may have been killed by Du Lin, he immediately began to think about how to deal with the body problem . Simple burial is not impossible, but it can be transported outside the city circle to bury it. The weather is so hot. Maybe it will start to smell the scent of corpse corruption at night, and there may be some unnecessary witnesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for other treatments, he has considered it. The only way to send it to the meat factory is to make a phone call and ask them to send a few goats. When I left, I put Chester and goat meat together and pulled them back to the meat factory. I broke the corpse that was thrown into the scrap to make pet food, almost perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many gangs operate a number of slaughterhouses and meat processing plants in many places in order to handle the bodies more safely and reliably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, even if there is some blood on the road of transportation, or the smell of some bodies, others will only think that it is the smell of animal bodies, not Think of the human body. After the treatment was over, the pets were happy to eat the added pet food, and the whole person disappeared safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin still stunned after listening, and then laughed directly. "No, no, not what you think, he was poisoned." Check to see what poison is, see if you can find the poison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon the body was sent to the police station on the first floor instead of the hospital. The reason was that the two nurses in the hospital heard that they were going to send a dead person to dissect their faces. They were scared, and they were not allowed to pull in the bodies. Finally, they had to be placed in the police. Anatomy in the bureau. After dissection, the forensic doctor came to a more ridiculous conclusion, which may not be murder, but an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took Chester’s riddled stomach bag to illustrate the reason he guessed, and he detected a chemical residue in Chester’s body. This is not a kind of potent poison. It can even be said that it is not a poison at all, not produced to murder a certain life. This kind of thing is mainly used in most places with toilets - it is a living chemical used in a clean toilet that removes stubborn urine and sticky stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only takes about ten milliliters and five hundred milliliters of water to be mixed, and then sprays to cover those places with urine and sticky stones, about half an hour later. These stubborn stains can be flushed with water to ensure a clean, fresh toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in advertising, this kind of thing is very corrosive and must be worn when operating instructions require it. If you have to eat, you must immediately seek medical advice to clean the stomach. If you do not see the instructions, the production and sales company will not bear any responsibility. But Butin thinks that Chester is being concealed, which makes him a little unhappy, and Chester is wise to propose a "public-private partnership" approach. To operate public transportation, this is in line with Doolin's appetite. After the public-private partnership, the city hall of Otis City only needs macro control, and the public transportation company is supervised immediately, without incurring any expenses, and at the same time, a considerable fee can be obtained every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, his concept is very unique and can be said to have a certain degree of "directionality." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I died in front of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Check it out, find this person, someone is dead on our site, as the mayor of Otis, and your police chief, It is necessary and necessary to provide justice for the deceased. Do you understand this? This is the power and obligation that the law gives you. I am waiting for your good news." Du Lin took a look at Hite's arm and returned to the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood stains on the table and the traces left on the floor have been cleaned up. Thanks to the last mayor who did not know how long he had left, he left a nice office. At least there is no hard-to-clean things like carpets. Water is needed to wet the floor and then dragged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought that this was the end of the matter, so what he did not expect was that after four days, the court gave him a subpoena, hoping that he Can appear in court to testify for the plaintiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When receiving this summons, Du Lin was confused, knowing that he later called to understand that Chester’s wife was under the lawyer’s The production and sales of “Jingfang Ling” came to court on the grounds that the production of this dangerous chemical did not increase the eye-catching color and the unique pungent smell to remind the user and played a role in encouraging crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is a very magical reason, but at least it is okay, Du Lin signed a power of attorney to entrust Kevin’s lawyer colleagues to appear in court, he I don’t want to go to the emperor to go to the emperor and do nothing and run back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Du Lin, this seemingly inconspicuous absurd lawsuit has caused great repercussions in society, and many social groups have stood up. Out of support for Chester's family, so that the "cleaning toilet" production and sales company was suppressed by public opinion had to publicly apologize in the newspaper. Even in a subsequent annual parliament, some members of the parliament proposed a bill on the revision of the law, arguing that all dangerous chemicals must be added with eye-catching colors and pungent odors to prevent similar situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From then on, all dangerous goods have a beautiful color and a pungent smell, colorful is like the bright animals in the natural jungle, let one Seeing that this thing is toxic to the horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, Chester’s wife received 160,000 compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Mr. Colliers..." On the weekend, Harry suddenly appeared in the city of Otis, and accompanied by a 50-year-old With a bearded middle-aged man, Harry introduced the gentleman to Du Lin. The name suddenly made Du Lin know that this is a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the initiative to shake hands with Mr. Colliers. "You look much younger than I thought!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Colliers burst into laughter. He held Duolin’s hands in his hands and did not be as proud as he thought. He also joked: “I think so too!”<br /><br />&nbsp; Colliers is a very legendary aristocratic capitalist. During the imperial rule of the New Party, he began to engage in the laying and transportation of railways, and he has done this business himself. The limit. After the New Party came to power, he changed his position decisively and became a staunch supporter of the New Party. This made him once again reached the limit of the railway industry and once again made a leap forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 60% of all the railways in the Empire are now owned by this gentleman. He is a well-deserved railway tycoon. Whenever he puts forward an idea or a suggestion, the railway transportation system will vibrate for a period of time. Many individuals and enterprises that depend on the railway to survive must adjust their pace in time to ensure that they are in line with his rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colliers, is the real upper class of the empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry smiled and watched the two men shake hands apart and talked about the reason for visiting Doolin today. The last time Doolin said that he intended to get through the east-west railway, to cross two mountains, to dig two tunnels or canyons, which caused the interest of Colliers. The huge amount of engineering means huge profits, but it also means that he put two railways under his own name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Colliers and John, a capitalist who can influence the empire’s pattern and politics, their purpose is no longer to be so vulgar, but to seek more Big political discourse and political interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the empire, the construction of the railway and the railway near the Imperial Capital has far more influence than he has earned millions or tens of millions. More important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting down, the couple chilled a few words and said a bunch of unhealthy farts, Colliers first spoke of the real purpose of his trip. "Mr. Mayor, do you have any thoughts about the two railways you said?", he said that he paused and changed his mind. "I mean when you plan to start the project, is it complete? Design and construction plan?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Building the railway itself is a long and complicated task, we need to consider a lot of problems, such as geological problems, such as Say the mountain structure problem, so the sooner some things start, the better for us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
