			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin hang up the phone and let Ellis send things to Luke, and Luke’s lawyer called in the evening. In order to kick out Du Lin's "liar" at the fastest speed, Luke is also very careful to do this. He invited the three best financial companies of Irian to evaluate the original Oriental Star Entertainment Company. The results came out in the afternoon. According to the financial records and various bills in Du Lin’s hands, the market value of Oriental Star Entertainment was suppressed. Hundreds of thousands of dollars, the total market value of the southern viewing has removed a fraction of 11.8 million yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the explanation in the supplementary clause of the agreement regarding the breach of contract, Luke Lian did not appear, so the lawyer sent 5.9 million banker's money. Although this number is more than one million higher than Juan said, Luke still pinches his nose and recognizes it. He will get this money back, but not now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer said a few scenes and asked Du Lin to sign on some documents, proving that Du Lin had already passed his own contract in violation of another agreement. The equity was returned to Luke and received a cashier's order of 5.9 million. Since then, the southern movie and Du Lin have no more than a dime. There was no objection to this Du Lin. He signed the agreement and let Luke’s lawyer leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat thinking for a moment, then picked up the phone and called Joshua, who was far away from the Xie Lisi Street in the Imperial City. The content of the call was very simple, only four Words - the end of the month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he called another call to James, the president of the Imperial Bank’s Irian branch, and invited him to dinner. James, who was very sensitive to the business changes between Irene's richest people, immediately agreed to Doolin's invitation. He knew the withdrawal. He knew that Du Lin had nearly six million in cash. This cash is a big figure for his bank president. If he can put the money at the Irian branch, he will look much better on the face at the end of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner was booked in the hotel of Alexandria. A separate banquet hall was opened for the two to dine. James came earlier, and then Du Lin arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the meal, Doolin placed a business card on the table and slowly pushed it over. Then he did not say a word, and began to taste the dishes that Alexander specially prepared for him this evening. The main dish is a good steak, and Irian has sold for 98 pounds a pound and is still alive. After doing this, if you don’t sell a steak like this one, you have to lose money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James looked at the business card with a strange look, and suddenly there was a blank in his mind, and then there was a faint excitement in the restlessness. This seemingly plain business card has only one name and one phone number. The two wiring numbers in front of the phone number are Emperor's, and the latter number is unfamiliar. He is familiar with the name, which is the name of one of the three directors of the Board of Governors of the Central Bank of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This business card may not cost a lot of money from design to production, but this name and this number are signed on it, it is worth 10,000 yuan. , 100,000, or even a million! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everyone has the right to dial this number, even if Du Lin gave this card to him, he would not dare to call this number. He respectfully pushed the business card back, and some envious smile said: "This business card has a very special meaning, you must keep it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put the business card in his pocket, he put down the knife and fork, and took a napkin and dipped his lips. "The steak is very good, you can taste it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp James picked up the knife and fork and cut a piece into his mouth. He nodded. "It's good, the material is very good, the chef's technique is also very good. This is the perfect steak I have ever eaten this year!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be a bit of an embarrassment, I would like to ask, if I mortgage the bank's things after the deadline, I can't redeem them, what will you do?", Du Lin took out A cigarette gestured, and James waved his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of the role of the business card, James did not answer immediately, but really thought about it, "We will have two options, if the assets of the mortgage With a high rate of return, we will write a self-operated report of the mortgaged assets to the head office, which will be approved by the head office on a weekly basis. Once they think it is enforceable, they will be arranged to operate directly. The finance generated by the operation will first make up the deficit of the loan, and then the profit generated will be paid to the head office except for a small part of the profit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is also a profit that may be the result of the collateralized assets did not meet expectations, we will open the auction publicly, there are actually two cases, if the mortgage asset itself has a high market value, the head office will arrange Specialists will carry out the split and then auction separately for maximum benefit. Generally speaking, small and medium-sized non-high-profit assets are directly publicly auctioned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James asked a little strangely: "Do you need a loan? Mr. Doolin, you can rest assured that I will give you the maximum amount and the lowest interest, you are one of our central bank's most important customers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head and did not answer the question. Instead, he continued to choose the question. "If you skip one or two links, I can get these assets directly from the bank. Can??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very obvious violation of the operation, the more the huge institutional rules and regulations, the more people may feel that this approach is very rigid, will all People's work enthusiasm and creativity are limited. Perhaps for some employees this is indeed a rule that they can't understand, but for this institution itself, this system is necessary to maintain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everyone can jump out of the rules and do what they want, then the bigger the organization, the faster it will collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James understands this truth. He looks down at the steak on the plate and thinks for a while, then reveals some smiles. He knows very well that Du Lin’s question is definitely because he wants to get something from the bank’s collateral. According to the rules and regulations, James should refuse, but the meaning of the previous chairman’s business card is really It is too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial central bank is actually like a miniature state government. For middle managers like him, it is not as safer as the bottom-level employees. The bottom-level employees did the wrong thing, and they were smashed at most, and they deducted a little money. They will continue to work tomorrow. But what about middle management? If they do something wrong, it will definitely not be a small matter. Not only will they lose good work, but they may also be required by the bank to blame and compensate for the loss, and may even go to jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They enjoy even better treatment and benefits, and of course they need to take on more deadly risks. If there is no "self" in the council, the ghost knows when it is possible to be swept out by the bank because of something that has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is not a general business card, it is the business card of the chairman, for this relationship James does not mind that he has a little bit of hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?", he picked up the knife and fork and continued to eat the steak in the dining plate, saying that there is nothing to open at this point. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not hang his appetite and directly explained his thoughts. "I want Juan's pledge of liquor license, wine license and liquor license."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp James stunned. He immediately realized what he was, but he didn't think deeply. He leaned in for a while and nodded. "This is not a problem at all, but it takes a while to determine that he can't repay the bank loan. After the principal and interest, and he was determined by himself, we can operate this matter." He said with a smile, "And I personally think this is not an easy thing, once Juan and George family talk In the case of proper cooperation, some banks are willing to provide him with funds, and he can redeem these assets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's my business, isn't it?" Du Lin picked up the knife and fork and cut a piece of beef. While watching James, he chewed the beef bag twice. James could clearly see Duolin's scorpion sliding up and down. I don't know why, he also swallowed a sip, and there was an inexplicable uneasiness. Dooling’s eyes were calm. He glanced at the table full of dishes. “Are we friends? Mr. James?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James’ heartbeat is accelerating, He didn't understand why suddenly there was a strong sense of oppression in Du Lin. He rubbed his finger to the outside and bowed his head. He nodded and said, "Yes, we are friends!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, I know we must be good friends, come and taste the dishes I prepared for my friends!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat After the meal, James left with a bag that Du Lin sent him. He had been dealing with money for almost a lifetime. When he touched his hand, he knew what was inside, and at least 50,000. This is the benefit that Du Lin gave him. The benefit fee given in advance, he did not intend to accept it, but he still received it in Dulin’s unclear eyes. After returning home, he hid the bag of money in the dark space, then walked back and forth a few steps, picked up a piece of music from the desk and stuffed it into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a good relationship with Juan, is a very good old friend, he would like to call Juan, Juan, Du Lin took a fancy to his liquor license . Every time when he touched the phone, he remembered the look of Doolin when he finally left him. The look was terrible, as if Dulin’s eye was not a person, but something, or something else. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a long time, and finally decided to give a little bit of wind to Juan, but at the moment he picked up the phone and put it in his ear, he was decadent. Put the phone back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
