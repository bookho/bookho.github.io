			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, hello, I am Claude, the Commissioner of the Federal Financial Management Committee. Please rest assured that this conversation does not represent any decision or position. "It’s just an ordinary exchange." Crowder made a fruit plate pastry and a pot of coffee. After the waiter left, he continued to laugh and said, "The Federal Financial Management Committee is committed to creating a stable financial Market and order, we welcome all people from all walks of life who come to the Federation to invest. It is precisely because of the many investors and a stable investment environment that we have created a prosperous federation."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We recently observed that you have a very large amount of money in operation, and I have to say that this is a very amazing number. I checked it twice before I came. Excellent and outstanding like you. Merchants are very rare in the federation, so I took the initiative to take this job, I want to see you in person.", Claude's eyes have a hint of curiosity, a glimpse of worship, and of course Less scrutiny ingredients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaks very well, at least not to cause resentment from others, and constantly praises the success of others to gain more recognition. This is actually forced out. The federal environment is very special. Money is everything, money can even become a member of parliament. This makes many government departments' work very troublesome, because if their work style is slightly more barbaric, it is possible. Raised a series of questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and didn’t speak, Crowd continued with a smile. “If it’s convenient, can you talk to me, your investment plan? Is it a long-term hold or a short-term profit-making behavior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said, "I may sell the federal shield, the federal shield in the near future." The increase is a bit abnormal. This is not the right thing. We all know that nothing will go up all the time. After the power is released, we need a new process of accumulating power. This process is very dangerous for our investors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you are right, this is consistent with our view." Crowder nodded again with approval. "But can I mention one?" A little suggestion?” After Du Lin’s approval, he smiled and said, “Are you able to contact us before you sell your money?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know, there are a lot of federal shields in your currency bin, if no one picks up If you sell it out, it will cause unnecessary riots. I am not letting you sell it. My idea is to inform us before you sell it. We will stabilize the market as much as possible. You have earned enough money and we have continued to stabilize the money market. This is a good thing for both of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stunned. He didn't think there was such a thing. Isn't this an interference in market freedom? But what the other party said is not unreasonable. They are not taking care of Du Lin. They are not big investors, but some small and small investors. These people do not have the ability to resist risks, compared to those of large investors and institutions. A small shock is enough for these avid investors to fall into the abyss and climb out. The real cornerstone of the country is not the consortium that has countless funds, but the ordinary people who don’t have much money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the most indispensable part, an important part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a lot of selling is likely to lead to a vicious circle, some people may think that the currency's gains have come to an end, they also began to sell in order to avoid risks, when selling When a wave is formed, the federal shield will have big problems. Recently, the Financial Management Committee is protesting to the Joint Parliament, hoping that the Joint Parliament will tighten the monetary policy through the Federal Bank and two other banks to cool the frenzied financial market. However, the Joint Council did not have any form of response to this, so the Financial Management Committee had to take the initiative to interview these "big households" and reduce the risks that may be faced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how the Financial Management Committee solves this problem, they are actually related to the federal "central bank." The Commonwealth Bank is the central bank of the Federation and is an official bank. The existence of the Federal Bank is to stabilize the federal financial and economic order. When necessary, they can extend the hand of friendship to help the Financial Management Committee interfere with the freedom of the market. After all, the bank is also within the jurisdiction of the Financial Management Committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, I will contact you before I decide to sell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crow De smiled and pulled out a business card and handed it to Du Lin. "This is my personal business card. If you have any financial problems in the Federation, please feel free to call me. I will meet during the day. In the office, I will be at home at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the business card and put it in the business card holder. His movements were not so fast, he was thinking. The financial management committee is likely to smell some unusual atmosphere and find some signs of something wrong, so they began to actively interfere with market freedom. What Du Lin is not sure about is that they all discovered it himself. Someone has made a shameful informant. If the former is not a big problem, if it is the latter, his plan failure rate will increase a lot. And the longer the time drags, the danger of exposure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
