			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like business people are always discussing how to avoid taxation legally, politicians often discuss how to avoid political risks, and professional ethics tend to be top-down. Requirements. It seems that this vocabulary is full of such heavy words as “morality”. In fact, if the phrase “professional ethics” is interpreted in a relatively straightforward way, then obviously “morality” does not exist and should be read as “professional law”. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessing and avoiding the disaster is originally an instinct, just like the thief in the thunderstorm weather will fly a kite under the dark clouds and lightning, as if the animal saw it in the night The fire is both eager and scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, this creature full of wisdom and conflicts is more extreme in this respect, everyone wants to meet the best and luckiest things No one ever hopes that he will be unlucky every day. Even drinking water may need to be sent to the hospital for rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem left by the doorman should not be borne by Julio, at least Julio thinks so, and his legal counsel provides the method of operation. Very high execution. Now, because of the death of the doorman, everything in the Kadima Party has been completely overturned. At this time, I don’t hurry up. When the Kadima party is really dead, I want to find someone to take the black pot. I’m afraid I can’t find it. Arrived. In the end, Julio decided to take a look at it first. If it works, then this is the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that Julio asked his legal counsel to file a review and reassessment of the existing bill with the state government and the cabinet, on the other side of the city, Du Lin is meeting with representatives headed by the president of the Workers' Union of the City of Ville. Recently, the workers’ union finally came out with a bad breath. The simple and independent working class in the west finally realized the benefits of solidarity. Only unity can resist the exploitation of capital. Only unity can bring out the real power of the working class! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unity is power. There is nothing more powerful than the united working class. Even the incomparable capitalists will tremble in the face of the united working class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the last half is their excitement of madness. In fact, the Western working class can’t do the same as the developed regions, which can directly threaten the capitalists. In the west they are truly vulnerable groups. Tens of millions of people are distributed in various parts of the western region. The number of people with jobs is about 10% of the total number of people who have citizenship and legal residence rights. The unemployment rate has reached 59.3 percent. Such a terrible unemployment rate is also one of the characteristics of the West, which is also a "landscape" that is invisible elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unemployment rate is as high as 59.3 percent in cities in developed regions, I am afraid that the entire city has become a mess. Scholars and experts from the Imperial College of the Royal Academy have conducted a survey. The survey shows that if the unemployment rate in a region is higher than 15%, there will be signs of chaos in the society, and the security problem will begin to deteriorate. If the unemployment rate exceeds 20%, then there will be obvious chaos, and law and order will become the biggest problem in the region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unemployment rate exceeds 30%, the area will be chaotic, creating a vicious circle of unstoppable until a city’s rule is completely destroyed Entering anarchy. At present, the average employment rate in the southern cities of the empire is around 9.7, and the east coast is only 8.1. Even so, there are certain social problems and public security problems. The unemployment rate in the west is high, ranging from five to ten times in other places. It is still an impossible existence to maintain a stable social structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is actually the fact, because the special environment in the west allows many families to support themselves even without a formal job, so even if the unemployment rate is high High, horrible, and not too chaotic. In fact, the most crucial thing is that every household has basically a shotgun. Shooting criminals who are committing crimes does not need to bear any consequences and responsibilities in local laws in the west, and even be rewarded and commended, which increases the cost of crime without limit, as long as they can find a way to support themselves, such as farming. For example, when a gold digger or hunter or something, everyone is safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that people living in the west do not need to work. If there is a stable job, who is willing to risk looking for minerals or hunting animals in the wild? In a variety of complicated situations, Doolin promoted the development of agriculture in the western region, so that more people saw the opportunity to work. In order to seize this opportunity, they hoped that someone could represent themselves and talk to Du Lin. talk. Negotiations are a very nerve-wracking process for Westerners who use bullets to move. They are not good at this, so they are very "smart" to register information in the workers' union, and then hope that the guild can and Du Lin Talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will become a breakthrough point for workers’ unions in the west, so the workers’ unions are particularly uplifting. They also sent a luxurious delegation led by the local president. Together with three legal advisers and some workers’ representatives, they sat in a stable with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Doolin, we are very sincere, the guild will arrange for your healthy workers to take care of your farm, one out of every 50 workers Workers who are literate and have received basic education. In the entire empire, this is also the best condition that can reflect our sincerity.” The president of the guild said that it is not a fake, it seems that this is a civilized society. In fact, under the surface of this civilized society, there is still a "dark" society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dark society does not refer to things like crime, but to culture. Culture, including a lot of content, but here is the recognition of words, the ability to read and write, the ability to do some simple calculations and know how to record some work like numbers. It took more than 20 years for the empire to enter a new era from decaying feudal rule. It can be said that more than 50% or more of the people in this society are "literate". These people are the lowest level of this society. These people are workers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They earn a hard and meager salary through the sale of labor, but not every job is suitable for them, even physical labor is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the capitalists, literate workers are more popular than those without culture, except that education can improve the quality and education of workers, at the factory. There are also many things to record or calculate. These workers have become a hot commodity in the workers' market. In the working class, these people are in the middle and upper classes of the working class, making it easier to find work and good work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers’ union took the initiative to solve the problem of Doolin in order to negotiate the “business” between Du Lin and they hosted a short-term literacy class and Computational classes will be taught free of charge to workers who wish to gain knowledge. Those books, exercise books, pencils, and the like are all laid out by the workers' unions. This will be a big expense, but if you can negotiate with Du Lin about the employment problem, it will be a victory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For meeting in this place, Du Lin did not have any opinions. He was very kind to him. After all, he was a farmer’s child. Up to now, there are still some people who are jealous of him, or who have splashed water for other reasons, and have always emphasized Du Lin’s origins. The words of the mud dog legs and the farmer’s son are very good. At first, Doolin was a little tired, but as time went by, he gradually became able to take it easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very simple. There are always people who want to find comfort through the shortcomings of others. Just like a joke that has been circulating for a while, there is only one sentence in the joke. Lord Magus is actually blowing his nose like us. Perhaps for a character like Magus, someone who hates him can only barely find this shortcoming to destroy his reputation, although doing so actually does not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is said that the farmer’s child or the mud dog’s leg will not let himself lose a piece of meat, the person who loves him will continue to love him, and hate him. The person seems to have no other way than to hate him more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
