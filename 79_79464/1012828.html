			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna went to the desk and picked up the black envelope. She smiled inexplicably. The envelope and the envelope more than twenty years ago were not even a little bit. Variety. It is still a pure black base. The paper of the envelope is very thick. It also has some special grass lines on it. It feels a little rough, but it gives a very noble feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the front of the envelope, a line of words was written in red ink - with blood to wash away sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the big red oil seal, the oil seal is also very old-fashioned, only a cross like X. But look carefully at the deep inside of the cross, there will be some small letters at the bottom, and the left and right sides add up to form a sentence - death is the beginning of sublimation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two sentences are said to have been personally requested by the leader. She listened to Walter and said that this will make the whole thing have a very special sense of ceremonies from beginning to end. Reminiscent of the career of the bloody dawn and other things. Although Anna did not know exactly what the leader was, she knew a little bit that the leader who likes to pose is definitely not a normal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first "letter" of the bloody dawn is not such a black card, but a flower with blood, they are watered with the blood of the former abducted nobles On a flower called the flower of the kingdom of heaven, it is then given to the next assassination object chosen by them. The flower of the kingdom of heaven is not a scientific name. It is just a common name for people. This flower blooms in the early morning. It has only six petals. These panels wrap the pink furry flower in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun shines through the clear petals every morning, a rainbow-like glow appears on the flower. Those botanists call this because the flower core absorbs the night's dew and accumulates on each fluff of the flower in a special way. When the flowers bloom in the morning, as long as the wind blows, the slight vibration caused by the water will make the water vapor continually oscillate inside the flower. If there is enough sunshine at this time, it will be enough to let people see some colored light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So people call this flower the flower of heaven, which is a beautiful flower that falls from the heavens to the ground and takes root, and represents the pure and beautiful flowers. child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since they assassinated an ear and found these black papers from the Earl’s House, the leader changed his mind and they started using black cards. Remind all goals and the assassination team will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna actually heard of another version, saying that some people got these bloody heavenly flowers and didn't know what happened. They didn't pay much attention to this strange thing, so this made the leader very angry. He hopes that all the targets of the assassination will be filled with anger, fear, remorse, and remorse for his own crimes in the last hours of his life, and finally he will be purified in despair. So the bloody dawn changed the token, and began to use the black post as a hint, the effect is really good, at least people know that this black letter is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are all going out!", Anna took the black envelope in her hand and turned to look at the two soldiers wearing casual clothes. "Go nearby." The bar turns around and relaxes. You must stay there until twelve o'clock in the evening. You can come back after a while." Looking at the two soldiers' inexplicable eyes, Anna once again deepened her tone. "This is the order!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two soldiers immediately stood up and answered aloud, although it was not clear what happened, but it was very good to be able to play in the mission. . And according to their rules, all the consumer names in the bar can be reimbursed by means of reimbursement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving, Anna asked the hotel to send her a big meal from a nearby hotel, which cost more than 70 pieces. The table full of rich meals was shimmering with seductive luster under the light. She sat in a chair, picked up the oil seal with a letter knife, and pulled out the small black card inside. There is a very abstract red smile on the card, and below is a line of hot stamping words - to dispel the darkness and greet the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put the envelopes and cards on the table, then picked up the napkins and tied them to the neckline, poured a glass of red wine for themselves, and began to taste these hearty foods. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ate very slowly, very carefully to distinguish the taste and taste of each food, as if a foodie seemed to be able to find out from these dishes Something that others can't find. She ate a little bit, sipped a little, and only a half of the remaining half of her face was red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the time points to 11:55, the door of the room is ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things on the table have cleaned up the hotel, and Anna is holding a book at this time. She hasn't calmed down to read a book for a long time. Time seems to be never enough for her, and there is not enough emotion for her to get a moment of peace. But at this moment, she suddenly became quiet, she was not interested in everything that happened around, and the noise outside the window did not seem to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She subconsciously placed a bookmark on the page she was looking at, and then laughed aloud. Whether she was alive or dead tonight, she might never go to the book again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly wait...", she put the book aside, went to the window and pulled the curtains, when she turned around, the room was already more three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the four people kept looking at each other, and Anna suddenly smiled. "I saw you last time, but your appearance at the time made me feel nothing." It will be you. I remember that you used to wash it every day. Even if you just wear a day's clothes, you won't continue to wear it the next day. Your changes are shocking." She looked at Walter and remembered it. The last time I went to the sneak observation outside Zijing Town, I found a drunkard, a drunkard with alcohol and smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time she looked at the drunkard’s eyes full of disdain and disgust, but she did not think that it was actually the person she was looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter is a very "exquisite" person in her memory. After all, Walter as a bloody dawn instructor can say that the status in the organization is extraordinary. He is very particular about his life, very clean and very decent. He always cleaned himself up, plus the kind of temperament that was not so good, so that Anna, who was ready to break into the organization, took a fancy to the man and began a fierce pursuit with this man as a breakthrough point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A handsome man full of sunshine and self-confidence, a beautiful and passionate girl, who has not been entangled for too long between two people, let each other fall into Love, no, it is hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of Walter has always stayed the day before that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Anna looked at the little old man standing in the middle, and she carefully looked at the old man with a white beard, and looked at it for a long time before picking her eyebrows. "If you didn't make a mistake..., Mr. Layton, I haven't seen each other for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyton has been cold-faced and closed, but Layton instead Smiled and nodded and said: "Yes, Anna, I haven't seen each other for more than 20 years. I didn't expect you to have escaped this day." It seems that I was aware of Anna's gaze, and Layton smiled. Some proudly said: "This is my youngest son, Hanle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna clicked on her head and said hello to Hanle. Then she relaxedly looked at these "old acquaintances". There were so many things in her heart that couldn’t be said to be rolling. The scenes of the past seemed to happen yesterday. Things that got up also thought about it for a moment. She looked at the three people and sighed. "So next... you should kill me, are you?", waiting for them to answer, she said with a smile: "I will resist..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no way to say that her wrist is on her hand when she flips a gun, no need for any aiming, just the feeling that the body is familiar with the gun She knows who her gun is aiming at. At the moment of pulling the trigger, Walter turned and flashed a gunshot on the wall behind him. Layton and Hanler still stood still and did not move. Today's protagonist is not them. It is Walter and Anna. The purpose of their coming here is nothing more than Mr. Xerma worried about the accident of Walter's idiot, let They will guarantee the safety of Walt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Anna’s attack is only locked on Walt, and the hatred between the couple can fill the world almost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of Walt's dodge, his arm has a small amount of swaying action, and there is a little bit of cold between them. Anna stepped on the foot. In the chair around me, the sudden center of gravity put the back of the chair in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duo, a diamond-shaped dagger with only one finger and one finger wide on the back of the chair trembled slightly. As a bloody dawn instructor, Walter’s personal ability is definitely not the weakest. Maybe it can be ranked in the top fifteen in the whole organization. As for the people in front of them... they are all monsters, for example, born. There is a kind of singer who can control all the firearms, for example, never need to consider not hitting the target, just need to consider where to play Layton, and a woman who can use a hundred and twenty pounds of giant sword... . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt is a relatively normal one... There is always an inexplicable heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just three seconds, the two have changed their position, and with the first fight, whether it is Walt or Anna, it seems that they all keep Your own fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the footsteps sounded on the corridor outside the door, accompanied by a woman’s jealousy and the screams of other room passengers, and the knocking on the door suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
