			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is not a problem that is entangled in knowing or not knowing. After Prando took the opportunity to send a fire, he also got some important information from here. The gold robbery on the robbery side has a bank staff, a young escort named Schubert, can also be said to be a escort. It was because of the help of the staff of the bank of Schubert that the duty manager put the war on the robbers. This news is very important. Prando immediately arranged for people to investigate all the information under the name of Schubert. At the same time, the staff at the upper level also reflected a situation. The guarded squad and the robber stole seemed to know. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two doubts are enough to explain some of the problems in the case from the side, for example, the motivation of these people is most likely to come for that half a ton of gold, they are Knowing that the news was revealed by the sergeant called Schubert, the one million guarantee was nothing but an incidental item. For example, the main members planning to implement this robbery should basically be locals. They have Schubert to provide some necessary information to get the robbery. There is a general scope to the remaining things that are step by step to check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor and the member of the parliament have been squandered by the rehabilitation of the rehab at this time, and they have no intention to give Prando a black pot. They married Prando. A few words, gave him a certain degree of privilege and then left in a hurry. Although he did not succeed in giving the black pot to the mayor and the members of the parliament, in general, even if nothing was finally obtained, Prando’s responsibility was the least, and he gained certain power, which made his mind A little change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no technical content to plant a blame. It’s not just that there is a single person, Prando will. On the one hand, he made the painter who is good at painting through the description of the eyewitness, drawn a simple robber appearance, released the city's wanted order, and passed the information of the Golden Robbery to the State Guard Investigation Bureau, hoping that they can release the state level. Wanted orders and nationwide wanted orders. On the one hand, I am considering how to use this rare opportunity to send those who are not like him to hell, such as Du Lin who has just been released from prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with Doolin is his intention, Prando has been a police chief for so many years, even if some people do not give him face, no one dares to be in his Faced with his life and the lives of his family to threaten him. This is the most unacceptable thing for him. As a police chief, even if a criminal who has just taken the lead can't keep up, his prestige will be severely hit. The prestige he has established will become a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling is a hyena around the lion. If you don't give the most violent counterattack, Du Lin can recruit more hyenas, just like he did against Wood. Wood and Doolin at the time were like the gap between giants and babies. Why did Wood lose? To sum up, it’s just two or three points. First, he is too underestimated by Doolin’s ambition and enthusiasm, thinking that he can overwhelm Du Lin with his own identity, but he does not know that Du Lin is not a person obeying the rules, so The rules limit Wood, but there is no limit to Du Lin. His death is not an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Wood regarded himself as a high society person, he forgot his origin and forgot how he became a tycoon, this is To Du Lin a wonderful opportunity, he took advantage of Wood's mental changes, with a despicable restriction of noble, successful turn over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing happened to his Prando now, he wouldn’t be confused like Wood, plus the hatred between him and Doolin It may have been exposed, so he is less likely to give Doolin an opportunity. The first thing that happened to Prando after returning to the police station was to let people search for Du Lin on the grounds that he suspected that Du Lin was suspected of this golden robbery, or that he had some understanding of the inside story and needed him to cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of such a city turmoil, Doolin waited in the engine room for the night before he closed the power cabin in the engine room, smooth and comfortable. Burt left the bank from the sewage pipe. He thought that he might need to borrow Schubert's death to make a fuss. I didn't expect that the idiots even had such important and obvious places as the sewage pipeline did not know the search, and all the brains ran out. Since there is no need to bury Schubert's life at this time, Du Lin will naturally hold the card in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not used now, does not mean that it will not be used in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11 o'clock in the evening, Du Lin returned to the farm, and after he opened the mantle cover, he squatted again, and the whole cellar was full of smoke. A group of people are smoking cigarettes in silence, with a dignified expression on their faces. When he saw it, he knew what it was because he was worried about him, because he said that he would gather together to discuss the next thing before eight o'clock. But at 11 o'clock, Du Lin had not appeared yet, and it would inevitably cause people to stop. Consider the bad direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although these bastards have done a lot of bad things, they are not necessarily good people, but they are really sincere to Du Lin. At least everyone who is here is there, no one is absent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin closed the manhole cover and coughed twice. "The sewer system is much more complicated than I thought. We lost our way. Thanks to a kind and unselfish helplessness, we were able to catch up before twelve o'clock. Come back.", Du Lin said that when he was selfless, Schubert’s eyes were a little different, and indeed they helped them, but not one, but a group. The group of babies ambushed them in the darkness, perhaps they strayed into the group of shackles, or for other reasons. In short, they succeeded in hitting them with an almost invisible environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Doolin and Schubert went through a fight, leaving only one person to destroy the group, and this "good" cockroach finally died Under the manhole cover. In Du Lin’s statement, he needs to pay for his rash behavior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked into the crowd and took off the stinky clothes. He took a bucket of water from his smiling Alice. I washed my body aside. "It’s so sweet, Schubert, you have to take a shower, I really have enough of that taste!", Schubert’s face also had some sincere smiles, even though it was The robbers got on the bus, but so far there is no problem, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I am really suitable as a robber, Schubert thinks so, when his casual eyes touch two black iron boxes, his breathing gradually Then I rushed, and learned the appearance of Du Lin to take off the clothes and rushed through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people sit together and the box is in the middle. Du Lin asked Dudu to open the box with money. The water-soaked banknotes lost the luster of the sinner under the searchlight, but they still firmly attracted everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone feels itchy throat, itchy hands, their eyes quickly focus on Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin picked up the hand and felt soft and wet, and lost it to Savi, who was hippie and smiling. "Savi is indispensable today. If he is not strict with him." Execution of our plan, even if our ability is big, there is no way to take these things back under the surveillance of twenty or thirty gun guards, so these 50,000 are rewards for Savy.", Doolin's The distribution method is very random, basically how much is caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi will hold 50,000 pieces in his arms and laugh, this is the most money he has ever touched in his life, don’t say anything before. 50,000 yuan, if you want five yuan, fifty yuan, you need the Buddha's nod to agree, and it is very likely that he will not nod. What he did for Du Lin, he took it for granted, he should do it, he didn't feel how much he should take. However, this money Du Lin gave him, and also made him realize that sometimes it is not a problem that is not given, but an issue that is not in dispute. These 50,000 pieces illustrate his position in Doolin's mind, and money now represents more than just the symbol of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
