			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Tucks? Your friend’s wallet has been found, because today is the reason we need to have a regular meeting on Monday. Can you pick it up in person at the police station? "The sheriff was very enthusiastic when he called. He knew Mr. Tucks. This gentleman has lived here for several years. In addition to asking everyone to drink, there is no "bad habit". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never asked what was done in certain restricted areas, nor did he inquire about the whereabouts of some politicians, and was not interested in financial and scientific information. The only hobby It’s just drinking with everyone and making a few laughs with the girls who are prone to sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, he also likes to plant flowers and plants, and sometimes he will go to some ordinary sports places to exercise, playing polo and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he must have been deceived by this odious spy with his fellow countrymen. Mr. Sergeant and many police officers in the wealthy area have guaranteed that Tucks It is absolutely impossible for a gentleman to be a spy. In addition to Mr. Tucks’s assessment, the agents from the intelligence agencies agreed to the sheriff’s request and transferred Mr. Tucks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Tucks was very happy after listening. He said to Mr. Lapuan, who was temporarily staying at home, and drove to the police station. Take back Mr. Lapuan’s wallet. Mr. Lapuan said that he had to go with him, but he was refused by Tucks. The reason was that Mr. Lapuan had lost something on his "land" and he should take it back by himself. This is about To his decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes just walked for up to five minutes, someone knocked at the door, and Lapuan glanced outside through the hole in the door, it was a a young woman. This person is not the wife of Mr. Tucks. Lapuan has seen the photos of his wife. In the masculinity of "women are harmless," Lapian opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the pretty face that greets him, but one foot, one foot on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell backwards in a moment, and when he had already turned over his body at the moment of landing, he was half-squatted on the ground and was ready to escape into the house. He heard that he was not allowed. Move, and raise your hands and kneel on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without thinking, he knows that the person behind him must have raised his gun, and with that chaotic footsteps, he is convinced that he is too fast, so he Very fit and squatted on the ground. His hands were quickly cut and handcuffed, and two people took his arm and pulled him up from the floor. He saw the beautiful woman outside the door, and a dozen police officers and several black trench coats around. Guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff, the sheriff who appeared that night came to him, carefully looked at his face, and then definitely said to a black man around him, "that is, when he called the police that night." It’s him!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mr. Lapuan?”, the black man smiled and took out his ID, “I am the Federal National Security Intelligence Agency. Senior detective, now we suspect that you are suspected of multiple confidential cases, I hope that you can cooperate with one point and eat less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lapuan looked The black man, the brain spinning fast, he has figured out what. That night, his performance was indeed abnormal. He did not conform to the behavior of a normal person. When his things were stolen, he took the initiative to say "calculate" as a loser, which was enough to cause the other party to be alert. Even if he is replaced by him, he will feel that this person has a problem. If he can't make such a mistake in normal times, he will blame for drinking and drinking that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t blame Mr. Tucks, others can persuade him to drink, but he can stick to his position and not drink. No one is holding a gun to force him to drink, and drinking or not drinking is his own behavior. He remembered the words that Du Lin said, and everyone had to pay for his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon he was put on the hood and went to an underground base on a bumpy journey. The underground is, Amp smells the air. Moist air mixed with earthy smell. The air in winter will only dry, not so wet, and there is such a humid place, except the underground, which is the seaside. But there was no sound of the waves around him, and he initially judged that it was underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the air duct on the top of his head and was taken into a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two men and one woman are waiting for him in the house. After he came in, he was pressed into the restraint chair, fixed his limbs and sent him. The detective also took off his clothes and left only one pair of underpants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold, damp air gave birth to some goose bumps on his skin, and the hairs were erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should already know your own situation...", the man said first, "My name is Smith, the federal security intelligence agency special agent, This is my partner, Ms. Lola.” Mr. Smith’s face is very strong, angular and angular, looks particularly righteous, and his tone of voice is like a messenger of justice. I feel a little funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and said: "I am very sorry, interrupt your words. I can ask why you will treat me as a spy? Although you didn't say it, I can feel it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Smith doesn't mind talking to Ampdo for a while. Many times the trial does not have to use hard and cruel methods to force the tortured person to say what the torturer is interested in, and many more. Chat is one of the peaceful ways of interrogation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people think that you are suspicious, and then based on the information you provided, we launched the intelligence personnel on the empire to explore your details, and you discovered them. What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you find? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affirming that nothing has been discovered, in fact, Amp is also considered to be half of the intelligence department. He asked Anna if he was a member of the federal side. What to do if you notice and inquire about his details. Anna told him that he could be assured that the identity information they prepared was not kept secret, and the relevant personnel were also the internal intelligence department personnel. When the other party has reviewed his information, he is likely to be charged with the crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, it seems that the other party found something, which made Amp curious to ask Mr. Smith what he wanted to answer, "What did you find?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Smith snorted and his face showed some sad and sad look. "Our two good comrades, good companions, lost their tracks while tracing your personal information. Initially prejudged that they may be killed, which is why we will invite you. I believe that an ordinary family is absolutely impossible to kill two highly trained and highly trained intelligence personnel. This shows your identity. Have a question, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp’s first reaction was that there was a problem on the empire, but soon he realized that it was impossible, he The current identity is Lapuan, not Amp, and there is no such thing as a dull and shameless person who wants to count him. Anna is also very dependent on him. It is impossible to sell him. What is the problem? Does Anna know this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question may have to be settled for a long time before it can be answered. There is currently no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Lapian was taken as a spy, Du Lin got the news, and honestly he had a hunch about it, when Elliott When they said that they had killed two federal intelligence personnel, Du Lin had already guessed that Mr. Lapuan would have a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the next one, it is so simple to see who is going to save him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic in Otis City has finally begun to fall, the cold weather is a reason, and it is impossible for everyone to come here to enjoy themselves every day, but also need to go back to work hard In exchange for the next chance to enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This traffic refers only to those outside the entertainment facilities and venues, not including casinos. The casino is still overcrowded, the entire empire now has only one place to gamble openly, and there is the highest unrestricted gambling table in the casino, which greatly stimulates many gamblers and wealthy people to come here. They left or took away a lot of money and became the best propaganda tool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse of the George family led to a situation in which the newspaper industry was divided, especially after Arthur’s arrest for second-degree murder, as if the entire George family It’s going to be finished. The newspaper industry seems to be ushered in the spring, and they all understand one thing, that is, to report news for others, it is able to make money. It’s not that making money in the form of advertising is purely a kind of news that has a position and attitude, and that can make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such an ordinary but not calm day, Nasha came to the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came with Mr. John’s last wish, yes, last wish. This life in the newspaper industry, founded three special syndicates syndicate, monopolized the legendary figures of the entire industry press release, and eventually died in hospital beds due to organ failure. The two parents were sent away in a month, which made Nasha's look very embarrassing. She was wearing sunglasses and wearing a furry fur and appeared in Doolin's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to buy the Empire Star Media Company, I know it's hard to do, but I really want it.", Nasha is more mature than before. No, aggressive or screaming, it looks like a very intellectual woman. "I apologize to you for the unhappiness between us. I hope that you will not substitute some of the past emotions into this matter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked down at the pen in her hand after listening, Nasha’s heart was tight, she knew that Du Lin was very interested in that company, The sales of the Empire Star are also steadily rising. Last month's sales hit 49000 tapes, while the high-open family tape company saw a decline in sales, only sold 37,000. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
