			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of Kailemen allowed the federal and even the citizens of the entire empire to believe that war has become a past tense, and even the federal merchants came to the core of the country. There is no accident in the opening of such a hotel in the place. Doesn’t the shadow of the war have become farther and farther, and the bell of peace and freedom has already sounded? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This businessman from the Federation is called Kaile, so this hotel is called Kailemen, and it seems to be confirming the victory of the Empire in the War of the North and the South. fruit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, Mr. Keller has become an empire and federal social celebrity, and has held a number of positions with strong political ethics, such as "consultants." The empire and the federal high-level officials attach great importance to Mr. Kaile’s views, precisely because his actions completely calm down the military confrontation that may last for a long time, and that side regards him as bringing peace. The messenger gave him a lot of convenience, so that the operation is no longer the main job of Mr. Kaile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His main job, of course, is hacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a celebrity like him using a hacker to describe his work is really an insult to him, it is better to use "messeng" is much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., are you dining or entertaining?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just stepping into the gate of Kailemen On the marble floor, a welcome lady immediately greeted him. He led Du Lin toward the inside and asked Du Lin to Kailemen for the main purpose. Then Du Lin reported Kevin's name, but there was a little accident, because Kevin only reported two people when registering the number of people, but now there are three people. In order to prevent the later appearance of this guest from affecting other people's meals, the restaurant needs to confirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about two minutes, Kevin walked out of the elevator. He had a cane in his hand. While walking, he tried to make his cane look like a civilized stick. But the somewhat awkward posture still sold the real purpose of the delicate stick in his hand. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would contact me tomorrow, you are coming, I have a friend to introduce to you.", Kevin is very enthusiastic and Du Lin hugged a bit, then patted his arm, turned and walked with him toward the elevator, and whispered: "This time I invited the head of a new department of the Ministry of Justice, benefiting from your presence in Otis. The set of citizen identification documents system, which is considered to be of great significance within the Ministry of Justice, has already prepared a proposal to be submitted to the Imperial Parliament for voting in March."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"From the current situation, it is impossible to have any resistance. Magus also nodded in agreement. The old party was angry and could guarantee that there would be no accidents in the Imperial Parliament. So the Ministry of Justice thought inside. It is to establish the content of the departmental framework first, and then the proposal can be entered into the work immediately after listing. This new department, called the 'Imperial Citizen Information Office', will manage the identity information of all citizens of the entire empire, to a certain extent It’s a department that doesn’t seem to be useful, but it’s absolutely important!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two said as they walked, and when they arrived in the waiting area, the hotel waiter was already They stopped the elevator and opened the elevator door, and the two stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel's decoration is very luxurious, with a noble atmosphere from the inside out, it looks very unassuming, but it doesn't hate this. local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dining place on the third floor of the hotel, when the elevator door opens, Du Lin understands why the Kailemen Hotel is one of the best hotels in the Imperial City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much clear on the third floor of the entire hotel, but he can count how many tables there are, not to say that the restaurant on the third floor is small, just On the contrary, the area here is very large. But the distance between each table and each table is very wide, at least not less than fifteen meters. Doolin also noticed that there were some screens around the table to ensure the privacy of the people inside. Even if the voice was a little louder, the people at the next table could not hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge crystal chandelier made the entire third floor very bright, and Kevin greeted Du Lin toward the table they booked. It was a square table, and Doolin didn't look crowded. A woman who looked like a 37-year-old had stood up and looked at Kevin and Doolin with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This beautiful lady is Nomi, who will serve as the chief of the information office and is responsible for the information approval for national citizens every two years." He laughs I nodded to Nomi, and then continued to introduce, "This is my good friend, Mr. Doolin. You may not be familiar with him, but I think you must have heard of Dulin City in Otis City. Long, this is the gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nomi菈 took the initiative and reached out with Du Lin, which made Du Lin slightly surprised, but did not show it. "It is a very lucky thing to have a good time to know a young talent like Mr. Doolin. Everyone is discussing when you will come back and will bring us new surprises!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I believe that it will not be far away!" Du Lin answered very politely, and he sat down with two sentences and three talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nomi is also a member of the New Party. It is based on the people’s feelings and is at the core of the imperial politics of the Imperial Capital, and is also a subordinate branch of the Ministry of Justice’s vertical management. The chief sergeant should be an amazing big man. There may be no mistake in saying this, but it depends on who compares it. If it is only compared with the mayor of a remote city, Nomi has enough gas to stand in the same place and let Du Lin say hello to her first. But Du Lin is different. He has not only served as the mayor of the SAR, but he is said to have a very good personal relationship with Harry and Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Nomi菈 not stand in the same place, and everyone can see that Dulin’s dismissal has not been accompanied by the party’s rank. The reduction, even at the level of the party, has also increased by one level, which makes the party insiders realize that Du Lin’s dismissal may be insider. Of course, it is possible that Magus favored him. No matter what the reason, I can't escape the final result. Du Lin will definitely return to the new party and become an important person in the party. According to his current party level, he can serve as the mayor of any city, even Governor of a remote area! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a new party in the party who has such energy and skills, why does Nomi have the courage to stand still? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting down, everyone talked for a while, maybe Nomi and Du Lin met for the first time, so the topic is not very deep, less than nine At the time, Nomi菈 resigned and prepared to go home. After Kevin bought the order, she and Du Lin watched her go to the car and left, then the two brothers looked at each other and smiled and got on the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting on the bus, both of them ordered a cigarette. Kevin’s took a few mouthfuls and then glanced at the driver. After Du Lin nodded, he said: "This information office is a very powerful department in the future. If you want to know any person's information, you only need to make a phone call to know where this person lives and who. Living together, what kind of work is being done, how much income is there. Even we can get their bills through the central bank or other banks, which can almost completely control everyone in the hands of the official.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now many people still don't see the benefits of the information office, and regard this department as a cold bench, but I believe that after the information office develops, it will be shocked. Human eyes. No matter whether you have any contact with Nomi, you can sell it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
