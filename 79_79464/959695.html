			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freina is very embarrassed, this thing has nothing to do with her, she just wants to maintain a group standing on the side of her own ideas, The result is so much trouble. At the same time, she also realized that Madur was very likely to be coming to herself, otherwise she would not have such a clever thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I make a call?" Freena hesitated for a while, and finally gave a sigh of relief and made a request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maduer stunned, and his mind turned, and those students would only give their parents if they called, but it would be hard to say who Freina would call. It is. Last year, she was said to be the CEO of a company. Will she know any great people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that Madur felt that there was such a possibility, he pouted and thought about it, and finally decided to let Freena make this call. As long as it is not the one he really can't afford, he can not care about the other's attitude. Freena is the most important piece of his dream puzzle. The singer already has the pillar of Celine, but the actor still lacks an actor who can get the hand and win the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the contract of Freena, the appeal she brings is enough to call on some second-rate actors to sign his Star Brokers, even the first-rate actors may not I can't talk about it, because Freina is the "example", which also allows people to feel that he really wants to do things, so I have already invited Freena, who has already had a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is some frictional collision for this, it is within his acceptance, once the "Mauldur rule" forms the standard, his prestige and power It is possible to break through the field of brokerage companies and penetrate into other fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actors, directors, screenwriters and even producers will be influenced and influenced by him in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena went to the phone booth and called the new house in Doolin, Otis. At this time, Du Lin should be sleeping, under the rough reminder of her heart. The phone was finally connected, and it was Defu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am, Freena, Doolin? ?", Freena turned her hand in her hand and turned her back to the phone booth. She was very nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dove heard the strange tone and immediately replied, "Mr. Doolin? He is on a business trip, not in the city of Otis. Why, is there any urgent matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What?!", Freina almost called out, "Is there his current contact?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, no, but he I should be back tomorrow, and I can pass it on to him for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget it...", Freena hung up and sighed With one breath, I didn't expect to go on this road in the end. In fact, she can disagree, but the result of this is that she has to be retired by the Royal Academy because she is also involved. If she only wants her own money, she wants to study and she can not sign. The problem is that she is coming to Doolin, and the money is also from Du Lin. Her future is still in Du Lin, so she can't lose her identity as a Royal College student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment he slowly walked out of the phone booth, Madur smashed his fist and became! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the female agent, and the female agent immediately leaned over. "To prepare a broker contract, and inform the company to open a press conference tomorrow." We will sign a cooperation contract with Ms. Freina in front of the media.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female agent immediately turned her head to the nanny car as a senior The broker has the power to take the initiative to sign a client, so there is such a contract in the nanny car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madour is very satisfied, he let the students, then went to Freina’s body, acting like a gentleman, slightly reaching out and reaching out Invited, "Please go here, I have already prepared the contract, in order to celebrate the surprise of this accident, we have a drink at night!", he has already made a place to go to the bar, must be contracted tonight Signed up, tomorrow is just a cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Freena could only follow him to the bar, and her classmates did not disperse and stayed where they were. They feel anger, feel relaxed, feel shame, and are filled with all sorts of complex emotions, so that no one takes the first step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramazan’s wine was almost faded. His face was red, red and white, and the last bite followed. Things start with him, then he should take on these responsibilities! Other students looked at it and finally walked towards the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there were already two contracts on the coffee table in front of Freena. The female agent handed a pen to her. After she took it, she sighed helplessly. She has already seen the contract. She chose ten movies. If it is tight, it will be finished in about two or three years. As the most important part of the contract, Madur directly wrote 10 million astronomical figures. He also laughed that the number was not that he would not let Freena repent, because Freina’s contract was worth the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking that his future has become uncertain, Freena smiled and bowed her head, just as the tip of her pen fell on the paper. The eyes of the three people in the room are concentrated on the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a sudden hand appeared, grabbed Freena’s hand holding the pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't ask me to disagree, do you want to change jobs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar The voice made Freena stun for a few seconds, and her eyes filled with tears immediately. She let go of her hand and stood up. She jumped directly onto the coffee table and slammed into Doolin's arms. Du Lin slammed back several steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the fellowships here just fear that the other party is really blocking Du Lin’s. After being praised by Du Lin, he ran out and kept stealing. listen. When he heard the name of Freina, he couldn't help but think of the peach rumors that everyone had nothing to say before. One of the rumors is the Frey. When he returned, he immediately told Doolin about this. Du Lin was also very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, I can meet Freina when I talk about something, and I still have trouble with her. This luck is really nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the room, Madur looked at the pillar that was about to arrive, and he stood up, his eyes staring like a sword. Dooling, slightly cocking his chin, his face with a smile on his face, "I haven't asked... Who are you on the horse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He was really angry, and the goddess of fate sent his chance to realize his dreams to his hands. As a result, there were now twists and turns, anxious, irritated and angry, and Du Lin’s young face. He has a desire to say that he wants to destroy something, and his tone is already very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he was stunned by anger, forgetting who was there outside the private room, how did Du Lin come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?", Du Lin finally pushed open her own Freya and smiled at Madur. "My name is Doolin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The name Du Lin does not have a high degree of understanding. There are not thousands of people in this empire called Doolin. There are hundreds of people in this empire. Although it is not like the name of a bad street like John, it is not rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Lin?", Madur snorted. "I haven't heard of it, why, have you gone to the wrong room?"<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; beside the driver Ma Duer stood up, under the distention of clothes is full of muscle strength, he does not mind beat this kid meal at the boss's orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Du Lin shrugged and looked at Freena. "The guy who seems to be your new boss doesn't know me!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madur’s arrogance over the heart of the man went to Du Lin’s face, his man was ten centimeters taller than Doolin, and the two were closer. He looked down at Du Lin. "Young people, give you a chance to come back. Now you have time to go out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words have not finished The temple suddenly had a sharp pain, and the head was stunned, and then the place where it was hit was drummed up again. When he slammed his head and was about to fight back, a cold metal object fell on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the agent and the vice president handled the outside things and came in. They saw Du Lin’s guns and pulled out the pistols, pointing The driver who stepped on the coffee table and raised his fist, and the frightened female agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like to talk to others with my head up!", Doolin's wrist began to force, the muzzle against Madur's head turned him down Pressure, he knows what Du Lin wants to do, but he does not want to cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin still holds Madur’s pen in his hand, a pen worth thirty-eight dollars. He tightened the pen and inserted it directly into Madur's thigh. The latter swayed and hardened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't kill me, I promise you won't see the sun of tomorrow, the whole empire has no place for you.", the light in the private room Very dim, he could not see the appearance of two people behind Du Lin, otherwise he would not say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
