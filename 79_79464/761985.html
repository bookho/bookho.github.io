			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the third day, Juan’s eldest son’s face was gloomy, his eyes filled with anger and a hint of unclear ridicule. He pushed the door into Juan. In the office, Hu’s documents signed with Eric yesterday fell on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan looked up at his eldest son. "Do you have any opinion on me, or do you have any opinion on this item on the table?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several children in Juan are not fuel-efficient lights, they want to gain a higher status and more power in the family, but Juan never gave them a thought. Everything you want. In Juan’s eyes, these children are still too young, although as long as he is still alive, no one can do anything to him and his company in Irian, no one dares to do anything to his children. But he is not so reassured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of times Juan is also very clear that he should actually let go of some power and industry to teach the children to take care of them. Juan, who can stand out from many workshops, has more control over his power than he is. He knows that he is wrong in making this, and he cannot make the final decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, his children will naturally complain, the eldest son is twenty-nine years old, the children have two, and now The location is only a manager of a bar, instead of managing the bar in Juan, there is no power in decision making. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is actually very painful. The pain is that no matter whether Juan’s children work in a family business or leave a family business to start a business, they can’t get rid of Juan. The shadows imposed on them, some grievances are not a strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son Cullen pushed the documents and bank extensions in front of Juan with a mocking smile, after Juan stared at his eldest son for a few seconds. Only calmly bowed his head. He just glanced at it and his brows stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the bank documents are very simple. Eric has mortgaged all the shares of East Coast Entertainment to the bank some time ago, in other words Two days ago, the equity transfer agreement signed by Juan and Eric was invalid, and his one million promissory note was also thrown into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some headaches Juan looked up at his eldest son again, the latter shrugged. "I have personally caught Eric, but he disappeared." Not only are our people arresting him, Du Lin’s people are catching him, and many others are looking for Eric. There are about 20 to 30 deceived people in the whole city, and the regional police station counts it. The total amount of fraud has exceeded 4 million!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Cullen, he is a joke-like mentality. Juan is old, but he is not willing to give up his power. Although the children have great complaints about him, no one dares to say anything, at least No single failed investment has proved that Juan’s so-called “destiny” argument is indeed a bit of a god. But such an unexpected investment failure now has caused great destructiveness to Juan’s authority at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe that a person can disappear without leaving any clues. Someone will have seen Eric, know what he did, or went. Where, find this person, and then give him a sum of money, let him tell us what he knows.", Juan has almost no thoughts and has a decision, he has never discussed with his children. A decision was made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cullen bowed slightly, "As you wish, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must be a In vain search, Eric is like evaporating in the human world. No one knows where he went. No one has seen him. He is like a person who did not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second day of Eric's disappearance, people gathered in the office of the director of the regional police station. The Secretary saw some rich people and celebrities, and the cold sweats were all down. The only thing worthy of his gratitude was that this leak was not in his hands. He looked at the imperial central bank manager standing next to him and poked his arm with his elbow. "You have to say something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manager At the end of the day, this is why he asked the police chief to gather all the deceived people. He must make it clear to the victims that the bank has not been deceived because the shares of East Coast Entertainment are in the bank. In my hand, although this is a bit too overbearing, but the manager of the imperial central bank can afford to lose 550,000, then there must be others to carry this account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the table and quieted in a small conference room. This room was used for interrogation work, so it was not very big. Slightly crowded. He presented a document that had been submitted to the hands of each deceived person. The capacity of Takuben was very simple. There was a signature from the head of the bank mortgage department, the seal of the Irian District Court, and Eric’s signature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, strictly speaking, the contract signed by the parties themselves has the same legal effect, but the bank’s document has a court seal, which is natural. Higher than others. He coughed aloud. "Today, please come to you to explain one thing. Under the court's proof, East Coast Entertainment has mortgaged the equity to the Imperial Central Bank's Irian branch, which has the signature of both of us. The seal of the court has a higher priority in law than the ones present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Eric, one of the parties, has fled and sinned. According to the terms of the mortgage agreement, Mr. Eric has given up the power to redeem the equity of East Coast Entertainment. From today, East Coast Entertainment will belong to the empire. The central bank, the Irian branch, all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager’s words have not been finished and he saw someone holding the agreement in his hand and lost it. He married. The body easily escaped, but there is a little bit of embarrassment. They are not the last signed agreement, but they are not the first one to sign an agreement. Naturally, some people are not happy. Obviously we spend money in front of you, and whoever ran the company became your thing, the world has no reason! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of such a non-threatening attack, bank managers have apparently long been expected. Some of them have invested in most or even all of their savings, but now they tell them that they have been beaten, how can they be willing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, after our inspection at the Ianan branch of the Chamber of Commerce, you gave the money to Eric and determined your own on paper. Investment behavior, but the archives of the Chamber of Commerce did not register any shareholder other than Eric and his long-lost partner, which means that the agreement you signed does not actually have any legal effect. Because this is an agreement that does not complete all the processes, they are actually void according to the relevant provisions of the Imperial Law!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have any dissatisfaction and other In the case, you can consult a lawyer, or even go to the court to file a lawsuit against Eric. In addition, I have to insert a digression. After our short and effective work, in the archives of the Chamber of Commerce, the East Coast Entertainment Company’s registered powers have already It became the imperial central bank and no longer accepted the registration of other powers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, people are stupid, and to be honest, some people are not clear Shares of power changes people have to go to the Chamber of Commerce branch register, while the other part of people think this kind of thing should be done by Eric, but not them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, the whole small meeting room immediately became chaotic, everyone expressed their thoughts, and everything was unclear. After two or three minutes of quarreling, the police chief patted the table hard, and the small conference room was quiet. He was just wearing his own police cap and said: "I understand the anger of everyone at this time. I can understand you, the problem is that things have already happened. We have also filed for this case and notified the police stations and courts in most states. Once I have Eric’s news, I will inform you as soon as possible and recover as much as possible for everyone. Loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
