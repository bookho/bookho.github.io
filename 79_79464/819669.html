			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irian’s trial attracted many people’s attention. Some of the “deceiver” and “victim” families in this case also bought tickets from the emperor. When I arrived in Irian, the passengers on this route were a little unclear. It was the arrival of Ilyan’s tourist season, and perhaps two more passengers to Irian’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the deceivers and the families of the victims, the three major feature agencies of the Empire not only sent a group of reporters who were luxurious, but also carried two The camera that took the entire trial process was intended to film the entire trial process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Century fraud, just this name will be bought by many people, they even have an idea to adapt this fraud to a movie, it is estimated that there will be good Box office. It is important to know that this has been the largest amount involved in recent years, the largest number of deceived people, and the largest number of victims... In short, financial cases that have broken many records have shocked the entire Western world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple speculations have also cast a mysterious veil on this case. Some people think that the mastermind of this case has another person, Du Lin just They introduced the scapegoat. Others believe that there is no mastermind at all. This is entirely the official wool-cutting act of the empire. The money is in the treasury of the imperial central bank. More and more rumors have made the news in these days all the time, and the name Doolin is also famous for the entire empire, even the Western world,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early morning of the next day, the temperature was only about zero degrees. The court was already crowded with the deceiver who wanted to go in and the family of the victim. The trial that could have been attended was eventually suspended because of the large number of people. Open. Only the deceiver and the family of the victim can enter, and only one can enter, which makes many people dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time points to 8:45 am, three modified police trucks entered the back door of the court, at the same time, represented The prosecutor of the prosecutor, An Pu, also appeared in people's sights. A large flash of light instantly flashed a lot of uncomfortable onlookers, and Amp lowered his head and stepped on the steps under the protection of the soldiers. Standing on the highest step, he stopped and the reporters immediately realized what he was going to say and immediately swarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp with a confident smile on his face, as if he had already won the game, he dressed himself this morning, just like every time he appeared in court. Facing these reporters, he only slightly indulged, and smiled and opened his mouth. The late sunshine was on his face, and he was bathed in golden sunshine. At this moment, people suddenly quieted down, looked at him, looked at the prestigious prosecutor, and wanted to hear what he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is justice and fairness in this world. Maybe you can't see it, but it won't be forever. You will see it someday. When you see it, you will realize that evil can't beat justice after all." No matter how much we pay for it, it’s worth it!” He waved his hand and said thank you and squeezed into the courtroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporters recorded the words of Amp, and the photographers hated why the camera in their hands was black and white, why haven’t they studied color yet? camera! There was a burst of cheers in the crowd after the calm. People liked the appearance of Amp, liked his self-confidence and liked what he said. He seems to be the embodiment of justice, presiding over the power that God has given him to find justice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, three luxury cars stopped outside the courtroom, and reporters and onlookers once again found something that focused on their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a driving door, a bright leather shoe stepped out of the door and steadily stepped on the ground, followed by Du Lin from the car. . He wore a gray coat, a dark formal dress and a white shirt with a tie. He looked at the crowds and smiled a little, and also walked up the steps under the arches of Dufo and Airlis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reporter suddenly shouted, "Mr. Amper has said something to us, do you want to listen?", he did not wait for Du Lin to give His own opinions shouted out what Anpu said. People were quiet again, and they were quiet except for occasional curses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the reporter repeated Amp’s words, he asked: “Mr. Doolin, what do you want to say to everyone now?”林 <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the reporter, and other reporters also looked at him. He was in his early thirties, with brown hair and a triangular badge on his chest. It’s no wonder that the people of the special publications are sharper than other reporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pointed to him, "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter’s grin Laughing, "I am a nameless pawn, Mr. Doolin, please don't evade my question. Do you have anything to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin keeps The smile, the golden brilliance also spilled on him. He slightly brewed it. "What is justice, what is fairness? When everyone thinks that one thing is right, is it necessarily right? The same is true. When everyone thinks you are wrong, are you really wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't oppose Ampo's prosecutor's remarks. He said it makes sense, but it doesn't apply to me. In this world, the greatest justice and fairness is the law. I firmly believe that the law will give everyone the justice they deserve. And fair, long live the law, justice will win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing his head, he entered the court door, and those outside the door came from the emperor. After a moment of sorrow, the gods opened again. They can do whatever is right or wrong, fair and equitable, they just want to know who took their money and let their life savings become a bubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trial was conducted by three judges at the same time. Because of the particularity of the case, whether Du Lin was guilty or not was decided by the jury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was sitting in the dock after entering the court, but he was not nervous at all, but he was talking and laughing with Kevin. The seats that were being watched were already full, and some people stood on the sides of the wall. They were willing to stand for one morning and wanted to get close contact with the trial of 70 million funds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At nine o'clock, the judge sitting in the middle knocked on the raft, and the entire court immediately quieted down. After a series of processes, it finally began to dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has been observing Amp, he has not had the decadence of yesterday, and the whole person is confident that it will light up. Dooling understands Amp's mentality a bit. People like them are actually proud, so even in the face of failure, they must come up with the most perfect one and be proud to face the painful ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Judges adults..., I will submit an exhibit first...", Amp will take out the evidence bag with the note and send it to the judge Then, then give the jury members one by one. The note was written with time and place, and then Doolin summoned the newsboy and Bruni. Throughout the process, Amp maintained a certain degree of excitement and expectation, and he was curious as to what the trial would look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the newsboy said what he said in his own honesty, there was some embarrassment in the court, and the next question was Bruni. At this time, the problem finally appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruni confessed in court, directly denied everything he had, and said that the newsboy lied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Bruni, do you know the meaning of confession and perjury in court?" One of the judges glared at Bruni. "This will increase your charges and you may pay a higher price." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruni was silent for a moment, then actually took off his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp did not stop in the process because he already knew what Bruni would do. When Bruni showed his scars, he said to the judge: "They found me and thought that I killed Juan and asked me to admit it. I didn't agree, then they used me to torture. I am afraid of me. They will be killed by them, so I did what they said..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a buzz in the court again, and the judge had to forcefully waved the raft in his hand. Let the court calm down. The judge sitting in the middle looked at the expressionless Du Lin on the dock and asked: "Mr. Doolin, what do you think of this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually This is not in line with the rules. No matter what Du Lin has any opinions, it should be heard by Kevin. However, the special nature of this case is not sure that everything will be completed in accordance with the procedures, so this is not beyond the routine. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood up and paid tribute first. He whispered: "I don't have any opinion. Three judges, I believe the law will give me a The result of fairness and justice!" After he sat down, the three judges discussed it and decided to adjourn for ten minutes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second key witness in court will make it difficult for the trial to continue. There must be a pause process. Missing this step will continue from the next step. After ten minutes of reopening, all the evidence and testimony given by Amp were negated by Kevin, and the next witnesses were also turned over in court, which caused the trial to be interrupted again. In fact, at this point, the three experienced judges have determined that Du Lin does have problems, but without the support of evidence and witnesses, it is impossible to He has any influence. They are a little sympathetic to Amp, and they are here, and they are also the recommendations of the Supreme Court of the Empire and the Imperial Justice. There is no doubt that Amp has been planted, but they are not particularly worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the proof that the court may not be so "standard" in the collection of evidence, in the end it is not a big deal, nothing more than to punish the case handlers. Plus Anp is the person of the judicial system, he may not need to bear too serious results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fourth session, the results were basically confirmed, but at this time, Kevin stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the trial like a farce has no meaning, the members of the jury are confused, and they still have some tendency to stand in succession. After the confession and alleged torture, their positions have become blurred. What Kevin needs is this result, and then enough to make Amp "pay the price" change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Du Lin still had some danger in this trial. The danger came from the jury. Ampu was very smart to mobilize some juries from other places. The members of the regiment will form a new jury, which will give each member of the jury a very special feeling - Du Lin is very powerful, and the local jury is bought by him, not enough to undertake such an important duty. So from the beginning, the jury was biased, and they were more inclined to Amp, rather than a neutral position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he held a piece of paper held in a glass piece, only the size of the palm, filled with characters, "Judge, I think Provide a piece of material from the stomach when the deceased dissected.", said his assistant began to send the printed documents to the judge, as well as the jury members, he continued: "It can be very clear Seeing this above, this is a suicide note, a suicide note by Mr. Juan. He explained his last thoughts in his suicide note, and it is enough to prove that Mr. Juan did not die from the murder that Mr. Anpu said. It’s suicide.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came up with a document, “This is the debt transfer document after the auction, before Mr. Juan’s suicide, Du Lin Mr. Juan has become the creditor of Mr. Juan, and Mr. Juan owes Mr. Du Lin 2.3 million yuan!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I would like to ask three judges Adult, jury members, regardless of whether the evidence and witness testimony are problematic, Doolin Does the student have the motive for murdering Mr. Juan?" He walked to the jury's seat and held a large copy of the rubbish in his hand to ensure that everyone could see it. "This is 2.3 million yuan. The debt is not two hundred and thirty. If Mr. Doolin wants to murder Juan, what about the 2.3 million debt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Not a small amount, I admit very inferiorly, I may not earn so much money in my life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I still need to state a fact Mr. Juan and Mr. Doolin have commercial contradictions. This is a well-known thing. But this is not enough to prove that Mr. Doolin will ruin the debt in order to vent his anger. My personal opinion is more inclined. This is Mr. Juan’s revenge against Mr. Doolin!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
