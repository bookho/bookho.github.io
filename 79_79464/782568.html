			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander’s hesitant decision is in everyone’s heart, and no one can make a big profit. He has done a half-life hotel, and it is impossible for him to do other things across the bank. His so-called partnership with Du Lin is actually a long-term investment. He took out the money to join Du Lin's plan, and then distributed him a dividend every year, which is much better than the existence of a bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin pointed out that he had a gold mine in his hand and wanted to partner with him, he hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know how to answer Du Lin’s question. If he answers his will, does Du Lin really want to partner with him in the hotel industry? Does it mean that he is again Nor is it a person in the company who can decide anything in one word. Does it mean that there is money in the future, and there is a copy of Doolin? If the answer is not willing, will there be a crack in the relationship with Doolin, will it make Du Lin feel that he is a very embarrassing person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of money, no one can be generous, especially when the money involved may be calculated in millions of dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin suddenly laughed, he patted Alexander’s shoulder and looked at him with a blank look: “Well, don’t make fun of you, where am I? Is there money to build a hotel everywhere? I just made a joke, but the things I said are my true views. The hotel industry has great potential for development. Instead of doing something strange, it is better to do something familiar to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted Alexander's shoulder, and Du Lin left temporarily after the two touched the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the banquet, Scott found Du Lin again. He was there at the same time and heard Du Lin’s "high theory." Scott is a city hall person. He can only say a little about the business operations. But he is very good at politics and he is very concerned. As Dulin said, the empire's economy is recovering rapidly from the post-war rundown, and this has already been seen in the capital and more developed regions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire’s high-level thinks that this has a lot to do with the New Party’s ruling philosophy. Compared with the rigid rule of the nobility, the New Party’s ruling philosophy is more in line with the current empire. The situation is also closer to international trends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the empire lose to the Federation of monkeys in the Great Patriotic War? It is not that the empire's weapons are not as good as the other side. In terms of weapons, the empire's sophisticated war weapons and weapons-loading platforms can be said to be superior to the federal weapons. It is the economic issue that makes the empire almost lose the war. It is the issue of soft power. A best weapon-equipped platform can hold at least ten times the same level of federal combat units, but the problem is that the federal is not ten, twenty, thirty or even fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the tsunami directly destroyed the defensive line of the empire, when the empire began to take it seriously and counterattack, it was not enough to find that their production capacity could not keep up with the money! This also makes the empire recognize the importance of the economy. The first thing the New Party did after it took office was to liberate the suppression of the merchants by the royal family and the nobles during the imperial system, and thus the rapid recovery of the imperial economic environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many choices, letting the merchants and the capital in their hands get a good return, it also brings some trouble. For example, monopoly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a political point of view, monopoly is an unhealthy business model, but in order to quickly restore economic power, the foundation empire that re-established the empire had to release power at the time. . But now the empire is a little helpless to the big capitalists and big consortia who are starting to go crazy. They occupy an absolute leadership position in each industry, and touching their sensitive nerves is like smashing a horse cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is related to the current social stability and sustainable development of the entire empire. Every trust company represents hundreds of thousands or even millions and more behind them. Employees, if there are so many unemployed people in the society at once, I can imagine how much the law and order will be destroyed! The empire can't solve the problem of trust. It can only be a way of thinking. They no longer want to dismember these trust companies, but they want to manage them in a controlled way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but another problem has arisen. Although the empire has a department in charge of commerce, it does not actually have any power, because power is used by the Imperial Chamber of Commerce. The members of the parliament are firmly in control. Those in the Chamber of Commerce will only think that the power in the hands is not big enough, the capital has not yet fully obtained the true freedom, and how can they make their own rules to restrain themselves? This has become a point of conflict. The New Party wants to get back the power of the Chamber of Commerce, but the Chamber of Commerce will not give it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott is looking for Doolin to ask if Dolin has any idea of ​​solving this problem. In fact, Scott does not think that Doolin can do it. At this point, the reason why he was looking for Du Lin was to marvel at the performance of Du Lin and the banquet. Maybe he could say something effective? However, he soon became disappointed. This is not something that Du Lin can solve. Capital itself is harmless, but it is troublesome driven by interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another world, in order to disintegrate the monopoly of all walks of life, the Western countries do not know how many people have died, and how many shady transactions have been made to make the monopoly a form that everyone can accept. Here, Du Lin thinks that he, including Scott and the mayor behind him, can't do this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Alexander contacted Doolin as a thank-you to Du Lin for his conviction today. He invited Du Lin to participate in a game, which represented Du Lin has successfully integrated into the social circle of Irian and has a certain status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that gambling in the Yaoxing Empire is an illegal act. From the era of theocracy, gambling has been labeled very seriously. At the earliest days of the ****, those priests believed that gambling was an act of indulging their desires. This kind of behavior was the soil of greed, and it also attracted the glimpse of the devil. In that era, anything that is related to the devil or the devil will not be better. Many people who are openly gambling are tied to the trial column and burned alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes religions do have some overkill problems, and of course they can be understood as characteristics of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the subsequent empire, gambling and the ban on casinos were also prohibited. Any game that uses money as a bargain or cash settlement can be considered a gamble. the behavior of. The reason why it is so strictly prohibited is not a cause. In the early days of the empire, many people lost their property because of gambling, including their land and houses and everything they could sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them became slaves in order to pay their bills, but some people took the road and they used crime to get more money. In gambling, it is hoped that the account will be repaid, which creates a vicious circle. In order to put an end to this act, the imperial law directly plagiarized the sacred law, and imposed heavy sentences on all those who opened casinos and participated in gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the more things you ban, the more widespread the people are. After the high-pressure period, this kind of game that everyone loves is revived. It may be that the royal family also understands that some things are not forbidden when you issued a decree, so they changed their terms and then closed their eyes. One eye, as long as the amount of gambling is not large, it will not be how much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behavior of folk gambling is actually not serious, and not much, because everyone has no money. However, this kind of behavior is more common among the rich, and only the well-respected rich will organize the game and invite friends to join. This kind of obvious crime has made these rich people feel the feeling of excitement, deepen the relationship between them, and also spend time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
