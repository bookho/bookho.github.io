			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glared at De Lier’s neck with one hand, and the other hand smashed into a fist, squatting on Delil’s well-dressed face. This punch is full of strength, although the strength of the 16-year-old boy is far less than that of an adult, but considering the thinness of Delil, the damage to this punch has already been in place. The blood suddenly flowed out of De Lier's sore and sore nose, and the hot heat flowed along his lips to the two sides. He looked at Du Lin with horror and struggled desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave him a punch without another hesitation, another punch, and another punch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only the sounds of "噗", "噗", and "噗" in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After playing seven or eight punches, De Lier’s eyes showed a look of pleading and fear, and he no longer struggled, it seems to be Compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin loosened his hand around his neck and rubbed his arm. In fact, his fists hurt. Delil had no flesh on his face, and he always touched his cheekbones. When he hurt him, his fists hurt a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a "free" Delier's mouthful of gasping, the whole body curled up into the egg, looking at the rude, fearful Unreasonable, young people like barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't do this to me!", the slightly pointed scorpion and the distorted expression on his face made the artistic atmosphere of Delil disappear instantly. There is no trace of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s eyebrows picked up and picked up a miniature totem pole carved on ivory on the table of Delier, and slammed it into Delier. On the arm. The crisp sound made both people realize that between the arm and the ivory, one must have a fracture. Of course, the fracture will definitely not be ivory, then it is Delier's arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His screams haven’t lasted for a second, and Du Lin’s ivory is lifted high, the high scream like a soprano The sound came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Delier, can we talk about it now?", Du Lin looked at the egg and screamed in his arms. Delier, who was raped the same, was dangerous and fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier squinted his head, tears mixed with nosebleeds, dripping on the collar of his favorite clothes, and a drop of red stains shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, this is great!", Du Lin put the ivory artwork in his hand back to the original position, and specially adjusted the position. Let it stay the way it was before. He sorted out his clothes and instruments and sat down on the table. "So now, can you tell me what I can do to get Mrs. Vivian as soon as possible?" He pulled out of his pocket. A cigarette, give it to yourself, take a sip and then directly put a small number of banquets on Delier's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delier feared, said in a trembling voice: "Mrs. Vivian has a passionate pursuit of all good things...", said At this time, Delil suddenly silenced. He didn't know if he should tell the truth. Du Lin, who sneaked a glance at his eyes and became fierce, decided to say it thoroughly. The only thing he can pray now is that Doolin has nothing to do with Mrs. Vivian, otherwise he will definitely die hard to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Vivian has a special hobby... She likes young, young boys, but not too small, probably thirteen Handsome or beautiful boy around the age.", said all said, De Lier does not seem to intend to keep it, simply say it out. Anyway, if you say that the sentence is dead and you say that one hundred sentences are also dead, it is better to first confuse the situation before you think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, many husbands like these tune, most of their husbands have a lover outside, even if they go home for the night, they will rarely do anything. I don't know whether it is because of revenge, or some kind of hobby that belongs to women. In short, several ladies like to do this. I am here to find them for these special guests in addition to the art gallery. Prey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should say everything, can you let me go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Du Lin suddenly felt a little bit to say, he looked around, obviously a museum full of art, but did not expect to be doing such dirty work in the dark. The curator of the art gallery is actually a special pimp? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, considering another angle, this is actually normal. These high-ranking husbands have long lacked the necessary care and nourishment, and they will certainly complain. Some of them can bear it, but some people can't stand it, especially a woman who has a special power like Vivian, who doesn't care what men think and how to do it. Last time he also listened to Kevin, the mayor or a member of the parliament who had a female boss in a restaurant. I didn't expect to see these things here in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
