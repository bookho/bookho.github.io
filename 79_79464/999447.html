			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the continuation of the debate, the lawyer as a defendant suddenly raised a point of view, whether the photos would be artificially modified and other technical means for content forgery. . And this lawyer also put forward the "alien incident" which has spread widely in recent years and has caused great influence as an argument. The influence brought by this matter is beyond the guess of most people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien incident is very famous throughout the Western world, and even the subsequent impact of this incident continues to ferment. The cause of the incident came from a freelance contributor who claimed to be a fan of wild creatures. He took out a photo. The main composition on the photo was a bird standing on a branch and combing feathers. But on the right side of this photo you can see a flat thing and some brackets with certain mechanical properties, as well as a big-eyed monster with a triangular head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freelancer claimed that he did not find any anomalies when he took the photo, and then some scientists stood up to explain to him, claiming This is a very sophisticated optical deception, and even a so-called simplistic model, demonstrated in some public places. Immediately afterwards, the whole world was in a state of utter disappointment. Some mechanical enthusiasts said that the content that was not completely captured by the picture should be a flying vehicle. The part of the ground is the best proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of multiple forces, people finally know where this photo is in the panic. So long after the Emperor’s Daily newspaper, we are not alone. The headline published a press release in which the contributor believes that aliens do exist and can even live around us in a variety of evidence. The reason we can't find these aliens is because they have technology that transcends the times, so that the naked eyes can't see them outside, but the machine can capture them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freelance contributor also won many awards, and was invited by many relevant organizations to give lectures, and suddenly became a society. celebrity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the year when the aliens broke out, as if the aliens occupied the earth overnight, many photos appeared more or less Some things that might be related to aliens, such as airplanes, blurred backs, and even clear faces. When the curiosity of people's aliens lasted for eight or nine months, the enthusiasm suddenly became a fear of aliens because of a book called "Feeding". The author of this book hopes to be able to use aliens. Influence makes a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar books on the market are not available, hotspots are still hot spots, but books may not be sold. In addition, most of the author's works are murderous and thrilling novels. He decided to go against the mainstream and reverse the faces of these "hobbies-loving" and "hobbies-seeking" aliens. They think that all of this is A conspiracy. Humans are just guinea pigs that are raised on Earth. When they need to experiment with a drug or something, they randomly grab some test products for experimentation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a creepy view in the book, perhaps these aliens that are invisible to the naked eye are by our side, and may even be in yours. Watching you read this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This counter-mainstream content has been a huge success in a flash, but at the same time it has quickly evolved the positive culture of alien fanaticism into a conspiracy theory. Negative fanaticism, people began to gather to march to ask the government to expel aliens from the planet, and some people think that aliens should be found out, then seize their technology, kill them, and regain control of humanity’s own destiny. Take the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the great social public opinion, the first freelancer who discovered aliens was attacked by some people as "the alien dog". The purpose of his release of this photo is to create a false atmosphere that allows humans to more smoothly accept the existence of aliens and even rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freelance contributor stood up against the public to admit that he had made a fake on the photo because of the language attacks and even physical attacks of many enthusiasts. In an accident, he made a second exposure of the photo of the photo. It is because of this mistake that he has some ideas, perhaps he can use this technology to gain his career success. Then he made such a coincidence that the photos of the aliens were photographed, and the success of the popular discussion and the trend of public opinion, he also gained a huge amount of wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the alien event and the impact of this incident, even today, some people still claim to have photographed the aliens, to the major The newspaper submission hopes to earn a draft fee. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant’s defense lawyers proposed that the photo fraud was not without any arrogance. It can be said that their lawyers have studied the basic evidence provided by the plaintiff quite thoroughly and found the first A key attack can be seen in a place that can be seen as a breakthrough. If it can be proved that the photos are forged, not only Doolin’s complaint against them is not established, but they can instead bite Du Lin’s obituary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the defendant asked for the legality test of the plaintiff's basic evidence, many problems based on the extension of the photo could not continue to be questioned, and only waited for the next hearing. The time for the next trial will be set at one month. The negatives of the photos will be verified by the four inspection departments at the same time to ensure that the final results are true and effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderful hot spot was played by the two sides in the most boring way, making people boring, and some people saw this arguing The thing behind it. That is, Du Lin’s lawyers seem to have chosen the wrong strategy. They did not use the effective evidence of the evidence chain in their hands as a firepower point to fight for the jury. Instead, they gave some ambiguous testimony witnesses, which made the simple and clear things change. It’s complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people think that Du Lin’s lawyers have problems in this election, but more people think that this world’s high-profile lawsuit, the place to win and all the previous The cases are the same, and the results will not be in the court, but outside the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has too much to interfere with judicial justice, and Du Lin has been removed from office, but he is currently confronting the current mayor of Otis. As well as the old-fashioned aristocratic chaebols who have a wide range of friends in the north, and as a minority, Du Lin wants to win the lawsuit that belongs to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper constantly analyzes why the first court debate of this lawsuit will end in this way, under the influence of some cute little pieces of paper. The public opinion initiated by the newspapers tends to be the "victim" of Doolin. The image of his victims is on paper. The general public includes some middle-class people and tends to be Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trend of public opinion quickly caused some problems in the business of the Cape family. The first thing that was caused by the Cape family was Fati, who believed that the cooperation was the strongest. Ma family. The Fatima family, as the largest aristocratic consortium in the north, is itself a weather vane. The sacred woman believes that morally tainted people should not let them tarnish the fate of the Fatima family, so they chose a suspension plan in cooperation with the southern SAR. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old cape of this punch is staring at Venus, the Fatima family has told everyone that this piece of cake I want, but now he suddenly put the cake back On the plate, even if he said that I didn't eat, no one else dared to stand up and say that you didn't eat me. Mr. Old Cape made a decisive decision and personally went to the Fatima family to explain these things to the Holy Virgin, hoping to continue the cooperation between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
