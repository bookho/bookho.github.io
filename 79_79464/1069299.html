			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income will soon drop sharply, and the new investment will continue to lose money. For Mr. Jackson at this time, his risk is already very big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business is a terrible circle. Today you feel like a friend or even an ally. Maybe tomorrow is the enemy who will give you the most crucial knife from behind. In this circle that always pursues eternal interests, only the constant growth of oneself is the only correct behavior, which is why even if the Southern Commercial Bank and the Imperial Central Bank have become monsters of a giant, they are still expanding themselves. Territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are actually afraid, constantly raising their position and making the walls of the castle thicker to guard against the risks that may arise anywhere, anytime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Mr. Jackson is so hesitant to join the game, he is not sure whether the tickets for this game are reasonable and whether it will bring the desired return. Is there some other risk that he still does not know is waiting for him. But at this moment, in the study, sitting opposite Du Lin, Mr. Jackson suddenly came to peace of mind. The South Commercial Bank is vying, the Imperial Central Bank is battling, and even Du Lin is vying to use such a method. This shows that the insurance industry is able to make money. He decided to go all out and do it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people have been chatting in Mr. Jackson’s study for a long time, and Du Lin’s plan for Perito and Taylor has been fully understood. Lin’s reason is that their personal connections and financial strength are very strong, and they can quickly help them to set the industry standards and access, so as to achieve the goal of thoroughly kicking out Doolin. If you change someone, honestly, there is really no chance. After all, you have to face the two major empire. The entire empire is almost 60% of the wealth in their hands. It is appropriate for them to do it. Dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin is different, he is not only not afraid, but also confident to turn them over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at 8:10 am, Du Lin was still asleep. During this time, he ran a lot of places, and he couldn't get tired from the body. It was at this time that Henry came to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry knew yesterday that Doolin had returned to the West. He didn’t bother to disturb Doolin yesterday. Considering this time, Doolin circled half of the empire, but today After he woke up in the morning, he felt that he had to make a clear statement with Du Lin, otherwise neither side would be a human being. So he personally drove to Dulin's place - it took about three minutes to walk from the villa where Henry lived to the villa where Du Lin lived, which is the kind of distance that can be seen at the door of Du Lin's door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he drove the car outside the villa of Doolin, he pressed the doorbell. After Henry had important news, Dove rang the door of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something?", Doolin was very quick to wake up from his sleep. He looked around and listened carefully to the sound outside and took a sigh of relief. People only saw Du Lin's scenery, but did not see his sinful side. He blinked and sat up from the bed, and put on a pajamas and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Henry said that he needs to meet you in a hurry, he is waiting for you in the living room!", talking to Dove, Du Lin opened the door. Let Dove pick a suit for him, and he took a hot bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin saw Henry, Henry stood up immediately, and he went to Doolin and took his arm and walked to the corner of the living room, face It was a dignified expression, which made Du Lin realize what might have gone wrong. There are a lot of projects between him and Henry, such as the three immigrant towns and cities that are being built. If there is a problem inside, it must be a big problem, and Du Lin’s face is also serious. He pointed to the door, and the Buddha sitting on the side drove out the people in the living room and kept himself at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s villa has always been a lot of people, the local Guar and the people around him, these people usually take this as their base, live Here or in close proximity, it is convenient for Dulin to do what he needs, anytime, anywhere, and to protect Dulin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone was driven out, there was only two people in the first floor of the villa, Du Lin and Henry. Henry looked around and lowered the low door. Said, "I really didn't think that the woman you introduced to me, that Catalina is actually a thief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin:┻ ━┻(╰(‵□')╯(┻━┻<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you want to tell me this?”, Du Lin gently patted Henry’s The shoulders, the tone is very kind. He suddenly understands why Henry stayed in the West for so many years, why he is not willing to go home, why his father and his brother will blame him for blaming him, all because he is more prominent than others. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry snorted and nodded. "Of course, this is important, isn't it? No matter how you know Catalina, I think you should Beware, what they might do to you, such as stealing your trade secrets, it’s terrible!”, Henry It’s a very reasonable excuse to find a good word. “I know that you are not afraid of small means, but when people always have an accident, isn’t it? Sometimes a little mistake can ruin your efforts. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, Doolin was a little angry. This idiot made God mysterious to say something important, and he thought that the imperial people had landed on the moon. I didn't expect to talk about Catalina. But then he was not so angry, and he was not angry at all, because Henry was not trying to play him or harm him, but was thinking about him. Du Lin’s brain is completely imaginable. This lack of love from childhood, but no family often takes him out to sunbathe. The mentally retarded children who don’t talk to him are very concerned about themselves. He is afraid that he will lose face, so he So careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I forgive you. Dooling didn't know if he was angry or because of anything else. He kicked the tip of the shoe. "I understand, where is she now? How do you know she is a thief?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time we went to the party together, she was expelled by the gods who stole things, and then I never saw her again. I think she might feel that her identity is exposed. So, I left." Henry has a little regret for this. "It's a pity that a good-looking skin, but not a good soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linwei For a moment, the expression solidified for a moment, then Henry sat on the sofa in a quiet manner. "Don't talk about those unpleasant things. Are you happy at this party?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Henry’s favorite things, he immediately came to the mood. “Of course, of course! It’s a pity that you didn’t go. They didn’t know where to find a female warrior. I’m not I dare to imagine a woman, even if she has received professional training, she can Customs clearance! God is on, really exciting, especially in the last scene she stood up from the pool of blood, too shocking!" In fact, Henry did not say that he spent 300,000 to save the key at a critical time. woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From front to back, this group of boring rich people almost broke into more than one million, used to provide all kinds of weapons and equipment, as well as an adrenaline and a simple Medical package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Henry sighed, "The next month’s party is gone, they have to stop for a month, there is no reason, but I feel It may have something to do with Catalina. She tried to steal inside the Tuss, this effect is too bad, too bad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They did not ask Do you have a relationship with Catalina?" Du Lin couldn't help but interrupt his words. The nonsense he said couldn't catch the key points and it was a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They certainly asked, after all, Katrina was brought in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry smiled, "I said she took the initiative to seduce me, then I took her in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Henry silently What is a good brother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Du Lin called and told Magus about the news. He didn't add or cut any content. What Henry said, how would he tell him? of. After thinking about it for a while, Magus gave Du Lin another number and told him to tell the person who answered Catalina. Du Lin guessed that it should be a phone call from the Security Committee or the military office in the west. He then dialed the phone and repeated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party did not say anything, even a voice did not reveal the phone, God mysterious is in line with the nature of their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn’t care about it anymore after hanging up the phone. Anyway, he had no relationship with him. He was going to sleep, Henry took him to go. watch the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quin Opera has a show this afternoon, I have already bought the ticket, we both go together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Henry said, and Doolin pointed to himself. "Do we mean me and you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!", Henry answered with affirmation, and then he gave Du Lin a general reason why he must go to see the performance of the opera group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin’s opera group was born more than two hundred years ago and has been performing for the royal family and nobles. Until the royal family’s economy had problems in recent years, it was impossible to continue to raise Quinn Opera Troupe, this opera group began the empire's money-making journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has entered the new era for more than 20 years, many things are not lost when they are lost, just like the middle class in society has been working hard toward The nobility "closes, their children will go to the aristocratic school, they will wear the aristocratic "precious brand" costumes, they will wear jewelry that was previously only sold to the nobility, they even appreciate the shouting out to distinguish the middle class and The low-yielding, proletarian class needs to re-define the proposal for social hierarchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
