			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the investigation at the police station?" Anpu spoke first, and Clarke squeezed a smile and licked his mouth. His face was not so good. good looking. Amp immediately understood, and asked, "Is it not going well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clarke shook his head with a wry smile, he was born in the capital, living in the capital, working Also in the Imperial Capital. In a place where the political conflicts of the Imperial Capital are fierce, any small things that are fart big may become a new point of political conflict under the impetus of some people. Therefore, even if you are not responsible for the work, at least you can working seriously. He once heard people say some interesting things in the local area, and he also guessed that this trip would not go well, but he did not expect that whether it was a police station or a bank, or a chamber of commerce, he had a strong sense of rejection and distrust. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you don’t mention Doolin, it’s a little better. When you mention Du Lin, those people’s attitudes are a lot worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first went to the police station to request access to a person’s information, and the police wanted him to take the court’s administrative notice, otherwise the “citizen” did not have the freedom to access others. The power of privacy. Then Clark went to the court, the judge's ears were not very good, and he talked to the horse mouth for more than half an hour, almost made him to collapse, and then directly chose to go to the Imperial Bank Irian branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he is also a half-banker. He saw that he was the governor of James, and the president of James was very enthusiastic, only when he proposed to check When Doolin and the jewellery company ran into the account, President James let him touch a soft nail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers the smile of James, who was apologetic and asked him, do you have a document? If not, accessing the file is not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark said he can call the head office and let the head of the line manager talk to James directly. I don't know if it was Du Lin's business card that played a role. Clark's faint request with threats was hard-pressed by James. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost pointed to Clark’s nose, the ghost knows what is on the phone, there is a document, everything is fine, there is no official document to avoid talking, even if the phone is another The chairman of the bank, either in person or with a document, must do everything in accordance with the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is the local staff so principled? In the anecdote of Clarke Road, local institutions are the most corrupt group of people. Why did he meet such a principled president? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoned the idea of ​​directly accessing bank files, he found the general business branch, the answer to him is the same, you want to see more specific Something, take a document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this is the protection of Doolin in the Irian region, and regional protection policies are often used by those who have made outstanding contributions to the region, and Doolin It is just such a person. His contribution to taxation, his contribution to the creation of jobs, and his contribution to maintaining law and order are not that they can be casually investigated by people from other places, even if they are from the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original motivated investigation team came to Elian to officially investigate Du Lin on the first day, and they encountered various troubles, which gave them a heart The feeling of gray is cold. This situation is also considered by Amp. He smiled and comforted everyone. He said: "I have applied for these decrees before I left, because I am not sure if I will use them, but now I am obviously doing the right thing. For up to two days, these documents will come here, you should take a vacation in these two days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this, Clarke The group was a little relieved. In fact, Amp knew that Du Lin would have such a high status here. He still quietly called and applied for various official documents after seeing Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about Clark's side, Clark also asked about the situation of Amp's investigation today, perhaps because of the snow cover, Amp did not get a complete conclusion. However, he is more inclined that Juan may be thrown away after being subdued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discovery immediately made the members of the investigation team feel excited, no matter what they did, the result was not to find a flaw and bring Du Lin back. Is the emperor a good interrogation? If it can be proved that Juan is dying of murder, and that Du Lin is also involved, then their trip is equal to perfect completion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can I find a clue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Clark’s question, Anpu shook Shaking his head, "I don't know, wait for the snow to go, then go to the site and check it carefully, now..." He looked at the surrounding members. "First take a break!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This waited for nearly a week. If the Emperor did not give them a certain degree of support during the period, the deadline for this month would be half of the waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just this week, another person also rushed to Ilyan from Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I don't want to see you, because I found that the speed of making money, I will never come fast, and you will get people's praise and society. Admit, I? I dare not speak out!", Doolin and Kevin hugged a bit, Kevin came here is not the attention of Doolin, but Kevin's own ideas. Every good person will treat the same excellent people as enemies. It is because they are good enough that they know that there are not so many excellent people in the world, one or two in one industry is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this time I can drop Anpra in Irian, Kevin’s career will once again usher in a new peak, and by that time he will not be an hour. The 1,500-study fee, but the price of his mind, and the firm must recognize his position and give him enough respect - just as a devout believer treats God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s head is very good, and he’s a bit stronger than when he was at Turner. It looks like he’s still a little taller. He smiled and hugged Du Lin, and smiled and said: "I know that you guys are very good, this time you are half price!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, these are small money, Du Lin can understand, as one of the firm's ace lawyers, not only the important resources of the firm, but also need to have certain restrictions. In the upper class, there is no such concept as a so-called lawyer. When the rich face the lawsuit, they usually spend a lot of money to organize a large and luxurious lawyers group. The firm gives the lawyers the opportunity to approach the rich, and naturally the lawyers. We are bound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly leaving the office to go to the field, I will not say it. It may take a lot of time to go. If it is a private matter, this group of words is flawed every day. The guys definitely don't believe it. In order to avoid future conflicts, Kevin's reason is that it takes about fifteen days for a rich man to handle internal private affairs. For this reason, he also needs to charge the rich and withdraw a certain commission from the firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Du Lin took his jokes. In fifteen days, 50,000, there are 10,000 pieces for the firm’s draw, and 10,000 Come out to share with the partner, the remaining 30,000 is his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in general, he has worked with Kevin. Naturally, he has a good understanding of the nature of this guy. This is a person who values ​​fame and fortune. He either gives him money or gives him a profit. This time, for the sake of fame and fortune, he I will definitely take out all my strengths and work with Du Lin to completely complete this case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Doolin’s luxurious manor, Kevin sighed. “I think I’m getting less, you guys can live so well. "The house?", he circled around the house, could not help but sigh, "Amp feels that the gold is in your hands, now I think so!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a lawyer, but you are responsible for speaking." Du Lin didn't care. From the time they started killing, he had a lot of trust in Kevin. Not everyone has the courage to murder their enemies through partnership killings. This is Kevin’s handle to Du Lin, and why isn’t he the way Du Lin trusts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not admit it, but Kevin’s heart had already had a guess, and the gold was in Dulin’s hands. He does not have any greed for this batch of gold. Although he likes money, he also knows that some things are not touchable at this level. If he is not careful, he will die. He did not mention this matter again. The two entered the study room and after a short break, they began to discuss how to deal with Amp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amp is very intelligent, and he is very dead with details. From the cases he had previously cracked, he almost always started with small clues. Grab, then step by step to find all the indirect clues that can be used as evidence, and then string together to form a chain of evidence recognized by the judge. This is his advantage, but also his shortcomings!", Kevin did not drink with a glass of wine, He gently swayed the cup, and the wine in the cup rolled back and forth, and there was a scornful attitude on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He likes to think too much, so as long as he finds the right opportunity, he can lead him in another direction."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded, then took a small note from his pocket and shook it at his fingertips. "Ten thousand, buy a clue, don't do it?" < br br br br br br br dismount. After success, he became famous and fame and fortune. Failure, anyway, the unfortunate thing is that Du Lin is not him, he will not have any loss. So he didn't know the same excellent Du Lin, was he already arranged something good to entertain Amp? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
