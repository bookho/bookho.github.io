			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensive footsteps are particularly loud on the wooden floor in old-fashioned buildings, especially the hard soles that can be heard every step of the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel, who is studying piston stroke and kinetic energy, stopped his research work. His eyes looked at the door of the room, revealing a serious listening expression. His expression is a bit weird, and the whole person is like a sudden stop. Kelly, who was pressed under him, pushed his chest and seemed to be wondering why he suddenly heard it. Although Kelly does not like being crushed by Daniel, sometimes life is such a fuck, she must make a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, Daniel reached out and grabbed the pants on the bed and stood up on the bed, pushing the window open and watching it jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fourth floor. If you jump from here, you will probably lose your lifelong disability. Daniel is very concerned about his safety and life. He certainly can't jump directly from here, but he has left a path for his escape, so he always feels that he is not a problem with his own university, but his family. Can't get the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pile of fluffy hay on the roof of another two-story building facing the window, covered with a layer of canvas. This is Daniel's last chance for himself. Once he finds someone coming to him for trouble and he can't solve it, he will jump from here. Although it will certainly be very uncomfortable, it is better than being beaten or even threatened with life. Just as he had lifted his foot and stepped on the edge of the window, the door of the room was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very young voice was introduced into his ear. "If you dare to move again, I will grab it!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniel doesn't know who said this sentence, he did it. At the moment he decided to give up his resistance, he had such an impulsive impulse, regardless of whether he jumped from here, but he finally succeeded in his desire to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t feel that his speed is faster than bullets, he thinks. He came down from the bed honestly, lost his pants, and raised his hands with the red fruit, watching the uninvited guests reveal the smile that they thought was the most harmless. "Sorry, are you looking for the wrong person?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Kelly, who had only come back to her mind, realized what had happened. She immediately rolled up the sheets and covered her body. She shivered and looked at the people holding the guns. She was sensible and did not scream. She knew She did nothing, it has nothing to do with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daniel?", Pete confirmed. He asked other people before he came. They told him that the 22nd kid is called Daniel because of his business. There is no conflict with other people's business, so the city temporarily accommodated him. The person who said this obviously had a demeaning attitude towards Daniel, and it seems that he could not see the kid making money in this way. However, everyone is fishing for the wrong door. If you look down on it, he does not have the desire to do good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Daniel’s face was stiff, and then he laughed. “Yes, it’s me, don’t know where I have offended you?”, He tried to show himself a sincere attitude. "Hey, there are at least seven or eight hundred pieces on the table. It is my fault for my fault. Everything else is good..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the people he faces are just performers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himan woke up with a huge light bulb on his head that made it difficult for him to adapt to strong light for a short time. He shook his head around and wanted to avoid the glare. The light, and soon he found himself tied to a chair. The momentary fear made him wake up in an instant, and also scared a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around, except for him, Daniel, Kelly and others were tied to the chair, he immediately asked: "Occurred What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slight tremor of the sound line is enough to show his inner fear. He struggled a few times and did not break free from the bondage of the rope. A desperate situation that could not be said was filled in his heart. He feels that he is innocent. The goal of this group of people is not his own, but this huge ... in the warehouse, in addition to a box of neat goods, only a few of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Daniel didn’t want to manage the idiots of Seaman, but suddenly he realized that perhaps the way he left here was on this kid, no matter what he did offended. These people are nothing more than giving them a little economic loss, which Daniel can guarantee. He is not the kind of rude guy who relies on brute force for profit. He doesn't rob, nor kidnap blackmail. He just sells a little luxury with a little trick. He doesn't "harm" anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, there is also a casino for civilians. If the other party is indeed for him, then it is very likely that the problem will be economic. If you let them know that Seaman has a brother, his brother can start tens of thousands of pieces every month, maybe he can use this news to keep his own life. At the same time, outside the warehouse, Graf turned red like an irritated bison. He punched a metal bucket and suddenly appeared on the barrel wall. Fist prints. He couldn't imagine the younger brother who cares the most about it, and actually deceived himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they have arrived long ago, and Seaman has not arrived yet. Graf saw Himan, who was tied to a chair at first sight, he I thought it was Pete who made a mistake. When I was ready to wake up my brother and untie him, Du Lin realized that the problem was there. He held Graf with just one hand and took him out of the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt recounted the original book. After they found Daniel, they searched all the rooms on the fourth floor, then the third floor, and found a total of five people. Daniel and Kelly didn't say it. On the fourth floor, they found the big boy with glasses. On the third floor, they found the "artisans" who brought the ghost mushrooms and the music into the tobacco. Then they cleaned up the casino downstairs, grabbed five dealers, and had three accomplices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of thirteen people, all here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitt provided a detail, that is, when he found the big boy with glasses, he lived alone in an unlocked room, and it looks a bit Confused, constantly talking about some embarrassing dialogues and even lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was not restricted. From the situation on the spot, it seems that more than one person lives in that room, because in the bed Pete also saw the women’s underwear. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf even if the brain is not good enough, understand what it means, he was deceived, Seaman was not kidnapped, and all this is just a scam . The younger brother he valued the most, the younger brother he regarded as the family hope, actually deceived himself for money, which made Graf begin to question his own life. He single-mindedly went to the edge of betrayal of friendship for his mother and brother, but what did he get? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Doolin to stop him, he might go in and smash the Seaman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now let us make things clear first, you don't want to go in." Du Lin blinked his head. Both Buddha and Pete pushed the warehouse door open, and Du Lin turned and walked into the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen people and thirteen chairs were placed neatly, and Du Lin walked in front of one of the little sisters and asked, "My money is "Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel, who was tied to the side, breathed a sigh of relief and figured out the situation. His eyes were on Du Lin, except for this person and himself. As young as he is, he is still observing this young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what money, sir..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people relying on women and casinos to make money How much guts can a small mix have? When they were pointed at the gun, they had already scared their courage. Of course, what he said was also true. He really didn't know where the young gentleman's money was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand and turned his wrist. The Buddha behind him put the pistol in his palm. He pointed his finger at the gun. Guy's knee, "Where is my money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... Don't Mr., I really don't know where your money is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gunshot shook the entire warehouse, in addition to the guy who was pierced by the knees, there were some chairs that beat and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Daniel with a slight look and went over. "Where is my money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Daniel was already sweating at this moment, the muscles on his face were twitching irregularly. He swallowed and said, "Sir, I don't know... wait a minute, wait a minute!", he saw Du When Lin's muzzle was aimed at his knee, he screamed fiercely. "I don't know where your money is, but I have money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin removed the muzzle from his knee and nodded slightly to signal him to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy, that guy who wears glasses..." Daniel kept moving his head toward Seaman. "He has a brother who is rich." Very rich, you will be satisfied!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
