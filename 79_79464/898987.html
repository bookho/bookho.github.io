			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, Du Lin smiled at the station and greeted several guests from the Imperial City in front of the newly built City Hall. These people came to Du Lin on the card, the SAR card. With such a plaque, the city of Otis can completely draw a line with other cities, including Harry, and in a strict sense he can not manage Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Otis began to implement high-degree of self-management like the three pearls on the East Coast, but it was different, and Du Lin was only responsible for the cabinet. It is no longer managed by the state government, but the state government has the power to supervise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three trips, do you want to take a break before discussing the listing?" In fact, from the Imperial Capital to the city of Otis, it is less than two hundred kilometers. Distance, the so-called travel fatigue is just like saying that, respecting each other and value each other. If it is possible to work hard a few months ago, after all, the speed of the whole car is not very fast, almost five hours is really boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first class is used, there is no such problem. If you want to sleep, you can sleep, don’t want to sleep, push the door panel of the small room together, Can chat with people around you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just habitually said that one of the three women was picked up in one bite, "Okay, then let's take a break.", said She stood up and let Natalie take her to a place where she could rest. Du Lin glanced at the woman and smiled and said nothing. At this point, I still don't know what is true or what is a lie. She either came to Otis with emotions, even came to trouble, or she slept all the way into a senior Imperial official. This is not something that is impossible. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that a secretary of the Cabinet Secretariat has been sleeping in a few opponents before conquering a senior party member of the New Party and winning the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin regained his gaze and said with a smile: "We are listed on the City Hall at 10 o'clock on time. Do you know if the two have other suggestions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two men returned with a warm smile. "No, no, Mr. Mayor, you decide, we just come to be a witness, don't care about us." Their enthusiasm made Du Lin more and more sure that the woman seemed to have emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with established practice, Doolin provided a "souvenir product". In fact, it was a small box containing two rolls of cash, which was covered with some wild fruits dried in the wild in the city of Otis. This kind of fruit is sour and sour, it is not good at all, but there are always some people who believe that eating this kind of fruit can keep themselves away from the disease and spend money to buy it. This kind of thing can only be made into iced tea in the city of Otis, and it is only useful in summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two hardships, and then some of the specialties of the city of Otis will be brought back to the two, please be sure to accept it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two laughed more happily. Isn’t it a good idea to fight for a bad goal? Moreover, they are very clear about their position. No matter whether they are in the party or outside the party, they are unlikely to be higher than Doolin, and they are not as interested in self-discipline. Plus, Doolin’s rumors are not very good, and they don’t dare to stand at Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before these people came, Du Lin scheduled the time at ten o'clock, and his invitations were sent out. How could it delay the time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry arrived at the scene with two "Members" at 9:00, and the two important historical moments must also be attended. It is an intangible political capital that can sometimes be a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you say three people?", Harry glanced at the city hall sign with the embroidered red silk and whispered a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded to the people who came to cheer, smiled back, and the lips opened slightly. "There is a woman, I am just polite." She is still serious, and should be resting now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry smiled and shook his head. In fact, he knew more about the things of the Emperor than Du Lin. More, who is not allowed to be the eldest daughter of that family, the elders intend to let her go to politics, so there will be some emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The politician’s political path is not good, not only does it need someone behind it, but also someone on the body. This person is usually born through marriage. For a so-called family glory to engage in a job that you do not like, but also to marry a person you do not like, a little temper is inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The listing ceremony was very successful. As Du Lin pulled the red silk down, a plaque of black gold appeared hanging outside the gate of the city hall. Du Lin couldn't help but touch the intaglio gold characters. Harry asked, jokingly. "You don't want to bring these gold home?", the crowd laughed in good faith, most of them There are a few people who have any industry on Doolin. Of course, this is just a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took back his hand and shrugged his shoulders. "As a mayor of Otis, I am really embarrassed because there are still many ideas that are currently only in the planning stage. The main reason is because of the lack of start-up funds. If these gold The words are all real gold, I don't mind integrating them, and then I am going to the construction of the city of Otis!" He looked at the guests who came to the ceremony, and his expression gradually became serious. "This The city is from nothing, not just the merits of me alone, but also the credit of everyone here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't have your bold investment, and With my help, with the help of Otis, this city will not be as vibrant as it is now. Please believe me, and believe in this city, it will definitely bring you rich returns, will also let here Residents, people who work here, people looking for business opportunities here, receive more than you expected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you for coming. City Hall today At the listing ceremony, someone will send a small souvenir later, thank you again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin Wei Wei, making the scene more lively and the atmosphere more Round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry standing behind Du Lin, hung a politician’s exclusive affinity smile, squinting and Donald said: “You have to learn something, if If nothing happens, Du Lin will nominate you to become the mayor of the city after he leaves the company. During this time, you need to learn how to manage a city and how to make the city work healthily.", he said To the other side, "You are also, Hageson. Although we belong to different camps, what I said to Donald just now is equally useful to you. I believe that after a few years, they will arrange a new job for you. At that time, it was the time to really test a manager’s ability to govern.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you don’t want to be a joke, learn from Dullindo. This is a rare experience. Opportunities, you are all of your peers, there should be something to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said so, but Harry thinks these two guys and Doolin are not Must be able to get together, Du Lin looks from the outside It is indeed a young man, and the body also exudes a special taste of youth. But he is probably a seven-and-eighty-eight person in his bones. It is like an old politician who has been immersed for a long time. He has insights into the situation and direct attention to the people. Means, these two "little guys" in the case of Doolin, if you swear, I am afraid I can't please. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to Donald’s serious nod, Hagson just smiled and perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is behind someone, sometimes you really need to envy this kind of guy who will reincarnate, from the moment of birth, you don’t need to worry about anything, even politics. On the matter, there are enough grandfathers in the family to ask him for advice. Adding to these years, I used to be accustomed to the wind. Suddenly I found that a guy who is younger than myself has become the mayor and how uncomfortable it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a child holding a big ice cream and thinking that he has mastered the world until they see a bigger and more spectacular ice cream. A thought of drafting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said a few more words, and then the staff began to issue souvenirs in the red line. The so-called souvenir is a miniature metal model of the city hall. A layer of gold. To say that there is more value, in fact, it is more than one hundred yuan. The guests invited by Du Lin in the red line can afford it. It can be said that it is worthless, and it is not entirely true. This thing itself represents a historical testimony, and it may have a higher value on a certain day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who needs to rest from the Imperial City at noon is in front of Du Lin. She has pumped her eyes and would like to ask Du Why didn’t Lin call her, but she could face the young mayor, even if she didn’t understand anything, she knew that this was not something she could humiliate. She squeezed a smile and apologized for her behavior, then turned and left with her companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not have too many eyes on her, a woman who couldn’t tell the difference. Is this woman still missing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new town hall, the new office, sitting in the office with the cold circulation system in the wall, the whole person completely relaxed. The heat outside the house can no longer be irritating. He sighed and picked up the first copy of the document on the table and read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand elections have finally begun. According to the current voting qualifications, each community can select 45 percent of the residents to participate in the voting. This is a figure drawn after screening out the children and the elderly. As for the specific conclusion of who got it, that is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
