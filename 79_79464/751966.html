			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone tells you one day, what you think is white is black, what would you do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abien is a good person, a very good person, everyone thinks so. He is always happy to help everyone, no matter what happens to you, he will come forward, even if you want to reward him, he will refuse to resign. His good heart is a well-known thing, so people love him, but everything that happens at this time is telling everyone that they are cheated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man is a very strange creature, especially the emotional part of human beings, can accept injuries, can accept defamation, but it is difficult to accept deception. In fact, the damage caused by deception is far from the consequences of other injuries, but people can't accept this kind of damage. This kind of deception can hurt people's hearts and make anger like a volcano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who feel that they have been fooled are suddenly angry. Abigene should thank himself for reporting to Hell, otherwise he is likely to be torn by this angry group of people. broken. In fact, in terms of what Abbien did, he did not have no credit. He is like a bottom-level hacker, helping his "customer" to do what they want or can't do, and then extract a portion of the commission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that his mistake is that he didn’t communicate with these people beforehand, all his actions are charged, he shaped himself into a selfless image. However, he secretly digs his own roots behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but then again, if Abigail can communicate with everyone before doing something, make sure that these people know that their actions are not unpaid, then he It is also impossible to obtain the support and respect that so many people have once given him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are selfish, I can give you, but you can't take the initiative to get it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who feel insulted are crowded on the streets outside Abigail’s home, loudly telling the fact that they are being “spoofed”, and some even want to Into Abin's home to recover a little loss for himself. If it weren’t for the police to stop the excited Guarts from rushing into the scene, it might not take long for the house to disappear into the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as these people vent their anger, another group of people curiously followed the police to see if they could find the murderer of Abigail. Most of these people have no direct interest in Abid, mostly knowing or nodding, and they are not so excited about the sudden collapse of Abidin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the content of the threat letter, the police investigators directly targeted the person in the small group of Abien, and also found these people separately. Just like greed in human nature, there is fearlessness in human nature. These people have been very open to the things they have not done, and even the police asked them to search their homes. No one has spoken out, but they cooperated very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, an Abinian friend was arrested, and the policeman from his door looked like a flower with obvious signs of turning In the basin, I found a used pistol. If nothing else, this guy should be the murderer of Abigail. In the face of a large number of police officers and obvious physical evidence, this little friend admitted with a bachelor's murder of Abid's crimes, and the reason is very simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thousand and five hundred of them are divided into six people, each of whom is divided into only one hundred, but Abigail alone has one thousand. In the course of following Abbie’s work in the past few years, in fact, many things are done by them. Abien is only responsible for taking a lead, and then when he closes, he shows that these are all he did. Before that, everyone worked happily, because at that time, Abigail was able to distribute the money they secretly intercepted. But as Bigbien's reputation grew, the system of distribution became increasingly unfair, and Abigail was always able to get the most money, and the ratio was more and more exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until their group was very dissatisfied with this, they all sent a letter to Abigen to clarify the matter, but Bien ignored their reasonable demands and even warned them to kick them out if they had such an idea. In this case, after deliberation, the small partner was the performer. They were holding Abien’s wife at home in the middle of the night, knocking on the door of Abien’s house and shooting him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police took the suspected murderer on the spot and also smashed Abigail’s gang and took it all away. The entire fifth district is as lively as a festival, and everyone is talking about what happened in these two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riot like a farce ends in this imaginable ending, except for the Guars who have been deceived by Abigail. Most of the Guarts expressed their indifference to this, but they were very fond of the rich man of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to feel bad, and there is money in his pocket. He also saved the lives of the Guars who joined the riots. He even said that he would hire a lot of Guar people to work. Who can be friendly and generous? The compatriots are not happy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of the Irian Regional Police Department sent the results to Doolin for the first time, under the confession of the first arrested murder suspect, Several small partners were also imprisoned. The alleged crime was "conspiracy and murder." They will face imprisonment for ten to twenty years. In a short time, they don't want to see each other again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like this place and I like this world!", Du Lin said, holding a cigarette in his hand, said to Jose, who was sitting on the side, "The money here is Justice, right is justice, there is no place more comfortable than this world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the general director of the whole show, Du Lin feels that she has done a good job. After he killed Savi, he saved the gun to Abien’s men and let him admit his murder. As a reward, Doolin will help him, let him out of prison as soon as possible, and then give him a sum of money to let him "far away." The one thousand dollars and the threat letter were included in the temporary props made under Dolin's request and instructions. Even the factory owner received the benefits of Doolin - 4,500 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a price, the factory owner needs to explain that he is not giving 4,500, but a whole 6,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Abigail did indeed take a certain amount of benefits in everything, but definitely not so much, he did not dare to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abouten’s existence is always a hidden danger for Dulin’s leadership of the Gualtes in the Irian region, especially if he does not want to join the fellowship. It is doomed that he will not have any good endings and end. If such a character with high prestige and convincedness cannot be used for his own sake, it is very likely that Du Lin has taken away his "people" and stood on the opposite side of Doolin, and those who used to, Now and in the future, stand with Doolin’s unfettered forces and add to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is such a possibility, why not eliminate this possibility before this possibility becomes a reality? Some people may be willing to train an enemy for themselves and then defeat him to prove their strength and strength, but this is definitely not the character of Doolin. He is the kind of person who must be extinguished with the flood when he sees the flame, and will never give any enemy. Any chance to make it difficult for yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in this scene is very perfect. The Guar people in the Irian area discovered the true face of "Abien". The more people who trust him, the more they hate him, and the spontaneous promotion of Abien. All kinds are not good. At this moment when they may not realize it, Du Lin stood up to make up for their long-term "dependence" on others' positions, and they would naturally become Doolin's most loyal followers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin annihilated the cigarette butt in his hand and sighed, "Help me to return a message to the police station, send them on the road!" I jumped into the swimming pool and, in this hot climate, I was still the most comfortable in the water! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the day, Ellis - the mate who murdered Abigail, he was lying in an independent detention room in the police station, this is The treatment he deserves. Listening to the curse and roar from another little friend in the corridor, he smiled indifferently, turning over and covering his head with thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abien is dead, his friends are still doing the dream of replacing Abigail as the new Guarte spokesperson, but only Ilys himself Clearly, they can't do it. They don't have the prestige of Abigail. They can't replace Abien as a new spokesperson in a short time. Then someone will replace them. This person is undoubtedly the 350,000 Mr. in the first district. From the time when Abien let them begin to spread the bad things of Mr. 350,000, Ellis noticed the rich and secretly wrote a letter to the rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Abigail was still alive, he couldn’t do anything, when he was woken up from the bed in the middle of the night, telling him that Abigien was dead first. Time, he made a decision. He doesn't think he is a qualified leader. He is only suitable for some auxiliary work. He decided to rely on the new owner, and then, under the arrangement of the new owner, together with other small partners, incited the riots of the Guars.... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a meritorious minister, the rich man may promise him to wait for him to go out of prison, send him to work in the field, and pay him three times Ten thousand sealing fees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is worth the price, 30,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sold himself a good price, he did not regret it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was groggy and about to go to sleep, the single room door opened. He sat up directly from the bed and looked at the two faces. The prisoner was sent in. He asked in a panic: "Is it not good to live here alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
