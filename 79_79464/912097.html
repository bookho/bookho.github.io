			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would call me.", Magus is a very charismatic person, his tone of voice and context always let People feel the cultivation and honor hidden in the voice, and his peace, even if he complains, it will not make people feel embarrassed, but it is like a complaint between old friends. "The result I called you, I have some questions to ask you, I hope you can let me sleep well this evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and nodded, although Marx could not see But he still did it because of a natural atmosphere, just like he and Magus crossed the space and time constraints, sitting and chatting face to face, "Please say, as long as I can answer, I I will answer you for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to be enemies? You should know that your main opponents are Cappe and the hymns, if you can't beat them. You can never climb to the top. The things of the George family will make people aware Your danger, they will reject you, and in our circles, hands-on is always the bottom-level way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is politically unspoken Just start, I am afraid that there is only one official in the entire empire, and that is Magus. The vast majority of politicians are silently obeying a rule without any written nature, that is, things within the system, solved within the system. To put it simply, if you don't like me, you will get rid of me, but you need to ban it. The rules of destruction are only too costly for the collapse of the rules, and no one can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus did not say bluntly that Du Lin did a stupid thing, on the one hand because the George family was not a political family, they did not have any incumbent officials. Secondly, for these capitalists, Magus did not like it from the heart. He needed to use the power of capital to quickly revitalize the empire and support the policies of the new party. But the capital power that has lost the dog chain has swelled to the point where it began to threaten the true master of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not the power of capital that has penetrated into every aspect of this society, perhaps Magus has long raised the butcher's knife and brought a dog chain to all capitalists. But now that Doolin is working on the George family, Magus doesn't think it's the time, because he, including the new party and all those who are determined to bind capital, They did not have the initiative in this war. They can only respond passively and can't take the initiative. Du Lin's sudden action is very likely to let the sensitive capitalists taste the special taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only way to call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally intended to use the power of the George family to promote public opinion, and let the people actively discover the erosion of capital by the capital, causing social The negative effects, then they will step on the sacred consortium. After trampling on a sacred consortium, there will be a second, third, until the power of capital returns to the scope that can be subject to constraint management." Magus, Doolin thinks that this plan can be said, whether it is him, or Magus is actually very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to get them back after the expansion of capital’s power. The so-called constraints and management are just a good statement, at most in capital and politics. Look for a balance point, at least not as dislocated as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Magus, he had to praise the benefits of Doolin’s idea. Du Lin did not directly face the giant sacred consortium, but I chose to use the power of the people. As the prime minister manages this empire, Magus is very clear that in fact many times the people are always obeyed by public opinion. The red fruit is said to be a bit of a sensation. People are easily confused by mainstream public opinion. It is not necessary to swindle them. Need to push it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know in detail about Du Lin’s details about the plan. He knew that even if he asked, Du Lin might not answer. Everything in the general direction knows how to say it. As for how to do it, it is the ability of the individual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a bit strange, since there is already a relatively complete plan, why is the current situation still present? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the people of the Cape family saying hello to the old John? So they refused to continue to cooperate with you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin couldn’t help but laugh, because he thought so at the beginning, "Not the people of the Cape family, Mr. John. He thinks I might be too dangerous and will drag the George family. Into the quagmire, so Mark told me to terminate the cooperation, and at the same time gave me a choice I did not know. I have always believed that the dragon in the mythical story is not because it can reason people respect it, fear it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's powerful because of its threat to other creatures, it's also a good thing to expose your sharp teeth properly. When someone hits her idea, I will consider whether I will break my teeth and be bitten by me.” Du Lin’s tone is just as calm, like a joke in a chat. “For you, and for those big guys, I’m just Is a farmer's child, maybe this is my good One. I don't have a family drag, no power constraints, I can do what I want to do, as long as they are willing to compare, I don't mind fighting."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus listened very seriously. He smiled and said: "Your words remind me of my youth. I always feel that there is nothing that can make me afraid. Sometimes you will understand, give in or regress. It's not a shame, it's a kind of wise expression. Especially when you are facing the abyss, you take a step back and your enemy is approaching one step, which means that he has taken a step further from the abyss."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your words have inspired me. I have a little immature idea. Don't you know if you are interested in listening?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp;Magston has come to the interest, every time he talks with Doolin that he can always get a lot of divergent thinking and can think more possibilities, he immediately came to interest, "Looks like I am tonight There is no way to rest, but I am more looking forward to your immature thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth day of the incident was about the burning of the George Family Feature Agency The news has spread throughout the empire, and even the federal and more southern countries have reported this. Thing, some called it the greatest loss in the history of human civilization. Because in these three special publications, there are reports of nearly seventy years, even the library does not have their full storage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, more people are gloating, the George family has suffered a fatal blow, and wants to restore the status of the feature agency in the newspaper industry in the past, not Simply rebuilding three buildings is as simple as that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this morning, Mark was under a slap in the face, after a phone call, he slammed a little and even slammed the entire phone on the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the unusually screaming secretary enter the room, I was shocked by the face of Mark’s ability to lose language. She had never seen such a horrible mark, that forever The gentle Marks are gone, and replaced by the demons that go out of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard!", Mark walked back and forth, licking his hair while walking, the foam on his lips made him look a little hysterical, "The bastards They should all go to hell, yes, they should all go to hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, several newspapers in Southern Cannes joined forces to announce the George family. The holding of shares is illegal, and a "news league" has been established, claiming that it will declare war for the press family's monopoly group George family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that some people, and those with great influence, have already learned about John's situation and have begun to push the first shot in the counterattack in the newspaper industry. Immediately afterwards, some newspapers stood up and filed a complaint with the court, accusing the George family of using the family's influence in the newspaper industry, forcibly buying their shares and monopolizing resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people think this is a shameful "strong buy and sell" behavior, because the George family controls the source of the journalism, they have to let the low price In exchange for shares, in exchange for the "protection" and "care" of the George family in the field of newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden outbreak of these things is definitely a behind-the-scenes push, with the aim of the George family’s supremacy in the field of newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the George family has decayed, it is conceivable that the "good friends" on weekdays will rush to bite until the George family becomes a past tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can he do this, how dare he do this?", Mark waved his hand to knock the blue desk lamp on the table to the ground, value Thousands of precious cultural relics were broken into pieces on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There must be a way!", Mark is a little panicked, he has never faced such a situation, the spearhead of capital forces suddenly pointed to his spear The person, let him find a way out. He forced himself to calm down and didn't care about the secretary who stood by. He walked back and forth for a while. At this time, he hoped that Mr. John would not faint. How much he hoped that Mr. John could stand out from the door and tell him to be "quiet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the same place as the injured beast looked at the broken blue agate fragments on the ground, suddenly sighed with relief, he looked back when he looked up Clear and more determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, let you see the jokes, let people clean up, then we may be busy for a long time.", he squeezed a smile After walking back to my desk, I sat in a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t count on Mr. John now, you can only rely on your own arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the Legal Department dispatch, I remember that all newspapers have shares signed by the two parties, first accusing the newspapers in Cannes of violating the agreement, According to the agreement, they compensated us for the loss and publicly apologized." He slightly bowed his head. "In addition, I contacted all the newspapers that did not stand up. I invited them to the Emperor to discuss the establishment of the 'News League'!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
