			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are sympathetic, especially when the sympathetic and the sympathized one belong to the same class hierarchy, but the identity status within the class hierarchy When it is completely different, it will make people feel compassionate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rich man has become a tramp because of failed investment, factory closure, corporate bankruptcy. When a working class sees this news, he will never sympathize with the situation and experience of the rich man. Maybe he will laugh. There is something called gloating that quickly infects his emotions and may even let them spit. Sip a bite and say a word to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only people who truly sympathize with the rich are those rich, even richer than the rich, no matter what kind of emotion they started, they will eventually become sympathetic, then say This guy is really bad luck, or this guy is really poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is compassion, a socially top-up compatible emotion that will never go from the bottom up. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the slave miners in the Andorra mines began to produce a kind of ten-speaking slave representatives who had been released and freed. The emotions they should not have produced - compassion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have seen hope and hope, but there are still 300,000 slaves in this land who live in the same darkness as the "everyone" In the mine, facing the endless suffering, and finally died in a certain martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them came up with the same conclusions as these representatives, even with Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since miracles can happen, why don’t we do something, let the miracle shine again, to save those companions who are still shrouded in darkness? "?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea soon began to spread within the mining slave community, because Doolin’s promise has begun to cash, they believe Du Lin, so some are willing to actively Under the election of the slaves, a representative was selected to face Du Lin’s request, hoping that Du Lin would be able to save more slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin certainly promised, he also considered this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, one thing is changing the calm of the current western region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many mines in the west that have entered the countdown to closure. It is impossible to dig more and more in this deposit, except for the twins. The special nature and composition of Jingjing have not been fully analyzed until today, and every year there will be new progress, which will promote the rapid development of another industry - chemical companies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formulation of the catalysts provided by each chemical company is not completely the same, some catalyst formulations are suitable for civilian use, and the reaction of twins in these catalysts will be stable. The duration is quite long, which is enough to deal with the power and thermal needs of ordinary people, as well as the savings on twins. There are also non-civil formulations that produce a violent reaction in the instant when the twins are mixed with the catalyst. Most of this catalyst is used in industry and military. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently no less than 30 kinds of catalysts on the market, but ordinary people do not need to buy any kind of catalyst for their own brains, need to use catalyst Equipment will be developed by the manufacturer of a certain catalyst, or even a dedicated catalyst for OEM. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, the production of twins has always been a mystery. This self-healing vein is completely in the hands of the empire, except for the crystal. After the other minerals have been excavated, it is really gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roel’s bauxite mine is also facing a situation where the exploration team gave a very good assessment report when the bauxite was discovered. It is believed that this bauxite can be mined for at least fifteen years. But today is the seventh year of excavation, and actually no more bauxite can be found. To put it simply, Roer Nonferrous Metals Mining is facing huge risks. If it is not possible to find new deposits on this privatized land, it means that the Roel non-ferrous metal mining company will soon go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperialist central bank will freeze all their assets and then take away all their belongings, those creditors will kill Mr. Roel and his family because they still Can't afford money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to grab this vein, Mr. Roel took out a price of 3.3 million from the Jindis Metal Mining Group and Orvili The mining group grabbed the vein in the hands of him, so he mortgaged all the property to the bank and repaid a large sum of money. I borrowed a lot of money from the hands of relatives and friends before I got enough to buy the capital of this bauxite mine. Because according to the conclusion of the exploration at that time, as long as it can be returned in 1989, after the end of all mining, the net profit after removing the cost will be no less than 4.5 million to 5 million! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not the time when the empire’s economic recovery was so fast. If you re-do that report today, the net profit will exceed 8 million! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is actually a bureau, a scam, a scam for Mr. Roel to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the West there is no shortage of speculators like Mr. Roel and Mr. Luke, a former friend of Doolin, who have already been in the industry. At the end of the day, there will be no further development. If we do not adjust the industrial structure as soon as possible, or change jobs, it is very likely that this is going to decline, and bankruptcy is only a matter of time. So some people with ambition and gambling, during that time, waved banknotes to the west, madly fighting for resources here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those speculators with only a few hundred thousand to one million are not seen by big companies, but Mr. Roel holds millions Speculators are objects that all big companies hate. Because they don't understand, because they have species, they want everything and want everything. This will unwittingly raise the transaction price of many mining areas, allowing large companies to purchase more premiums than the original plan, but for these speculators, they have no loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money in their pocket is still in their pockets, waiting for the next auction or trade fair, they start messing again unless they spend the money . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr. Roel was fooled. In fact, not only is he alone, but in recent years there have been many mines that have been closed due to the depletion of the veins. Some people are lucky. It’s good to earn back the money that was invested, and it’s a little bit of a surplus. There are still many people who have finally gone bankrupt and disappeared into the wilderness of the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the mine, 271 local miners took off their clothes, including the "dog tags" on their necks. Although they are not military personnel, they also have a dog tag. This is an important certificate for identifying the number of victims after a mine disaster and identifying the body. Local miners will have such a dog tag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Roel stood on the side with a gloomy face, watching these people hand over everything, and then waiting for the return of the captain of the mine protection team - These people have been taken to the trucks, they will be sent to the north to continue mining, there are many mining areas in the north, but the scale is much worse than the west. Mr. Roel compensated the miners for 1,500 pieces each. They would stay in the north for three years and return only three years later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything was ready, Mr. Roel took out a cigarette, took a few mouthfuls, and threw it on the ground, and his eyes became somewhat stunned. "Get started..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the violent vibration of the earth, the entire camp was affected, and then several mines spewed out a large amount of airflow that hit the dusty stones like a pipe, and the ground The crack opened, and a loud noise came from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The landslide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sharp, piercing scream, the entire camp was chaotic It’s up... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three minutes, the State Government Emergency Office received an alarm call, and the mining area of ​​Roel Mining Company had a large-scale landslide accident, at least three Hundreds of people were trapped in the mine waiting for rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This call has caused the operator to feel a cold sweat, which may be the largest mine accident in the past two years, since the mine owners began to After the use of slaves, the "personnel" of the city where the mine was located will not have more than 30 casualties. The accident of more than 300 people like this will definitely shake the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire will not be able to look at the west, but the doormen have shaken up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation brought by the accident of more than 300 people will make his pockets clean. He immediately dialed the phone number of the governor’s office to negotiate this How should things be handled? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the accident spread throughout the West, but the reaction of the mine owners is thought-provoking. They knew that the first time of this matter was very strange, like laughing and laughing, with some thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Mines Club has linked most of the mine owners in the West, and they know each other's situation. Since the beginning of last year, Roel’s mining area has had problems and reserves. For this reason, he also hired two very famous exploration teams to go around on his site. Later, it was reported that Roel’s mine had dried up and no more things could be dug. Even though the news was finally confirmed as a rumor, Roel invited many people to his mine to see a large number of large-scale The bauxite is transported out of the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
