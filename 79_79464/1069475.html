			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time outside the mountain, a special agent wearing a variety of plant grass leaves under the cover of vegetation clings to the mountain lurking at the gate of the earth gods meeting place Just above it, there are several agents around here who are watching here. A distant mountain is equipped with a military observation and records everything that happened here. Since the local military office received the feedback from Doolin, they immediately acted. They did not need any meeting to discuss the results, nor did they have to weigh the pros and cons. As a violent institution with great power within the empire, it does not need much Things can be acted upon first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under them, a large number of Tudio priests wearing robes are carrying wooden boxes packed in trucks, starting from yesterday, God made And the Presbyterian Church issued a transfer order, everything here must be removed, must be completed within a week. Most believers do not know what happened, why should they abandon this gathering place that has been used for several years, but in the case of religious organizations, top-down orders often do not require the superior to explain to the subordinates, telling What they have to do is fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meeting place is a very engineering project. It took almost five years to build everything here to decorate it. But now it takes only a week to destroy it. All the valuable things were unloaded very rudely. The decorations embedded in the holes were directly smashed with a hammer. Like the gold, the golden door that is like a work of art is cut into dozens of pieces directly inside. The artworks that have been loaded into different trucks and some of the collections of the gods are all shipped away. These are now valuable, but they are still worse than gold and precious art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone responsible for carrying a truck was taken to the side of the cab and patted the door. The driver immediately started the truck after receiving the signal. Slowly leaving from the mountain road, the believer did not immediately return to the crowd, but instead walked toward the side of the mountain, he needs convenience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wearing a robe, it is actually very inconvenient when it is convenient, because if you want to be convenient, you should completely smash the inconvenient teaching robe. It is said that in this climate of the season, many believers only wear underwear, and some are indecent. Moreover, the robe is pure white, and it can be seen that it has little effect on the dust. If it is stained with some yellow stains, others will know what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buddy smashed the robe and hung it on his shoulders, found a suitable place to step on the ground, and then narrowed his eyes. The sound of the patter has suddenly relieved the pressure at this moment. After hearing this sound, the whole person has relaxed. Although the body has a feeling of being hollowed out, this feeling is great! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person relaxes, he wants to twist his neck and move the cervical spine. This is a "common problem", just as he twists his neck and looks up. Actually saw a face, a face that is supported! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stunned, the wild faucet proved that if there is no external control, the argument will be chaotic, what he wants to do, but it is too late! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, he couldn't even call for help, he was wrapped around his neck with two arms, and he lost control of his body after a "squeaky". He is actually dead, but he is still alive. He is dead from a physiological point of view. The neck is basically not living for a long time. The latter is that he has not died yet. The remaining consciousness and the still active brain let him I saw the man sliding down the cliff, standing next to him, and then got into his robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent held him in a circle and reached for a support. The robes were worn by the agents and lost the help of the unlucky believers. On the wet ground. The agent took off his camouflage—the grass blades and covered the dead believers to cover his body, and then took out a special handkerchief to wipe off the putty on his face, head down and other Like everyone else, I returned to the ranks of believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, three believers have been replaced by agents of the Military Intelligence Department without being discovered. Others have not found a suitable opportunity, still Waiting for an opportunity to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been observing for a while on the mountain wall, and after they have mastered the exact trajectory and laws of these believers, they have mixed into the crowd and then returned to the gate together. . They also need to move other valuables out and put them on the truck to other places. Of course, these three agents are unlikely to really think of themselves as a believer. At a fork in the road, they separate and begin to penetrate deeper. This time their mission was very simple, rescued Katrina, and seized the top of the Tushen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the Tushen did and did nothing, it was only the imprisonment of the military intelligence agent that had violated the law, even if it was not legally. In order to protect the dignity of the military department, it is not to be trampled. In order to ensure the safety of the agents of the military affairs department, the stronghold of the western side directly released all the agents. They must retrieve the lost face from the body of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"叮", a believer stopped in the corridor. He looked at the coin that was spinning on the ground not far away. It was a fifty-dollar coin. He looked around and did not Finding anyone, it makes him feel a bit strange. Why did this coin come from, why is it here? He walked toward the coin, and was curious as well as happy for his good fortune. It was worth the fun to get the money, and it was still fifty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he bent over, a fist appeared on the side of his head, and he also found a shoe that suddenly came out, under One second, the soldier who seemed to be lucky, actually went to the bloody believer, and his neck was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, where is the cell where the prisoner is being held...", the voice behind him made the believer very scared, and he realized that someone had penetrated this Inside, but in the respect of life and responsibility for himself, he decisively pointed out the direction for the people behind him, and then he was disappointed, disappointed with the morality of people in modern society. Because the person behind him is a villain who is unbelievable, he lied and deceived himself. The gaze in his eyes accompanied by the hatred of the liar gradually faded after a "squeaky" sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the agent found Catalina, Catherine was already in a coma, and he whispered a few times through the window on the iron door of the cell. Catherine didn't answer him, which made him very worried. He lifted his wrist and glanced at the watch. It was already six o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden footsteps made the agent quickly look in the direction of the voice, and the two men in the robe appeared in the distant corridor. At the end, one of them also asked, “What are you doing here?” Everyone in the Tushes has their own responsibilities and areas where they can move, and there are some subtle signs on their robes. As a sensitive place such as a cell, it is the responsibility of the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a single person will definitely cause suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent didn’t even think about it, he said the truth directly. He pointed to the iron door of the cell and said in an anxious voice. "She seems to die." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards did not care about the identity of the believer who went to the wrong place, immediately ran over and ran while holding the key Come out. The Presbyterians told them before, try not to let Katrina die, and don't need to let her recover completely, hanging her life. At this point I heard that Katrina is dead. These two people are a numb in the head. If she really dies, they must also be punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
