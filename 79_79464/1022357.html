			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Du Lin, we met again." The Vice-Chairman of the Security Committee also had a suspicion of Doolin, but saw Du Lin. When the initiative came over and took advantage of it, the suspicion disappeared. Before his vice chairman, he was also a very standard field transfer to the back office, and finally climbed to the high position. There are many prisoners who have been dealt with by his hands. He knows the psychology of these criminals, that is, how far away they are from people like them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person can't never go wrong, this may not be so absolute, but it is absolutely absolute in most people. When you do a bad thing, face a person who can give you great punishment because you have done bad things, always subconsciously close your own thoughts and inner activities, so that you are always in a very nervous mood. In the middle, keep telling yourself, don't talk, don't look around, don't find your own suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This state stays for a little while, but not for a long time, at least so far he has not seen anyone who can guarantee such a state for a long time, except those metamorphosis serial killer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t think that Du Lin is such a person, because people like Du Lin are not abnormal, they must have experienced many things that ordinary people have not experienced, and they have encountered Many of the ups and downs have overcome these difficulties, and they have a state of mind and tolerance that ordinary people cannot have. Du Lin was so young, he could not do this, and in the first 16 years of his life, he was only the son of a farmer, he could not do it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and took off his hat and nodded. "Thank you very much for being able to bring us, knowing that the fastest shuttle bus is also in three days, I can I don't want to waste too much time here.", said Du Lin with a look at the empty deck around him, very politely asked: "Can I sit here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice-Chairman nodded. "Of course, this is your freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is from Wasiu to Fanlier The temporary trains, the people on the car are the people of the security committee and some military personnel, because the seven gold diggers on the scene were unfortunately dead, which made their actions a little mistake. But fortunately, I still live one, although it is said that this guy is not a gold rusher is an agent of the Security Commission, but it does not matter, as long as he knows something. The problem now is that the agent, called Eric, has also been injured and has fallen into a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical conditions here are not enough for him to recover quickly, so you need to go back to Vanlier before making a decision. As for whether or not the people of the Freedom Front will smell the wind and escape, it is not so important. Even if the other party moves quickly, they will leave enough traces. That is a large group of people who lack horses and fast moving props. If they don't want to lose a lot of heavy but heavy materials, they can only choose to use their legs to transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the two groups couldn’t think of was that when they were about to leave, Du Lin actually took the initiative and brought them back to Fanli. Seoul. Regarding this request, both the Security Committee and the military are willing to agree. This road is less than two or three hours, enough for them to observe Du Lin on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching Du Lin sit down, a middle-aged man with no military cap in his officer’s appearance smiled and sat next to the Vice-Chairman. The crowd was crowded, and the Vice-Chairman could only give him a little place. He sat down and placed the hat on the table between the decks. He smiled and extended his hand to Du Lin. "Hello, I am the Colonel of the Imperial Army Western Division, Mann."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook hands with him and said with a smile: "I have always heard that the soldiers in the Western Region are all made of steel. When I saw Colonel Mann, I knew what this said. It’s right.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background of this compliment is the Civil War. At the beginning of the empire, all the south of the empire fell, and the Southern Military Region could not organize any effective resistance measures. I can only watch the EFF advance step by step to the middle of the empire and threaten the emperor. Then there was a major reversal of the federal main siege, in which the Western Military Region contributed a lot of power. They clamped the madness of the EFF in the mainstream of the Agate River west of the central part, allowing the EFF to use the inland river as the transportation line. The "rafting plan" was completely defeated, so in order to conceal the concept of the imperial army is incompetent, the official slogan of the steel west army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words made Mann very happy. After talking a few words, the Vice-Chairman also began to interject. “Mr. Du Lin, Wat Xia So far from the big city, is there any benefit here that you deserve to come in person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded with a smile, "Benefit? No, no, sir. You may not know, some things are more worthy of possession than those that are colorful, such as faith! I came here to see the local compatriots who are willing to raise funds to establish a fellowship, and talked with Wat Xiazhen. For a business, I want to open a farm here. I need the help of a local farmer. It is naturally impossible to leave the local farm. This is the purpose of my visit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This purpose is plausible, and Du Lin did not cover up the fellowship, let the Vice-Chairman believe that Du Lin is "innocent." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fellowship is a troublesome thing in the eyes of many people. If it is a religious organization, it can’t be said to be wrong, because all the fellows will There are statues of gods and there will be epic stained glass. On weekends, there will also be believers gathered in the church of the fellowship to pray for the gods to ask for blessing, or to confess something. This is indeed a religious organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most crucial thing is not to break the law. In the early empire, the attitude towards these defeated peoples was to completely destroy all their things, including the glory that might have existed in the past. Confidence, there is culture and faith. Throughout the history of civilization in the whole world, apart from the fact that everyone in the Eastern civilization does not understand it, in the history of Western civilization, human warfare is often caused by different beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people believe in water gods and feel that water nourishes everything, and water is the source of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a belief in Vulcan, a safe environment for fire, and a civilization that inspires humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their beliefs are actually right, this can be said to be an interpretation of nature, but the problem lies in the people who believe in water gods and the belief in Vulcan The moment when people first met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The water god is the greatest, and the water can extinguish the fire. The fireball falling from the sky will be extinguished when it falls into the sea, so the water god must be the strongest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fart, Vulcan is the greatest, even the violent storm can not extinguish the lava in the fire mountain, Vulcan is the greatest!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After you leave school, don't leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whoever is who is not a descendant of Vulcan!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a war based on faith and purpose has emerged, and everyone can’t play, so that in the end they may have forgotten why they are going to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want these defeated people to forget their past and fully integrate into the big family of the Empire, then the unification of cultural beliefs is the inevitable result, of course There is also the merits of the church. With the advent of the new era, freedom of belief has also become the ruling party's respect for society, and the shackles that have been released have allowed various belief cultures to enter a period of flooding. It is not a big deal for Du Lin to engage in a fellowship, but his scale is slightly larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the fellowship is really a mere religious organization..., the children don’t believe it. This group of guarts who were brainwashed by Doolin madly believed that Du Lin was the Messiah in Revelation. Yes, I don’t know when they started a revelation, saying that it was the existence of the Guart dynasty. Something that has predicted hundreds of thousands of things after a thousand years, it is faintly said that there is a Messiah who will save the lost Guar and lead everyone to stand up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the faith not only enriched their minds, but also armed their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at those bastard agents, almost all of them in the fellowships. They are much more pure than the gangs. They are simply a group of thugs with sheepskins! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are very wise to stagger this topic, "I heard that you recently planted crops in a large area of ​​the western region, making crops more profitable than selling wine. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!", Du Lin’s answer was firm. “Not all industries can make millions of dollars a year, I found this. So, before I reacted to others, I took up the site and naturally no one would compete with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Mann couldn't understand when the crops were so big, and Du Lin said a few short sentences. They felt that their thinking could not keep up with Doolin's rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, he is bragging! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard someone sacrificed?" Du Lin seemed to ask casually, Mann nodded, and the vice-president's expression was a bit heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and his expression slightly softened. "In order to guard this country, there must always be a fool who knows that if you step on, you may never have a second." Steps, they will smile and take the next step. There must always be some people who believe in something stupid, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If each of us They are all smart people. They all know that they should not take great risks to pay for their return. Will there be a peaceful life like us now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All peace is maintained by the sacrifice of a group of fools. They are fools in my heart, but they are also the greatest heroes of the Empire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
