			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kaile’s words seem to have given his son Xiao Kaile an emotional release, and Xiao Kaile took a few steps back and forth, looking at Kaile Mr. said, "I heard that Du Lin has always had a lot of troubles. He is a gang leader and has acquired a lot of wealth through smuggling. Every penny in his pocket is not legal. Maybe this is A good opportunity." Looking at the expression encouraged by Mr. Kay, his confidence is more abundant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can contact some people who have a bad relationship with Doolin, and then unite this force, I believe that even if someone wants to keep Doolin, here The strong power of the stock will also choose silence.", Xiaokai Le said more excited, "Think about it, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Southern Commercial Bank, The Imperial Central Bank, and some aristocrats who suffered losses for his sake, yes, and the group of sacred consortiums. When I didn’t think about it, I couldn’t think of Du Lin’s actually offending so many people, and Many of them have a considerable background, this is an opportunity, father!", Xiao Kaile has become a little konjac, I feel that my brain has never been so clear, every thought is like a lightning in the brain The happy shuttle back and forth in the cell reminds him of more things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Keller has always regarded people in the image of a good gentleman in the empire, never took the initiative to conflict with anyone, and even some people think that Kaile Mr. is very bully. Although these people finally reached a settlement with Mr. Kaile for one reason or another, Xiao Kaile felt that this was not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family has so much money, such a large amount of energy, can directly face-to-face contact with the top officials of the two governments, they do not need to behave like One is the same as the gas bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he knows that Mr. Keller’s low-key is for a reason, but Mr. Keller is a young man, for this era, for people’s avant-garde thinking and The trend is more understandable than Mr. Kaile, at least he thinks so. This is an era of self-worth, you can't show your difference, people won't buy your account. If Kailemen has always maintained a low-key style, it is very likely to be gradually submerged in the long river of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kailemen has already shown people a gentle side, and properly exposing the minions will not cause any undue consequences, only to make those who are not as good as Kailemen People are more and more awe-inspiring to Kailemen and Kaile and his sons. For those high-rises, let them know that there is no one or two stones in the Kailemen's dough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kaile nodded after listening. "You said it is very good, then how do you plan to dispose of Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, he was sent to hang Rack, we should let people know why he was hanged because he offended someone he can't afford to sin.", Mr. Kelly took it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kaile laughed. He took the land on the ashtray and took a sip on his mouth. He took a move against Xiao Kaile. Beckon, "Come here, son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Keller stunned, but still walked very obediently. From small to large, the person he admired most was his father. In the compliments of those around him, he realized how great his father was. This is a businessman who changed the relationship between the two countries by himself. He managed to do it. To the point of exceeding the upper limit of merchants, it can even be called one of the greatest businessmen of this century. For Mr. Kaile, Xiao Kaile rarely violates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the woman’s problem, he will listen to Mr. Kaile’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just walked to Mr. Kaile’s side, and Mr. Kaile suddenly grabbed the crystal-carved ashtray on the table and turned it to Xiao Kaile’s forehead. , dong's muffled sound, Xiao Kaile swayed twice and fell to the ground. He was constantly blackened in front of his eyes, and his hand touched the forehead with a headache like a crack. He looked at Mr. Kaile while he was horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Keller took off his coat and revealed the white shirt inside. He took a bite and then put the land back on the ashtray." I always think that I should talk to you well, because sometimes you are too messy, now is a good time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of his aunt On the cheek of Xiao Kaile, the moment the leather heel and the cheekbones touched, the head of Xiao Kaile was on the right side, and he just fell back and fell back to the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want you not to fool around with female stars, skilled women, you treat my words as fart..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I let you have a good relationship with... but you give him a look..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pile of errors accumulates The anger that came out exploded at this moment. Mr. Kaile beat the little Kaile who was rolling around and complained about his inferior performance. After playing for a few minutes, Mr. Kaile gasped and walked back to the table. On the top, pick up a lot of fun, and calm down the intense emotions. He looked at Xiao Kai, who was crying and crying on the ground, and his expression was slightly distorted a few times before he returned to his usual appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand up!", he turned and sat down, giving a command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Kaile stood up with his hands on the edge of his desk. He had a leather shoe print on his face. The blood in the wound in the forehead had solidified. It is not very big, but the blood and wounds of the wounds are mixed with the prints of the shoes and the mud, which makes Xiao Kaile look particularly embarrassed. He was full of fear and horror. In his memory, this is the second time that Mr. Keller beat him so rudely and brutally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time is because he used to like gambling, not a small bet, a big bet. There are also some deep underground casinos in the Imperial Capital. In fact, the police stations and investigation bureaus of these casinos are not necessarily unknown. It’s just that most of these casinos are made by the dignitaries of the dignitaries, and they don’t accept outsiders. In their eyes, it’s the place where the children play, it’s not harmful, and there is no need to offend their parents for these children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Xiao Kaile was pulled in. Sometimes he can win a little, but he loses more and more, and loses a dozen or two before and after. One hundred thousand. After knowing that Mr. Keller had ordered him not to gamble again, the face of the young man was obviously more important than that of Lao Tzu. Then he went again and was arrested by Mr. Kaile. At that time, Mr. Keller cracked his leg bones directly, and he never dared to gamble again, because Mr. Keller said that if he found out that he was gambling, he interrupted his two legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is the second time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Keller, who was sitting back in the chair, took another breath and spit out a faint smog and asked, "Do you know why I am going to hit you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I let you down..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Keller’s eyebrows pick a straight handle The half of the soil was to the face of Xiao Kaile. The land slammed into his face, and after a big Mars popped up, he fell to the ground. Xiaokai was frightened and wanted to escape, but he did not move. Move his feet because Mr. Kaile did not agree with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kayle took out a happy land and pinched his nose. "Tell me, how did you tell me yesterday, about what happened outside?" Those things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry...", Xiao Kaile just glanced at Mr. Kaile with three words, scared and quickly put yesterday The original words came out, "The central bank is going to hold a meeting at our hotel. They say that they don't want unrelated people to bother them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kaile nodded. "But you didn't tell me, they didn't want Du Lin to disturb their meeting! My child, you lied to me on the most important thing, then I ask you to tell me, the central bank. What benefits have you given, and you are willing to deceive me against my rules?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Money? Woman? Or something else?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Kaile did not speak, kept silent. There is nothing promised to the imperial central bank at all. If you have to say yes, you may invite him to join this year when the Elliland event is held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elliland Annual Event is the most important event in the film and television industry, except for the award of some authoritative awards to all practitioners. In the eyes of a small group of people is a place to squander hormones. A large number of first, second and third lines and top actresses will be present. These stars will be very casual in the body after this event. Of course, this is for a very small number of people, so in some small circles, this event is actually a Indulgent party, but all the participants are those who often appear on the screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the real big guys all use the film and television circle as a merchandise vending machine. They only need to pay a little price for them. select. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was wrong, my father.", Xiao Kaile used a lot of effort to say this sentence, just bitten by his father when he was beaten. The tongue is a little uncomfortable to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kaile pointed his finger at him. "This is the last time, child, if you let me down again, I will send you back to the Federation. Change your sister, do you understand?", Xiao Kaile nodded quickly, and Mr. Kaile closed his eyes and sat on the chair. Xiao Kaile did not dare to even out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Mr. Keller opened his eyes, and his face showed a smile that everyone was used to. "You are too careless. Find a place to clean up yourself, work for me honestly, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the smile like the father of the spring breeze, Xiaokai I was happy, and I felt a deep fear in my heart. "Yes, I know, my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
