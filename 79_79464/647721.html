			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts are a very scary topic. How many tax officials have fallen inexplicably on their way to the city they need to take up? The tax of the empire was a black hole. During the feudal monarchy, the nobles had absolute control over their territory. They could not let the royal family plunder resources and wealth from their territory, which is the largest between the nobility and the royal family. One of the contradictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, local tax officials are either bought by the governor or the mayor, and when they file tax returns, they can’t report 10,000 taxes or they’re shrinking. In the tax bureau, after the end of the term, the ash is leaving. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax issue is much better than before. The New Party has vigorously promoted various reforms, and there are problems with tax reform. However, until now, the results have been minimal, and it is difficult to make breakthroughs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it does not mean that the empire has given up on taxation. On the contrary, in the new party’s holding of the imperial regime, the new party attaches great importance to the taxation issue. As long as the problem can be identified from the accounts, the new party will definitely reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is not so complicated. In simple terms, the new party has no money and is poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old party’s operating funds come from a layer of black gold tribute, so where does the new party’s operating capital come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: From the donations of social enthusiasts, the mixture of some officials and businessmen, and the income of "Emperor". The so-called socially enthusiastic contributions are basically provided to the new party by businessmen who have already begun to be the capital of the overlord. Their purpose is to exchange money for political blessing and support in exchange for greater profits. Some of them have been transformed into politicians, so they will naturally use their money to show their unique political ambitions and decision-making ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the largest part of the income is the income of the Emperor. Emperor Shang is the abbreviation of the exclusive merchants of the royal family. It is precisely because of these people that they have maintained the decent appearance of the royal family. At least the royal family does not need to rely on the taxary life that cannot be collected at all. In addition, the Emperor itself represents a considerable degree of influence. In short, the Emperor is very successful and earns a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not enough for the new party to abandon taxes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only by solving the tax problem can we completely solve the biggest problem of the imperial ruling party at present - there are many reform plans, but there is no money to implement it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the new party not see the black holes in the taxation of these cities? Of course they can see it, but the problem is that if you don't mean it will definitely be able to find out the problem. Nowadays, when tax reform is difficult to advance, it is simply nonsense to get useful information from the tax officials who have been bought up. The high-level people went on a round trip and found that all the tax returns were reasonable and there was no "fraud" phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't find a problem, how can I get through this opportunity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a difficult problem, a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the fortresses are extremely powerful in imagining the imaginary enemy, but they always ignore the fact that many enemies are from the inside of the fortress. It’s hard for outsiders to want to check the accounts of Chatter City, but is it difficult for locals to check this account? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoen has put all his plans out, and he will use his influence as a senior agent to influence the State Bureau of Kansas and let them Send a team on the "face" to escort the tax bureau of the tax bureau to clean up the local tax. This will definitely allow Peter to take his attention away from Jon and transfer to deal with the tax official who is "finding". With so much time, they can do a lot of things, such as finding a home for Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin has the blessing of "going home," as long as the family is strong enough, even if he faces Peter, the mayor, he does not need to worry. I will be killed by a wave. The rest is to find ways to collect evidence and publicize the corruption of Tener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rarely reasonable, at least Doolin did not find any vulnerabilities that he was too obvious. There was a look of consent on his face, but he was still wary in his heart. He did not believe that there were such great people in the world, and he was not a fellow with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two discussed the matter afterwards and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back, Dudu asked: "Do you believe his words?", he said that Xiu En. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook his head seriously. "I don't believe his words, so on the surface we are cooperating. In fact, we still have to find a way to save ourselves. We can't put hope in the hands of others." He said here. When I took out the cigarette and handed it to the Buddha, the two stopped at the fire before moving on. As he walked, Du Lin said: "It is imperative now to find a way to see Mrs. Vivian, and only after seeing Mrs. Vivian, we know where the exit of the maze is!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no emotional exposure to this Buddha. He knows that he is not as smart as Doolin, so he only needs to play the role of a good performer. As for why he does it, it is not what he needs. Things to consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, two young police officers appeared outside the door of Peter’s house, and they were very loyal and did not leave from morning till night. At the end of the evening, Peter returned to give two policemen a pack of cigarettes, and twenty dollars, which is a reward for them. Peter knew very well that this must have been arranged by Prando to please him. Although he did not quite see Prando, there was no prejudice against these policemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, for whatever reason, the two policemen are always here, aren’t they? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For three days, the people in the manor have become accustomed to having two police officers at the door, especially the feelings of some servants on the two policemen. Their presence reduces the workload of these servants, at least without the need for uninterrupted patrols to prevent anything that might happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day, the weather was a bit gloomy and the wind was not too small. The wind was mixed with faint mist and small drops of water. It seemed to be raining. The mayor of the mayor quickly went up to his exclusive car and galloped away. Today, investigators from the State Taxation Bureau will arrive in Turner for a one-week rational tax check. Sometimes Peter despise those new parties very much and knows that it makes no sense to do so, but he is always doing this. What else can they get besides disgusting people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 9:40 in the morning, the downpour suddenly erupted, like the sky was smashed by someone. The pouring rain brought the whole world into eclipse. Mr. Guan Jia stood on the second floor of the window and looked at the two policemen who shivered in the autumn rain at the gate of the manor. He hesitated and asked the servants to invite them in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a housekeeper, the interests are always consistent with the owner. Peter is not a difficult mayor to get along with. On the contrary, on the back of his violent, in daily life he is a very personal guy. He is very caring and gentle, whether it is his nature or his means of hiding himself. In short, he has succeeded in setting his own people perfectly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two young policemen shivered and wrapped thick blankets under the manor's eaves. The rain flowed into their boots along their trouser legs. Even with thick blankets, the faces of the two were still very unsightly. Still shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give them two cups of hot tea and two sets of dry clothes, they are very hard at the door, and I think the weather should not be Anyone who rushed here to open the door to make trouble.", the steward said so, but at the same time, he also smashed the guards in the manor, be sure to guard the entrances and exits, and absolutely must not let anyone in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two little policemen dried their bodies after a thousand thanks, changed a suit, sat in the lounge for the servants to sleep heavily. Go, as if everyone has forgotten the two little policemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this dark rainstorm day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Vivienne just drank a little broth, she has no appetite at all, if she is not pregnant, she may not even drink the broth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every woman is eager to be a mother one day, this is the power that God gives them, whether they are in power or not, they should be Have the power to be a mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly caress the belly without any change, Mrs. Vivian looks at the dark night sky outside the window, she feels that her world is like a window The rain is bleak and there is no future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compact and a slight knock on the door alarmed her, which made her somewhat unhappy, although Peter did not say, but everyone knows that Vivian has been under house arrest. This manor. She can do whatever she wants, except to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in!", there was a lingering aftertaste in the hoarse voice. She held her chin and looked out the window, feeling her heart dead. It is. She believes that once Peter is asked to find Jon, he will kill Jon and kill his own children. For the children in the stomach, the outside world is too dangerous, and any small accident is enough for them to hug God early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar voice makes Vivienne shine, her body trembles slightly Although she is a strong woman, although she has a prominent background, first she is a woman. At this time, any woman is eager to have someone to comfort herself and bring even a negligible warmth to herself. But this surprise is too big, so she dare not turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
