			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that already out?", Graf's eyes are all red, which is tantamount to a gamble for him. All his worth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is one of the few porters who can actually make money at the station, and the monthly salary is about eleven to twelve. Between the blocks, this is because everyone's speed is very fast. If the number of porters is reduced, the amount of money he can earn will increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in Du Lin’s careful explanation, he took out all his savings – forty-one dollars, as he and Du Lin’s career. Start-up capital". According to the agreement between him and Du Lin, if he succeeded in turning low-alcohol into a high-alcoholic wine, he would take 40% of his profits in selling high-alcohol as his own advantage. For this, Doolin did not have any objection. At first he planned to give Graf a 50% profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this guy has a one-degree reduction, Du Lin even knows that he should close his generous mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Graf’s forty-one dollars, he soon got everything he needed in his memory. A small iron bucket for burning low-alcohol, a lid with a tube. The tube was turned from another bucket filled with water, extending from the bottom, and a glass basin underneath. These things didn't actually cost too much money. They only used four blocks and five. If it is not necessary for the blacksmith to install a pipe on the lid and fill the gap between the barrel and the pipe, three blocks can be bought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real cost of money is a box of low-alcohol, along with some sugar, glass bottles and the house they are in now. . These things are the big ones that consume a lot of startup funds, and they are not big enough to save. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please take two days off, two people have been in this small room, Graf has a high sense of vigilance, all the doors and windows are covered with curtains Covered, and later proved to be the most stupid way, the taste in the room was not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the low-alcohol in the small iron pot began to twitch and whistle, Du Lin pressed a few stones on the lid and reached out to touch the tube. Immediately bounced off, some hot. When the first drop of liquid dripped from the other end of the tube, Graf almost rushed to hold the glass basin in his arms. More and more liquid dripping out of the tube, the speed is getting faster and faster, Graf's deep trembling hands, stained with the liquid at the bottom of the glass basin, stuffed into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin swallowed a sip, and the shaved scorpion was burning. In the past two days, he also worked hard. At this time, it seemed that he could hear his heart beat and scream. If it succeeds, if it fails, he will be guilty. After all, Graf has taken all his own continuation to do this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Graf closed his eyes, the five senses were crowded together, and all of them began to tremble. Doolin’s brain was blank and failed? He sighed a little defeated, ready to extinguish the fire, but Graf suddenly shouted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ecstatically put down the glass basin and held Du Lin in his arms, holding it hard, spinning, and filled with joy in his mind. fully. Before meeting Du Lin, he did not know that cheap low-alcohol wine could actually become a high-priced high-alcohol. If he knew that he could play this way, he would still work hard at the station. Thank God, thank you for sending this bastard to me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Du Lin with a red face. "If you are a girl, I will marry you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that my ribs may be broken!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf slammed, immediately put Duolin down, he knew his strength Very big, but when he looked at Du Lin again, Du Lin looked at him while holding his arm. The sparks of excitement and joy flashed in the eyes of both of them, followed by a loud and happy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter didn’t last long. The sound of the dongdongdong’s knocking on the floor was heard upstairs. It’s faint to hear a woman with a sharp voice yelling, “Also let Don't let the rest? Damn guy, you should rent a house for the rest of your life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stunned, stopped the laughter, but did not because of the woman upstairs The complaints and curses have the slightest unhappiness. They returned to the simplification of the distillation equipment and looked at a small bowl of light amber liquid with a gas that was not so good, but both of them were obsessed. This is not a high degree of wine at all, this is money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s heartbeat is faster now, and some of his mouth is dry. He knows that he has actually violated imperial law, but he doesn’t know why, he is not afraid. The emotions, but feel extra excitement, jump! If it is not to avoid causing attention, he can't wait to open the window and sing loudly to vent his joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are we going to burn?", Graf looked at the drops of water dripping from the pipe, and when he was getting slower, he asked his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not sure, he hesitated to think about it for a while. "It should take a while? It’s better to put these up and see if they can fit. How many bottles!", as soon as he finished, the two began to work together to pour the wine from the glass basin into the bottle they prepared, looking at the two filled bottles and one for six or seven cents. The bottle, the eyes of the two have no excitement, replaced by a deep suspicion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bottles of low-alcohol wines have just done this test, but they came out with three bottles of high-alcohol. How do you feel that the more you think it is wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf picked up the bottle of dissatisfied bottle and poured it on his head, then spit it out. "Hey, how is it so bitter? The taste is wrong, And the degree is not high!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin immediately turned around and opened the small iron pot, only to see that the small iron pot has a layer of burnt yellow and is still bubbling. Sticky things are rolling under the fire. He picked up a small wooden branch and picked it up, blowing it into his mouth, and a strong smell and sweetness made his brain hurt. He slammed his head, and realized that the first thing that came out was that the wine was right, but then the water passed away, leaving only those things that could not be evaporated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, sugar in wine, and some spices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you know the reason, the next thing is a lot simpler. He first scraped out the black stuff in the small iron bucket, then poured the low-alcohol again and distilled it again. When I had a bottle or so, I immediately changed a utensil. The two tasted the taste in the glass basin. This time it was not only very bitter, but also very spicy. He added a little bit of black syrup that had been scraped out before, and under constant experimentation, he finally made a high-alcohol that was considered by Graf to be a perfect score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think we can already sell it!", Graf couldn't help but take another sip, God testified that he had never been so happy to drink like this High alcohol, really is too happy. The hot liquid enters the stomach, but the warmth is a warmth, and he likes this hot taste, just like he likes to add chili noodles to cigarettes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn’t think so, “We should investigate the price and taste of most of the high-alcoholic drinks on the market, and then make improvements as much as possible to make our Features can then be sold. Products that are different from the ordinary brands in the market can quickly create a better reputation and value for us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
