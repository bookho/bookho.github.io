			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words gave the young people in the church a great shock, and he did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are always telling themselves that fathers, relatives, neighbors, friends, they all say the same thing, don’t do stupid things, they will get better. Can you live well? Look around, even the street lights will be closed at night, they don’t have the courage to go out, because if they are still swaying at 10 o’clock in the street, they may be treated as homeless by the patrol. Han, a violent meal sent to the sixth district or the seventh district to engage in hard work, this life is estimated to have no hope of returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational resources, medical resources, employment resources, these seem to be very good words and they have no relationship, because they live in the fifth district because They are poor. They did not do stupid things as everyone hoped, and they worked honestly, but did life get better? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words are not as exciting as Carter’s words, but what he said is like a loud bell, echoing in everyone’s heart, shocking these Those who want to sleep are forced to open their eyes to face this cruel world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing life is not a simple matter. It takes a lot of courage, even bloodshed, and death. Is it because of these possibilities that you give up hope of changing your life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out another cigarette, behind the smog, he asked in a tone of self-talk: "You don't Fight, how do you know what will happen after the fight?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days, a freighter slowly departs from the port, and most of the ship has a full container of wine. There are also dozens of pistols and rifles that Du Lin got from various sources. The ship not only has members of the fellowship, but also the Buddha, as well as Doolin himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his words, the first time you need to take the goods is not just to put things in the hands of others, and then tell them how to use weapons to compete for the site It is also necessary to establish a direct relationship. If you pass Carter, or someone else to replace him to complete this relationship, you may be able to be overhead in the future. Du Lin never simply guesses people's hearts with good intentions. He always labels everyone with the most malicious, and then tears off the label a little bit... maybe someone can't tear it off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha's face was a bit green. When he was on the sea boat to Irian, he almost didn't lie down. Sailing in the sea gave him an inexplicable fear and fear. He clung to the arm of the ship and kept smoking cigarettes. The farther away from Irian, the harder he could hold the hand of the handguard, and even the tight blue veins could be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin patted his shoulder, the hull continued to bump, some waves flew up, covered on the face, there is a feeling of a whole world . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know there is a way to avoid seasickness, but I don't know if it is true." Du Lin remembered the many remedies for the treatment of seasickness in the world of dreams. He picked up a thing that can be done here. "I heard that smashing the orange peel into the belly button and then attaching the tape can effectively reduce the stun of the seasickness."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the Buddha slammed into the cabin, although this time is not the era of technology behind more than one hundred years ago, but most ships will retain some Fresh fruit trees, such as orange trees. On the one hand, it is to meet the needs of different classes for food diversification, and it is not worthwhile to use an ice bank for some fruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders, glanced at the beach that had completely disappeared on the sea level, and turned and walked back to the cabin. He needed a good rest for a while. Three days later they will be in the first place, a seaside city called Wesley. All the cities close to the sea will not be too backward. Although there are some small villages and the seaside still live a poor life, there is absolutely no poor and backward city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is shipping or marine resources, it is enough for the seaside city to have enough economic pillars to support the development of the city. Wesley is such a seaside city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wesley has more than 3 million permanent residents. The city is dominated by fishing and light industry. They mainly make canned fish caught in the sea. Sell ​​to other cities. Although the taste of cans may not be as good as it should be, many middle and lower class citizens in society still like these things very cheaply, but also meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know what they call amino acids, they don’t understand why humans need to supplement amino acids, but they know that they don’t have the strength to work without meat. Compared to those dozens of pounds of beef, this kind of money can buy six cans is their favorite thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city has the same Guarts. After the empire’s demise of the Guart Kingdom, they put together all the Guartes in order to prevent the Guartes who brought them great casualties. They all broke up and distributed to various cities. In Willis, the Guars are mainly engaged in canning work with high labor repetition, heavy work, and sailors on some fishing boats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, this city with few tourists has fallen into a deep sleep, except for dogs that occasionally wake up from the middle of the night. There is only the sound of the waves. At this time, on the edge of the most remote berth, more than a dozen people stood in the cold wind smoking. They wore some of the whitewashes that had been washed, even the repaired seals, with an old round cap, shivering slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea breeze at night is not so comfortable, for the first person to walk anxiously back and forth, it is speculated that those compatriots who contact them will make a mistake. At the time, a black shadow suddenly appeared on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man who was called "Buddy" by the group of Guads took off his cigarette butt and threw it on the pallet and stepped on it. foot. He picked up an oil lamp from the ground and lighted the signal of "three long and two short" according to the agreed content. Soon the shadow of the opposite side also responded with a signal of "three short and two long", which is his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tidal wave, the boat quickly approached the dock, a guy wearing a luxurious wool trench coat with a very beautiful hat in the moonlight He stepped on the pallet, he shook hands with Buddy, and his voice was young. "It's nice to meet you, I am Du Lin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budi Forced to shake hands with Du Lin, and received it back, he worried that the old man in his hand would hurt the young man. After spending the rest of his life in the city, his palms have been covered with wounds and calluses by the sea fish and work. The wounds and the edges of the old man are as sharp as a knife. He glanced at the contents of the ship and said "help them". The people behind him immediately began to help others to put what they put on the pallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no talk of both of them, and soon someone rushed over the cart, they packed things up, and then they opened it together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that although Buddy is the most prestigious person of the Guars living in Willis, he is not rich. He was only forty years old, and the wrinkles on his face were deeply trapped like an axe. The whole person was very old and very embarrassed. They came to a basement not far from the dock, here is Buddy's home, a wet basement. Fortunately, the size of this basement is not small, perhaps the only one that can prove Budi’s identity is the size of this basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
