			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s statement does not make Amp comfortable, but he is also very clear that he is not a person on this front, so understand the things inside. Not much, and soon closed his mouth and no longer discussed anything related to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car keeps moving forward. After a while Anna asked: "Why are you caught by them? I remember that you didn't arrange any for you when you were on vacation." Mission, as long as you don't go to some military restricted zones, or close to some key personnel, the other party can't find you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp smirked and smiled silently. "I drank some wine, my wallet was stolen, and I made a mistake." He sighed with the hair washed on the boat and sighed. "This thing blames me, I will not drink afterwards." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna should have a voice, did not speak, and after a while, she spoke again. "Do you think this matter has anything to do with Mr. Tucks? Will it be that he suspected your identity and then reported you to the police station?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp shook his head. "He doesn't know my true identity." We are very happy with each other, he should have no problem. But after this incident, it is actually good, at least I have an excuse to put Tucks. The student is coming back from the federal side. As long as he returns to the empire, we have a way to let him meet with Du Lin, or arrange some other work, let him take the initiative to discover something, and then cooperate with us to win Du Lin." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I remember you said you are going to Doolin’s hometown. Have you gone yet?" Anna nodded, andampton came. Interested, "Is there any important discovery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!", the Anna expression with only half of the face is not very good, "I didn't see it." The people I know may have changed their appearance because of the time. Some people have been wearing masks before. I have not seen their true face. After the next mission, I plan to go to Te Nai. The District Police Department has read the archives there. There should be some past information on the information before they change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna goes to purple The trip to the town can be said to be a very failure, she did not find Any key thing to determine the original color Dawn members are not living there, but there may therefore arouse his suspicions, she can only hope that these people get old after it is not as rapid response. The only thing that made her feel that there was a problem with Zizhen Town was Duan’s heavy firepower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was too familiar with the gun, the weapon of Leidon, the most powerful sharpshooter in the organization, from a collection of a duke. Of course, Anna did not see the gun around who was using Du Lin. But she had a feeling, a sixth sense of belonging to a woman. In some cases, the traces of heavy weapons used in the scene were inevitable. There is no doubt about the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current empire’s standard weapons do not have a heavy weapon for single-person portable use, and at least a weapon pedestal is required to function, in the memory of her entire life. Only the dragon hunting gun can be carried around and cause the same damage as a heavy weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun is not an antique, it is actually a modern work, but the drawings come from the origin. Also found along with the drawing is a handwritten note on the source and the process of the birth of the design drawing. In that era, there should be a creature of the dragon, and this drawing and the gun were designed to eliminate the dragon at the top of the food chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the original craftsmanship and metallurgical standards could not meet the demand for the manufacture of dragon hunting guns, no similar weapons were found in the known relics. This drawing finally fell into the hands of the Duke. The Duke felt that the weapon was very interesting. So he consumed about 17 million gold coins, collected enough materials, and modified the data on the original design. Only now has this gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gun is definitely an important clue, which is why Anna rescued Anpu from prison. She not only needs Amp's clever mind, but also because it has an unclear relationship with Doolin, so she hopes that if Amp has the opportunity to send Doolin to the gallows, it is very likely that the original blood color will be The soul figure of dawn appears again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch that guy has always been Anna’s greatest desire. If she doesn’t catch this person who has lost half of her face, she will not sleep well in this life. The tearing pain on the face and the sensation of the ants will always entangle her, even if she goes to hell after death, she must find that person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent car quickly disappeared into the crowded traffic and could not attract anyone’s attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the eighth district has just begun to operate as a whole, and already two shooting teams have entered the eighth district to start taking snow, which makes many Ilyan local The middle class is relieved. It is clear that the tourism industry seems to have gone downhill differently from people's guesses, but if the eighth district can operate as normal as the City Hall said, it will be enough to make up for the pressure on the depressed tourism market before the winter break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To borrow my estate?" Du Lin picked up the phone in a confused way. Carter transferred two young girls and six boys from the fellowship to listen to Doolin's instructions. The phone was accessed from the outside. Suddenly, when someone told Du Lin that he could rent his manor, Du Lin really did not respond. "No, sorry, my manor is not rented or sold." He hung up the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got out of bed, he glanced at the wall clock on the wall. Now it’s more than ten o'clock. He patted his forehead and turned down from the bed, rushing a hot water. After changing a new dress after taking a bath, I hurried down the stairs. He and Albert made an appointment to meet at 9 o'clock this morning. It has been missed for more than an hour now, which is too rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, after he went downstairs, he saw Albert sitting in the living room and looking at the TV bored. When he heard the footsteps, he immediately got up, Dulin Station. In the half of the stairs, he waved at him. "Come to my study room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two entered the study, Du Lin asked a girl to send them Some cakes and lighter teas were closed to the door. This time, because of the New Year, Albert was able to return from the federal side. He usually lived in the federal busy Dulin's big plan. At this time, Albert had a more noble temperament than the salesman who sold him every morning. The elegant dress and qualified accessories make him look like a big man in the upper class, no longer an inconspicuous salesman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looks good there!", Du Lin picked up a piece of dried meat that had touched the honey and stuffed it into his mouth. In the past, this was only the nobility. Only eligible to enjoy the food. The cooks sliced ​​the beef and marinated it with spices for a while, dried it naturally, baked it, and smeared a layer of honey while eating. It tasted great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert’s expression was a little excited, and he kept shaking his head. “Boss, if you are not you, I’m just a salesman. I’m very fortunate to know. You, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled. "Success will not be lazy, just because you are on time every morning." It appeared in front of me, so your efforts touched me. I didn't give you the opportunity, it was the opportunity you won.... Well, no more touting each other, tell me something I am interested in. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert was given a very important task by Du Lin, the second "outsiders" who entered the core circle of Doolin after the bastard lawyer. The reason why he is used, in addition to this person is very well controlled, he is also smart enough to know what is his own, what is not his own. Of course, trust is a very cheap thing, so outside of Albert and his team, there are more people who, without knowing each other, follow Du Lin’s request to execute his plan and even monitor these people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
