			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honour, or the glory of the past is a very practical old trick for many people, it’s like two women with technology standing at you Let you choose in front of you, on the appearance of the body are almost the same, when you do not know who to choose the best, suddenly someone told you that the technical woman on the left was the first public relations here, the money may not be able to She learned a game. At this time you must know how to choose, the same for more general customers, even more than the concept of trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People’s evaluation of good things is rude and simple. As long as they are the first, they must be better than those who have not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can win the first place in a sales list, it’s an affirmation of yourself, the San Fernando boutique production company, and it will certainly become a choice when people choose a banner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff immediately made his own office chair, took out a contract from the drawer, and signed an actor contract. Once the name is signed on the contract, you must film at least ten films for the San Fernando boutique production company according to the legal documents in the contract. The pay per movie is one thousandth of the sales of the single tape, or You can also choose the base salary, and then each time you shoot more, the salary increases by percentage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most actor will choose to split into salary, but there are also unfortunate ones. For example, the worst sales in the first half of the year only sold more than 7,000, three The income of the actors is less than one hundred together. This kind of thing is really inaccurate. There are also 800,000 copies of the explosions. The single income of the actor is more than two thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, give us two cups of coffee, the best kind.", Jeff instructed Jim to go out to do the service, Jim did not complain, this This means that once the contract is successful, he will be able to get a fee of no less than 30 dollars. Even if there is no success, there is a labor fee of ten dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Jim went out, Jeff let Kinsale sit down and put the contract on the table. He didn't start Jinsell to sign the contract. He did do it before, but after scaring away a few young actors, he gradually understood how to talk about these things with these young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like performances? Is there any performance experience?" This is a question that Jeff is very concerned about because he considers the transformational aspects, naturally There is a higher demand for the performance skills of the actors. If he had been in the past, he wouldn't consider asking for it at all, and Jeff still had some ideas. He thought that it might be more appropriate for Jinsel to look like a normal film. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He often encourages actresses who have signed up, and will definitely have the opportunity to appear in normalized movies in the future. He does intend to do so. At the same time, he is also very aware of the fact that it is not an easy task for an actress who takes off his clothes in front of the audience to succeed in the field of big screens. People always look at these actors, especially actresses, in the past. For example, the heroine in the movie he recently invested in is the signing actor of his company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl had previously photographed the contents of the tape that could not be said. The finished film had not yet come out, and there was a one-sided situation in public opinion. People even turned out the action films that the girls had played in the past two or three people. Although they also sizzled the topic for the upcoming movie, it also meant that the mainstream group did not accept the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undressing is easy, but it’s not that simple to wear. Even these things will suppress an actor for a lifetime. If it doesn’t work, you can only lick it. In the past, when I saw that she had forgotten to wear clothes, she was old. When she forgot about it, she might be successful. But when it was time, she was not old? She wasted the best years, she lost those opportunities, she could only go back to the past in countless times, saying, I don't shoot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Jeff hesitated, Kinsale’s voice disturbed him and pulled him back from his divergent thoughts. “Jam said that you are here. Is it an actor? I have never learned to perform, but I believe this thing is not difficult, just show another person in front of the camera, maybe I can do it!” Kinsale never felt that the actor had any difficulty. Didn’t you see the people on TV performing very simple? It’s her, she feels she can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff wants to laugh and laugh, he snorted and his face struggled to put the contract on the table. "This is a contract. And it's still the top contract. As long as you sign this contract, it is the signing actor of our company from today, we are protected by the content of this contract. I need to declare two points, the first point, there is Mark your salary, one-thousandth of the sales of each film plus five hundred plus five points. Second, you have the right to pick the script you want to shoot, but you can't go without restrictions. Drag down, shoot at least one every three months, and take a total of ten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you sign your name...", Jeff Before I finished, I saw that the girl named Kinsale signed her name on the contract. He swallowed and continued. "Well, the previous sentence, when I didn't say it, I need you to go. Receive a 45-day performance training class that will teach you the most basic performance skills Et al. Forty-five days we'll discuss what to shoot the film "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Jeff took a look at the contract and he unexpectedly found Kinsell's signature... very nice, with a little star style. In fact, he didn't know, even Du Lin didn't know. Since Du Lin sent the TV set to Ziwei Town, Kinsale had the idea of ​​being a star. Not only did he watch the TV series that he was licking every day, still The town found the teacher who was often beaten, let him design a signature for himself, and practice it many times a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Kinsale, it is that she will definitely become a big star. If a big star does not have a qualified signature, it will not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to study?", Kinsale is a little unhappy, she feels she has a very high level of performance skills, even her younger siblings are often Praising her performance is very expressive, "I don't want to waste too much time on unnecessary things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff is also very embarrassed, but he is very Persevere, "This is a must, or you can give me a performance. If your performance makes me happy, maybe I can't go to the cram school." He recently talked about a new investment with people, and now they are tall in the eighth district. The production company on the market also recognized the speed at which tapes make money, especially Jeff. In the first half of this year, San Fernando has completed more than 4 million in profit, and the abundant cash flow is quite attractive to any company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They plan to team up with Jeff to shoot a larger movie, the kind of **, plus the famous male star and the stimulating script, maybe Can make a fortune on the big screen. If Kinsale's acting is enough, let her go to the big-scale movie may be a good choice, at least it will not be so difficult to transform and put on clothes in the future. As for the failure..., small cost production welcomes you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I play?", Kinsale took a few steps back and forth, then punched a fist. "I play a cowboy?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff’s palm is lowered on the head, the most direct way for an ordinary actress to express his acting is to interpret the aristocratic lady. The aristocratic lady is dignified and noble, and her temperament is very difficult. Because they do not live in such an environment, they can only observe and imitate, so this is the most correct choice. Performing a cowboy... What is this thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jinsel’s legs are open, the hand is holding the reins, and the other one is like a lasso, very serious. Looking at a pot of green plants in the corner, I also specifically reminded, "That is a wild calf, watch me catch it.", then waved his arm and made a lasso action, it looks like What is really hard to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
