			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Durin was kicked out?" Nasha couldn’t help but ask, she was cheerful since Du Lin and she told the truth. A lot, there are occasional smiles on the face. It’s just that she didn’t think that Du Lin would actually be kicked out by her partner, which made Nasha feel a little confused. This guy is definitely not a good person, and Nasha has confirmed that they can kill other people by killing Morris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s just that such a person is actually kicked out of the game by his partner. Doesn’t he have any remedy measures or revenge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no, Du Lin is honestly staying in his own home, not running around all day, except occasionally going to film the scene to explore him. Almost every business activity is isolated. This made Nasha a bit tickle. She was also prepared to give herself a sigh of relief when she negotiated at the end of the month. She retaliated against Du Lin’s bastard. Didn’t she think that she could not do it? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Chris has already transferred the news from here to the Imperial Capital. John was very happy after learning that this meant that letting Nasha go to Irian to relax. What is necessary is also the right choice. The only thing that is uncomfortable for the elderly is that Nasha’s emotional changes are most likely to be related to the countryman called Du Lin, which is the last thing the elderly want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first person of the third generation of the George family, Nasha's role is very important. Towards a small one, her words and deeds may be the vane of the middle management cadres of the enterprise. Her joys, sorrows and sorrows are no longer their own, and they are a channel for the family to go abroad. To the big, Nasa, who is of great significance, is definitely the best candidate for marriage. No matter who chooses or even marries the royal family, there is no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she may prefer a poor country, Mr. John can only sullen in his heart, but also said that this task Chris did a good job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is Doolin?" Nasha quickly changed her mind, since it was impossible to report "one finger" at the negotiating table. Enmity, but watching his failed expression can still be done. Chris immediately told Doolin about her movements. At this time, if Du Lin was not surprised, he should visit the filming scene. He is going there almost every day. Some people say that he is pursuing Freina. Others say that he has covered his failure in this way. No matter what the outside people say, Du Lin will go once a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha changed her handful clothes and grabbed a handbag and went out. When she got on the bus, she suddenly asked: "Duo Lin is really pursuing the woman of Freina? She is bigger than Du Lin. More!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scornful tone that made Chris jump, and came, the young lady really liked Du Lin? She lifted her arms and lifted it up to cover the panic in her eyes. "This...Miss, these actresses are very dressed, they can make themselves look younger than their actual age, and I heard that Ms. Reina and Du Lin are both out of the place, and it is inevitable that there will be a good feeling between fellow people. It is understandable to breed feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nasha laughed a few times and squinted at Chris. "Do you think I am a fool?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clyss slightly lowered her head Silence, she knows she can't say it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin is talking to the director about the shooting problem. Once the TV station is set up, it needs a lot of programs to attract everyone's attention. There is no doubt that Du Lin has had many imitators as soon as he successfully fired the first shot. At that time, there will be competition, but Du Lin is not very worried. When it comes to TV programs, I am afraid that no one knows more about this line than he does. He has hundreds of years of "advanced" ideas and materials! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard from my peers that the tape specifications of the player are not the same as those used for filming, and the size of the tape is much narrower and the material has some changes. It may be more delicate than the picture seen in the movie theater." The director was tired of chatting with Du Lin in the gap between the shots. "And the tape of the player has not been dedicated to video equipment. Now the tape is made up of The large tape is turned into a small tape, and the cost is even higher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In general, copy a tape tray suitable for player playback, probably It costs about 22 yuan. If you can produce in large quantities, the cost may be reduced. How? Is Mr. Doolin planning to play this movie on those players? This is a good idea. Watching a movie in a movie theater is comfortable at home?" It is obvious that the director misunderstood the meaning of Doolin, and Du Lin did not explain it. It is the default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a tape requires twenty dollars (compression cost is not a typo), then transport from Irian to other places, a small amount of money, more For three dollars, you need at least twenty-five dollars in the hands of customers. The cost was much higher than he expected. He thought that he could get it for just a few hundred dollars, but he didn't expect it to be so expensive. Rolling tape on Monday, one month is a hundred dollars, which obviously will make some middle-class families can afford to buy TV but look down on TV. This is not what he wants. It seems that only one week can be adjusted to ten days. Or a half-month period. At the same time, it is necessary to hire some experts to make targeted research improvements, reduce unnecessary processes and reduce costs. If the cost of tape can be suppressed within ten dollars, the industry is the one who has the final say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I need some scripts and some actors to shoot some songs and dances, who should I look for?" Du Lin took a cigarette and handed it to the director. The director smiled and thanked Du Lin for not forgetting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sniffed the unique taste of the cigarette and then stuffed it into the entrance. "Thank you, in fact, these things can be found from the actor guild to find everything you need." The actor guild listens as though he only cares about the actors. In fact, some writers and directors also join the actor guild. They should call the film guild!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The actor guild was born with a huge momentum, and soon the cheap actors on the market disappeared. The president of the actor guild referenced the rules and regulations of the workers' union, formulated a series of standards and required members to abide by them. There are also very strict standards for paying for the film, which once allowed the producers and actors' guilds to enter the extreme. However, this kind of struggle ended in less than a week, because they could not find anyone who would like to be a supporting role and extra actor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of tremendous pressure, the final producer agreed to the actor’s standard for the performance of the film - the extra actor’s pay is not less than the percentage of the actor’s pay One, the supporting role of the film is not less than one-fortieth of the male lead. This standard quickly gained support from all the underlying actors and middle-level actors, which is good for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, some actors also have some script creations, and some transformation directors have failed, and they have found their living space in the actor guild. A large number of low-level scriptwriters and small directors also added an actor's identity to the actor's guild, which is also a guarantee for themselves. As for why they didn't join the director's guild or the writer's guild... that's actually another question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the actor’s guild faintly threatened the producers, the tycoons immediately established the director’s guild, the writer’s guild, and the producers’ union, not wishing The Actors Guild can be a big one. However, they were too anxious, but they directed the director and the screenwriter to the actor's guild. Now, if you don't hang an actor's name in the entire movie circle, you are too embarrassed to go out and introduce yourself as a director or screenwriter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the Actors Guild is said to have stated that the Actors’ Guild will independently establish a director’s branch and a screenwriter’s branch to satisfy everyone’s growing enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want a script or a director, you can definitely buy it if you contact them. Now the tycoons in the film circle have no way to take this group of people for the time being. It seems that the actor union will be a big one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
