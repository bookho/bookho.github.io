			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when Anpu heard that Du Lin and Xiu En had to negotiate with Karur, Amp’s heart was suddenly filled with a thought, Du Lin is not a robber. The reason why I have such a thought is because Du Lin is really too "active". As an outsider, he is only giving a fifty-dollar coin to those tramps who are standing on the street and have nothing to do. The other party can tell what Du Lin is going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of swaying does not conform to Amp’s own "sketch" of the robbers. In his opinion, these robbers should have undergone a certain degree of militarization. Training, with very strict and efficient execution ability, they have a complete program from the beginning to the end like a professional robber, and even count the police response of the local police station in Ternell. To do this series of things requires a long period of observation, secret observation, they should be good at lurking, and the perception of the city is more clear than their own home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is foreseeable that if someone is observing the inside of the bank when they are observing the internal structure of the bank, it is highly probable that the other party will find the vault after half a day of looting the vault. The implementation of the robbery. This also explains the reason why the other party is efficient in the plan - because the exchange of fire is to delay the time, it will also alarm more people, bringing difficulties for their evacuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, there are two things that require special attention. The first point is that the child who shot the gun and killed the guard, Amp is not at the meeting. I’m naming this because he feels that even if it’s said, it’s meaningless, because most of the children are the same, and the other is that they have such a brilliant plan, and naturally there are enough hidden solutions. An adult with a different character and strange behavior may find it difficult to hide himself in the crowd, but no matter how exaggerated the child is, it will not attract people's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he has arranged for people to investigate this little child, but he does not want too much hope for this. First, the police code of conduct in the city has been clarified by the group of robbers, so that they dare to hide in the engine room and wait for the police to leave before they leave the power furnace and leave the sewer. They simply did not take Tern. The police in the city are doing the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that needs special attention is that Amp has always thought that the other side has placed an undercover in the police station. This explains why the escort car found it, but the other party Did not leave any traces - because the other party has mastered the intelligence of the police, and even this undercover intentionally misleading the detectives of the personnel, so that this very eye-catching escort car can be bright and upright in the police's encirclement without fear Direct departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the guess is true, the difficulty of cracking the case will increase exponentially. He has arranged for someone to ask for assistance from Oroto. Tomorrow, a police investigation bureau agent will come to Tener to help him put this. The case was detected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his analysis of the case and the speculation of the perpetrators, he believes that the most likely robbers at this time are to change back to their usual camouflage The object, like the previous day, lived like a mechanically boring life, rather than running out to do big things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Amp soon pressed this idea down. He always felt that this Du Lin was the most suspected, even if he opened a deposit in the bank. All kinds of change are used, but Amp has a feeling that Du Lin may know what he or she has done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time to negotiate with them for a while, and Amp just found a rotisserie and ate something to fill his stomach, and then checked himself. Equipment. Although he is a prosecutor, he is also a soldier with a rank! His military ability is definitely no worse than anyone else. This is where he dares to investigate the case alone. I went to a small hotel and slept. After the alarm sounded, he jumped up, checked the equipment again, and set off at night to the pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half hour of the booking time, he has already arrived at the dock, the first time feeling is shocked. He didn't know how much interest Duolin and Shane and Carol's negotiations represented, but there were quite a few people hidden around them. He counted them at random, and at least twenty or thirty people were hiding in various places on the dock. These people were armed with weapons. It seems that they are not like Du Lin or Karur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp is so lurking behind a glass on the third floor of the dock warehouse, waiting quietly for this strange negotiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ten o'clock, the lights of the two cars attracted people's attention in the night like a lighthouse, probably because the pier knows that there are big people here at night. The street lights and lighting equipment that were turned off at five o'clock on weekdays have not been closed. When the two cars passed through the dark curtains and entered the bright world, everyone's heart was tight, and Du Lin, one of the protagonists, appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t come out in the car, he could see a flash of fire in the window, followed by a hand with a cigarette in the window Stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Moo waited less than five minutes, and the other three cars also entered the light from the darkness, stopping at a place not far from the Doolin vehicle. The two groups were separated by a distance, and the first to appear was Karur. Old things wearing a black dress, red sword collar and white boutonniere make him look a bit temperament and majesty. He walked to the place where Dolin's two cars were only about ten meters away, and looked slightly at Du Lin, who was sitting in the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pushed the door open and walked out. As he walked to the front of the car, his buttocks pressed slightly on the front of the car, while looking at the lighter in his hands. Carol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Xiun? Didn’t he come?", Karur only waited for Doolin, but did not see Xiun, which made him unable to feel Some were not quite right, but Du Lin’s answer made him ignore this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am fully representative of him, you know, he is the director of the Bureau of Prohibitions, how can it be that the bright and bright presence is sitting here with us?", Du Lin went to a cigarette in the cigarette case and lost it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carroll looked at the cigarette and fell to the ground from his side, and did not reach out. He took out a small metal stick from his arms and unscrewed it to take out a piece of paradise. "I still like this more than a cigarette!" He raised the land in his hand and took a sip. . Both of them stood under the light, and the lights emitted by the circular street lampshade were like the beams on the stage. They were indeed in the eyes of everyone like the protagonist on the stage." The old words can be said later. Today we are standing here not to smoke a few cigarettes, but to solve the problem. Your behavior is a bit too much, but I forgive you a lot."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this, he used his teeth to bite the ass of the land, and the land was awkward as he spoke. "We used to have a good cooperation, so I don't I am willing to do things. I offer a plan today. If you think so, then we will all be friends in the future. If you feel that you can't, you will leave me, I will leave me, and after dawn, I will fight!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "It’s reasonable, I am waiting to hear your thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karur kicking Kicking the shoes, said with emotion: "I will give the north of the city and part of the west to As your site, how do you operate is your business, you can't cross the line, and I will guarantee that I will only sell things on my site and will not intervene in your site. Doolin, we are all big people. Don't worry too much about the gains and losses in front of you. After you have saved enough of the cost, we can still expand our business to other places as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
