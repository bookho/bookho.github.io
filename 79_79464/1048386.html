			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thanked Mr. Xerma and Mrs. Xerma at this moment because they gave him a very high birth. One meter is tall enough to let him kiss most people's foreheads. He doesn't want to stand on the stool to welcome all the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bud took the little Buddy into the manor’s hall and immediately walked towards Doolin. After the two hugged, Budi kissed Du. Lin's index finger, that is a symbol of power. Du Lin also kissed Buddy's forehead with a very polite understanding. This is a wonderful blessing from the parents. What people didn't think was that Buddy didn't resist like this before. He also kissed Doolin's index finger and called Messiah. After Du Lin returned, he took a small Budi's arm and looked at the old Budi. Praise it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that people have recently called you Buddy, which is very good. We not only use our fists to let others know that we are not afraid of any challenges, we dare to Anyone who fights back, let them know that we have the same values ​​and ethics as they do. In addition to letting them know the fear, let them see the blessings we have given. This is good." Buddy started with his arms. The injury fell into a life-long disability, and the doctor said it was normal, but no matter how his arm could not do some very detailed movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be because this resentful Buddy went back and killed the Quartet, all the enemies who did not want to surrender, let them destroy, which also made some people indirectly Duolin reaction, Buddy's killing is a bit heavy. Later, Du Lin made a phone call to Buddy and said something, the situation improved. According to Doolin's words, whether you are a good person or a bad person, you must have a certain sense of social responsibility, integrate into society, and do not let society isolate itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in charitable activities, donating money for charity, and paying for improving the living environment of the poor will not damage your reputation, but will allow you to The mainstream of society is closer. Money is not the most important asset. A rich person can live. A person without money can live, but how to live a respectable person is a matter of learning. After the influence of Du Lin, Buddy began to abandon the hatred in his heart, took the initiative to reach a ceasefire agreement with those gangs who had been lingering, and began to actively participate in charitable activities after allocating market share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers Doolin’s request to be kind to the poor, whether they are Guar or not, be kind to them. You can give the Guar people ten dollars, but they can also give the poor people of other people a dollar. Although there is a gap, the respect for the harvest will not be less because of the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a change, people began to throw the name of the scorpion Buddy into the sea, replaced by a more intimate name - Buddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mindset of people changes frequently, some are good, some are bad, but it is clear that the changes that happen to Buddy are good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and was a little embarrassed. If it wasn’t for Du Lin’s phone call, he might never realize life like this, walking in the street. Someone will always nod and pay tribute, even take the initiative to say hello, and thank him for his help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenge is the happiest thing in life, and the same is true for good deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear can't last long, many people may not realize this problem, many gualts are still in the excitement of finally getting out of the sea, a small part wants Apply the pain you have suffered to others, through revenge or other means. But this is actually a wrong behavior. People hate and fear can't exchange positive things. They can only isolate themselves. Only by integrating into this society and maintaining a certain degree of detachment is the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Du Lin looked at Buddy, the young man who had seen the last time he was not convinced, and now he is completely convinced, in fact, Du Lin can Understand the change in mind of Buddy. His esteemed father must bow to a young man who is one or two years older than himself. As a little Buddy who has always regarded his father as his pride, it is tantamount to the collapse of the world view, indirectly transforming this collapse into a kind of Not convinced, I want to prove the result of my father's mistake by challenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a pity that he can’t prove this, but gradually realizes the gap between Du Lin and himself. This is not a language that can be described, except for convincing. In addition, only the temper is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do your best to help your father, be a useful person, and be valuable to all gualts, I will prove your worth. Opportunity!" For young people, Doolin is always very good at speaking, although he is also a young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Buddy gratefully nodded, with Doolin’s sentence means that if he is not too stupid, at least one club president or agent The identity can't run away, and the worst can take over his father's class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always things in the human society that are exempt from it. How can there be so many fair and just? Even the law that claims to be fair and just is not written by a group of people with authority. Therefore, some unimportant promises will not bring about substantial changes, but will make the father and son more serious in their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is not a job, it is a great cause of national rejuvenation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this gathering is not only to meet with you, but also to contact the relationship, there is also a ceremony to be carried out. In the crazy expansion of the fellowship, Du Lin could not have met every member of the club, and every branch president had a profound exchange with him. There are more than 20 branch presidents and more than 40 agents who he has not seen, but it is indeed his arrangement. This time, with the opportunity of the party, I will do everything I need to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people feel that the sense of ritual is a stupid thing, can these people become more happy through the ceremony? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, neither. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of ritual is still necessary for the fellowship, because at the beginning of the establishment of the fellowship, all personnel changes are based on the ceremony, for the latter To the people in this big family, rituals are the most important "procedures" that they lack at the current stage. With this procedure and without this procedure, there will definitely be different results, at least in the degree of recognition there will be a huge leap. In fact, this is also a kind of worry. It is not unreasonable and uneven, and it may take a long time or even thousands of words to explain in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have experienced this ritual, but some people don’t, this will make the people below them feel an idea that cannot be announced. I am afraid of people above. Is the butt sitting wrong, or why have everyone participated in the ceremony, he has not participated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is also a necessary thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides that very few people couldn’t come to call Du Lin because of certain things, everyone else appeared in this manor. I don't know if Henry, a child with intellectual disabilities, regrets it now. His manor has become a meeting place for fellow villagers. Presumably, Henry included his father and his smart brother for the next time, and he was monitored by some departments of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of Henry, when the last agent arrived at the manor, everyone was sitting in the largest restaurant. There are many restaurants in the manor, there are small restaurants specially prepared for two or three people. The decoration shows the warmth of the family, and there are also large restaurants for hundreds of people, solemn and solemn, and some special atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood in the middle of the table, both hands holding a roll of white long towel, a delicate common on the long towel, the handle on the handle There are many gems before, but this is definitely not just a piece of jewelry. Du Lin looked calmly at everyone sitting in the hall, he said in a deep voice. "A thousand years ago, the king led many warriors to conquer the whole world. After the millennium, the descendants of the king could only live in slums and exchange food with dignity because A small group of people betrayed, we lost our homeland, we are sinking to this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is definitely not the end of the story, but the new story. At the beginning! Faced with such a rough encounter with my brothers and sisters, I uphold the will of the first king and the gods, vowed to lead all the Guars to stand up again, look for the dignity that we will lose, and look for us to be proud. The power of the chest standing in this heaven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not allow anyone to hurt us, hurt our brothers and sisters, and not allow anyone to take us As a garbage that is not needed, for this purpose, we may have to pay for the struggle at the expense of life, but I absolutely do not regret it. This is the responsibility of the first king and the gods on my shoulders, the life I have fought for! ”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, we are gathered here, sitting in a luxurious manor and tasting delicious food, but who knows what we have done for this?!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Battle will never end, whether it is today, tomorrow, or the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Du Lin, will be fighting for the interests of the Guars!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room was once very depressed, just like the eve of the storm, everyone They all remember the past that is not far away, the weight of life that they can't afford, and the memory of the food and survival that they need to abandon their dignity and pray on the ground. However, everything is different on that day, because the appearance of a young man, the world has changed color! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very young, as young as the first king, he said as he did, he changed everyone’s life and changed the situation of the Guar . Respect him, the person who loves him calls him the Messiah, and regards him as the messenger of the first king and the gods. He is called Du Lin, standing here and standing in front of everyone. Everyone, from the heart, appreciates everything he has done, and is willing to respect him, love him, and be loyal to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
