			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew is the third executive member to die this month, but this time Matthew’s death was not overwhelming, he was discovered by his servants. He died in the study, and then the servant reported the police. Hesitant to carry out curfews and military control in the city, the doormen want to look at the past and can only wait for tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a bit strange, who killed Matthew in the afternoon, he met with Matthew in the afternoon, what is the motivation for killing Matthew, what is the purpose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew is obviously not involved in the current case, he is an outsider, what good is it to kill an outsider? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, I didn’t figure out the relationship that existed in it. Mennon sighed, and the explosive appearance of all the things during this time made him feel bad. I have found a new "East", as long as the things in front of me are settled, the future will be in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the things on the table subconsciously. If it is more important, he will collect it. If it is not, then it’s not too late, he should Got to sleep. However, this is the eye, let him see a person he does not want to see - Roel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roel has been discharged from the hospital. His injuries are serious, but they cannot be said to be particularly serious. The bullet penetrated his lungs, and fortunately the bullet shot through his body. After the rescue, his situation stabilized, and after a period of cultivation, he was able to leave the hospital. The newspaper has his photos, the front page headlines, and Roel's photo is very embarrassing, as if he was a teenager. Kemen Nong was staring at Roel's eyes in the photo. Through the printed photo, he saw something called stealing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment in the mind of the farmer, a little light blew the fog, he can arrange for people to assassinate themselves, so why can't Roel arrange someone to assassinate himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman had no sleep at this time, he sat at the table, his hands clasped on the table, frowning and staring at the newspaper El, he was shocked by his guess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to think deeply according to his own ideas. If Roel himself designed the opening ceremony of the wonderful western world, how much benefit can he get? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once received a cash income of no less than two million, solved all the current predicaments, became a persecuted vulnerable group in public opinion, and represented a group of people, and was able to take everything from one thing at a time. The inside was taken out, and even the doormen had temporarily abandoned the idea of ​​continuing to chase the line of Roel. Because this line is too cumbersome, accidentally it will touch the sensitive nerves of some people, and they will stand up against themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest group of people in the West is the gold digger and miners. Once Doolin touches Roel, it may trigger a rebound in the miners and miners’ families. Driven by those who are interested, his three-guarantee policy may be regarded as a language game after the "Autumn Account". Take his money, but also to be targeted by him, the three guarantee policy will soon be shaken. The three-guarantee policy is precisely the way in which the doormen take root in the west. In this way, the entire western region needs to work, and there are education for the children. Those who are not well-informed are all wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone meets one of these conditions, but once there is a problem in this area, he may be finished. This is why he knows that the mines in Roel's mining area are not accidental, but also the reason for the scalp to pay the compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is there any harm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides getting Roel himself injured, there will be no more losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, I don’t consider the things behind Roel and the inside story of his attack, assuming that it’s just a hypothesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that Roel was attacked by a self-directed farce, then the doorman’s own injury was also a "drama" he arranged, Du Lin and Who is the other ambassador who is assassinated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer retracted his hands on his chest and leaned back against the chair. He began to recall all the assassins during this time, except Roue. Outside of him, he and Du Lin, everyone else died in the attack. This suddenly gave him a feeling of creepyness. Was Dolin’s assassination also arranged by himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea has once again emerged from the uncontrollable frenzied growth until it occupies the whole idea of ​​the doorman, the more he thinks it is possible, he gives back The people who were assassinated during this time were divided into one class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no real deaths in their own acting, such as Roel, for example, he, for example, Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are not arranging their own assassinations have actually died, such as the Hendry and the West Mine, including Matthew who died at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... Mennon’s brow wrinkled again, and his vision did fit a certain pattern, but he learned about Doolin’s gunshots from the hospital. Biroer was much more serious, especially when the doctor told him that if Doolin moved his head slightly to the left by a centimeter when the attack was made, the bullet would shoot through his head and let him die completely. Moreover, the gunshot wound on his waist was also very serious. The bullet broke his intestines. If he was sent to the hospital three minutes later, the rescue would not come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sore a serious injury... The doorman turned himself into Doolin’s perspective and thought it was still not possible. This is not an exercise, it’s taking his own life. joke! This is not a shot on the shoulder or on the leg. It is really possible that death will result from a small negligence. He will not be so embarrassed and may not be so embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Du Lin is assigned to the other side, who is the assassin who assassinated these people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, two soldiers appeared in the mayor’s office, and the doorman looked down at the soldiers. He didn’t like them. There are many reasons for not like it. For example, when he encouraged him to win the western military base, he was equal to the western part of the country. As a result, he had a big battle outside the western military region and the military. He almost lost the old man and used a lot. It’s only a year later. As for now, the urban military under military control has the permission to intervene in everything, and they can temporarily manage and supervise the city according to their ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the current city is equivalent to having two sets of management systems, one is the City Hall Government, and the other is the Western Military Government. The person who interfered with his power, he would not like it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mennon, we are here to investigate the assassination of the Executive Committee Member of the Western Mining Association, Matthew, and I hope that you can cooperate with our investigation.", It’s a female soldier who looks very good. She looks like a female soldier who can be selected and... The doorman looks at her epaulettes and is a lieutenant. A female soldier who can become a lieutenant must always meet certain conditions, beautiful, or military quality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman pressed the edge of the table with one hand and leaned back against the back of the chair. "What does this have to do with me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female soldier took a step forward. Her chest muscles were very developed. At first glance, it was the form of regular exercise. After all, the task also represented the face of the Western Military Region. It is sure to choose such excellent military personnel to be decent enough. She smiled and said: "Mayor Mayor, we have collected some clues and agreed that this case may involve you. So we invite you to assist us in the investigation. By the way, this is approved by the Ministry of National Defense." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman was silent for a moment, he needed to know what was going on, "I understand, wait for me to change a suit." The lounge next to the office, picked up the phone after closing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing must be asked to the police chief, although the city has implemented military control, but this does not include the police. The local police station is still functioning normally, including nighttime handling of cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief received the call from the farmer and quickly took the matter out of the matter. Matthew gave his maid to him after going home at night. Put a bath of water, in the process he went back to the study, and asked the maid to wait for the bath water, including other things, to call him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid is ready to take a bath and wait for another ten minutes. This is because Matthew sometimes looks at some documents and is very focused and doesn’t like any People are bothered. So she waited a little longer before she went to call Matthew. She went up to the second floor of the study and unexpectedly found that the study door was not closed, revealing a seam about one foot wide, which is very abnormal. Because the study is the most important place in the family except the bedroom for a home owner, it may involve a lot of confidential matters, so the door is locked at any time, no matter whether there is anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid shouted twice outside, and there was no answer inside. She looked through the door and looked inside. She only saw Matthew’s sideways, he leaned back on the chair. On, it seems to be asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid once again struck the door of the study, Matthew still did not wake up, she faintly felt that something happened, and found Matthew after pushing the door. The neck was cut open, and a knife was inserted in her eyes, and she called the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also military officers in the regional police station. Because of the accident in the city, people only know the phone number of the police, and they don’t know the contact information of the army, so they Arranged for people to stay in the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police and the military quickly rushed to Matthew’s villa, but the policeman was asked to investigate outside the door, for what happened inside the police chief Not knowing. About twenty minutes later, the military man asked the coroner to drive the body away and then no one knew what to do. When the morning was over, the police chief knew that the military asked the doormen to cooperate with the investigation. As for how to cooperate and investigate what, they did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
