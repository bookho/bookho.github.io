			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the violent incidents being thoroughly explored, all the tails must be placed in front of the readers of the entire empire, one for the workers’ union The very bad situation is gradually being born. Many celebrities and well-known social activists stood up and accused the workers' unions of using innocent workers to achieve their own goals. In the end, the trend of public opinion was blown back, and countless spearheads pointed to the attitude of workers' unions. And practices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes a big strike, which means that the city becomes insecure, meaning that many business practices must be shut down for some people, meaning that it may happen a series of questions. In the past, people may not have any good methods, but this time in the city of Otis, I found an excuse for pouring firepower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injured worker did not follow the rules set by the Workers’ Union and the Chamber of Commerce to use his seat belt in the way of working at heights. It is firmly connected with the main body of the building, which is also the main cause of serious injuries to workers. According to the rules established by both parties, the employer does not need to assume any responsibility. However, the workers' union not only requires the workers to pay for medical expenses and other expenses, but also the city hall to give certain compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit unintelligible, and what is even more unacceptable is that the attending doctor responsible for the injured worker in Nam Lindes stood up. , accepted the interview of the media. He told all the reporters that the man named Buju told him that the treatment of injured workers should use drugs and materials that are more expensive but not practically effective, and that they should modify the treatment plan. In short, it is a sentence. Be sure to spend more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor’s standing out of the workers’ union suddenly fell into deeper predicament, and even if he wanted to argue, I’m afraid no one would trust them. Including the working class itself, they all began to resent the workers' union this time. Many people have already announced the high-profile declaration of separation from the workers' union and no longer recognize themselves as members of the workers' union. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more and more businessmen and workers appeared in front of the public, they confided the fact that workers’ unions extorted and even persecuted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is pushing this, and it’s still a high-level person, otherwise the size of the workers’ union and the time they exist will not be hit by such a failure. collapse. The back of them is enough to survive this disaster, but unfortunately someone intervened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not someone who intervenes, it’s precisely Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers’ unions have always had a big problem. They want to highlight their status too much, and constantly create conflicts and conflicts with managers and capitalists. And then use their own resources to defeat these opponents, thus gaining a high social status and prestige. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people, including workers who joined the workers’ union, may not realize what the workers’ union did, but Maggs saw it, not only It is him, and many new party leaders have discovered this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers’ unions have begun to intervene in local governance and seek greater benefits through a way that people cannot see, such as where a place has happened before. During the strike, the City Hall planned to remove a chemical plant with more serious pollution and ordered the chemical plant owner to move to a farther place. But this has obviously touched the fundamental interests of the chemical plant owners. The relocation requires additional expenses, and the farther roads represent more transportation and storage costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the chemical city was shut down, the workers began to march under the organization of the workers’ union, and finally forced the city hall to agree to the chemical plant to introduce sewage and environmental protection equipment to reduce emissions. The pollution caused by sewage to the urban area no longer requires them to move out of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no "power transaction" behind this matter that deserves people to ponder, but more people have no deep thoughts, especially those who are manipulated. . They only knew that the factories they worked for had stopped working because of the city hall. They also lost the opportunity to work. They were about to lose their jobs after the factory owner’s tragedy, so the workers’ union intervened. In order to guarantee the power of workers' work, the trade unions carried out a general strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Magus discovered that the fire of this incident had reached the head of the Workers’ Union headquarters, he immediately launched a public opinion offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not intend to let the workers’ union completely disappear, but hopes that this organization will be more in line with the political environment of the current empire. A worker's union, there is no need to have such a big ambition, do you not do your own job? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, under the influence of high-level pressure and public opinion, the workers’ union headquarters finally stood in front of the stage. They expressed their willingness to accept the supervision of the society and at the same time The middle and upper levels of the union were cleaned up. However, it is useless to do so. Magus immediately stood up and asked the top members of the trade union to implement the electoral system. It is no longer the same as the usual employment system of a company, and the president must also participate in the election voting. The final winner will be the general president. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year, can't be re-elected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife is directly cut on the life gate of the workers’ union, facing the raging public opinion and one-sided public opinion, has served as the president of the Workers’ Union for thirteen years. , had to announce the resignation, and asked the official supervision of the Empire to carry out restructuring elections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this has nothing to do with Du Lin. The Guar compatriots he has come from all over the place have begun to work happily, according to the current salary. Standards, they can get almost forty dollars a month, which is much higher than their previous income, and they don't need to be too hard, and they work with dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving the employment problem, Du Lin realized that another problem, the development of the fellowship is too slow, if the fellowship is developed into an organization similar to the workers’ union. Will all the Guartes be wiped out, will it be more helpful to enhance the status of the nation in society? He thought for a long time, and felt that it was not appropriate to do so, or that it was not suitable for the current social environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-isolation is always against the mainstream, and if more people of other races enter the association or another organization, it will trigger more Contradictions. If they are not allowed to join, then this is to isolate the wall of the Guar and the whole society. It will not only have no effect but will have a negative effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers’ Union of Otis was stepped on by the shackles, which made the Chamber of Commerce’s club a lot more honest. Heidler once again saw Du Lin’s The hot and the means, the turtles shrink in their temporary homes. He took it for granted that all of this was Du Lin’s conspiracy, no matter how high he was, it was a deception. As a businessman who inherited the wealth of his father's treason, he is well aware of anything that can change the social form and historical process, and there will be an invisible black hand behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he chose not to appear in front of Doolin and not give Dulin a chance to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can handle the workers’ union, can’t he start with the Chamber of Commerce? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t think that Du Lin will have no idea about himself because he is a “township”, that’s the hell of thought! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler also has a guess that he doesn’t know whether it’s right or wrong. He thinks this incident is so unexpected, so embarrassing, fighting workers in Doolin At the same time, the union will also use this matter to clean up the idea of ​​some landlords who have become commercial districts in the city center, but not in the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
