			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it is the three uncles of Nasha’s father, John’s younger brother, who wants to monopolize the cinema business. According to the rules, Nasha wants to call the three grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This three-grandfather named Fabre is the most ambitious in the family. He proposed to monopolize in a new field, just to put George The family-managed enterprise is split into two companies, and then finds ways to let the future "George Cinema Business Company" completely separate, so as to achieve the purpose of dividing the family resources and wealth. I have to say that this method is very good, because no matter what his purpose is, from the current stage, he is only good for the George family without any harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is also very aware of the purpose of Fabre’s doing this. He pretends not to know, but there is also a kind of desire to make this happen with this opportunity. The disgusted brothers and sisters all kicked out in one breath. He agreed to agree, but did not mean that he lost power to control the family. Until now, except for part of the transfer of power to Nasha's father and his younger son Arthur, the power of the George family is firmly in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Nasha insists on stopping Doolin from becoming a partner of the George family, as the first heir to the third generation, she has enough weight to make it among the families. The elders took this matter back to the family meeting to continue the discussion. Although the general direction will not waver, she can still put forward her own views on the choice of partners, such as changing a partner or changing a strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha is well aware of Dulin’s recent series of positive approaches aimed at forming a new trust with the George family in the field of cinema. If you threaten Doolin in such a way, will Duolin bow his head? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks it is very likely that Chris has listened carefully every time she reports her work, and Du Lin has invested no less than three or four million in the previous period. Funds are in it. If this time cuts off his path of progress, all his previous work becomes meaningless, turning a lot of liquidity into worthless fixed assets, and he will make huge losses for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Nasha’s tough attitude, Du Lin just smiled, just like he pitted Juan, he didn’t care about the childish means of the little girl. It can even be said that he is very eager to hope that Nasha can say that sentence and release the appropriate signal. Only in this way will Juan be more eager to realize the unrealistic dream of "trust" and rush to the cliff without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the play was still to be played. Du Lin’s face first appeared an angry look, but soon became helpless. He hesitated for a moment, and finally nodded. "We are looking for someone who has no one. This need to be said separately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha pointed Not far from the hotel, the accompanying bodyguards opened the crowd and let the two returned to the hotel one after the other. When they entered the top floor, there were only two of them on the top floor, and this was what Du Lin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the balcony, the entire Irian’s coastline is unobstructed, and the blue sky and the deep blue sea are like a beautiful picture. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha stood not far from Doolin and looked at him. "Can you say it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Du Lin smiled, without any embarrassment or nervousness, but he persuaded Nasha. "Many times people always think that they have the power to know the truth and want to know the truth, but they are Ignoring the truth is not necessarily the truth they want. If I were you, I would rather not know the truth, the fruit is not necessarily sweet, there are some mouthfuls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Nasha stared at Dooling intently, shaking her head slowly and firmly. "No, I need to know everything that happened to me, as you said, this is my power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I hope you don't..." Dulin shrugged his shoulders, revealing a white tooth, and spit out a word, "Repent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used a very low tone as if he was telling a legendary story. Everything is explained very clearly, including every detail did not let go. Nasha’s face was slightly white at first, because she heard Du Lin send the family living on the farm to the bottom of the agate river, and then became angry again. She didn’t until her until this time. Good classmates actually sold her for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then these indignations turned into blushing faces and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The villain!" This is a word that Nasha thought of after half a day. She felt that this was not enough to describe her innocence and Du Lin. There is also the despicableness of the guy named Kevin, "shameless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you have these bloody executioners not go to hell?" Nasha was a little crazy. She wanted to take a few slaps on Doolin's face, but she knew that this young man who was about the same size had already killed. At least four people, so she restrained her own physical impulses, "Why choose me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin spread his hand to reveal a very innocent expression," I can only say that you just caught up. If you didn't go to the bomb shelter that day, it might be unfortunate that there are other people, but just as you went, it was also seen by Morris. We can only choose you as a bait and implement all Plan. If you feel that this makes you feel that you have been seriously hurt, then I apologize to you here. If you want something to compensate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Du Lin took a pocket and took out a roll of ten-dollar denominations. "There are a thousand pieces here, although not many, at least it is my heart!", he actually wants to be disgusting. The feeling of Sha. If Nasha can make some changes to the cooperation plan, this is very beneficial for Du Lin. In addition to giving impetus to Juan’s “hot fight”, the favorable place will also affect the valuation of DreamWorks on Xie Lisi Street, which is a favorable influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nassa’s identity may be a tragedy before it changes. But when her identity changed dramatically, it was a scandal. Dooling is not worried that Nasha will say it unless she wants to completely disengage from the George family, and she does not need to worry that she threatens herself because it is exactly what Du Lin wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasha, who thought she was raped, heard that Du Lin just used her fingers... She was relieved? She doesn't understand why she feels like this. She shouldn't be more angry, but why do she suddenly feel a little relaxed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about it carefully, perhaps this has something to do with Morris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a girl is raped by a handsome prince, she may feel that this is not a harm to her, but a thrilling affair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if a girl has a relationship with an aunt in an unconscious situation, it is definitely a carefully planned conspiracy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, this is always a face-watching world, and with the recent increasing feminist movements, some aspects of the atmosphere are very open, in this way In the case of Nasha's mentality changes are not unusual. (Off-topic, the feminist movement is always accompanied by the *** movement, which is the inevitable result and necessary means for women to pursue affirmative action. In fact, in the process of promoting the affirmative movement, many men have played a very important role... Let's take a look?)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Du Lin is still unforgivable. She shot down the banknotes in Du Lin’s hands, and there was a sway of fluctuations on the face covered with frost. “You think this money can make up for you. Do you act rudely? Not enough, not enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin bent over and smashed the money on the floor and put it back into his pocket. He Shrugging again, "I said, the truth you want to know may not be what you want. Since it is finished, I have to go!", he patted the dust on the guardrail "I wish you a happy day, madam!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Du Lin’s departure, Nasha’s hateful, itchy, happy day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who just came out of the hotel, came across to find Scott everywhere. The harassment of the crew was reported to Scott at the first time. He pondered over the decision and still had to talk to Du Lin to see if this was a misunderstanding and how to solve it. Some things are not too good for the official, and people like Du Lin are just right. Although his two ways of solving troubles are a bit alert, the sharp knife is better than a blunt knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luke?", Doolin looked at Scott with a fog, and the two turned and walked toward the hotel, including Freina now. They all rest in the hotel. He carefully recalled that he did not have this name among the people he knew. He could only shake his head and said, "I don't know this person, is there any misunderstanding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Freina may know what, you have to ask her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few actors in the crew are comforting Freena when they enter the crew. She looks a little bit languid, but she can't say bad. When everyone saw Du Lin coming, he left the room consciously, leaving only Freina and Doolin in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked over to Freena, pinching her chin and letting her face her head and discovering a slight bruising trace near her temple. The brow slightly twisted, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena retelled what happened outside, and then looked at Doolin, she thought Du Lin would say something sorry, I didn’t expect Du Lin to suddenly laugh after a while, which made her somewhat inexplicable teeth itch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
