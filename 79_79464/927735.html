			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...is this the city hall of Otis?", a savvy postman pushing a bicycle that is twisted and twisted in Audi Outside the city hall of the city, some parts of his clothes have been ground out with a thick layer of putty. His hair didn't seem to have been repaired for a long time, and he didn't know where to find a straw rod and tied it casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already mid-December, the weather in the north is much colder than in the south, and the whole person is shivering in the frozen, his lips are showing a little Blue-purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this guy who can play eggs anytime, anywhere, a few passers-by circumvented him and they didn’t want to bother. Instead, the two young tourists who came to visit told the postman, here is the city hall of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Du Lin said to the guard that there was a postman to give him something, and he had to hand it over to him, asking him to look at him or to put things directly Put it in the booth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin remembered from the corner of memory this time when he talked to Mr. Kesma last month, Mr. Kesma said that something has been taught. I gave the postman, but I didn't expect to come now. He frowned and told the guard that he would go down and the empire's postal system was really rotten. The things that I was able to send in a few days were dragged for a month, and Du Lin’s heart was ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he saw the postman, all the dissatisfaction turned into a cloud of smoke, because the postman he knew, it was the only one in Zizhen Town. The postman, when he was a child, called him "racing", because Mr. Racing said that he can ride a bicycle faster than the car. When he grew up, Du Lin called his real name, Mr. Sethi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Sesie... How come you?", Du Lin immediately greeted him, while taking two thick clothes and hot water. Come, while Mr. Sethi is invited to a small reception room on the first floor. After letting Sety put on his clothes and give him a cup of hot water in his hand, his look that seemed to be about to die was finally slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can you do for me?" Du Lin saw a box without saying it. This box may be him and him. The only thing that is well preserved in the car, no doubt, this must be the thing that Mr. Zema said. Du Lin was a little dumbfounded. "If you just send something, you can send it to the post office on the side of Tener. How do you send it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sethi smiled a little thickly. "Because Mr. Kemma sent things to my hand, telling me that I must hand it over to you, this matter is very important to me, so I came over personally." He looked back through the window and glanced at the bicycle on the edge of the square that had no repair value. "If it wasn't for the night road in Lingu, I should be able to come a few days in advance."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked back at the bicycle, Du Lin, who was sitting across from him, saw the bicycle. I still thought that Mr. Sethi’s brain was a problem. He was a moment. I understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sethi has no problem, he has a "mission." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many Mr. Zema’s followers and companions in Zizhen Town, Du Lin is not clear, it seems that Kea’s old man, Layton, is obviously Is one, the sheriff who is always drunk is one, will there be others? Perhaps Mr. Sethi is also one of the members, so he habitually obeys every request of Mr. Zema, even if this request is a little bit stupid in Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is a very stupid thing, Mr. Seyce rode his bicycle from the border line of the southwest of the Empire for Mr. Seychel’s phrase “handed over to him” Riding to the hinterland of the empire, this attachment and spirit are indeed respectable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sethi was a child of a wealthy business slave, and was later saved by Mr. Xerma, who has been giving Mr. Xema a provocative taste. The "ultimatum", he is always able to complete the task very well. One time Seysey was caught while sending a letter representing the organization, but the nobles looked at him as a postman and thought it might be just an innocent person, temporarily shutting him in jail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s amazing that he escaped, then stole the letter from the local lord’s study and placed it on the table in the living room before leaving City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a very serious person and a trustworthy person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you drive?", Du Lin looked at Sethi's very ceremonial feeling after putting the box on his hand from his hand. I asked a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sethi nodded. "It will be a little bit, as long as it is a vehicle, I will do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that what he said in his mouth is a modest statement. After all, riding a bicycle for nearly a thousand kilometers and being able to live to Otis is not only a simple one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have extra cars here, you give me the help for Mason, he needs this now.", Du Lin just finished saying that Sethi stood up and watched As soon as he was ready to leave, Du Lin immediately took his arm. "You have to rest for a few days, turn around and play here, and go back in a few days, don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After letting Dece give Sethi a place to stay next to his villa, Doolin returned to the study with Mr. Zema’s things and gave him a door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo saw Du Lin’s rare seriousness, and immediately came over, Du Lin looked at him, and he also looked at Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You open the box...", Doolin pointed to the box wrapped in canvas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Buddha immediately turned to find the knife to cut the envelope, tried it, could not open. Canvas is not paper, this canvas is not only difficult to cut, but also has a certain waterproof function. Looking at the Buddha, looking for a long time did not find a sharp knife, Du Lin pointed to his finger, a stroke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly realized that his palm was on the box, and the canvas coat suddenly broke open. Du Lin took out a wooden box. After opening the lid, it was filled with white cotton. It should be a fragile item, at least Du Lin thought so. His hand caught it inside, touched a cold thing, and slowly took it out before he knew it was a white mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines of the mask are a bit grotesque, giving the impression that there is a hint of madness in the funny. The eyebrows of the mask have a dark red pattern with a semicircle and a rounded upwards. There are nine red dots above the semicircle, like a sun that has just found half of its face from the sea level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin immediately understood, this is Mr. Mamma's mask, the mask of the bloody dawn. He handed the mask to the Buddha and looked at the box with a letter in the box. Mr. Rixma not only arranged a "drama" for Du Lin, but also wrote some lines that seemed a little shy to him. With his current emotional intelligence and experience, how can you not see Mr. Kema who wants to borrow his hand... Du Lin couldn't find an accurate vocabulary to describe the word he wanted to say at one time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kesma couldn’t understand the treacherous dog legs of the peasant peasant who had become a man and wanted to show off to him. He said so in the letter. In fact, the keeper of the keeper, Kesma, did not have any ostentation. Instead, there is some fear. After the ambush, Mr. Xerma sank for a while, and then followed the New Party to overthrow the rule of the nobility, and Mr. Xema disbanded the bloody dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Mennon united the group together and became the leader. These people used to be the subordinates of Mr. Kesma. He arbitrarily took the group to the net of his own hands, although it was reasonable to say the past, but it feels a little worse. So he wrote a letter and Mr. Xerma chilled, expressed his respect and said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr. Zema’s view, this is showing off, shameless display, and he is also planning to kidnap Mr. Xiaoxma, so he is already in Ke Mr. Sma was drawn a huge XX in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked Du Lin to wear this mask at the moment before killing the doorman, and then to say that Du Lin felt very embarrassing dialogue - the sun always Rise, tonight, use your blood to kick off the dawn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this sentence is estimated to be good on the stage, but you have to wear such a mask to say it..., it always feels a bit awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this an antique?", both of them turned over and carefully examined the mask in their hands, and they were awkward and a bit weighty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took the mask back and put it on his face. Looking through the hole in the eye and looking directly at it, there are still some differences. The production process of this thing. Not simple! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly took the mask off, put it back in the box and locked it in the safe. "It can be said that it is an antique, it can be said to be an era." I believe that many people will be interested in it! Don't let it go, or we may be a little troublesome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody dawn killed a lot in those years Aristocrats, these nobles also have friends and relatives. The nobles of the past are still nobles, and the times seem to have improved, but it seems that nothing has changed! They may avenge their loved ones, maybe not, but this is always a trouble, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
