			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddy is not subject to personal restrictions. He took a sip of his glass and was a pleasant thing to drink a glass of wine in the cold cell in winter. The body suddenly became warm, and the chill in the body had long been dispelled without a trace. In Willis, there is basically no market for such things as fruit wine. Only high-alcohol is a necessity for people's lives! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief smiled a little cold. He shot on the table with one hand and stared at Buddy. "Do you mean that we are not friends?" Brd/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddy grabbed a piece of broken fish and threw it into his mouth and refused two times. He shook his head like a smile. "You are the police chief, I don't have that." The matter is climbing to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next second, the police chief yelled over the table, and the dish on the table was covered in the hair of Buddy. , face, body. He slammed on the table and put Buddy on the foot of the bed. "I will give you a chance, you know, I don't like to move rough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not the head of the police department. He does not like to give prisoners a sentence. He is a native. He has lived here for more than 40 years. Willis is not big, saying that it is not small. Someone who might be caught by him knows him or knows his family. If the family or relatives of the suspect do not know him or his family, they can’t avoid the human condition. Therefore, if you can't take measures, you will try not to take measures, which makes him have a good reputation in the local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, his character has been mastered clearly, a little thing to apologize to pay a gift, to compensate the victim's loss will be over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that he does not have a "brutal" side, to do police work, without deterrence to become the police chief? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Buddy without saying a word, immediately removed the baton from his waist and smashed the arm of Budi’s injured arm. This stick is very real, and Buddy thinks that the arm that hurts the bone should be broken. He clenched his teeth and resisted the severe pain, and his eyes became somewhat sensational. He didn't talk, but he licked his mouth and showed a twisted smile. His mouth was breathing heavily, and he continued to learn to spray from his mouth while he was breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gums broke several times, the pain of the fracture was unimaginable, and the arm that was smashed by the police chief began to swell up, he But I don't care at all. The muscles on his face began to tremble slightly. After a while, he spit out a sentence. "You have the ability to kill me, come here, right here, today you don't kill me, I will only look down on you!", he remembers The letter that Du Lin gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't know the word, but he had a young man who knew the word. When the young man read what Du Lin wrote, he was shaking all over! He even carried this content down, which is a very difficult thing for a person who has not attended school in his 40s. But he memorized it very smoothly, and at this time the content suddenly appeared in his mind -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death is the best way to get respect from others, Whether it is the death of another person or the death of oneself, you can be respected or even feared by others. The Guarts have been silent for too long. We need blood, we need death, and we need blood. Today we can choose to continue to live as we used to, but what about our children? What about our descendants? When generations of people choose to surrender, we will eventually lose the past we are proud of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the shame we suffer today will become their "past" and become their "habit", let them think that living with the guar All of it. If you want the descendants of the king and the gods to bear all of this for generations, then let me, and you, and more Guarts who are determined to change this, become pioneers, use our blood, use us The death to water this flower called resistance, let it bloom beautifully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, people will stand in front of our graves and point our gravestones to tell their children that some people have won a fair time ago. To win happiness, to recapture everything that belongs to us, to create a belief called equality with blood and stubbornness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this is the purpose of all our actions, so that all the same people can live in this world on an equal footing, no discrimination, no humiliation, We will bathe in the sun until eternity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Buddy’s eyes began to turn red, just like the injured coyotes were blocked by hunters somewhere, and an indescribable wildness filled with cloth. Di's eyes. He did not resist, nor struggled, so he stared at the police chief. "Come, kill me, there is a kind of shot here!" He pointed his finger at his eyebrows. "Come on, fast. I can't wait. The first king and the gods are already calling me back to the hero's return, satisfy me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His last three words are almost out Looking at the police chief's somewhat retreating eyes, Buddy spit a bloody spit on the police chief. The sly smile stung the heart of the police chief. He lost his baton and pulled out the pistol. The support came to Buddy's head. The sharp buttocks pierced the skin on Budi's forehead, and the blood suddenly flowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the gun on Buddy's head and snarled. "Bastard, do you think I don't dare?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddy's ridicule, Suddenly he realized that when he was hardened, even the police chief chose to give in, which made him understand where Du Lin’s courage came from. People are afraid of fearless things, but some sacrifices are meaningful, and some sacrifices are meaningless. When a person dies for an ideal, arouses the anger of his compatriots through his own sacrifice, and expels their inner shackles, then such death is sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogdin people, far from being as great as they imagined themselves, so determined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a smile on his face that seems to be a pilgrimage, and the wrinkles on his face have become supple. He scorns the song of the first king, slowly Closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this kind of Buddy, the police chief suddenly realized what he had, he took back the pistol, inserted it into the holster, and released his foot. Finishing the clothes and grasses ended the inquiry, and he left the word "mad" when he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, when the door was closed, the police chief heard the laughter that Buddy had gone out of. His eyes were pumping and the problem seemed to be more troublesome! He realized that Buddy might not be just a new private liquor agent, there must be something else he didn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was timid at that moment, he knew that as long as he pulled the trigger, Buddy, the old guy would be finished. But he also realized that it is not only Buddy who is crazy... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes his scalp numb! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn bastard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days passed, the assassination seemed to stop, just like never happened, the gunshots that often appeared during the time on the street could not be heard, people Going back to the street and discussing what happened recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But anything needs someone to make an account. Several unimportant mountain wolf members cry and shouted to go to jail, and the police chief caught them. They also arranged the crimes on their heads. When the City Hall asked him what it meant, he was silent for a while before he smiled helplessly. Perhaps, the world has to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day when Buddy left the police station, there were more than a dozen cars parked at the police station. Many young Guars were like the heroes who greeted them. They looked at Buddy with a hot flame. Budi smiled and walked down the steps. As he was about to go back, he looked up at the window on the easternmost side of the third floor of the police station. The police chief flashed away at the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the Guars won, and Buddy understood what Du Lin said, you don’t argue, others give you what Respect, give you equality? If you give up your dignity yourself, you must pick it up yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen cars left the police station at the same time, Buddy did not know that during his time in the detention room, Doolin was crazy. The sweeping of all the people who have a relationship with the mountain wolf gang will almost kill the mountain wolf. It is his practice that has aroused more yearnings and bloodiness of young Guart. When they walked down the street, they were able to feel that people no longer have a look of disdain, contempt and contempt in their eyes, but a fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone asked Doolin, is this okay? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s answer is very simple. You are willing to let others cast aside your dignity and then slap you, or will you be willing to hate you even if they hate you. Fear of you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man thought about it and chose the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a personal choice, but a racial choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't let us accept us equally, then hate us with hatred and fear us! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heroic warriors will never get the respect of others with their mouths, only the scalp on their belts and the blood belonging to others will enable them to get cheer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the basement, Du Lin called the doctor, because Buddy’s arm was obviously not right, and the blood leaked out more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the doctor checked for Buddy, Buddy did not care at all, and even talked with Du Lin. He glanced at his already a little numb arm and looked at the compatriots who were filled with care for his eyes. He smiled and said: "With an arm for everything in today, I think it is worth it. I thought about it, I should I exchanged all the more important things, but you did it too well and didn't give me this opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
