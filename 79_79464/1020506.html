			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle dagger is Brest’s baby, the dagger that he found from the Sheriff’s body when he killed a sheriff. At that time, he was not as famous as he is now. At that time, he robbed a carriage near a small town. He couldn’t kill the murderer. He let the family on the carriage, but it also attracted The local sheriff. The sheriff has been chasing him in the back. He ran far away and was reluctant to give up. He also said that he wanted to pass him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally he was forced to fight back, killing the sheriff in the wild, and getting the eagle dagger from the sheriff. He knows nothing about antiques, but he knows that when someone who has never seen the market feels that something in his hand is a good thing, it is likely to be a good thing. The handle of the eagle's dagger is like an eagle with its wings on its trunk. The upper part of the eagle forms the handle of the dagger. The dagger is pulled out of the scabbard and is the lower body of the eagle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a layer of feather-like texture on the steel blade of the dagger. Brest thinks this is definitely a good thing, even if it is not antique, it can be worth a lot. The price, so he always took this dagger with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he will be the first in the drunkard's neck, carefully maintaining the edge of the hard-cut thing, just touching the alcoholic skin, let the drunk feel There was a slight sting in the bursts. His drunkenness disappeared in an instant, and the whole person was awake and turned his hands slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest frowned. "Put your stuff into it, or I will cut it and feed the dog!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alcoholic spirit immediately put his baby back into the crotch, pulled the zipper and raised his hands again, slightly bowed his head and glanced at Brest’s baby, closing his mouth and making a sound I dare not send it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, I like the obedient child, do you know that there is a carriage in the town today?", he closed the door of the single room and let his companion Blocked at the door, if someone wants to come in, send him a signal, so that he can immediately clean up the situation here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that gold diggers are poor people, people should have a compassionate attitude towards the gold digger. But in fact no one likes gold diggers. This group of people who are desperate for money often appear in the past to rob or steal around the point of life. Once their behavior is discovered, they become more dangerous. They will kill those who discover them and prevent their portraits from being targeted by other gold diggers who are self-proclaimed justice messengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunkard thought about his brain, which was being washed by alcohol. After some connections between several neurons, he nodded quickly. "Yes, I know that there is a carriage, and it stops at the opposite side of my house." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Brest very surprised. I didn’t expect to grab a guy and figure out where Du Lin was hiding, which is the next plan for them. There is tremendous help. He licked his lips and he licked his lips whenever he was excited. "Where is your home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alcoholic honestly still has some sadness The muzzle said: "My family is gone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are playing me?", Brest’s happiness has not lasted for five seconds and he is somewhat annoyed, his The hand used a little effort, and the blade was embedded in the alcoholic's neck against the skin, but no blood flowed out. In fact, the skin is not afraid of a slight squeeze, the fear is cutting. But this was enough to scare the drunkard. He suddenly wanted to excrete, but he had just excreted it. The poor faucet behind him was not tightened, and a few drops of water dripped out. It was exceptionally crisp in this extremely quiet toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, absolutely no, my house was burned, so I have no home!" He explained, he did not deceive anyone, He swears with the light of God's toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest laughed when he heard such an explanation. "Good, tell me where you live, I will let my friends stay with me." You drink together, if you dare to lie to me, I promise you can't see the moon tonight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The newspaper said it will rain at night...", the drunkard I squatted again and raised my hands higher. "Okay, okay, I said..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brest from the toilet is angry and feels He shook his head with a funny smile. He put his baby back in the scabbard and hung it on the belt. He said to the companion outside the toilet. "I heard that the second floor is a rented room. You bring him up and wait for me to come back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion nodded and took the drunkard on the second floor. Brest walked straight out the door and sat on the round table. The other person also stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it was noon, and there were not many people on the street, but there were still some people. Although Huaxiu Town is not a big town with tens of thousands of families, it is also a medium-sized town with four or five thousand families. It is not uncommon for some pedestrians on the street to rush home to eat. Brest they appear to be somewhat different among these people. Many people see their dresses and are willing to circumvent them rather than being too close to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold digger is a madman, this is common sense of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the town is not too big, I can find out a little inquiries, and finally Brest stood next to the ruins still smoking, this is the drunkard s home. He turned and saw a small hotel, only three stories high, and it looked very fashionable, in terms of the aesthetics of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the hotel, Brest shot ten dollars on the counter, and the smirking boss at the counter was somewhat impatient and looked up sideways. "Is there anything I can do for you? You better hurry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want a few rooms.", talking to him towards the counter The floor plan with the keys on the inner wall was looked at. The plan was a total of three pieces. Each floor plan marked the number of rooms on each floor and the rooms in those rooms. There are no keys on the hooks of the three rooms, it should be someone who lives, and the rest are all with keys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss took the ten dollars on the desktop and sniffed it in front of his nose, and then used his fingers to play the ball to properly fit the shoes. In the scorpion. He looked up and down the two gold diggers outside the counter, hesitated and reported a price. "A five-day, how many rooms do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At lunch, a local middle-aged man whispered a few words in the ear of Doolin, and then Du Lin looked at the Buddha. "Those gold diggers lived in the hotel in the morning." The endings of these people have been decided, but Doolin does not intend to kill them so simply, it is too wasteful of the gift that these people ran so far. He then looked at Eric, who was sitting on his right hand side. "These people can let you go back to the cross. By the way, my friends in the Mainland have found your lost savings certificate, any central bank in the empire." Use this set of numbers to report your savings voucher and you can get a new voucher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Doolin pushing a small card to Eric At hand, and smiled and reminded: "This time you have to be careful, don't lose it, it is very troublesome to find!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin called Mr. Jack and entrusted Mr. Jack to help him set up a secure anonymous account with 100,000 yuan. This kind of trivial matter is not even a good thing for Mr. Jack. The largest money laundering banker in the underground world has a very broad relationship with the Imperial Bank and the Southern Commercial Bank. Even a human sentiment is not a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric took a napkin and wiped his mouth, picking up a small card with a set of eighteen numbers. He nodded and thanked the card. In the pocket of the shirt, "Do not worry, I will definitely not lose it this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once decided to become a friend with Du Lin, Eric’s mentality shift Very fast, he thinks Du Lin is right. If you want to be loyal to the empire, you must first be qualified to loyal to the empire. He is now a poor worm who is not qualified for even the chess pieces. He is not an empire, but only the will of some people. Once he accepted Du Lin’s ideas, he realized how stupid he was in the past. If he could become the chairman of the Security Committee, he would definitely draw a line with Doolin to ensure that he did what he did. country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, is the time when he has accumulated his strength. He needs to accept a gift that is not so friendly. For the great ideal, a little bit of a mistake is allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are they?", Eric, who quickly entered the state, was very curious about the identity of this pedestrian. Du Lin said that these people are Valuable, then they must have a huge impact on themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and picked up the napkin and licked his lips. "If I didn't guess wrong, they should be free-formers."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s answer made Eric feel a little shocked because he went to school and received higher education, so he heard another from Doolin’s words. One layer of meaning - Dooling and the Freedom Front are linked, so the guy in the morning wearing the hood and wearing a hood must also be a free-form, and most likely a very important high-level figure in the Freedom Front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he fell into silence. Because he found his own smallness, such a young man who is younger than himself has not only had a huge force on the table, but also has a terrifying influence in the invisible place. He barely squeezed a smile, "If it is true, that would be great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
