			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be happy!", Du Lin peeled off a soft red fruit, placed on Freina's palm, facing Full of confusion, Freina Doolin explained with a funny explanation, "It is because you have married this, so you are the heroine of this movie today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Freina is very clever, otherwise there is no way to spend more than ten years in the car and the dean, she immediately realized that this is not a black pot for Du Lin. This guy named Luke should be the "golden master" behind Corina. Freena laughed and smacked the peeled fruit back into the dish, and gave Dulin a white look. "There are you like this." Comforting people? Listening to your statement seems like I am worthy of this squat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saying she couldn’t help but laugh, think about it This is indeed the case. She doesn't know Luke, or she won't give Luke this opportunity. In fact, everyone in the film circle looks at the resources in their hands more carefully than the money hidden in the house. Freena and Corinna get along. It has been more than a month, but in the past month or so, she has never revealed the name of the gold lord behind her. Even she did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of resource is definitely a scarce resource. If Corinna reveals it, those newcomers who can’t find the way to the door will probably rush to Luke. The big bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ridiculously laughing, and there is a sorrow in Freina’s face. “I heard that Mr. Luke has a lot of power and is very Rich, will it cause you trouble?" Now, Freina has already determined that it is to hold Du Lin's thighs, and everything else is virtual. She bit her lip and closed her eyes and said something that made Du Lin somewhat unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it doesn't work, we won't shoot this movie, let him be re-released!", Freina actually sees it very well, and no matter what Du Will Lin give another small person such as her a bad guy, and if she shows the desire to fight, maybe Du Lin will think she is using herself. She is willing to lose this precious opportunity and also to exchange for the greatest benefits in the future. Once Doolin agrees with this idea, she will definitely make two movies for her that she feels that she is all embarrassed and will naturally be compensated in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two major productions of the film, and she is also in the film circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Du Lin doesn’t think so. His stuff is his stuff. Whether he’s stolen or grabbed, as long as things are in his hands, it’s definitely his. He can take the initiative to throw things away, or give it to others, that is his freedom. But he does not accept any blasphemy and persecution, I can give you, but you can't force me to ask, this is Doolin's principles and attitudes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a picture of Freena’s legs and then stood up. “I will handle this matter well. It’s just two days in the food festival, you guys. The right time is good. After I have handled it, I will arrange for someone to inform you, if there is anything else, call the manor directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just out of the room Door, Du Lin saw Jose, and the faint smile on his face converges. He pointed his finger at Jose, who was a little shy and bowed his head. "How did I tell?" He glanced at him and turned to walk to the mirror on the side of the corridor to sort out his own Dress, "I want you to 'protect' Miss Miss Freina, have you done it? Where are you when things happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolin asks The all-weather "protection" Freina can also be understood as surveillance. It seems that this is not necessary now, because Freina is very smart, he just needs to click on Freina to understand what should be said and what should not be said. . But this has nothing to do with Jose's mission. He didn't do what he was supposed to do. He was not on the scene when the situation happened, which made Du Lin somewhat annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also knows that these old brothers are coming from life and death with him, and they are all gambling on their own lives. But these can't be an excuse. Du Lin turned to look at Jose after he got the collar. Jose’s lips moved and there was no explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t explain it. Actually, he was diarrhea at that time, and the reason for diarrhea was that he ate a lot of foods at the food festival. I don't know which one of the stalls is not so fresh, so his stomach is very uncomfortable, so he left for less than ten minutes. It was only in ten minutes that this happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jose is a whispered person, Du Lin knows this, he sighed and patted the other’s shoulder, saying with a strong heart: “So We are all in a dangerous situation. If you fall on something like this, don’t you feel sorry? Well, this is the last time, you continue to help me 'protect' Miss Freena, no more problems. !!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling did not let Jose do other things, nor did he say anything further. This was to take care of his face and to tell him a fact. He is still Doolin's brother. Even if he does something wrong, Du Lin will trust him as he used to, instead of "distrusting" him from his wrong position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jose used a bit of a bit and then said: "Boss, I know Luke where they live.", when he came back from the mobile toilet Just happened to meet Luke and his group, and Jose, who knew that he made a mistake, immediately followed these people and watched them go to the villa of the rich with a local wealthy man. He returned to the original road. It is also why he came back now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't say these things before Du Lin scolded him. He was such a dull temper, but Du Lin liked it. He patted Jose's arm. "You remember the address yourself. After I have decided, I will see how to do it. If necessary, I will give you a chance to find your face."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Du Lin walked into the hotel lobby, Scott immediately greeted him. Du Lin said something, and Scott’s face was sore. He squinted for a moment and sighed. "The trouble you got, the end of your own, or the same as last time, let us face your face is ugly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can solve it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Garfield has nothing to do with this!", Sco Special warning Du Lin, this guy is Luke’s friend, who is engaged in the steel business. As one of the three deep-water ports for civilian use, Irian has many workshops for repairing ships on the dock. To repair ships, a variety of metal materials are needed. Garfield is one of the providers. It is also because Garfield often needs to buy metal ore and metal ingots, and he only knows Luke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott thinks he has already understood Du Lin’s personality, and he is afraid that Du Lin will count Garfield as a group of Luke’s, so he’s only The words warned him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Scott once discussed with the mayor adults about Du Lin, Scott and Du Lin have more time to contact, and Du Lin also Learn more about it. He always thought that Doolin would be a big problem because he was not so disciplined. The Irian area wants stability, but his actions are telling him that he is not so well controlled. There are some different opinions about this mayor. He thinks that Irian needs a sharp knife to help them solve things they are not suitable for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
