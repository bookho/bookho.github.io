			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth minister in his 50s who was sitting in the right hand of Magus nodded. He was the minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The newly established information office was not in the same place. Within his scope of functions, Magus later felt that the matter of citizenship should belong to the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the department was taken from under the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of Social Affairs. For almost a year, this department has done almost nothing. The three employees in the department are living a leisurely life all day, and they have no specific work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of the Information Service has been working on the matter. It is said that she and the people in the Ministry of Justice are very close, and continue to submit some reports. A report on the legal and equal power of immigrants, Magus heard about it, but the report did not. At present, the most non-national citizens in the empire are from the federal government. The legislation specifically for the federal people has made Magus include all the Oggdin people with an inexplicable opposition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now it may be an opportunity to see this. A strong country can never be separated from good talents. This is seen from the group of bastards next door. come out. When the Union used to be called the Business League in the past, it began to draw talented people around the world. Margos remembered that when he was young, he once ridiculed a policy of a business alliance as an uncultured treacherous businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Business Alliance released a new policy to the world more than 50 years ago, as long as someone can prove that they are more than all of them in their own field. People are smarter, or have the ability that the business alliance does not have, and have more advanced knowledge and technology. In short, as long as they are better than those of the business alliance, they can get 5,000 to 100,000 silver coins and give high social status and power. The business alliance is also willing to create an environment suitable for them to continue research, providing all materials free of charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people felt that the business alliance was so "naive" at the time, because excellent talents did not necessarily leave the country and environment in which they live because of money, in many big people. In the eyes of the present, noble patriotic sentiments are also part of the moral code. Capable people do not necessarily have patriotic sentiments, but most people have them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is such a seemingly stupid policy that allows the business alliance to quickly become a federation, and then thirty years later, the empire is still lying in the past. When the glory medal was on the sleep, a slap in the face of the empire was beaten, and almost killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the war 20 years ago to today, Magus is increasingly aware of the importance of talent, and all walks of life need talent to make the technology of the empire Constantly improve, so that the national strength is more powerful. The federal people used to make that set in the past, and now they can use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Magus is politically savvy and has a long-term vision, but his time is limited. His God gave him the wisdom to transcend ordinary people, but did not give him more time every day. Others are twenty-four hours a day, and he is also twenty-four hours a day. There will be no thirty-six hours or thirty-two hours. He has no time and energy to handle everything, only to choose the most important thing to solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the outbreak of the slave massacre, he may not think about immigration for three or five years, and it’s even more likely One consideration is to increase the welfare of Imperial researchers, thereby attracting more talents to the empire and contributing to the power of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sudden silence did not seem to notice that the Minister of Social Affairs had already answered his question, his fingers were constantly lit on the table, the voice of duoduo There is a rhythm, everyone knows that Prime Minister Magus has now fallen into deep thinking. After about a dozen minutes, he looked up at the Minister of Social Affairs. "Let the lady at the Information Office go after 5:30 this afternoon." Come to my office, I need her to explain the immigration to me personally." He said that he took a deep breath and let his chest rise, pointing one hand behind him. "Mr. Du Lin said very much. Intuitive, your office will come up with a valid charter for me. I will see it by nine o'clock when I go to work tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, let’s skip this One, discuss how to solve the requirements of these diplomatic notes in my hands..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation team from the cabinet soon settled in the west, they first One question is where the four executive members of the West Mine will go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four people are very important. They are involved in almost all crimes in the west. Grasping them is the most important factor in capturing the turmoil in the west. But the problem is that they are gone. This has caused many people to breathe a sigh of relief, from some farms that run small businesses to the governors who sit in the governor’s office. They are even praying, hoping that these four people will never appear in people's sights, and it is better to return to the embrace of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hope is always good, the reality is always cruel, just the second day after the investigation team entered the west, a lawyer came from the first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you have to do from the first? Don't you know that we are very busy?", the regional police station has been busy recently, and the Security Council and the Western Military Region handed over some inspection work to the local police station. Especially the Venier Regional Police. The people of the Security Committee thought that the four executives could not have left the west. They might have hidden in Vanlier and had not left, and they could only run out after the situation was slightly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is mainly because the traffic in the west is very simple. When the press conference of Federer and Amon is not over, the people of the Security Council and the Western Military Region will All the external passages of the city of Vanlier were blocked, and patrol cars were dispatched to prevent them from being left in places where they could leave the city. No trace of the executives was found. Therefore, the two sides believe that these four people must have been hiding in a certain place by virtue of their long-term interests in the local business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Council is unfamiliar with the West, and the people in the military region are unfamiliar with Vanlier. Finally, these things fall on the local local police and investigation bureaus. They have arranged staff to conduct a city-wide investigation. Although it has been a week, the useful information has not been obtained at all. This allowed some people to get angry while also letting some people breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are temporarily relieved will definitely not do anything. Those who can get angry will send the fire to someone else’s head, such as the area. A police station, such as a local investigation bureau. Therefore, there were less than ten police officers on duty in the entire police station. Others were urged by the director to go out and search for the traces of the executive committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a fire in their hearts. At this time, there are people who have a personal model and a briefcase, and they will definitely feel that this guy is coming to trouble. The tone of the reception staff is definitely not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer smiled and took off his hat, glasses, gloves, and placed it on the counter with the briefcase. He didn't look nervous at all. "I know where the executive is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Security Council, the people of the military region, including the police chief and the director of the investigation bureau, all appeared in Fan In the interrogation room of the Lier Regional Police Department, this made the interrogation room somewhat crowded. The uniforms and casual clothes made the group look like a hodgepodge, but there was only one person opposite them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that you know where the executive is?", the people of the Security Committee first asked, in fact, their work is almost over, they have found The person who made the attack - Roel, the task assigned to them by the superior has been completed. However, in order to compete for more credit, they did not go, the reason is to cooperate with other departments to conduct investigations and arrests. At this time, one more back pot is better than one less person, although there will be more people when the distribution is credited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
