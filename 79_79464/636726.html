			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando didn't dare to shoot, even if he was sure that the gun would definitely kill Doolin, and he didn't have to take any responsibility. But he didn't dare to gamble. He didn't know what kind of backhand Du Lin had arranged, and he would retaliate against him and his family. Wood, Godol, is the role model, the most unfortunate should be Codor, he did not know why he was abandoned when he died, and all this is from the person in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Wood, pulling the singer into the water and making him feel that it’s as simple as removing a bug that doesn’t have any advantage. . The erroneous estimate of the situation, and then inexplicably dying, can be seen in the meticulous Du Lin plan, as well as the violent launch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't like anyone using my family as a trick!", Prando's pistol pulled back a bit, which represented his compromise. Du Lin naturally leaned back on the sofa. From the beginning to the end, his face did not change drastically. Prando slowly inserted the pistol into the gun bag and sat down. "It’s not an example. I promised this, but I have to appease the people below. Every time the personnel changes in the branch, it’s for the people below. An incentive. Now you have to take this incentive, you have to make up this part."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is very chic out of his pocket A checkbook, written for 20,000 yuan, and then signed his own name - really sorry, just like the third grade child just learned how to write a coherent word, full of irresistible and unknown The edges and corners. He tore off the check and placed it on the coffee table between the two and pushed it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The check of the Imperial Central Bank can be cashed anytime, anywhere, valid for one month." More than one person told Doolin that he should not put money in the bank. But Doolin did not listen to them. Do you hide your money in the cellar and wait for them to get wet, moldy, and rotten? In addition, money should not be used to accumulate. Money can only prove its value when it is "circulated," rather than hiding it somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, he got enough information from his dreams, and the Big Mac family or business, or the money is constantly invested in new projects, Either disassemble it for others to exchange income, and never rely on putting money in the bank to become a world-class family or business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando glanced at the check on the coffee table, sighed, folded it up and put it in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mason also sat back again. He remembered what Du Lin said on the car. Prando couldn’t accept Doolin’s money. He said nothing! When she thought of it, Mason’s body shook a little. Indeed, Prando showed that he was unwilling to collect money at the beginning, but now he has collected it. He said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was afraid of Dooling’s control over the horror of the situation, he felt that Du Lin stood up and he stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am waiting for your good news, Director Prando." Du Lin’s face was filled with a warm smile as he got off the bus. I have my own hand. Prando stared at him for a while and then reluctantly reached out and shook his grip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the next month, let your brother go directly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Rondo said that it paused here, and Du Lin added a very polite way, "Dongcheng Branch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the damn Dongcheng branch, I will arrange Ok, all this, now I have something to do, so... I won’t send you anymore.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not have a cold attitude towards Prando Enraged, just threatened him with his family, how could he give himself a good face? He smiled and nodded, leaving Mason to leave Prando's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving, Mason whispered, "Dulin, I don't quite understand, you should be friends with the Secretary, why should you threaten him?" This is something that Mason doesn't understand. "And will it cause other bad effects?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are facing the police station Going outside, Du Lin explained in a whisper, "Friend? Don't be kidding. I have never heard anyone say that knowing a friend must first give 10,000 yuan, and let him do 20,000 for him. He is not my friend. ......", Du Lin's brow slightly twisted when he spoke. One of his body was full of alcohol, his clothes were not perfect, and he was obviously drunk. The guy who didn't even walk well suddenly slammed into him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and helped, and said a word of caution, the other person returned a thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An episode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
