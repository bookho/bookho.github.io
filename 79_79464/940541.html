			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;乞丐? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the city of Otis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has been a bit ignorant, the city of Otis can be said to be difficult to see today, even he can not say that he has never seen any A street friend like a tramp. He didn't study Ilyan's set, forced him and the tramp to work until they could afford to buy a house. There are very few people in the city of Otis... It’s almost impossible to see people like the tramp, and the whole city is full of money. If you are willing to give some strength, you can always get a good one. work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time in the city of Otis is the currency of the majority of the time, the current minimum denomination of the chip is fifty, no good people will fifty Give it to 乞丐, very or five points is still about the same. This has led to the lack of survival soil for crickets and tramps. Most of the tourists are in chips, and if they have to go to the chip, they need to redeem. If you exchange more chips, or if you have more times, you will feel To disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Keena said that there was a shackle outside, and Du Lin couldn’t turn a corner. He had some suspicions, but he couldn’t think of these cockroaches being spontaneous. Still purposeful. If it is spontaneous and the past, almost the vast majority of high-ranking people gathered here this evening. These people are just enough to give them a half-month. If it is purposeful... Will it be Felicia? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels unlikely, he listened to Harry saying that the heirs of the Tima family do not often walk outside. They are different from those small families. The small family needs the heirs to gradually master the art of management by managing the family business. Through the most basic practice, they gradually understand how to allocate resources from birth to solution. At the same time, cultivate the qualities of these heirs in all aspects so that they do not understand anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these heirs of the Fatima family only need cramming education and constant decision-making. Most of their time is spent reading some typical cases. Learn from the essence of these cases and the causes of the results, and then decide on a copy of the documents sent by the family business, large and small, without stepping up the cloud from the ground, they are directly above the cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only need to stretch their fingers to a position, the people below will take the initiative to operate, and they don't need them to experience any "life"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without contact with the outside world, it is very difficult to have any enemies, but in any case, you must ensure the security of Ferrari, which is not necessary Doubtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pay attention to the situation around you, arrange the security guards, if these people want to work on Fei Lijia, immediately kill them!", in order to avoid someone to blame yourself Du Lin quickly arranged it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not impossible. He has been offended and still alive. There are always two or three people. Maybe some people will jump over the wall and want to pass this way. Come to frame him. Even if he can pick himself up in the end, it will definitely take a lot of effort and even make many compromises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kina took a moment and left in a hurry, and Du Lin took the initiative to follow the crowd, followed by Fei Lijia out of the hall door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She actually lives upstairs, but as the most important guest today, she also needs to do some scene work. Those in the upper class pushed away other things to attend the welcome dinner, and she must send them to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ferrari came out of the gate, he immediately saw the shackles outside the door, and the number of people was small, only four people. Their unkempt standing on the side of the hotel's gate shivered, the colder winter weather became colder, and they only wore light clothes. The winds of the city of Otis are very large, because there are no dense high-rise buildings around, and the wind blowing in the wilderness will go through the streets and go out from the other side of the city, so that the temperature of the whole city will drop rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are holding some signs with slogans. They are simply begging for passers-by to give them a little change and let them fill their stomachs. They humbled on the sidewalk outside the hotel and looked pitifully at the guests who came out of the splendid Grand Hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frijia just paused and took the initiative to go, Harry stopped, but did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't just because we are dressed well and eat enough, we ignore that there are still many people in the world who have not solved even the most basic food and clothing problems. For us It may be just an insignificant act of goodwill, but for them it may be a boon to save their lives. The weather is cold, they should add some clothes.", Felicia smiled and smiled at Harry. Head, then took the skirt down the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many guests praised Ms. Fei Lijia's charity and praised her for her beautiful heart like an angel. She is so good to her, she is a girl who is sincere and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Felicia walked over to the side, the cockroaches were lying on the ground, and they held a broken utensil and said the words of pleading. Fei Lijia took a picture of her own skirt. There was no pocket on the skirt. She looked at Vitor with some apologies. "I didn't bring the money, did you bring it? Give these poor people some money, let They can spend this winter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry’s hand has broken into his pocket, and he has already held a roll of money in his hand, but he noticed Fei Li. Jia's inadvertent look, the hand took it out again. The surrounding guests have made similar moves. After Princess Ferrari gave the money to these crickets, they naturally expressed that they are also the elites of the upper class, who are really good and beautiful. They have enough love in the face of such poor and vulnerable groups. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next scene, some people’s faces have changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitol also touched his pocket and shook his head with no expression. "I am very sorry, miss, I have not brought money. But I heard that The city of Otis can use chips as currency for circulation or cash."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that the case?", Felicia looked at Harry, Harry subconsciously Nodded, and immediately realized that something went wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also frowned and pushed to the front, but his speed was too slow, or that Ferrari and Vitor had a tacit understanding. At the moment Harry nodded, Ferrika regained her gaze, and at the same time she ordered Vitor to take out the golden chip that Harry gave her at the dinner party. The label was one, with a denomination of one thousand and weighing more than a pound. The pure gold chip was taken out. Then, in the midst of a dead silence, under the gaze of many eyes, she placed the chips of extraordinary significance in a small pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the bargain given by Governor Harry. The denomination is one thousand. You can buy some clothes and find a better place to spend this winter. "The smile on Fei Lijia's face seems to be able to emit light, and even the cold air seems to be ignited by her smile and warmed up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few excited and trembling, squatting on the floor, called the Princess Royal Highness. They couldn’t believe that there would be such a good thing falling on them. When the night was not completely dark, someone found them and told them to wait outside the most luxurious Alexander Hotel in Otis, and there would be good things happening. And they paid them ten dollars. They came here with suspicion, thinking that there is no loss for ten dollars anyway, but who can think that there will be so much money on their own? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand pieces of chips, that is a thousand chips! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next second, Harry’s face was very ugly, and Du Lin became more calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world is full of the evil of the red fruit, you don't want to have anything to do with some people, but these people try their best to be against you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience in the city of Otis is also not good-looking, and they have left to leave. As "locals" they are actually being humiliated in this farce. They took out their greatest sincerity to respect the Miss Fatima family, but in exchange for such a final outcome, it really makes people feel a little unsatisfactory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like...they are like those who are, don’t need to take care of them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd quickly dissipated almost, and Harry’s face smeared with an ugly smile. "It’s not too early, it’s very cold outside, you still have to rest early. "I won't bother...", after he nodded his head, he turned and walked straight toward the parking lot. At the door of the bustling hotel, there were short-lived Ferrega, Vitor and Doolin, and some Security and waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the four shackles that disappeared into the night, Fei Lijia looked back toward Du Lin and smiled and asked: "I told someone before I came. I am a city of happiness here, everyone in the city is happy, but now it doesn't look like this. Hey, there are some unhappy people!", after she smirked the ceremony, she wiped from Du Lin By the side, Vitor always lowered his head, but he could see the arc of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this scene of today is very successful, not only hit Du Lin’s face, but also let no one find out to blame them. Reasons. This is not to use anything to make it difficult or to attack anyone. This is a manifestation of love and kindness. No one can blame love and kindness is not right, then the only person who is naturally wrong is Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Harry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood in the wind and covered his hand with a cigarette. After three minutes, the Buddha wrapped his windbreaker and shrank his head and ran back. He patted it. Pockets, stiff and falling clothes lines indicate something heavy inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
