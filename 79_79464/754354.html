			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any occasion, a glamorous woman can always attract a man’s gaze, which has nothing to do with status, identity, and wealth. It is an animal nature instinct. Under the "selective instinct". When a beautiful woman shouted Doolin's name, many people's eyes were concentrated on Du Lin's body. Of course, these people have not shown anything different, just curious how a local celebrity knows a second- and third-rate little star, is it... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that most men here have a hint of meaningful smile, they looked at the red makeup beauty standing next to Du Lin, and took a look at the little star. Suddenly it was normal for Du Lin to change to a female companion. It may be that most people here are too greasy to eat, and it is inevitable to find some vegetarian food to eat. Compared with the little star named Freina, the female companion around Du Lin obviously has to be pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a man, you know! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin had previously read about the film about Ilyan Holiday in the newspaper. He remembered that there was such a woman’s photo, but she could not remember her at the time. The name, even now, is not remembered. In the face of this paragraph, the woman Du Lin seems a bit embarrassed, can not remember the name of others is a very rude thing, today he has committed once, did not expect to make a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't seen you for a long time, I didn't expect you to come to Irian?", when Freena smiled, Du Lin's gaze could not help but be her. The clothes you wear are attracted. The same evening gown, even more horrible, is like a tool that puts a towel on the neck just to cover the breastfeeding offspring, and as the two strips of her smile tremble, Maybe even seeing anything from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Du Lin’s slightly embarrassed expression, Dove himself was embarrassed to close his eyes, fortunately, Freina was a very clever person, she Immediately realized that this guy who had a side in the Grand Theatre of Tyne did not remember who he was. For her actress who just broke out from Turner and was active in the film circle, it was nothing. She immediately extended her hand. "Fleina, you must have forgotten me? Really sad. It seems that I have to work hard to make you remember my name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stretched out her hand and grabbed her Hand. There was no change in the opposite Freina expression, but Du Lin felt that at the moment she shook hands, she scratched her palm with her fingertips. "I remember you, Freena!" Du Lin said with a smile. A few times, Dove hasn't opened his eyes until now, too embarrassed, can't blink! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw you in the newspaper last time as the second heroine of this movie?" This is a good statement. To put it bluntly, it is the supporting actress who ranks first in the list, but it is a bit of a disappointment to say the truth in such an occasion. The feeling, so the second heroine this name is very appropriate, but also made Freena laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that Freina’s change is still very big, and Du Lin’s is not clear about the big and small things that happened to him after he left. There is a very special case, among them, Freina. The dean of the theater suddenly became violent, and when Freena was on the scene, the police quickly arrested her. Just when everyone thought that Freena couldn't stand the decree of the dean and finally killed the old man, the police announced the results of the investigation, so that everyone could not believe what they saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freena is innocent, and even though the dean’s family is noisy, this result cannot be changed. The newly appointed police chief is the new party. He does not need to make any supplementary explanations for those who are unreasonable. Here, I have to mention another thing. Du Lin saw that the newspaper of the final result of the gold robbery had a stinky face sitting on the side, not because the gold robbery was not successfully cracked, but the governor took advantage of this opportunity. Suddenly, I made a problem with Tener, and I think that the judicial system of the city of Tener has a huge problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief died in the dock warehouse and did not say it. The investigation of such a large case was slow, and the security team was very negative after the arrival of the police. Suddenly cleared, and the governor also arranged for a new party member to take over the position of Prando and become the director of the Tenel Regional Police. A large number of police officers were arrested for collecting black money. Except for a very small number of people, such as Mason and other police officers who entered the police station, almost all the old people were transferred and separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Peter’s face is like a dead relative, in the oldest party’s strongest site, because the gold robbery was actually cracked by the New Party. The Governor’s adult even criticized his stupidity, not to mention the general election. He has a threat in the mid-term election. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of trouble later, the theater dean was a real social celebrity, and there were students and relationships in Orodo and the emperor. A number of letters were sent to the new director, and the new director was forced to announce the results of the investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dean is dying of a sudden rupture of the blood vessels in the brain. This has been documented by the coroner’s post-mortem and photo, and there is a piece after opening the head of the dean. Almost a pound of multiple solidified blood clots oppressed his brain and caused the brain to be hypoxic. As for why there is such a result, it has something to do with Freina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening, Freena went to the theater according to her and the dean's appointment. On that day, she rested. The dean wore the emperor's costume and sat on the props throne, while Freena played a widow. This is a good agreement between the two. As long as the dean gets a blood, he will leave Freena. After being forced to go nowhere, Freena, who always wanted to be free, finally had to compromise. It may be because it is too exciting, and the age is enough to make Mrs. Freena’s grandfather suddenly screaming at the ground when he tries to rape Freena according to the “screenplay” and falls to the ground... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no dean, and the dean’s family’s defamation of Freina’s family just gave her the opportunity to leave her for nearly ten years. Seoul. After coming out, with the foundation of his ten-year stage actor and his good figure, he immediately became a sought-after and was willing to win her. In fact, the spirit of this sought-after, Freena, is also very clear, nothing more than the old dean is a mind. It’s just that she has been familiar with the mentality of such people for so many years, and she even thinks that her follower is not as good at the means as the old dean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was such a human role, she starred in the first supporting actress in the Ilyan holiday, the play is second only to the male and female protagonists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing so many Freina can see Du Lin in Irian is also very surprised, she once only knows that Du Lin is a private wine tycoon, and then There is not much understanding of the deep things. Unexpectedly, after Du Lin left Turner, she actually appeared on a banquet of this scale, which surprised her and also moved some thoughts. She knows how high the grade of this banquet is. If she can rely on Doolin's power and strength, she can't tell if she can get rid of the current follower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you can't do it, it's very important to make a rich man. After reaching the film circle, Freena realized that a rich and powerful man in the circle meant nothing in this circle. He didn't even need the rich to come out. He only needed to make a sentence, which was enough to decide the candidate for the male and female protagonists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can really talk!", Freena smiled and licked her long hair, revealing her entire shoulder, and she was closer, with Doolin I am afraid that there is only a distance of more than ten centimeters left. "In fact, it is not a protagonist. It is just an inconspicuous supporting role. Even if it is not easy to get it, then what about you? What are you doing now? Or doing it? Previous business?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous business? Of course, it was smuggling private wine. Freena had heard of it before she came to Irian. The prohibition of alcohol is almost abolished here. Those licensed wineries and bars sell an unlimited amount of wine, she thinks Du Lin is taking a fancy to the resources here, taking root and smuggling private wine here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
