			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coliers fainted not at the time, many plans were delayed by him, but fortunately his family was very rational, did not continue to drag with us Going on." Du Lin once again complained that investors have always appeared in front of him in the past few days. It seems that there is a problem of testing the railway, which makes him annoyed. "But today we are not talking about this. Things, but another thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday at 9:30 am, Du Lin faced the management team that the city hall has expanded to 20 people. Arranging this week's work, he can't stand the mechanism and framework of the Imperial City Hall. Since it is the SAR, he has to make appropriate changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From today, I will redefine the original departmental establishment. After referring to the other departments including the establishment of the Imperial Capital, I think a city management. In terms of responsibility and scope, there is a need for strict planning and a sound system. Like this medical education resource office...", Du Lin picked up the file and even opened the desire to throw it on the table, "it is simply Shit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff sitting behind the conference table are a little embarrassed, and it’s not easy for the mayor to swear. These politicians always maintain their positive image day and night, and it is very difficult for them to swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From today on, the management of Otis City will be divided into several departments, and the scope of responsibility of each department is described in detail in the documents before you. This is not a fixed number. In the process of the subsequent development of the city, we will establish more departments and authorities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hite!" Du Lin took the pen in his hand and pointed to Hai Te. Heite immediately straightened his spine. "The first department is the Otis City Police Department. You continue to serve as the director. The traffic problems are also yours. There is a problem. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heite shook his head seriously, "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some People look at Hite’s eyes and hide some indescribable things. Who can think of a foreigner who came to the city of Otis and became the police chief here, more than a month ago and two months ago, many People think that Hite is a display. In the city of Otis, where the degree of autonomy is very high, there is no need for a police profession. Whoever can think of it before and after, the change in this city is so fast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guy who didn’t have any sense of existence has instantly become an object that many forces need to fear and tie up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second department, Otis Medical and Epidemic Prevention Bureau, Thomson, you are responsible for this. I only have one request, I must give me a reply within one week. Whether you are looking for a medical contractor from outside or looking for medical resources through the state, you must have a week in place, is there a problem?", Du Lin looked up at him, what Thomson might have wanted to say, and finally I swallowed my heart back into my stomach and said that there was no problem like Hite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t understand this aspect at all. Originally, he was a tax official. How did he suddenly become the person in charge of this medical and epidemic prevention bureau? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably... is it a promotion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is great! I like to see you have a sense of responsibility and responsibility. It is like a city management, not a roadside stall vendor. So next, Otis City Board of Education, Mr. Edward, you are responsible for this, don't you know if there is any difficulty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Edward is Doolin through A university professor who was recruited by Sha's father did not have any great academic achievements, but he was also a talented person, sociable, and well aware of the deep hidden things in the academic world. Simply put, this is a hybrid of academia. Du Lin dug him up, hoping that he could build the education system in Otis. As for whether he would do anything special, it was not what Du Lin worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this city full of villains, it is not that simple to want to be a bad person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Edward’s instrument, smiling and decapitating, plus his set of formal dresses, gives a very special temperament, "Please believe me, Mr. Mayor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The fourth department, the Environmental Protection Agency of Otis, must maintain the cleanliness of the street and ensure the green coverage in the city. This is a very hard job, like a gardener in the city. Is anyone willing to take it?" Du Lin did not assign the person in charge of this department. One reason is that he does not know who knows about this. Secondly, I hope that someone can stand up more actively and take over the job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he first arrived in Otis, the town hall added several people. In addition to Thomson and Natalie, there were three men and two women who were over fifty years old. It was not in line with Du Lin’s definition of the city. "Young" standard. He hopes that this is a dynamic city. He can tolerate those who are mixed, but it is absolutely impossible to assume the main responsibility. During this time, these people did not take the initiative to take up any responsibility. They still sit in the office and do their own things, or open old newspapers and use it as a nursing home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin doesn't like this kind of person very much. A government staff member can have amazing ability and can be ordinary, but absolutely have a sense of responsibility and mission. It is a pity. They don't have these excellent qualities, so Doolin excludes them from the core power circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This period of time with the construction and expansion of the city hall to absorb some of the new staff, most of them are local young people, not in the city hall Worked in the official body of the agency. They mainly do some idle work, run errands, sort out documents or reception work. In the face of Du Lin's request, in fact, some people are also very tempted, but they don't know if they can do it well. If they have this ability, they will fall into silence in the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, no one seems willing to take on this position. When Doolin frowned, he sat at the end of the conference table, and he stood up. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mayor, I am willing to give it a try." He spoke loudly and looked a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at him and nodded slightly. "Yes, then this one is your responsibility, which is exactly the same as your current job." He said that there was some light laughter in the conference room, and it was hard to say if there was anything else in the laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck came to the city of Otis and at the request of Dove, became a cleaner in the town hall, no one, because the entire city hall is such a Cleaner. Although Buck complained to Duffdo in private, why not give him a good job, but the work is still serious. This is not because he has the right attitude. He is purely afraid of Du Lin. This job is the head of Doolin. He does not dare to complete the quality and quantity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cleaner is the head of a bureau? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old guys who had mixed up showed a scornful smile. They looked at Du Lin’s eyes and they were full of fun. They were convinced that Du Lin would finally understand that if he wanted to manage some details of the city, they still need them. Talents with senior management experience can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand and slammed it twice to let Buck sit down. He continued: "The fire problem is also temporarily responsible for Hite, to find a little understanding of fire protection. People come to set up the fire station, and then report the list to me. The tax bureau will be personally appointed by the Director General of the Prime Minister of Taxation, Rani, and we only need to do a good job of cooperation. In addition, another comprehensive management department will be established. The mayor's secretariat, assist me in managing the city, Natalie, do you have any questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie looked at Du Lin a little dazed, she Immediately aware of what, shaking his lips with his lips tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, in addition, we still need more departments to divide the terms of reference, which will gradually improve in the following days, in my It is envisaged that all aspects of the city will be managed by a special responsible department. The power and scope should be clear and clear, and the problems will not be evaded. This requires everyone's joint efforts. If you have any good ideas, or what new to the departmental system The proposal can come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as your ideas are approved by me, I will give you a chance!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person in charge who just named the name will submit the list of member organizations to me. The funding problem will be directly taught to Natalie, and I will sign the grant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, when it comes to making me interested, for example, what changes have we made in our city last week..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the meeting, Natalie packed up and followed Du Lin and left the meeting. On the way to the mayor's office, Natalie whispered her head and said, "Is this not so good?" Du Lin ignored him. She continued: "I am afraid that others will say that I am passing some..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them say that people are the first to give birth to things that transcend themselves. They will destroy all those who are stronger than themselves, or things. Denied The success of others is equivalent to indirectly raising yourself. After they understand the gap between the two sides, they will know how to be awe. You don’t need to squash the stone like a monk, you will stumble yourself, stepping on the stone is the need for you. Do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
