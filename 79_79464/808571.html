			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are we missing?", Du Lin looked at the local Guar compatriots and turned his eyes to sweep on everyone’s face. Yes, "We are upright, kind, hardworking, honest, we have many virtues, but we lack a blood. When our compatriots are treated unfairly, what we lack is a bloody, a kind of dare to use eggs. The courage to fight hard with the stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not in favor of using eggs to touch the stone to prove our courage, our blood, but if not touch one Touch, how do you know that it is really a stone? Perhaps it is just another 'egg' that looks like a stone we have not seen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" The purpose of bringing these things to you is not only to make everyone's life better, but also to take the opportunity to find our blood and courage. I hope that Mr. Buddy will invite me next time. I am not coming at night, but during the day. I hope There are more cars to pick me up and make the scene more decent. I hope that each of you will wear hundreds of clothes with a confident smile on your face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that when you walk on the street, you will no longer be despised by people, but will bow down to fear you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin He once again reached out and held a tight grip with Budi. "To achieve this goal, work hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soon Du Lin is in Budi Mr. left to leave the city, he still has a lot of places to go, will not stay here for too long, even if one day is not enough. In just over a month, he ran thirteen cities and then came to the most important place in his trip, the city of Montreux, the three most prosperous cities on the East Coast. The city is as prosperous as Irian, and as one of the three deep-water ports of the past, even in winter, there are many tourists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monter is on the southernmost side of the long coastline of the Empire and the closest city to the Union. It was once affected by the war, and most of the city was destroyed by gunfire. After the Great Patriotic War, the New Party seized power. With the encouragement of the New Party, many businessmen funded the reconstruction of the city. As the closest tourist city to the Federation, the atmosphere here is completely different from the north, more open and more free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a city dominated by merchants. Although the City Hall performs its power, it is actually a businessman who controls the city. Some people say that this is a paradise for businessmen. As long as you have money, you can do anything here and buy anything, as long as you have money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than once, the City Hall wanted to intervene to get back its own power, but each time ended in failure. The capitalists used money to rebuild the city, and built the city as perfect as Irian. How could they be so kind and not asking for a contribution to the empire? They hold more than two-thirds of the building's property rights in the city, and 60% of the city's residents are their employees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything that makes them unhappy, there will be a group of workers who are told that they are about to lose their jobs to go to the town hall to demonstrate. For Irian, the possibility of demonstrations is one thing that affects the face and image of the city. However, in Montreux, the demonstrations became one of the “landscapes” of the region. Many tourists heard that they were going to hold demonstrations before they rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, the City Hall also dispelled this idea, at least until they were able to buy the land of the city, before they could be more than 900,000 citizens They can't do anything until they provide jobs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin needs to completely spread his private wine in this place. This area will sell tens of thousands of bottles every month, and even more a little. Once you take a certain market share in this place, it is equivalent to catching a chicken that will lay golden eggs, which is one of his most important places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many times as you did before, it’s just that the place to meet this time is no longer in the dock or in a park, but in a restaurant. This restaurant is just around the corner from Montréal and Third Avenue, a small door that looks more like a hairdresser or other place from the outside. The environment in the restaurant can only be said to be okay, there are seven tables, and when Du Lin comes in, there is no one guest. When he wondered if he was in the wrong place, a slightly fat guy laughed and walked down the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly walked up to Doolin and held out his hands to hold Doolin’s hand, very enthusiastic. The facial features that are not so delicate on the round face are crowded into a pile in his smile. "Welcome welcome. Since receiving your letter, I have been waiting for your visit. Come, let us go upstairs. "It was said that he realized that he had forgotten his introduction and shot his head. "I am Sebble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and introduced himself. Just follow this chubby Sebble on the second floor. The second floor is only half the floor and half a table. There are already a few people standing on the edge of the stairs waiting for Du Lin and his group. After entering the room, they sit down. Sebray let people tell the cook that they can serve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He enthusiastically introduced Du Lin, this restaurant is his industry. His father was called into the army during the Great Patriotic War. Because the dishes were good, they became the chefs of the officers. In the strict sense, they did not go to the front. After the war, the officer was upgraded and left, and his father returned to Montreux, and then opened the restaurant with some money and a few faces accumulated during the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, this restaurant has been the industry of Sebble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because he is doing business, his reputation may not be the highest among the Guars in Montreux, but his reputation is the highest. It's like picking a general in a dwarf, always picking one out. Du Lin thinks that since this guy is doing business, many things don't need to be taught, which can save him a little time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Du Lin, don't know how much wine you brought this time?", a slightly oily fat face flashing a layer of greasy under the light The reflection, Du Lin brow slightly twisted, he always felt a little wrong, but can not tell him anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was alert and silently said: "This time I brought a thousand boxes of wine!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebre took a sigh of relief, that is 12,000 bottles of wine, according to local prices, this batch of wine can sell at least 240,000, and still the wholesale price. If you open the retail, a bottle will have at least 30 yuan, and his eyes will suddenly burn a hot fire, which is an amazing wealth. Sebble, who has been running a small restaurant, was more enthusiastic at the moment, constantly talking about Doolin’s good words, and this made Du Lin gradually discover what was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is that Sebble is too different from the merchants and small capitalists he has seen, and the Guart compatriots he has seen before. I thought that Du Lin understood that the problem was here. He is thinking about whether or not to hand over the goods to Sebble. His market looks unbelievable. He has the ability to take on the responsibility that Du Lin has given him. Now he can temporarily find a prestige among the local Guarts. It’s a bit difficult for people to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this cyber is not as unbearable as he imagined? And he will also leave people here to help Sebble open the market, and stare at this guy by the way. Thinking of Du Lin's lack of motivation to continue this chill with this guy, he said a few words repeated many times, Sai Bray's excited guarantee will lead the local Guar people to the glory, eat a little something Du Lin left six members of the fellowship and left, and he still has a lot to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
