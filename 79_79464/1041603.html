			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otto is back?", Magus bent over and took out the newspaper from the mouth of the hound, and asked while wearing glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the most relaxing time of Magus from 6:30 to 8:30 every morning, and there’s no business that can’t be dealt with forever. With him, there is no need for various departments to mediate, and there is no need to face the distressed diplomatic note application that diplomats have come up with. He can sit in his villa yard, soak a cup of flower tea, let his wife make a pancake for him, and read the newspaper while interacting with Bick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bick is his dog, an old dog, already eleven years old. The life span of dogs is very short, at most 13 years, and they can live up to 20 years old when they meet longevity. This dog, called Bick, has entered the life of an old dog. Its slender kiss has been loosened, and even the teeth wrapped around the lips have begun to loosen. It was a great guy when he was young, and he won great glory for Magus in many hunting games. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bick is a purebred Auxerre, running powerful and extremely fast, with good patience and bite, generally dealing with fifty pounds The following small beast, an Auxerre, is enough to accomplish the task alone. Even if it is more than 50 pounds of prey, three or five Auxerre can complete the hunting. This kind of hound, especially the purebred hound, is expensive, ranging from five hundred to five thousand. This horse, like the horse, is a dog named Bick, who has served Magus's family for at least three hundred years... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, from its ancestors, its family began to serve Magus’s family and has been proliferating to this day, for more than three hundred years. history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bick walked slowly away from Magus's side and walked to a place less than ten meters away from him. It sniffed the pair of shoes that looked familiar with the nose, lazily falling on the lawn and basking in the sun. It recognizes this taste and often appears here, so it does not reveal any aggressive behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar looked down at the old dog at the foot and walked over to Magus. The weather is getting warmer and warmer, and people have taken off their thick coats and walked out of the cold winter. Like animals, everyone is lazy. If you can read a book in the sun in the sun, taste some delicious snacks, sleepy and then sleep in the sun with your eyes open, it must be the most comfortable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He untied the two buttons of the clothes, sat in the chair next to Magus, and took a bite from Magus, a pizza. "He came back in the middle of the night, I let him take a break, wait nine. After the clock, I went to the opposite side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been more than half a month since Otto went to the west. He came back after he handled the things over there. In the west, it seems that everything is ending at an unknown and neglected point in time, and it has come to an abrupt end. After handling the resettlement work of those new immigrants, Otto immediately returned, and he could not find more useful things from the mouth of Mennon, unless the doormen opened up with the means of threatening the threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in such a situation, even if the Mennon speaks, these people may not believe that what he said is true, and always have to verify it. If the doorman mixes one or two people who want to kill but is not a bloody dawn on a large list of real names, the official is equal to the knife in his hand. Although this will not be a cabinet, it will bring any negative impact to the empire - in fact, after all, there will be things like robbery or burglary, and people will still feel that there is no official law and order. The promotion is so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Magus or Otto is not willing to be disgusted by the Mennon, so they wait a little, patiently waiting for the doorman to take the initiative The entire list is sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why there are not many clues to the bloody dawn in the twenty-seventh year of the empire is because this organization is a neuropathy. They are almost completely different from people or organizations like the famous Grand Theft Auto in the same period. Those organizations may be for fame, perhaps for wealth, or perhaps to make a career. These people all have a clear purpose. Every time they hurt the nobility to rob the place, they will strengthen themselves and make themselves stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so many times, try to have enough power to fight against a small area and want to change the pattern of the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the blood is different at dawn, these people are all neurotic, and getting wealth is just an act of incident when they assassinate the nobility. They don’t go for wealth. Assassination of the nobility, some of the wealth that is readily available will not be given to the poor in most, and most of them are still in their hands. They are not assassinating the nobility for their reputation. They are not critical of the target, nor do they have any rules. In general, wherever they go, they will assassinate the local nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not grow their own strength. At the beginning, there were almost forty or fifty people. The ambush was also the last large-scale event of the bloody dawn, that is, fifty or sixty people, or more. They don't care how much power they have in their hands. Even if they assassinate the nobility uprisings of the nobility in the land, it seems to be easy to do, not intentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this group of people is a group of neuropathy, not for money, not for the name, as if it is purely like to assassinate the nobility. This neurotic-like style made the nobility and the royal family at that time unable to do anything about them. There was no law and purpose. There was no place to kill one here, and many traps were arranged. The other party had already gone to the other half of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only flaw they left was the doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman is an Ogdin, a treacherous horse dealer active in the middle of the empire, with information and information about the doorman than anyone in the bloody dawn Much more. For example, he often buys some sick horses and then uses some kind of botanicals to stimulate the active state of these horses, making them look very healthy, and then selling them to others to make a profit. In the past archives, there were more than 70 horse trade fraud cases related to the door farmers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the doorman took the initiative to stand on the table, the empire was paying attention to him and his people. The empire's intelligence agencies believe that there must be a lot of people with bloody dawns under the hands of Mennon, but it is not clear who is and who is not. There is no cooperation with the doormen. Those who are not sure that they are not, those who are sure that they are not. When Hut’s family was killed, he did not admit that he was a member of the bloody dawn. It is obvious that these people are all neuropathic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original idea of ​​Magus is that since Doolin wants to go to the west, he will go to him and let him fight with the doormen, looking at Magus’s eyes. It is definitely not the opponent of Du Lin. After the peasant was ousted by Du Lin, he might not be so angry that he would give Du Lin a black post. As long as he did, then Magus’s plan was successful. It is just unimaginable that Du Lin did not need to do it. The Mennon himself took the initiative to cut off the relationship with the bloody dawn, and devoted himself to the new party camp, completely out of the expectations of Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s just like this. A “self-person” is better than Du Lin’s chaos in the west in the west. Originally he planned to use Du Lin to deal with the Men’s Party. In the growth, now it is necessary to use the doormen and the more pure forward party to restrict the expansion of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he doesn't think how long the Mennon can last. In a year or two, he will almost be dismissed by Du Lin. When the western turmoil was in the midst of the turmoil, Magus’s gaze was always paying attention to the situation in the west. When the problem of the doormen was restricted and free, almost all the big capitalists did not take the initiative to help the doormen to solve the problem, not to mention their powerful forces and Whether the financial resources really can make the doormen escape the accident, but they have not even asked if they even asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door farmers as the most important partners of the western capitalists, their silence made Magus think of Du Lin, Du Lin and these people must agree on what conditions So they chose to watch the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the current situation of the farmer, if he can not pull these capitalists back into their camp, he will soon be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he got the "three guarantees policy", it also includes his direct separation from the bloody dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus considered that if he was the leader of the Scarlet Dawn, what he had to do now was to wipe out a person who knows most of the inside story from this world. Go, especially if he has already been betrayed, and he can't let him live. Magus had reason to believe that the Mennon did not give all the lists, and he must have a more important list in his hand. This list was used as a bargaining chip for the New Party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, he is stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of things between Magus’s thoughts and turns have ended in a matter of seconds. He opened the newspaper and glanced at the headlines. Shake his head and put the newspaper on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His old friend Bara picked up the newspaper and glanced at it. It said that the joint construction is expected to completely penetrate the western mountains of the city of Otis at the end of April. To the complete opening of the car, the city of Otis will usher in a new round of development. There is also a subtitle below the article, which is that the joint construction and the three major projects, including the construction of the Empire's tallest building in the Imperial Southern City and the Imperial Royal Academy of Engineering, and two total lengths of not less than one A thousand kilometers of railway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't like federal people, it used to be, now, and later." Barr threw the newspaper back on the table and looked at Maggs in a hurry. "You should submit a bill prohibiting federal traders from participating in important empire projects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
