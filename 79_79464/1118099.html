			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Du Lin gave him a call to his older brother, Mason, and told him to try to participate in the general election after 18 months, if it was possible, either The mayor or a member of Parliament can try it. There is no problem in this aspect of money. Du Lin has sufficient funds in his hands. It is not a problem to choose a principal official in a marginal city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason has been the director of the Regional Police Department in Tener City for several years. He once had an opportunity to promote. He and Du Lin said this. Du Lin asked him not to agree. The regional police bureau is considered to be the highest-ranking policeman in the “police” industry. It is either administrative or transferred to various investigation bureaus as the leader of a group or the highest chief of an office. For a person who wants to climb up, they can accept this promotion, but Du Lin does not want Mason to take this step, saying that it is promotion, in fact, the power is severely cut, and maybe there will be life when Danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the regional police chief, it has more power, and it has jurisdiction over the security problems of the entire city, and it has more social contacts and more resources. There are more relationships, so not every regional police chief is willing to be promoted. Because they still have a second way to go, it is the most crucial step in the election, and they go directly to the political stage of Gao Guang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who have worked with Mason in the Tener area over the past few years, no matter how many people he has dealt with, whether it is a gang gangster or a mayor The social elite has a bit of friendship. Under Dolin's wealth blessing, plus the votes of the Guarts, there is no chance that the position of the mayor will be affected. Du Lin also felt that the possibility was very big. After all, the police station, as a regional violent organ, always had some secrets that could not be said. In order to maintain this secret, it was always a secret, and some people would make compromises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brothers said for a while, Mason agreed with Doolin’s request, and he knew that this was something he had to go through. He can't be the head of the police station for a lifetime, or his boss, the boss's boss, the mayor or the governor, will not let an official have too much influence in a certain area but do nothing. When the influence of a lower-level official exceeds that of the highest local chief executive, there will always be big problems. In order to stabilize, Mason will definitely be transferred. Even if he is unwilling to promote his promotion, he will transfer to other regions. Director of the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this step is only a matter of morning and evening! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this plan, Du Lin has a request, that is, at least 20 cities, votes, mayors, or members of parliament. The number of elections in the next ten years will have to double. At least forty cities and even 50 cities will be included in his system. This process can be very difficult and face many struggles, but he, And everyone is ready, always ready to contribute to the ideal and the pursuit of all the realization! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hesman is already waiting for him after returning to the West. He formed a seven-person campaign team and signed a supplement with Du Lin. According to the agreement, the wages of the working group personnel will be raised to 1.2 million, with an average salary of 200,000 per person. Therefore, many well-known politicians will form a similar campaign team after retirement, or lead a team, often two or three years of income can top the income of the previous middle class for a hundred years, the work is not very complicated, very Suitable for politicians who want to continue to play the heat after leaving the political arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team formed by Hellsmann has two politicians who have served as governors, a policy researcher, a sociologist, and two nobility. Members - This is the turning point that Magus has only appeared after Doolin's pimp. Since Du Lin is willing to participate in the game according to the rules of the game, all the players present will welcome his entry and begin to accept him. His arrival will only make the aristocratic class more full, and there will never be anything outside the plan. The nobles have this confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the table is not only the privilege of the mud dog legs, but the nobles will also lick the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in addition to these people, there are a large group of peripheral members who are all working with money. They are not core and do not need to establish with Du Lin. Working relations. For example, the staff who posted the posters, they have an egg and shake hands with Du Lin and sit cordially to talk about the election? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the team is about to start working, and for this team Du Lin deliberately purchased another manor, right next to the manor he now lives in. Originally, this manor had a master, a slightly famous mine owner. When he learned that Du Lin intended to buy another manor or villa nearby, he immediately gave his estate to Doolin. For the mine owners, a manor of more than ten thousand and two hundred thousand may not be worth the money, and making Du Lin is more valuable for investment. Du Lin was very grateful for this and bought the property rights of the manor with a symbolic piece of money and paid a tax of 17 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the new manor was repaired and briefly refurbished, Doolin took part in the first team meeting in a huge conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hellman sat in the first place, he looked at his team members and nodded with satisfaction. Everyone has a big role. At the beginning, this team only has him alone, but as long as you work hard, you can develop more team members, and the fact is true. After a moment of deliberation, he said to everyone, "I believe that you all understand why we are sitting here today. We will help Mr. Doolin to participate in the election of the three western states in the next 17 months. Work, to help him to achieve this goal and plan to the maximum extent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the nod, Hersman asked, "Mr. Doolin, your new party Did the committee approve it?” Du Lin nodded. He is now a member of the New Party. In the case of Margots’s greeting, there was no block at the committee. He submitted the application less than forty minutes before the chairman. Mr. signed the application and re-added the personal file he had sealed to the order of the members of the party. Hellsmann looked at another person. "Let your people collect the ingredients and positions of the residents of the three western states, as well as social issues. We need the most accurate figures, accurate to every household in every community." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Party and the Old Party have their own audiences in the public, and they can get more votes in cities with more audiences. This is also the basis of the campaign. In the three western states, which state has the most supporters of the New Party, then in which state Doolin will stand for election, the maximum avoidance is missed because of the wrong place. All of this is to spend money and spend a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there will be hundreds of people doing support rate census work for millions of people, just knocking on the door and filling out the form and in the process Leading these people to Du Lin, it will cost a lot of money. The common way is to give a small gift. For example, the easiest thing is to send a pen. A beautiful ordinary pen takes about forty-nine points. Every time you survey a family, the investigator will use the surveyed people after completing the questionnaire. The pen was given to him, and many politicians are using this little trick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much money... well, if there are one million households to investigate, Du Lin will need to pay 490,000 for this. In addition to the cost of printing the questionnaire, just filling out the questionnaire and giving the pen, Du Lin has already spent about 600,000 campaign funds. Therefore, the campaign is always a game of spending money. How much it costs, how to spend it is very important to the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
