			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer is very aware of his own situation, and he has a huge suspicion. If he can’t explain why Matthew’s death has nothing to do with him, then For the time being, he will lose control of the sphere of influence of the city and the entire western region. There is no telephone, no way to contact the outside world. The Kadima Party, which has just separated from the bloody dawn, will become a little chicken with no sense of direction and become the most vulnerable party in this riot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was biting his teeth at this time and forced himself to calm down, looking at the officers in front of him and the commander of the temporary headquarters, slightly lowering his head and facing them. At the foot, "I will say again, Du Lin lied. He deceived you and deceived me. He deceived everyone!", Mennon’s face turned red like he just came out of the steamer, and it was hot and red. The skin was tight, and his hands clenched into fists, hitting the table with force. "This bitch raised me and told me I hope I can speak for him. By the way, I can resolve the dispute between him and the West Mine. Yes, I am sure. I did listen to him. I only found Matthew, otherwise I didn't know Matthew at all, and there was no reason to kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" By the way, Du Lin was stabbed by himself. He himself staged an illusion of being assassinated and deceived us all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing The commander on the side shook his head. He said something beside the officer’s ear, then turned around. Open. In his opinion, the farmer did have a great suspicion, but he could not be completely sure that the peasant did it. The commander was only a lieutenant colonel. However, in the western military region, he is most likely to be promoted to the colonel in recent years. The candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many people use to improve their status and character - my status, my character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is also suitable for bringing into the current case, with the power of the doorkeeper - he has a great chance of winning one in the next general election The position of the governor, the status of the farmer - as a celebrity, a party leader, the light of the west, has a huge amount of wealth, he does not have the right and necessary motivation to kill Matthew, because Matthew does not cause him He can't bear the damage. Even if Matthew and Doolin get angry, Matthew knows that the doorman is composing a story to provoke the conflict between the West Mine and Du Lin, and the Mennon has no reason to kill Matthew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the West Mine is on the “weak” side, the Mennon is the strong person, even if the West Mine will face his conflict, he is not necessarily It is the one who lost. Therefore, from the current point of view, the suspicion of the Mennon is the most direct and largest, but it is not enough for everyone to confirm that the Mennon is planning the behind-the-scenes murder of Matthew’s murder. It also requires a large amount of evidence and counter-evidence to provide a fulcrum. Inciting conclusions on either side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before the conclusion, the Mennon was not suitable for the first time, for two reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that the doorman is behind the scenes of the murder. Once he is allowed to leave, he can organize his own powerful forces to forge enough for himself. There is more evidence to prove that he is not involved. Many mayors and celebrities will be willing to testify for him in exchange for benefits. Once he was allowed to leave the temporary headquarters, the difficulty of getting him back would be multiplied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the doorman is not behind the murder, the planner has another person, then the doorman once he leaves the temporary headquarters, May be in danger. He can leave here to show that he has eluted his suspicion. For the behind-the-scenes black hand, the value of the peasant has been lost. A person who loses value and has the ability to fight back, the other party will definitely try to put him in everything possible. Give it a break and don't give him any chance of revenge. In order to ensure that the doorman will not be assassinated, the commander temporarily detained him here, which is also to protect him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Mennon, Duulin’s attack was a scam by Doolin’s own director. The Lieutenant Colonel and the main investigators just smiled. Not taken seriously, not even in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s injuries They have been thoroughly understood through the photo records and transcripts of the time, as the doctors who worked for Du Lin said, if at the time Lin’s head was a little more than a centimeter, and the bullet would penetrate his skull and let him die. He couldn’t die anymore, maybe there was already a grass in front of his tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you spend so much money on a scam? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, but definitely not a person like Doolin. He has enormous political resources and holds countless wealth in his hands. Whether he can establish his business in the west, he is a successful person, a small group at the top of the tower. Even if such a person loses a hair, it is more expensive than the life of an ordinary person. Let him risk the almost mortal death to play this scene? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible, totally impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They regard the Mennon’s statement as a dog biting his dog in a hurry, and only those who are irrational will think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think...there is a possibility!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military’s news was fed back to the “common commander” Amp, who was temporarily seconded by the Security Council, immediately The information he possessed was analyzed. After analysis, he thought that Du Lin could definitely make such crazy things, but this is definitely not an isolated incident. If Du Lin’s attack is a self-directed scam, then Roel’s attack and the attack of the Mennon, and the scams of the Western Mines Executive Committee and some mine owners are the scams? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the idea of ​​the Mennon, Amp has come to a conclusion similar to that of the Mennon. If Du Lin is really deceiving, then the Mennon Also deceiving, Roel is also deceiving! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those who are really dead are not deceiving, but is this really possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Amp gave an uncertain statement - it is possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be “yes” or “no” if it does not mean that he needs more information and evidence to support his point of view. He gathered the information on the table and tied it with a cowhide belt and placed it on the corner of the table. He looked at the vice chairman of the Security Committee in front of him and said, "Now we need to do a few things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice-Chairman hugged his arms in his arms and he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, the arranger stares at Roel and finds out whether the funds invested by Mennon in the Roel account are fully compensated to all the victims. The family, let the central bank and the people of the Southern Commercial Bank check whether there are about 1.5 million to 2.2 million in the short-term category from multiple accounts into a single account. Yes, freeze these accounts and then arrest Roel.” There are some other security committee members in the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, Amp has used his ability to make these people convinced at least with his mouth. In the face of his request, although everyone is reluctant, but look at the vice The Chairman, Mr. Chairman, nodded and promised without any comments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp nodded. "I suspect that the Roel people made a mine disaster, and then defrauded the insurance premium from the 'three guarantees policy' promoted by the Kadima Party, even at the expense of This self-directed self-acting attack has disrupted the normal order of the entire western region." Then Anpu pointed out what he thought might be doubtful and evidence, including Roel’s current economic problems, his investment failed. And the purpose of his doing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the law of the empire, once a person has been determined to have complete and reasonable motives and goals, then this person can be regarded as a suspect and then handed over to the local prosecutor's office for presumption of innocence. Now Anpu gives Roel's motives and goals, and even gives several specific possible means to capture Roel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the military. The military does not have to have the exact evidence to arrest people like the local prosecutor’s office. They can grab the people first and then look for evidence. This is why people are afraid of military control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts know that they will be caught for some reason that may make them uncomfortable, and then wait in the cell for a long guilty presumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second, send people to stare at Doolin, if the Mennon is true, then Du Lin will soon be up. He passed The assassination of the injury has eclipsed the eyes of the first stage people. Now the death of the important person is dead, the customs are closed, and then it is time for him to start acting. I ask those you send not to be discovered by him, not to be lost by him. It is best to let him not leave his sight, and not lower than the two groups of people taking turns to face him, and once he is in danger of endangering his life, he will immediately retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the security committee in the room nodded their heads with no expression, but in their hearts they did not put Amp's words in their hearts. But how much difficulty can it be to track and stalk? As for the danger of life? Whenever they are in danger, they will be safe and sound as long as they reveal their identity. The Security Council is an official semi-military organization with considerable power. Even if the reasons are sufficient, it is not a big problem to directly kill suspects who believe that it may threaten national security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracking Doolin is not a problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third, keep an eye on the remaining executives of the West Mine, record where they went every day, who they met, and better to figure them out If you have been attacked, I hope that you can help a little, if you can guarantee your own safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fourth, The bank needs to go to two people to check whether there is any large-scale capital flow in the account under the name of Doolin, and what kind of money has flowed into the account..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Finally, I hope that all field personnel will wear bullet-proof vests and wear hats or bullet-proof helmets with certain anti-ballistic performance when performing their duties. None of the people you are tracking this time are ordinary people, their degree of danger. It is much higher than you have seen before!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
