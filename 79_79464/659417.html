			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Freena, Du Lin just sat down, the seats were not hot, Ernst didn’t know when he was sitting next to him,” The woman is not as simple as the surface, try not to have deep contact with her." He handed Du Lin a cigarette, and Du Lin also took over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the eyes of everyone, Du Lin should be inseparable from Ernst, and I can’t wait to kill each other to occupy more private city of Tener. The wine market, but for Ernst's initiative to sit around Du Lin and hand the smoke, there is no such thing as strange. This is the upper class, which is the demeanor that the upper class elites should show when they socialize. To put it simply, you obviously want to use a knife to kill the person in front of you, but at this time, you must treat each other as your good friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in this way can we reflect the distortion of the mainstream values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it’s very different, in short, it’s right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out the lighter for Ernst and then gave it to himself. The two of them added Karur’s fight in the city of Tener. Although they still kept restraint and did not directly use force, they have become vicious in price competition. The wholesale price of each private wine has dropped by one or two. Thinning the profits, in the eyes of people, they are not far from the blood. However, people do not know that in the external expansion, the three have already taken away the dividends far higher than the profits of the local private liquor market from the private liquor market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in addition to letting everyone see that they are "fighting" in each other, they also started to flow into Tyne with foreign wines. There are relationships. The influx of private liquor in the field is not only as simple as the first love is re-enacted, perhaps their behavior awakens those private liquor dealers who are still satisfied with the local market, and the private liquor dealers within the various spheres of influence have begun to go outward. expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of foreign private liquor has begun to flow into Tener, in order to maintain the local market, price war is a must. The three private wines that took turns in the price cuts were caught off guard. They originally wanted to come in and compete for the market, but did not expect the market of Ternell to be terrible. Except for a handful of high-quality private wines that are still fighting for high-end consumers, those low-end and low-end have all left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can't afford to play, the cost of transportation makes their cost much higher than the local private liquor dealers, and the price war broke out, they simply don't have it. Competitiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, before the private liquor dealers in other cities have not been as close together as they are to form a similar business alliance, they face the same price or even a little lower, but the quality of the foreign wine is not broken. . This made the city's current private wine giants make a lot of money, even the smallest part of Karur's face showed a lot of smiles, and people around him can make a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the harmony between the two is not pretending, it is true harmony! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the direction of the girl’s departure, spit a smog, and raised her eyebrows and asked: “What? Is there any interesting argument?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst nodded, tilted his legs and said it in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freina is not a simple girl, she knows that the theater’s dean is coveting her youth and beauty, or trying to provoke two tycoons for her. I am jealous with the dean. But unfortunately, she did not get the freedom she wanted, because the two tycoons have become one of the history of the city of Tener, because of all kinds of accidental bankruptcy and finally committed suicide. But this girl is still doing this. The purpose of her doing it is to say that it is the same thing. She hopes that there will be a "warrior" who can defeat the "Devil" and save herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she never thought about what would happen if the Warrior couldn’t beat the Devil... Yes, she would try to find the next Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin listened to Ernst’s commentary and screamed, and laughed, and could stand on this occasion, really no One is simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst saw him understand and then patted his arm and then got up and left. His seat is in the fourth row, not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a half-hour chill, people finally returned to their seats, and the charity gala was held. The host of the party was the director of the Tenel City Education Bureau, which is in charge of Imperial Citizenship Education in the city of Tener. It is said that during the mid-term elections, the New Party will launch an administrative reform and refinement of the administrative organization, and the name of some administrative agencies will also change. But for now, this pair of gold-rimmed glasses, white hair, a face of a very politician old man, is still the city's director of education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed a little, and the hall immediately calmed down. The old man described some very old-fashioned words that were recognized by mainstream values. The false positives advocated that more people would pay attention to the education industry, and then Rory. It has been said that the education problem in the city of Tener has changed tremendously in recent years with the attention and support of many tycoons and celebrities. At the same time, it reminded all the guests that 30% of the fundraising amount will be transferred to the Education Bureau's account as an education fund to provide more “cheap” education and more knowledge for the public. Popularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin was sitting in the Grand Theatre to participate in this actually boring charity auction, outside the Grand Theatre, the eyes of the bucket lost Focus, a car wash with a sudden look suddenly a spirit, he remembered who the familiar back is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the young man who is so diligent that they can’t stand it. It’s obvious that you can get rid of the dust on the car body and you can get it. He has to clean the vehicle more seriously, and they have to work harder to earn the same salary as before. It was because this kid broke the rules here that he told the mad dog about it and caused a conflict between him and the mad dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he just works in it, the car is not his, he is helping others to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin is so explained for everything he sees, because there is no reason to explain it. More than three months and four months ago, he still needs to rely on his strength. A guy who earns a modest income can afford to buy a car after such a short period of time. To know that the car is worth at least 2,800, it is definitely not affordable for their class. I have never thought of this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand eight hundred? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on his face has changed a little. In fact, there is not much hatred between him and this kid, except for his bad business in those days. There is no substantive conflict between the two. But the mad dog said that whoever can provide the news of this kid will take out five yuan as a reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five dollars are not too small. You can make a lot of money by washing a car. You can wash three or five cars a day, and that’s why everyone works on car wash. The reason for "constrained attitude". Because most of the time when the car wash is in the evening, and not every car owner has strict strictness on the appearance of the car, sometimes there may be no business in one day. Therefore, in the shortest time, washing the car in hand to compete for more business is a skill that every car washman must master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five dollars, for him, is half a month's income, and it is still the kind of luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His throat slipped up and down involuntarily, and he knew exactly what would happen if the kid was caught by a mad dog, to be honest, between them There is no deep hatred, except for the resentment that even the disgust can not be talked about in a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But... that is five dollars after all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and placed the bucket and other tools under the lamppost, and other companions would look at him for him, forcing the five-dollar hard-won desire He made a decision contrary to his intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to find a mad dog and get the five dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe someone will be injured or even die because of this five dollars, but it has nothing to do with him, isn’t it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin in the Grand Theatre did not know that the short-lived appearance caught the attention of others. After sitting for half an hour, he finally ushered in this charity auction. The second half of the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of the story is mostly donated by some tycoons. These things may be worth a little money, but it doesn't make sense to grab these things. According to the unspoken rules of charity auctions, the things donated by these tycoons will be taken back by them at a moderate price, except that others like to compete. After the general owner’s mouth is opened, everyone will give up. This is here. Game rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the auctions in the second half are different. Most of these donations come from celebrities in the city of Tener and the rules-makers in the city of Tener. . They even come up with something that is worthless, and often can shoot a very high price. Are the rich and tycoons brains bad? Of course not, in this way they can enhance the relationship with celebrities and officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first auction item in the second half comes from one of the two councillors in the city of Tener. It is a potted pot that looks a bit inexplicable. What is famous, it is not like something, but it is such a thing that is not something. The first offer of an appearance has already surpassed the final drop price of all previous donations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hundred!", the young staff of the Grand Theatre waved their hammers with high emotions. "This respectable gentleman is willing to get three hundred pieces to get this full." The wilderness and natural potted plants, and people have higher prices?", the staff once again showed a full range of flowerpots filled with grass everywhere, to the art of Doolin, he looked It is inevitable that nothing related to art is produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
