			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunkard sergeant in Zizhen Town echoed the old wife’s impatient noise and the sound of the pot. He opened his sleepy eyes, reached out and grabbed the corner of the curtain, and the sky outside the house was still dark. He didn't know if it was still not bright in the morning, or there was some time in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the throat is dry, it is like something is tearing his throat, he screams uncomfortably, spins up from the bed, wears I put on slippers. I opened a dim bedside lamp and looked down at the clock on the bedside table. It is now at 12 o'clock in the evening. After watching it for more than twenty seconds, he took the clock and tightened the clock for it. The clock ticking again and again fulfilled his duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirsty, headache, this is the drawbacks of cheap private wine, he stood up with his hands on the bed, went to the table and took The cup looked up, but did not pour out even a drop of water. There was a violent thing in his gray scorpion spreading, and the old wife's jealousy and dissatisfaction complained that his head hurts more, and the sound of the pot-and-pot collision was simply unbearable. He gasped and rushed out of the bedroom with a shotgun hanging across the wall of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not an ornament, but the owner of the room treated the two shotguns as decorations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kitchen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toilet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sheriff walked into the living room, he saw a figure standing in the corner, he pulled the trigger without hesitation, and the bullet whirled The muzzle flew out and also led to a small piece of white mist. With a bang, something was shattered, and the figure slowly fell to the floor against the wall. The shackles and complaints in the ear disappeared in a flash, and the whole person seemed to return to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff swayed and walked over, subconsciously talking about some incomprehensible words. He walked to the front of the figure and touched the bullet. The floor, alert to look elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will find you!", the sheriff coughed, "I swear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the kitchen, including the faucet to unscrew the switch, one With a touch of water pouring into his mouth, he sipped in greed, until he was full, and then he returned to the bedroom and threw himself into the bed again, into a drowsy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight shines through the window, on the cupboard in the living room, a black and white photo frame has a woman who looks very gentle, facing all Her people are smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the curtains that he pulled open in the middle of the night could not stop the power of the sun, and in the glare of the sheriff, the sheriff raised his hand to block the sun. Slowly awaken. His brain was blank, he glanced at the shotgun in his hand and turned and hung it on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a very serious illness, but only a few people know that many people think that he is an alcoholic drunk and will never wake up. But only those who know him know that he just uses alcohol as a medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the face, the big eyes of the beans are hurting on his cheeks, and they walked to the mirror in the closet with no expression, and they changed very seriously. The police uniform representing justice and justice, wearing a badge, and after paying a very standard ceremony in the mirror, left the bedroom and left home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving home, he has not forgotten to take a bottle of private wine from the table, which is the kind of family brewing, the degree is lower than ordinary The wine is a little higher, and it is lower than the private wines of the big factories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rude bite opened the lid and filled a big mouth. When he was ready to go out, he was squeezed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, who is this, Mr. Kesma!", the sheriff’s emphasis is a bit high, and the surprise in his eyes flashes away, replaced by a Kind of deep defense. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Xerma’s face is not as ridiculous as the artist’s sculptures, and even the slight trembling has not happened. He took off his own round hat and placed it on the hanger. After patrolling the room, he shook his head and walked to the dirty rattan chair in the living room. He turned everything to the ground and then sat. Go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing here?" The sheriff put the wine back on the table and sat facelessly on the opposite side of Mr. Kesma. "Are you forgetting the agreement between us, if it is not the face of life and death?" At the juncture, none of us will take the initiative to contact others!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma actually shrugged his shoulders, it was incredible, but even more incredible is that he shouted There is a name that does not exist in the town, "Watt..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up, that's not my name!", the sheriff's anger I have already made an offensive stance. After seeing Mr. Kesma’s calm eyes, the whole person has become stiff and sat back. “No, I am not Walter, no such person, please call me. The name 'Johnson', Mr. Kesma!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma escaped from his pocket with a delicate metal box and took two cigarettes. One was on his mouth and the other was thrown to "Johnson." He took out a beautiful sterling silver lighter, lit a cigarette for himself, and then looked at Johnson with a slight chin. If it is a stranger, it may be irritated by Mr. Zema's attitude at this time, at least not too happy. But Johnson knows that this is a way for Mr. Zema to express his vanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a few decades ago, he was like this, showing off everything he had in this annoying way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you have a good son, you know it in the whole town, but what about it?", Johnson took over from Mr. Kesma. The lighter lit the cigarette for himself, took a deep breath and played with the sterling silver lighter in his hand. "This has nothing to do with me. Listen, I don't want to get into trouble, but I don't want to be troubled. Do you understand?" Br /> /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kema spit a faint smog, played a ash, and the white ash of the snow fell on the ground, cracked into several petals after the impact, followed by the door The wind coming from the wind blows away. He said calmly and indifferently as before: "We are friends!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Kesma said this, the body of Sheriff Johnson Obviously trembling, this sentence once became a nightmare for people, often let those who heard this sentence can not sleep peacefully. But it is obvious that today he is not listening to this sentence, the voice, as a party of "justice". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
