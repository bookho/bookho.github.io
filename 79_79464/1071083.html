			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Commercial Bank’s site is in the South, and there is also a system in the Imperial City that is second only to the branch of the head office. Perito is also in the capital. Just in this branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before many people are afraid of the three-guarantee policy, this obvious policy of losing money ignores the actual benefits that the insurance business can make, when the two represented by Berito and Taylor When the big bank noticed that each other was looking at it, the two major economists, financial experts, including some well-known professors in academia, began to participate in the analysis and summary of the insurance business. They also built Fewer mathematical and economic models to verify the results of their analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are very gratifying. It seems that all students who participate in tuition insurance are likely to go to college. For this reason, they may have collected less than two hundred for many years. The insurance costs, but these insured people pay a thousand tuition fees when they go to college. This is obviously a very uneconomical business from the digital point of view, indicating a huge loss. In the same way, like other insurance businesses, such as medical and accident insurance, the insured's annual expenditure of twenty or thirty dollars is not much, but once they enter the hospital, it is a huge amount of compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a few hundred to a few thousand, this is why many people are not optimistic about the three insurance policy and the insurance industry at that time, because the uncontrollable risk is really Too big, a big one can make a strong company become a past tense overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the mathematician's algorithm, this is indeed very dangerous, but if you bring these numbers into the economic environment, it seems less horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentleman had a ten-dollar deposit twenty years ago, enough for him to buy a house in a slightly backward city, but he saved the money Into the bank to save up, ready to buy a house for his son or grandson when he grows up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years later, the money has been turned into interest in the bank for forty dollars, four times, on average every five years. Doubled. But now forty dollars, don't say buying a house, it is enough for a family to live for a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this happening? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of commodity circulation and the economic environment, the rate of currency depreciation will continue to reduce the real value of currency denominations at a very stable rate until one A ten-dollar denomination of banknotes is equivalent to a piece of money in the past, even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some things will not change with the depreciation of the currency, that is the value of the commodity itself. It took only two cents to buy a bread ten years ago. It takes twenty to buy a bread today ten years later. The value of bread has not changed, but the value of money has changed. In the economic model, if you use the current money to buy something that can “preserve”, you will get more “banknotes” after many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not the case, it will not bring any benefits beyond the expectations of the insurance business, so the insurance company, or the current two economic think tanks in the line After many days and nights, I finally found the key to open the key to the wealth gate - the agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement will take effect from the first second of the insured’s payment of insurance fees. In this agreement, the insurance company will use the “now look” The very affordable content, so that the insured thinks that the insurance they bought is worthwhile, as long as they buy themselves to make a big profit, after all, the agreement is written in black on the black background, and in the event of any situation on the policy, they will compensate Compensation ranging from fifty dollars to five thousand dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they counted from the first premium to the final payment, they may only need to pay less than 50 bucks, but they change It is a huge profit to come up with a return of 100 times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you put this policy in ten years or more, even if the insured has an accident on the policy that needs to be settled, or triggered When any compensation agreement is reached, they will find that the insurance that they have earned in the past is actually getting ridiculous. Even if they get the highest standard of 5,000 yuan in the agreement, maybe 5,000 may be connected at this time. A coffin cover can't afford it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the insurance company earning it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly earned them. After they got the premium, they immediately exchanged the currency that represents purchasing power, that is, the currency directly into the actual commodity, that is, the purchasing power. This kind of behavior can be seen as an investment. Except for those who fail, these investments will not only depreciate but will continue to appreciate, and will be polarized with the currency that is constantly depreciating. Ten years later, the same currency has been cut down by various willingness to buy power, such as depreciation and inflation, but they have already cashed their purchasing power ten years ago. Their profits are higher than losses, and they have won hippie love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they need to pay the insurance that needs to be settled, they pay the insured not the purchasing power that was cashed in the year, but the currency that has been seriously devalued. In the past, the money was equal to 100 times the premium, but now they It may be worth a premium, or even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the redemption of purchasing power in the second year, the cashing in the third year...so the two big lines conclude that the insurance company will definitely make money. And still make big money, much more than the bank earned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the two major banks attach great importance to the insurance business, and the entire active participation of Perito, even the bank’s shareholders who opened up the insurance business, was sent by them. Emperor, continue to close the door of this diamond mine with Taylor, and not let the money belonging to them be taken away by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the approval of the General Chamber of Commerce, not only did the Imperial Bank have a copy, but Perito also had a copy here. He breathed a sigh of relief after reading all the approvals, and it was settled. Although there have been many accidents in this process, for example, Du Lin snapped up the insurance policies, for example, the local indigenous rich people in the West also participated in the purchase of insurance policies. For example, even the Imperial Central Bank participated in the business practice of dividing the victory cake, but In the end he still won - part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has already made him very satisfied. The looting of food from the mouth of the imperial central bank has made him soar in South Commercial Bank. Many people think this is very One thing to raise your breath. Now they also know that before the Belitto did not get the news, in fact, the imperialist central bank has already reached a series of transactions with the cabinet, going to the west to prepare for the big troubles left by the doormen, they are the "third party". This is a great victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the approval has come down, the process of going is still to go. The first step is to determine the organization and membership of the self-regulatory committee, and then the association will be The facts are released from all walks of life, and then you can find Du Lin to talk about repurchasing his policy. They are not worried that Doolin will not nod because he does not have the standard to enter the insurance industry. Even if he has it, his standards are not standard enough under the intervention of the insurance industry self-regulatory committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two major banks held the inaugural meeting of the Insurance Industry Self-Regulatory Committee on the third floor of the Peace Hotel, a highly political and commercial hotel. In addition to Perito and Taylor and the seven retail investors, there are also some “enthusiastic people” from the society, such as the people of the South Commercial Bank and the people of the Imperial Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an important meeting should of course be held in high standards. The preparatory team of the committee not only covered the entire three floors, but also invited nearly 100 journalists and newspapers, as well as some real "enthusiastic people" from all walks of life to join. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still fifteen minutes of meetings to be held, and you see what is missing." Taylor stood on the podium of the conference hall and watched The next row of seats and the name card, asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belitto stood by his side, he shook his head and smiled and extended his hand to Taylor. "I think it is perfect, congratulations." Mr. Taylor, I heard that the Central Bank Board of Directors nominated you as the first executive director of the insurance company?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor’s mouth was slightly picked up, which scratched his At the itch, he did not expect the council to give him such a large stage and power. This is indeed the happiest time of his recent few days. I can't wait for everyone to ask once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded with a modest and subtle smile. "In the future, you still need your cooperation with Mr. Berito."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belito also smiled and said a few good words, cooperate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coordination is impossible, and it is impossible to cooperate in this life. The South Bank and the Imperial Bank are always two hostile camps, saying that the battle may be more pleasing. some. At the same time, Doolin stood in front of the first villa on the first avenue of the Empire and smiled and said goodbye to the wife of Magus. A small gift box for pizza. Although Magus did not say that the pizza is not good, the lady who often found the "corpse" of the pizza from the trash can already know that Magus was not interested in the pizza. A woman, especially a woman like her, is actually not suitable for doing anything, because no matter what she does, she will be considered that this may be the signal of the release of Magus, she can only stay at home quietly, even socializing. Must be reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only fun she has now is cooking, giving some snacks to her loved ones or visitors to taste. She is the young man who likes to eat their own pizza. Du Lin likes it very much, it is like getting affirmation from others in his career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Du Lin also took the initiative to ask for some crepes to leave, so that the wife of Magus was very happy, and personally sent him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
