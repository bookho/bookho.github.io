			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Heidler...", Du Lin looked at him in a sitting position, his eyes filled with sarcasm. "You may not know me very well." I don't know enough about the Guartes. Of course, this does not blame you. After all, you are no longer a Guar. How do they call Mr. Heidler?" He leaned his head and looked at the Buddha. , "What is it called?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousands of fruits, boss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of layers It is a fruit that is only found in the tropics. With the recovery of the empire, domestic and foreign trade has begun to recover, and some things that have stopped importing in the past have begun to be re-imported. The continuous increase in people's spending power indicates that spring comes in all industries, and some non-essential items that are purely for people's enjoyment have begun to reappear on the shelves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layer of fruit is brown after maturity, and there will be a layer of white coat after tearing, with yellow flesh inside. People use the brown skin to describe the color of the Guar people. The white gold and gold are the main hair color of the Ogildinians. The Guarts call the traitors such as Heidler who are in the high position in society. Melaleuca. On the one hand, they describe them as gults through simple color comparisons. In fact, they are already Ogildinians in the bones. Another way is that they hide their selfishness under the unpretentious surface. There is another layer on the ground floor, and there is a layer that has been opened. You can never see their hearts (referring to treason)! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using thousands of fruits to refer to some people’s way of speaking is quickly spread among the Guarts. This is a very vivid statement. One person will not forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler smiled disdainfully against Du Lin’s accusation. He did not counterattack. Such accusations have not known how many times he has experienced in the past few years. Although many people are accusing Heidler, Heidler feels that he has not done anything wrong. If you have to say who is doing wrong, then what is wrong is his father, but definitely not him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formally because of his existence, the guar people in his area in these years have lived better than other places, he will help The poor will use the power in their hands to fish out the Guars in prison, and give the poor families a job that can be adequate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is harmless to the entire group of gualts, but there is still a lot of help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin shrugged his shoulders and did not care about Heidler's reaction. "After all, Mr. Heidler is born in such a wealthy family, you may not know much about the real environment of the Guar people, so you take you Imagine being treated as a fact, and you will never see the true truth." He raised his hand and glanced at the watch. "Okay, sir, I have a date in the morning, I don't want to delay here for too long!", After he finished looking at the Buddha, they all slashed the knife at Heidele's neck, and the old man fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin went to Heidele and looked at the place where he was hit by Buddha. He curiously said, "I will not learn this trick, I You only hurt or kill people. How did you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foshan thought for a moment and replied, "I don't know, this Someone taught me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, don't say this, drag him to the bathroom, we should work too!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peeling sheepskin is not an easy job. The first thing to face is psychological endurance. It’s like some animals can’t be injured, their eyes are closed, they are shouting, but they can be happy. Those who have leg of lamb drinking deer blood must not do this, and they need some professional medical knowledge, such as how to stop bleeding, to ensure that the object will not die before it hangs up and dried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the test of skilled knife skills, there will be a layer of fascia-like between the skin and the meat, you need to use the sharp edge on one side The skin is pulled outwards and cut along the fascia between the epidermis and the muscle tissue to ensure that the skin is intact without damaging the muscle tissue<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the Buddha has already stripped more than one skin. He is very familiar with these things. With the help of the Buddha, it took more than an hour, and Du Lin just pulled the whole skin down. He took off the disposable raincoat, took off the gloves used for the operation, rinsed it to dispel the strange smell of the body, and did not look at the ground like a peeled red flaming dragon. Heidler, calmly put on his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let people hang him above the gate, everyone else will handle it!", he put his neckline in the mirror to make sure the neckline is not stained There is no wrinkle. "Can you see my collar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha who is stopping the blood for Heidele raised his arm and wiped his face. Sweat, then carefully looked at it for a while, nodded and said, "very good, perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked out of the house wearing leather shoes. Every step down and lifted up, there will be a squeak of water, and a pair of bright red footprints will continue to extend. From today, this is a new world, and he has also achieved what people expect. Something, punish those who have betrayed the people and betrayed the country! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the major newspapers were given passwords by some people, and it is forbidden to report any news about the hoisting of the rich, although it is not certain that this order is From wherever they come, everyone is obeying, because the people who shut them up, they can't afford to offend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs knows this, after all, more than 30 well-known or unknown public figures have died overnight, not a small case. However, Marcos has pressed this matter down, and there is no opinion on this. Anyway, it is not the Ogdin people who died. He is very clear that this is Du Lin is saying goodbye to himself in the past, this is what he is looking forward to. Only by bidding farewell to the past, Du Lin can have a new future, and this is not an excessive thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the world is not safe. Is it not normal to occasionally die in a certain area? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Emperor’s confidential archives, a file about the bizarre death of many public figures was kept secret and blocked in the store. A ray of light illuminates the decryption period on the file before the gate of the vault is closed - one hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s really a hundred years later that the file has declassified the general public and there is no chance to know that the so-called decryption is not to announce the truth to the society, but to The rulers who are interested in these things are open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the public’s right to know..., what is it, is there a word in the Constitution and the Code? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next evening, Magus had just returned from the cabinet. He casually asked "Where did Du Lin go?" and couldn't help but shoot. I shot the brain, because the butler told him that Du Lin took the lady to the ostrich nest... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never thought it would be so fun!", the girl ran in front of Doolin, she turned and looked at Du Lin from time to time. The laughing eyes are like two crooked crescents, and the innocent smiles are not even tolerated by the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her two hands were holding a bird's egg. Originally, Doolin meant that roasting eggs were a very interesting and delicious food. The sympathetic girl refused Dulin's cruel request to take the bird. The eggs were caught in the hands and said that they were supposed to hatch them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the gap between rich and poor. Poor children only think that the eggs can fill their stomachs, but Miss Fuji is thinking about taking the birds. Incubating, will not consider how many people need to go through how to turn the bird into a bird, as long as she wants it, then it will do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how much it cost, they never think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also smiled, he was a little tired, only after three nights of rest after returning to the Imperial City last night, and then took this little girl Go out for a date. For the usual date, Doolin doesn't like it. Finding a romantic place and then saying something stupid and embarrassing love or secretly kissing is the whole content of the date. The date is too cliché, he needs something different. For example, ostrich nests, as well as eating eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird’s nest was smashed today, but the bird’s egg was not eaten, but overall it was still a very interesting day, reminding him of his own in Ziwei Town. Everything that happened when the three stupid days smashed dozens of bird's nests, so that they would not be hungry when they were able to fill their stomachs and sleep at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked and walked to the girl’s residence. The sister of Magus arranged a house for her next to the Royal College. The college went to school and was equipped with a housekeeper and four servants, who said that she wanted to learn to live independently. Now there are more than 20 days from the Royal College, she has lived here to adapt to the environment here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one meter away from the house, the girl suddenly ran back and stood in front of Doolin, looking up at him, his eyes flowing and looking good Guanghua, "When is the next date, will we do something different?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl found herself a little attached to Doolin, maybe Because Du Lin was full of contradictory temperament, he looked serious and closed his mouth like her father, giving a feeling of depression to breathlessness. But when he grins with his mouth and heartless, a glamorous warmth like the sun instantly replaces another temperament, giving people a feeling of safety and comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
