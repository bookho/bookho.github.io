			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ideas correspond to two kinds of policies. Although Magus is the most powerful man of the imperial power, he is not a one-word decision in the cabinet. . The scenes of the past still appear in front of the old aristocracy, and absolute power can bring about absolute decay. In the past, the emperor ruled this empire and there was a lot of absurdity to hopeless things. But no one can persuade the emperor, because the emperor's power is too big, and whoever is against him, he will let anyone go. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the fact that there are very few powers in history that are more powerful than the emperor, the royal family can be said to be all the way to the road, thus laying aside the second line. Make a seed of a mascot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Magus has a high demand for himself, can be said to be a bit too high, but it is not too much, because he can not be wrong. It’s okay to make a small mistake. The big things and the direction are absolutely not wrong. The new era he opened up is an unimaginable world for the once decaying empire. In this strange world, many things are still in the stage of exploration. In the early days. If something is wrong in some major things, even if it is wrong in the direction, it will be enough to overthrow his 20-year efforts. All his policies, including the establishment of this new era, will also change. Into an error. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he can’t be wrong, which makes him not a dictator, he is not a dictator, and that is why people are willing to salute him. Not every subversive has this perseverance and perseverance, and does not touch the restricted area of ​​that power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabinet gave two choices. He now puts this choice in front of Doolin. He wants to see how Dulin chooses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's easy, two sets of programs are executed one after the other." Du Lin did not let him wait for a long time to give a great answer. Because he himself tends to do this, stringing the two programs together is not a separate choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me why?", Magnus’s appreciation of Doolin’s appreciation is almost undisguised, and the cabinets are too correct to pursue, thus ignoring one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of a country should never be rigid. It should be constantly adjusted with the progress of society and the evolution of civilization. No policy has ever passed through the millennium. The history is difficult to achieve even for a hundred years. Because the whole world is constantly moving forward and constantly evolving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adapting to the adjustment of the times and adapting to the actual situation is what policy makers need to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said that he chose to choose this reason. "After 20 years, the empire has already had the strength to take off again. We are all accelerating the pace of construction and increasing the scale of construction. We need more ordinary workers to help us develop rapidly and achieve leap-forward progress. When the rapid development of society begins, it begins to precipitate and accumulate the necessary power for the next development. Our demand for the basic workforce has begun to decline, and the demand for high-tech talent has prevailed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I think the two programs are the best together Ok, there are some problems with the separation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have talked for a while, Magus invited Doolin to stay in the Imperial City for a few days, he hopes to make Doolin participated in the entertainment of the upper class in the imperial capital and met some new friends. However, it is a pity that Du Lin is still eager to return to the west, only to decline the invitation of Magus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just left, Bar went in from outside the study. He sat in the place where Du Lin was just sitting, just wanting to reach for the pancake, but I found that all the crepes were gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus glanced at him and said with a smile, "He has taken it away, but he certainly won’t eat it himself." Gus asked, "What kind of person do you think he is in such a close contact?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar slowly leaned back on the sofa, he Holding his chin, he said, "A very good young man can talk about excellence, but to be outstanding or amazing, I think it is a little worse. And he is not as ambitious as you said, at least he refused you. The proposal, from what he has shown now, he seems to want to continue to develop in business, which is actually a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Du Lin this The content of the conversation with Magus, he did not want to participate in the political competition, he just wanted to continue to be a businessman. Barr listened very carefully in the other room. He didn't know Du Lin. He could only tell his feelings about Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus nodded and said, "This is exactly what I am worried about, if a ferocious wolf tells you that he only wants to graze now. Do you think he is cheating on you, or is he really rehabilitated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrying a box of sweet and greasy pancakes out of the first half of No. 1 Street, throwing the pancakes into the trash can. It is almost made of sugar and honey. It is covered with a layer of wheat flour and baked in the oven. Once, the sugar and honey completely melt and solidify after cooling, so sweet that it can hardly swallow. Of course, this may be delicious for some people who are very obsessed with sweetness, but Du Lin is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the street phone booth and called the lawyers and asked about the patent registration. The lawyers told him that everything went smoothly, even though They were a bit confused about Doolin's request to register the patent in all countries, but in the face of money, they are in the process of going to various countries to handle these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A war between the Empire and the Commonwealth brought the empire to awaken from the arrogance of the past. This is actually only for the sobriety of the Union, when the Empire is facing other countries. There is still a sense of superiority, and perhaps this may be true. But with the increasing links between countries in the world, many things are quietly changing. In the past, the registration of patents in the Empire and the Commonwealth was basically able to guarantee the authority of patents. They felt that Du Lin had more to do, but Du Lin knew that the pace of development of the times would only be faster and faster, and it would take long before those lying on the patents Those who have peace of mind will be woken up by a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved the dispute with the Cape family and met with Magus, Du Lin set out to make a return ticket, also at this time, A large-scale search is under way in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the bloody Dawn members who were recruited by the doormen - those who did not obey him were being arrested, or had already caught arrest. There are more than 20 names on the list provided by the farmers. These people were also supporters of the doormen six months ago and important members of the Kadima Party. But at this moment, they have become dangerous criminals. These people never thought that the doormen would actually sell them, even if they chose to quit, they never thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the doorman is a treacherous person, but the doorman is also a person who knows how to "package". After the ambush, the bloody dawn turned from the bright side to the dark side. The things that Walter suffered and the damage suffered by the organization caused the leader to lose the desire to continue the movement. The entire bloody dawn was turned underground. Entered the dormant period. When Magus overturned the rule of the royal family, the leader thought that the new era had arrived, and there was no need for the bloody dawn to continue. With some people disappearing, no one knew where they went, but they were still in this empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the new party has completed a great career and dream for everyone, so the leader has to return to his ordinary life, but in the group of people left in the bloody dawn, another idea has emerged - our cause is not It should end like this, so they did not choose to retreat to the ordinary life with the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this organization, not everyone is just fighting for an idea like Mr. Kesma. There are some speculators and some fantasy. Home and pretentious ambitious home. Under such circumstances, some people led by the doormen stood up. They called the slaves and civilians who had been helped by the dawn of the blood, and called on everyone to stand up and fight for their own interests. In the Mennon’s statement, the New Party stole their fruit and became the new owner of the empire. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the end of the war, it was not long before the empire had not come out of the pain of the war. The doormen led these people to stand up and attempt to erode the western world. empire. Although his plan has failed, there are still many people following him, and many people feel that the doorman is an ideal and ambitious executive in the post-leader era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He packed himself perfectly, constantly telling others that he inherited the spirit of the bloody dawn and wanted to bring some changes to the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this person who has always emphasized that he is the successor of the Scarlet Dawn, but betrayed the dawn of the blood, does he not know that the leader is still alive and lives in the empire Somewhere? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The once crazy bloody dawn is the source of motivation for every member, and the blade that hangs overhead on everyone’s head. Betrayal can only burn the flames of revenge. Eventually all the traitors will be burned to ashes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapk was quietly in a wheelchair, surrounded by military personnel, who had been arrested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Shapke, as long as you answer a question, you, including your family, can be pardoned."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the real name of the messenger, where does he live now, how can he contact him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapk’s ridiculous smile The contempt in his eyes almost spewed out of the eyeball, and he remained silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
