			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two said that they couldn’t understand, Prando immediately took the policemen back. After he had gone a long distance, the person who saw it on his face felt that the friendly smile gradually converges. He took two more steps and stopped and stopped. He leaned slightly and twisted his head, looking in the direction behind him, watching Du Lin and the two young men walk into the already almost finished store, and then regained their gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back to the police station, Prando did not say a word, his face was not greeted with the slightest expression, from beginning to end Holding a face. To be honest, he doesn't like Doolin, very, very disliked. If he chooses, he will now choose to support Wood instead of supporting Doolin. As part of the overall Tenel City rulemakers, he doesn't like the “breakthroughs” that are easy to cross the line and jump out of the frame. Those big men, councillors, or mayors who are above his official hat will not like Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this kind of motion does not break the rules, do not know the awesome young people, they prefer Wood's "players" to follow the rules. Wood will follow the rules of the game made by these big men and keep the game well. No matter what he encountered, his first thought was that he could not cross the border, and this is what the rule makers are willing to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They worked hard to develop a large and complicated game order, not for the purpose of destroying the order, but for the common maintenance of everyone. Let the game run smoothly and healthily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he had to show his closeness with Du Lin, until now, he realized that the only meal at the dinner table, the whole meal process The little guy who doesn't say a word is far less "quiet" than he showed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10,000 yuan is really hot, and you can’t get rid of it. Even if it’s hot barbecue, he’s going to scalp. Hard to swallow, because Doolin is a person who does not follow the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando returned to the police station in a very heavy mood and returned to his office. He took a bottle of high-quality wine from someone else on the wine rack and poured himself a cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to think and think about how to bring back the guy who has stepped on the line, at least not let him go so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando may not remember that a young little police officer did not keep up, just witnessed the "fierce" cruelty that created a massacre quickly There was nothing happening in the washing of the floor, and the police officers who were talking to the director and the students were ignored. A young police officer followed Wood’s car and has not returned yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This police officer has always been there, he is on the roadside and witnessed the entire "murder case" process. He is angry, he is jealous, he is ashamed, he is at a loss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did it start, in the city of Tener, the boundaries between black and white are so unclear? When he saw Wood leading a group of police officers, he even thought that the director of the bureau would arrest the violent gangs who were cruel and vicious. He took the initiative to stand up and testify that Du Lin had done it before. Things that have passed. But when he saw that the temper was not very good, the director of the company actually talked with the young man as a good friend, and also waved his farewell, he felt very shameful and felt that he was humiliated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a police officer, and it is my responsibility to uphold justice...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to Tell yourself that even his initial ideal is not to be a policeman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His outlook on life, values, and worldview were completely destroyed at this moment. He felt that he needed to talk to his family. Is it sick or not? The world is ill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment he turned and left, Du Lin behind him walked into his store with a gloomy face. The buildings that have been cleaned are full of pungent smell of disinfectant water. These things are still bought by the hospital. The money can be bought for less than three gallons, and the pungent smell of disinfectant water covers it. Bloody smell and a touch of sourness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big guys all gathered, and Du Lin’s eyes stayed on everyone’s body for a moment, except for some girls, almost everyone was hurt. But their mental outlook is very good, they did not show frustration, or a painful expression, one by one is... the spirit is very uplifting, and the eyes are burning to meet Du Lin's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are we dead a few?", he couldn't help but pick up another cigarette, he needs to relieve the pressure in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha said with a smile: "There were six dead, one of them was shot and killed, and the other five were stabbed to death." He paused and said, "There are still nine people seriously injured. There are only about four or five people who can be cured. The rest may have to be disabled." There is an expression on his face that can't be said, sad, but unfortunately And no help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the families of these people, their children have been raised for more than a decade, and suddenly they left the world. Not to mention that it is your own son, that is, a kitten and a puppy are enough to make people feel sad, let alone a living person, a more affectionate relative? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the situation is not as bad as imagined, every Guar family tends to have multiple children, although it is true that a child is killed. People are very sad, but they have not reached an unacceptable level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walked back and forth a few steps and said: "Everyone who participated in today's party... fifty dollars.", said fifty dollars. At that time, the boys were almost coming out of their eyes, and the girls looked at the boys with some envy. Du Lin pointed to them, "You also have!", and the girls are happy. , a smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they are sad for the dead brothers and those who may be disabled, but they are more satisfied with their own harvest. To say a bad word, they are trying to fight for wealth, but their commandments are not worth much, but they are worthless, and there is also a measure. Fifty, equal to the hard work of others for half a year. For this group of teenagers, who are eager to prove their youth, it is not a small sum of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words have not been finished yet, he went on to say: “The injured 50 plus, the medical expenses company out. The disabled, plus one hundred, etc. After they came out of the hospital, they went to work in the company. They started at 20 blocks a month and raised their salary every year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to it, there are already Many people are moving, outside, in the society, if it is for the gang to be disabled, most of the time to arrange a light job for them, of course, the salary will not be too much, can save them to eat okay It’s warm, but I don’t expect anything if I want to pay for it. After all, the gang is just a simple gang, it is illegal to operate, and there are not so many positions to raise idlers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
