			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This society is sometimes so interesting, and some moments of life seem to have the whole world, but they are doing low-key all the time. There are also some people who need to continue their efforts on the road to success, but always think about how high-profile there is to be high-profile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s funny, but it’s more than a funny thing. It’s a lot more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man around Fei Lijia is called Vitor, not a Fatima family, but has a very close relationship with the Fatima family. His family, let's call it a family, has been serving the Fatima family since 400 years ago. Among them, there are three big butlers, arguably half a Fatima family. In his generation, the two best young people in the family took it out, one was assigned to Fei Lijia, and the other brother who gave Fei Lijia as a servant, hoping to compete in one of the two. Out of position, become the next owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitol appeared at the side of Fei Lijia from the age of seven, when Fei Lijia was only three years old, until now, almost no separation Over. The tacit understanding between the master and the servant from childhood is one of the compulsory courses for all the major members of the big family, and it is also the basis for mutual trust. Both Magus's butler and Orne, who is around Solo, have always played such a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One glory, all damage, they are completely serviced by the master, but also the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that sometimes some people are somewhat dynamic and not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Felicia is a perfect girl, a noble and unimaginable origin, and her looks, temperament, and education, including everything. Everything is considered to be the best choice. There are actually three girls like her in the Fatima family, and the big family can always find almost perfect women. However, in the eyes of Vitor, Fei Lijia is the best. From the age of seven, she began to watch Fei Lijia grow up little by little. In the heart of Vitor, Fei Lijia is not only the master but also her own life. All of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is passionately in love with his master, and does not allow any people and things that defile Ferrari. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Fei Lijia’s doubts, Vitor’s performance was like a gentleman bent down. “I’m very sorry, miss, I’ll be right away. He will handle these things well!" He was just about to inform the new party's top-level reporters about the news of Miss Ferry's report that the report of the new party should disappear immediately. Fei Lijia raised her wrist and extended a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give a letter to the messenger newspapers and tell them that if they don't want to go to court, they should officially apologize to me in their newspaper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vitor praised the kindness and love of Miss Ferrika, and then did it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felica looked at the newspaper on the table and smiled at the forehead. There is no doubt that Vitor included no one in the family. She will disclose her schedule and behavior in private, which is absolutely not allowed in the nobility, and can even rise to the extent of "betrayal." Therefore, the person who disclosed the news must not be a person in the family, so there are only two objects that she can doubt, one is Solo, and the other is the mayor of Otis, Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solo now seeks the Fatima family, hoping to take advantage of the family’s status and power to take over the management of a SAR, in this senseless but It is impossible to be confused in a small matter that will damage the image, so there is only one answer - Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is able to understand Du Lin’s ideas, which have been used in the past. Some merchants will give their goods after they contribute some goods to the royal family. The label of the royal family buys, on the one hand, to increase the added value of goods, and on the other hand, to combat peers. After all, the royal family must buy something exactly the same as other homes, but the royal family does not buy much better, this is their purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Du Lin is like a businessman, the city of Otis is the commodity in his hand, and now he actively exposes his own trip to promote his own goods. To the newspaper, it is also a very reasonable explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can imagine that the journey that should have been low-key has become a lively moment. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s exactly what Ferrika thinks, two days later when the luxury steam train docked outside the newly renovated exchange station in Otis, in the hall It has long been crowded with people. Many people are looking at the train with their feet on the ground. Even some reporters raised the camera and waited for the moment when she got off the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need to disperse them?", and Vitor pouted through the glass of the locomotive window and looked at the crowd outside, asking. So many people will not only make the air unpleasant, but also have many hidden dangers. "Mr. Doolin is very derelict, and even the most basic reception work is so bad. I really don't know how he is listed on the market. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment he grew up in peacetime and what he saw in peacetime made him say such a thing would not be surprising. There is a saying that is quite right--"The nobility of the nobility is half aristocrat, the title of the master, the title of the steward ". It is not clear where this sentence came from, but it makes sense. Like the master servants like Fei Lijia and Vitor, once they have been with each other for decades, in some things, Vitor himself will be able to make some unimportant decisions instead of the master on the premise of clearing the position of Ferrari. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika shook his head, and since he couldn’t hide his trip, he went out in a big way. She has not done bad things, and she does not look like a mythical lava beast. There is no reason to be afraid to see these ordinary people. With the help of the maid, she packed up her dress and walked out of the train's door under the guidance of Vitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the crowds boiled, and countless flashlights flashed wildly, and people cheered as subconsciously as they saw a big star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian separated the crowd, and Du Lin and Harry greeted him, Harry was in front, and Du Lin was behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Doolin did not intend to invite Harry, but Harry took the initiative and ran over, and he could not drive Harry back. The longer I spend with Harry, the more I can find that Harry and Magus are completely different people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggs’ behavior is low-key, and the attitude towards the capitalists is very determined and never wavered. His desire for power is not strong. On several occasions, he met with Magus. Du Lin did not feel that the other party used power to force himself to promise or promise. On the contrary, if he ignored the identity of Magus, he might be an ordinary person. Old man. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that he has reached the peak of politics, and he does not need to prove himself by showing his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Harry is different, this guy is keen on power, but also chasing capital power, his pattern looks like a big, actually it is, ordinary A politician, there is no such dazzling degree as Magus. To say that he does not mean that he failed, he passed, but only passed, not even ninety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry strode toward Felicia, full of joy, "President Princess Felicia, I represent the state government and all citizens, welcome Your arrival!", he said, he still owes a slight owe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not use the wrong words, only the royal princess can use His Royal Highness, the princess of the Duke can only use the lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitor stood in the back half of Fei Lijia’s body. After Fei Lijia’s return, he said with a blank expression: “Harry Governor, Miss has already Tired, we need a place to rest, don't you know that you are ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that Vitor should be able to say after Du Lin’s greetings This sentence, but I don't know if Du Lin "leaked" the wind or because the newspaper said that he and Miss Ferrika had a leg, which made him a little unhappy. Plus Du Lin did not seem to say hello, he only said this in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can become the servant of the Fatima family heir, and the most important servant, can not be a fool who can not be distinguished by such a simple matter, as long as When you start your brain, you know that everything is a ghost that Du Lin is engaged in, which makes him feel very bad about Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika did not speak, but looked at Doolin, and Du Lin smiled and walked over and reached out, "Welcome to you." Otis City!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry looked at him, Vitor looked at him, and Ferrika also looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He not only did not use honorific words, even in such a public occasion to reach out to an unmarried noble woman who can be called a girl? What kind of brain circuit is this stepping horse to be able to make such a rude move? Harry laughed a little embarrassed. Actually, he didn’t blame Du Lin. Because Du Lin was just a farmer’s child, he couldn’t understand how the aristocrat’s social etiquette was. Exquisite and complicated. But Vitor doesn't think so. He thinks that Doolin is declaring his authority here and watching the Fatima family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Vitor was preparing to sue Du Lin’s rudeness, Fei Lijia smiled and did not speak. She squatted on the skirt and acted slightly. The range is very small, so small that many people only touched the skirt when she touched it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss...", Vitor did not understand what he wanted to say, "He..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felika looked at him, he immediately closed his mouth, and after getting together for more than ten years, he could understand the meaning of Fei Lijia's eyes, that is to let him shut up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
