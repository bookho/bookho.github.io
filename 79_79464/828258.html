			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Kesma is more involved in killing and killing than in political matters. Du Lin just hangs a few words with him, he has some Impatiently took the pipe back to the house. Anyway, this matter has already been handed over to Doolin. What he does is his business, and has nothing to do with himself. Well done, it is natural that Mr. Kesma has a foresight and a good understanding of his children, so he gave the task to him with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is not doing well, it can only be that Du Lin has failed the expectations of Mr. Xerma, and will make Mr. Xerma feel sad and sad. Then he will think of things like whip, stick and the like hanging at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Mr. Zema’s indifference, Mrs. Kesma is very happy, because Du Lin told her that he is going to take office in Otis. It is the mayor. The reason why there is a generation, this is the practice of the New Party, using this word to distinguish members who have climbed to the management through the party system and those who spend some money to "buy". Only Du Lin did a good job in this job, and the word was removed from the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, with this word and without this word, the power that belongs to Doolin will not be less, and his power should not be too much. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Kesma was happy after that, she did not expect her son to become a nobleman... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin would like to explain that he is not a nobleman. If he thinks about it, if she thinks that the word aristocrat is more appropriate, it is a nobleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in addition to seeing Mr. Xiaoxma, it is to communicate with Mr. Kemas. After staying at home for almost three or four days, I also took a buddha with the Buddha. Du Lin took the Buddha and Keina to leave the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yes, Kea. Uncle Layton asked Dulin to go out to see the world with his eldest son, otherwise he would lie on the ground and splatter, and let the residents of the whole town come to see how the little Du Lin developed, and he learned to turn his face. The set that recognizes people. In the end, there was no way. With Mr. Kesma’s indication of nothing, he could only bring Keina with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After going to the big city for a few days, Kea didn’t want to come back. It’s like a big city like Orodo. The places where the gods lived were full of beautiful buildings, and the number of pedestrians on the road was more than the number of people in the town. Especially at night, there are always some enthusiastic young ladies who want to pull him to some places to let him be a judge to evaluate the skills of the younger sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved the place, but he still went back. He is a very obedient guy. When he was fighting, he said that he was working hard. He is not allowed to force, the bastard is standing like a guest waiting for the little friends to give him loose bones. He looks a bit stupid, but he is absolutely not stupid. In the words of the world in Doolin's dream, this is called the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understood it in his heart, but he did not show it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sitting in the car, the Buddha was a little interested in a long box he was carrying, and asked casually, Kina said it was a fishing rod, he liked it the most. This fishing rod has been smashed, and every time I can catch a big fish, I took this fish without leaving anything at home. I also vowed to wait until the place, and I must catch a few big fish for everyone to taste. Early adopters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha mourned for him for three minutes, Otis, the ghost place, don’t talk about the lake, not even a river with a big eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fishing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at the Buddha at first glance, and suddenly felt that people were actually quite happy at times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long journey of nearly a week, the three finally got off at the station in Otis. It seems that the steam locomotive does not like this place. After leaving the three people, there is no waiting time for each station for fifteen minutes. Just continue to move forward. Only one car butt can be seen in a blink of an eye. After a few seconds, Disappeared in a piece of vegetation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the station. He felt that the first thing he should do was to repair the station. There is a feeling that he has gone to the west. If the plants here are not so lush, they may be no different from the west. One of the two hooks of the station card has fallen, and the remaining half of the estimate will not take long. Whenever the wind blows, it will squeak and shake. There were several holes in the roof of the shed, and there was no repair. The benches on the platform were also decaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place is worse than what is described in the text. When I came out of the station, I didn’t say that I met the staff. I didn’t even have a mouse, just like it was abandoned. Fortunately, they had already notified the city hall here before they came. The people here sent a car to pick them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is still no car with only one bucket, which is often used to pull forage in the countryside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet Du Lin is a young man in his twenties, the smile on his face may be a little more numb, very stiff. After reluctantly, he pointed to the three small stools in the car and said: "The funds here are very tight, so I am very sorry, I can only pick you up with such a car." He said sorry on his mouth. A little sorry expression is not enough, sitting directly in the driver's position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people got on the car, and after a little bit of a bumpy ten minutes, they finally entered the city center of Otis. If Du Lin really wants to go to politics, it is estimated that his heart is already cold. Fortunately, he does not have this idea. After all, he is just running for his own interests, so there is not much dissatisfaction with the situation here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest floor in the whole city of Otis is no more than the fourth floor. The only house on the fourth floor is the town hall, but it does not look like the house of Irian. good looking. On the mottled outer wall, there is a pit in the west, which is the wound left after the outer layer falls off. From the front, the town hall is surrounded by a wall high by one person, with a booth and no gate. There are some vegetation inside, it seems that there is no repair, and there is room for survival and the plants next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-story town hall has four rows of continuous windows from east to west, that is, eight floors, four floors and thirty-two rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse stopped in the yard and the young man slammed the reins on a tree. The old horse took the initiative to stand in the cool corner and licked The lush grass on the ground, the young man introduced Du Lin three people into the office of the mayor in the city hall, he took the initiative to leave. Later, Du Lin knew that this guy was so stinky because he was the director of the transportation bureau here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of the Department of Transportation, a city that adds up to ten vehicles, is really a promising job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinna looked at the dusty mayor’s office, immediately put down the salute, and took out a rag to start the room. He was diligent, and he had to do it with a rag. He originally wanted to ask someone to clean it. After all, this is not a relaxing life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin just took a look and then said, he wants to go everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only six rooms in thirty-two rooms, and the other rooms are not empty or full of dust. Some people are not very excited about the arrival of Doolin, and they are very numb. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin called these people, including the Director of the Transportation Bureau who sent him, to the conference room for 20 minutes before he opened his post. The first one will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was this first meeting that left him with the idea that he was going to develop well. There are only seven people in more than 10 departments of the City Hall. Some of them have two positions, and each person has a numb smile on his face, just like a routine. In their mouths, Du Lin gradually learned that this is the "exile land" of the New Party, and all the guys who are sinful and sinful will be exiled here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, some people voluntarily resigned from the party’s position and position here, and chose to go home and find another thing. There are also some people, such as the seven people who stay here, waiting for a chance while waiting for a salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have no thoughts on how Dulin proposed to develop the city. The entire city does not have a population of 400,000, of which 70% are old people and children. Young people leave the city to work if they have the ability. The only job that can make money here is to make some handmade blankets for the capitalists, as well as some other work that must be done by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that it was assigned here, and that is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Du Lin also invented the idea of ​​the mayor of Irian, who forced Du Lin to ask him. As long as Doolin spoke, he would be able to open a mouth from Du Lin to the next piece of meat. Can Du Lin be such a person who can compromise at will? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is certainly not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of others, the city may be dead and there is no possibility of development, but in the eyes of Doolin, the city has great potential. Because he and his eyes are not the same, they choose a different way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otis is located in the southern part of the capital, at the heart of the entire empire, the only drawback is the lack of rivers, and the terrain of the east and west is not very good. So there is no railway, only the railway in the north-south direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
