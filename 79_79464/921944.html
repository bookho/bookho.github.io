			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to tell me about this, you will get a message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Former Secretary After hanging up the phone, I responded to the mayor's adult. The mayor was somewhat undecided. He couldn't confirm whether Du Lin knew it or didn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen this young man, the last time he was in the hospital where Nanodides lived for a while, when Harry went to visit him. Long went with him. In the ward he saw the young man who was often praised by Harry. His youthfulness really shocked the mayor. He greeted Du Lin with a smile, but his inner guilt was tearing his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent eleven years before becoming a mayor from an inconspicuous clerk, during which he paid too much and could Said that he had nothing left. What dignity, personality, and the like that are being hanged by those scholars have turned him into a rising step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former mayor of Nano Lindes, who was his former boss, was a very awkward aristocrat. At that time, the New Party had not overthrew the decadent monarchy and was on the eve of the outbreak. In that environment, his ordinary person could not become the mayor for a lifetime, because he is not a nobleman, he has no territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nano Lindes is the mayor’s former family territory, oh no, it should not be said to be the mayor, it should be said to be the consul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a person with no skin and no face serving the aristocratic consul, the consul looks down on him, because the governor thinks he is a moral The bottom line, even he gave his wife to seek greater power. People in the city don't like him either. He is the dog's leg of the consul. Every month, he will take a whip and take the soldiers to collect taxes from house to house. Sometimes he will beat people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that period, he quietly joined the new party and waited for dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became the mayor of Otis, becoming a big man. He has been painstakingly running the city and taking the city as his own. Perhaps this was edified by the lord of the governor, who once was the property of the governor, and now he regards the city as his property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used every means, never considered his own decent, and developed the city into the jewel of the empire's hinterland, so that the people of the entire city are proud of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that the young man, even a small amount of beard or fluff, already has the full power of a city and threatens his city. . People are saying how Du Lin is, whether it is good or bad, let him be jealous. Because he and Du Lin were so old, they were watching the governor’s lord take off his wife’s clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嫉妒, like a poisonous snake, injects a venom called viciousness into his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent air made people very uncomfortable. After a while, he said to the microphone: "The batch of goods should not be sent for a while, then observe a few Day. Arrange a little person to inquire about the situation, and look for it to see if you can find Coster." When he said it, hesitated, with a rather uncertain hesitation: "Arrange people to stare at Doolin The group, if they have any special actions, we will first take the shot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mayor facing the window after the phone is hanging, the sunset in the west is exhausted Sprinkle the afterglow to the earth, but it can't stop the arrival of darkness and shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin is not reasonable, then he does not need to reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savi is not the first time to come to Otis, but after the real opening of the city of Otis, he is the first to come, young people’s eyes are almost Not enough, keep watching the buildings on the side of the road, or on girls who have a particularly good face. Some of these women are tourists, and some are local girls. They don’t need to sell their own oysters or superb skills. They just need to put on beautiful clothes and walk around the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is necessary for Du Lin to pay them twenty-five to forty-five monthly salary. Not only girls, but the handsome boys in the sun have the same treatment, put on the clothes that Du Lin prepared for them, and then exposed the muscles that had been exercised because of the hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Du Lin’s memory of dreams, there is a phenomenon called “the effect of the face”. Simply put, if you look good, you can attract people. The appearance of so many handsome guys in the streets of Otis, will make many people think of this as a holy place to find love, which will further stimulate the overall outbreak of the local tourism economy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The change here is really big, Defu sister." Savi looked amazed at the side of Dove and couldn't help but sigh: "Du Lin Ge must be very happy, this is his credit! So, why give me this?", Savi took out a token in his pocket, a denomination of five dollars, and some smaller denomination tokens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a token. In this city, the denomination of the token and the denomination of the Empire Star are equivalent. You can go anywhere, this It is a feature of the city of Otis." Defoe explained to Savy in accordance with Du Lin's statement. She actually did not know what this feature is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these days of business, some tourists have made some suggestions, for example, some places can only use tokens, but because of the rule of not changing It makes them feel a little uneconomical. Obviously, you only need 50 yuan to get things done. At least you have to take out a piece of money. Some people can't be happy to see it. Du Lin knew that the token factory would immediately add a set of fifty-five tokens, which tend to be more of an empire coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size is only a little bigger than the thumbnail's fingernails. On the first day of the market, it received a lot of praise, whether it was for Doolin or the municipal Hall. At least the reaction speed of the City Hall allowed the passengers to see a city hall that was really serving everyone, not the kind of high-ranking lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin will make a big move wherever he goes, as long as he shows up, someone will say hello to him, and soon there will be pedestrians who want to come over. I want to sign something. He is not a big star, but he has a star position and may be a political star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he didn’t pick up Savi in ​​person, but arranged Dove, who is very familiar with Savi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the entire city of Otis has turned into a city that never sleeps, and the city’s sky is illuminated by various neon lights like a dream world. In Doolin’s villa, a group of people gathered around and talked and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Savi only brought nine people, and 90 people stayed in Nano Lindes, which Dulin asked him to do. He is talking to Dudu about his training in the military base, and Kea has focused his attention on snacks and television. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to go back.", Dove stood in the corner of the hall, looking at Buck seriously. "It’s not too early, you are busy. One day, go back to take a bath, then take a nap and obey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck looked at Dove a little incomprehensible. During this time, he felt that he had successfully integrated into the small group of Doolin. He and Dudu and Keina became good friends. He even took out his life. The first salary invited the two bastards to find a skilled woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see that there must be something in the evening, because Keene returned from the security company very early, he lived in the security company during this time, no What will not come back. After encountering Buck's Buck in the middle of the road, he immediately went to Dulin's villa with him. He has an expectation, and maybe it will be different this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?", Buck was a bit angry, and finally had such an opportunity to integrate into the core, why did her sister not let herself participate? He whispered a little anxiously: "I still don't want me to have a better future? This is definitely a small gathering inside Mr. Doolin. As long as I have not attended such a party in a day, I will never be "Own people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff looked at Buck a little surprised, this kind of words he used to be absolutely impossible to say, not that he did not say, but It is impossible for him to say such a reasonable word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when she was somewhat uncertain, Du Lin came back from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his hat and threw it on the cabinet by the door, then took off his jacket. He is not a rotten aristocrat. He won't do anything except picking up gloves and taking off his pants. He also saw Buck. Some strange questions: "You didn't go home to rest? I heard that you were tired these two days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not saying good, it is the truth. There are always some people in the hot rides who are trying to challenge their limits. There have been dozens of fainting incidents, and some accidental injuries, the most serious one has a broken toe. Since Buck is responsible for the medical business, he certainly can't sit in the office to enjoy a leisurely time. Du Lin confessed that he must appear on the front line, must solve all problems in the first time, and must let the whole city see his enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be a hundred and a half for Barker’s behavior and attitude in these days. The deduction is that he still lacks a little passion, but for him this is already Enough, he has done much better than Du Lin expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not tired... I saw Kina when I got off work, so I followed him back...", Buck suddenly took courage and looked at Du Lin, "Mr. Doolin, I want to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
