			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be a little drink, or it may be called a few words by Prando, and gradually the meditation has become awake. He shook the cup with the ice left, placed it on Prando's desk, and then walked over to the window. Prando immediately took the cup with the water droplets on the outside wall from his beloved desk, and wiped the shallow water stain on the table with a handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no choice but to be a fellow. There was some awe from the beginning - after all, Xiu En came from the Imperial Police Investigation Bureau, and for the Prando who has been living in the city of Tener, it is definitely a big man who can't be provoked. Until now, numbness did not take much time. Sometimes Prando was also skeptical about how Xiu En was a detective. He did not have the appearance and consciousness of a detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole day is like a scum, and I don’t care about the cases in this city. Even the telegrams sent by the capital are often used by this. The guy was thrown directly into the trash basket. He seems to have been completely desperate and began to indulge himself. He did not even care about the police's unification of "black money", and even took the initiative to find Prando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His remarks are very simple. He is also a member of the Tenel City Police Department. Of course, he should get the extra "subsidy" every month and take it. It is still the kind of fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a person, even if he has extraordinary power, how can he make Prando awe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that he is bored! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze blowing the breeze made a snap and turned and sat on the window sill. "I remember, Jim, Wood, right?" Prando nodded a bit, and Xiun’s face suddenly showed a bright smile. "I said that I heard about this name, how? He died? Whose hand is it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando's eyelids glared at Zion, and Zion might have realized something, laughed a few times, patted Prando's shoulder, and did not feel shy on his face. The expression, "I forgot, you are asking me." He shrugged his shoulders. "In fact, I want to say that apart from the people of Graf, there will be no other people doing this. You know Wood. Have you taken Graf's mother and his brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando really didn't know about this. On the one hand, he didn't have much contact with the gang, and he didn't like to contact gang members. If you are seen, if you go out, you will really lose your hat. Secondly, the gang members are not willing to be involved with him. For the gang members, even if they are cut off by an enemy arm, they will endure and then look for opportunities for revenge. They will not call the police at all, and it is even impossible to use the power of the police. Come and ask for justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a dispute between the gangs, it must be settled by the rules between the gangs. Anyone who dares to use the power of the police will be despised by all gangs. Rejection, even lynching, just like Jim's wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Prando simply didn’t know that Wood actually took Graf’s mother and brother, and it’s no wonder that such a decisive and revengeful vengeance would occur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Prando has defined these two murders as vendettas. Of course, he also understands that no matter how qualitative he is, he cannot change a fact. That is, the war broke out. He slightly frowned and asked: "Is there any way to ease it, for example, find a middleman, pull the bosses on both sides, sit down and talk about it, avoid the outbreak of war?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sloppy glance at Prando, his movements, the look, the taste, like a gang of gangsters on the street. "Are you kidding? Wood is dead. Two confidants, do you think Wood will agree with your request? In addition, if Graf and his boss Doolin dare to do this, they will not stop. This war must be completely collapsed before it can end. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me for being rude. This is not something you can obstruct and interfere with. You don't have this... ability!" What I want to say is qualification. Prando is really amazing. It is the police chief of the city of Tener, responsible for the security work of the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what about it? He is not a steel robot, not a war machine. He is just a chubby human being. It is no different from the roadside gangsters. He also has a great time, and he often spends a lot of time, he will also be injured because of a knife, but also because of a bullet. He is no different from Jim who died today. He is even more vulnerable than those people because he does not have the vigilance and care of those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, when people are willing to follow the gameplay in the rules frame, the Prando police officer can indeed be said to be the biggest one. Everyone must respect and obey the rules he has set. But once someone jumps out of the rules and does not follow the rules of the game, what is Prando? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
