			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel shameful for you!", Amon’s face was indignant, and he breathed very thickly. "Mr. Doolin gave us the freedom to regain The opportunity also gives us the value of life that is more worth pursuing, but you actually want to... want to go against Mr. Doolin?” Amon’s tone was incredibly toned, and he took a small table. “It’s just making me feel ashamed. I feel ashamed of having friends like you. Have you forgotten what we promised Mr. Doolin?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The two wall-collecting parties constantly persuaded Amon not to be so angry, as if they were born to be the material of this line. Amon is from the Tecolt Empire, an ancient empire in the Western Continent, also known as the Confucius. The shape of the western continent is like a eagle mouth, big and small, with a little back hook, scattered scattered islands in the back of the eagle. The Tecolt Empire was once the only country in the Western Continent. Later, because of the bloody and ruthlessness of Pharaoh King Colte, the last many members broke away from the rule of the Tecolt Empire and they were in constant conflict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tecolts are also born warriors. They have different physical qualities than ordinary people. They are very strong and can swing forty pounds of weapons to ride in the battle. However, they have a flaw, that is, their heads are relatively short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The western continent, which lags behind other countries in science and technology, has become the favorite place for many slave traders. They use the absolute superiority of weapons to secretly collect slaves, but this year With the ascension of Pharaoh's Tecolt XXIX, the situation on the Western continent has become more peaceful, and he has also made a parliament calling for peace. It is more difficult to want to catch slaves now. This group of dwarves has learned to exchange weapons from arms dealers for gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although it is more difficult, it does not mean that there is no, the slave team can always find a small village with weak defenses to attack, hardworking and powerful Tecolt. People have become the easiest to sell goods in the labor slave market, although the price is not very high, because these people do not have advanced technology and ability, can only engage in the most simple and repeatable physical labor, but the sales are very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Freedom Front, Tecolt’s people accounted for about 15 percent, a relatively large group, and Amon was among the ten warriors. One member represents the thoughts of all Tecolts, who are a group of sincere people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenrell’s smile looks very fake. He lowered his head and used a sharp dagger to pick up the dirt in the crack of his nails. He looked up and snorted. Meng, Ping angry and persuaded: "Amon, not that I violated Mr. Doolin's wishes. First of all, we came here not from our own wishes. Secondly, I am grateful to Mr. Doolin for saving me from the dark mine. Come out, but this does not mean that if I am rescued from the hands of a slave owner, I must voluntarily become a slave to another slave master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are free and independent people. We should have independent will and independent thinking ability. Amon, I am just doing what Mr. Doolin wants us to do and learn to live independently in this land. This is not Is it Mr. Doolin’s expectation for us? Is there anything wrong with me doing this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenlier is from Nanda Road, the longitude of the road is very long, the most The south is connected to the Antarctic, and the northernmost part is approaching the tropics. Finrier came from a southerly side and was born in a place called Elmondo. The climate in that place is very bad. There is hardly any crop that can be grown for a long time. People live mainly on fishing. - Sometimes they also intercepted passing ships at sea to plunder. This group of people born in the worst environment, where the country is almost three sides facing the sea, are born sailors, or pirates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they are also full of blackmail, which is said by the robbed merchants and captains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel shameful and ridiculous for you! This is a betrayal!", Amon screamed without looking at Finril, looking at the direction of the tent curtain. "In any case, I will go to see Mr. Doolin, and all Tecolts will continue to abide by our commitments with Mr. Doolin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fen Lille put down the dagger in his hand and looked up at Amon, even though he was a person often referred to as the Elmondo pirate, and he was not willing to bear the reputation of betrayal. He looked serious and said loudly: "This is not betrayal! This is my power, we have the power to choose, this is our choice! You are willing to continue to be a slave, I will not stop you, but don't hinder me. Keep doing what I want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is destined to be The unsuccessful gathering of the head, they were indoctrinated by Doolin, because they just re-entered the bright embrace from a black desperate world, so the person who gave the light to them will get Their unconditional trust and some worship. But when these extreme emotions retreat, the individual's sense of independence will once again occupy the commanding heights of the soul. Everyone is an independent person with independent thoughts and plans for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are more focused on self and reality, and some people are emotional and idealized. This requires a process to guide everything and finally See the essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three perfect attacks have accelerated this process, allowing some to discover their essence, such as Amon. For this young man who has his own beliefs and grew up in a different social environment than other empires, he is more convinced of his own judgment and the so-called mission. He believes that he is not a slave because of his own misfortune. This is the revelation that Cuppy has given him. He points out the path he wants to take in the future, that is, to liberate all the suffering Tecolts to fight for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finril is also the same, his beliefs and the cultural education he received told him that things are best in his pocket, when the three attacks ended Then he discovered that he can make himself happy by doing these things, but obeying others will not make him happy, so why should he obey others? The man named Du Lin did save him. He didn't return anything. He had risked his life and attacked three mining areas to complete the task that Du Lin had entrusted to him. He paid enough to reward Du Lin for pardoning his slaves. The gift of identity, they are even. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith, culture, these things have quietly affected people’s judgments and cognitions. This is not a question of who is right or wrong, because everyone is right. Everyone is most sincere and loyal to their own choices. It doesn't matter if they are right or wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Finril also knows that when Amon returns, the Freedom Front may split into two organizations. Although he has some regrets, he does not regret it. More pure talents have more pure fighting power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place in his dreams, gold is everywhere, money is everywhere, as long as you can bend down and squat, you will be able to make a fortune! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is a ten-warner in a hotel in Washu, the town of Wasiu is located in the central and western parts of the west, and the most prosperous place in the west is the most In the cities on the east side of the city, after the central part of the city, the city became scarce, but there were more towns. It was only after the West Coast that the situation was alleviated. This is because most of the western part of the country is Gobi, mountains and a small number of desertified areas. The cost of building a city in this kind of geology and space is too high. More. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washiu has a population of more than 27,000 and is considered to be a medium-sized town. Trains with two shifts pass through every three and four days. Once, Du Lin came by train. He left the train three days later and returned to the east of the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
