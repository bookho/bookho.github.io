			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the week, Doolin used this time to observe the topography of the city of Otis. There are many abandoned military fortifications around the city of Otis. During the Civil War, the invasion of the EFF was like a broken bamboo, and it almost hit the empire's hinterland. In order to ensure the safety of the capital, a large number of military facilities were arranged in the north and south of Otis. After it was not dismantled after the war, it was left there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are basically flat areas around the city, and there are mountains in the east and west. This is why Otis is obviously underdeveloped in the heart of the empire. The two walls cut off the east-west transportation, and with no water transportation, the transportation hub will definitely not be placed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a star-level city in any region, it will involuntarily take the human resources of other cities out of the way. This is the case in Otis. Young people have gone to Nano Lindes, which is close to more than 200 kilometers away. It is the transportation hub of the imperial heart. The throughput is huge. It has not only land transportation, but also abundant water resources and water transportation. The lively is not much worse than the emperor. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading this neighborhood, Du Lin found the local history of Otis, and found that the land around the city of Otis was not developed, nor any The open space of ownership. He immediately decided to hold an auction, and also informed the insiders of the New Party, as well as some of the richest people in the community, the content of the auction is the land around the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the New Party and many rich people knew about Doolin’s invitation, the first thought was that the guy was ill, and the illness was unclear and his brain was already burned. It is. It’s a bit of a whimsical thing to say, and it’s hard to say that it’s crazy to think about money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is auctioning the land around Montreux, Irian or the Imperial City, he does not need to invite him, he only needs to reveal a little bit of wind, and it will soon be reasonable. The rich will gather, and everyone wants to buckle something from his finger sew to fill the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what is he going to sell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the city of Otis that can't see many passers-by during the day. The ghost place is not only the woods but also the woods. Even the hunting will not be anyone. Choose that ghost place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people regard this as a joke, but others are serious, such as Alexander, and Gadfil are two guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin can't be sure that they are all right to turn around, by the way to see how bad he is, or really want to come over and look for business opportunities. He deliberately wore two of them in the city, and their expressions gradually became very exciting. Until they returned to the City Hall, they didn't say anything on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the time came to the day when Doolin auctioned the land of Otis, and the Emperor’s side came to the staff of the two Ministry of Justice, who will be strict throughout the process. Supervise the auction process and go through all the formalities for the auctioneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No way, the only judge in the city of Otis is over seventy years old, and he is the only one in the judicial system. Not to let him do this, it is a very difficult thing to let him stand up, so Du Lin sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice on the side of the emperor, requesting cooperation there, so they sent two Personally come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction was held in the conference hall of the town hall. Doolin, with the city of Otis as the core, planned ten plots of land radiated around, close to Two hundred square kilometers, and all have been designated for planning purposes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest auctioneer’s Dufo went to the stage and asked a question from the staff of the two Ministry of Justice, and then only three of them participated in the audience. The auctioneer smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there are only three people in this auction. Even the judicial staff from the emperor are jokes about the size and scale of this auction. There isn't a bit of embarrassment on his face. Instead, he has a self-confidence that others can't see, as if they are not auctioning the ridiculous land, but a gold mine with amazing reserves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first place we are going to auction is the No. 1 plot in the plan, close to the railway, the total length...", reported a large After the pile of data, the Buddha raised his head. "The starting price is 100 yuan, and each time the price is 20 yuan, gentlemen, you can start!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linju I got the brand in my hand, and then waited for almost a minute. No one continued to placard and they all knocked on the raft and completed the first transaction. The two young guys from the Imperial City couldn't help but laugh again. It was really interesting to sell only a hundred pieces on a large piece of land. It was not like selling land again, but selling toys! One of the guys has a little curiosity, and he also plans to buy a piece of land to play. Anyway, I look at the posture of a hundred pieces. I want him to pay more than a month. But after buying this piece of land, he will always belong to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe when did this develop? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second plot was auctioned, he raised his hand and said that he had to shoot, but it’s a pity that the price of the land soon rose. To the point he could not accept - a thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only recover his hand silently, and then secretly recite a few words in his heart, these three people are crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen land, Doolin took eight, Garfield and Alexander each took a piece. Whether they really want to invest here or not, it doesn't cost much to invest in a piece of land. Instead, they can sell Du Lin's face. Why not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst-selling auction in history has ended in the last 10,000 quotations of Doolin, and the two staff quickly wrote each After the legal documents were stamped, they were handed over to three people. One of them said with a smile: "I believe that the city of Otis will definitely have a good development. The investment vision of the three gentlemen is very brilliant. From now on, the land you photographed belongs to your private property. No one can take away these properties until your consent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shook hands with him. "Thank you very much for being able to come here on the go. Come, thank you very much!", he took the paper bag containing a series of legal documents from the man, handed it to the Buddha, and thought about it, took out a checkbook from his pocket and tore two. I wrote a thousand pieces on each piece and then threw it on the ground. Everyone in the room didn't know when Du Lin was doing this. He bent down and picked up the two checks with their names and put them in the other's pocket. "I just licked it. When we got two sheets of paper, our judges are currently physically ill and unable to handle them. They bother to deal with them as appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bright bribe But no one can find the problem of Du Lin’s bribery. First of all, he did not contact the people of the two judicial departments in advance, and talked about conditions, which means that there is no premeditated. The second occurrence of this incident is also after the auction, there is no violation of the behavior and operation, the results of the auction is still valid. Finally, under the “visiting” of up to five people, Du Lin was indeed a note, and he did not say that he was given to the two Ministry of Justice staff, but asked them to deal with it as appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a bribe, but a gentleman with good morality and education is the most correct way to find a lost thing, even if you want to go to court for this matter, hit Dorian, the highest court of the empire, is also unlikely to lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stunned and was just about to refuse. He felt his clothes were pulled when he had not touched his pocket. His movements, a glance at Du Lin, and finally dispelled his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a thousand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t have the money for a year, and they could get the peace of mind with this money. After all, they didn’t destroy the rules for Doolin, and they didn’t cover it. He did things against his conscience and the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were very enthusiastic and left their contact after Du Lin’s thank you, then turned and left. After the two men left, Du Lin would say something that is not suitable for outsiders to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, I didn't think you really would buy a piece of land, I knew it was like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s words have not been finished yet, Alexander’s interrupted his words, and while laughing, he took Du Lin’s arm. “We are friends, aren’t we? So when I can do it, as long as I have Ability, I will definitely help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garfield also said in a timely manner that as long as he can do things, he can help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t have a brand like Doolin to call the lowest price, Alexander reported a price of 100,000, and Garfield is the same. The money is not much for their own net worth, but it is enough to express love, even a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that the money from these land plots for Doolin’s auction is not in Doolin’s own pocket, but is transferred to the financial account of the Otis City Hall. On, this is the "imperial official" money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s funny rebuttal, “Hell, wait for me to finish.” He looked at Alexander and Garfield and confirmed that they were no longer interrupted. I continued to say: "I mean, if I know that you have to vote for a piece of land, I will draw two smaller places! Damn, do you know how painful I am now? This is millions of tens of millions of dollars. Actually, 100,000 pieces were taken away by both of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression is exaggerated, and he still has a painful look on his chest, but Did not let Alexander and Garfield laugh, their faces gradually become more serious. Dooling helped them, and there is no doubt about this, and they have already started making money. Whether it is the mine that Garfield acquired in the past six months, or the hotel that Alexander has built in the field, it has begun to work in a benign manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
