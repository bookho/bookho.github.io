			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another cell that was held in a separate cell, the food delivery staff stuffed a dinner from the small plaid into the ground of the cell and was chased by Brunei in Ilyan. The arrested killer calmly finished eating dinner, knocked on the wall of the prison, and suddenly gave a punch to his face, hitting himself in front of his eyes and staring at Venus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two prisoners are silently "beating" themselves. When they are tired, they will choose to take a break and continue to destroy their bodies until the evening inspection. When the prison guards discovered their situation, they realized that there was a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both were taken to the prison hospital, the doctor on duty frowned, and he asked the prison guard to place the two on two adjacent beds. Then I couldn’t help but complained a few words. "Don't you be so aggressive when you use your sentence next time? Even if you hate them any more, you can't make such a heavy hand. What if you kill a person?" "He went to the left side of the bed and glanced at the prisoner who had been in a coma on the bed. His arm was twisted at a strange angle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say, it must be caused by excessive punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are often some important "witnesses" temporarily being held in the Imperial First Prison, in order to extract the things of interest from the mouths of these people, Beating is just the most common way. Only this time they looked at the level of over-fire, may be irritated by these two guys, so they are desperate to put a heavy hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prison guards who sent them came to the mouth and finally did not defend anything, no matter what they said, I am afraid that the doctor would not believe it. Instead of wasting time and saliva on meaningless things, consider how to report this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know who is moving, but it’s definitely someone’s hands. These two guys are very important. Someone can actually beat them in prison. The thing behind this is no longer a small prison guard can intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prisoner with the broken arm recovered, the doctor sighed. "Your arm I have tried to help you reset, but you have to Psychological preparation, there may be sequelae, sometimes you will not use force.", he stared at the prisoner after he finished, the prisoner looked at the ceiling, as if not heard. But the doctor knows that he has heard the slight change in the details of his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there is no way to face this fact. The grotesque doctors return to the table and continue to look at the latest medical publications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the police investigation bureau rushed into the medical room, and one of the lean guys with short hair went to the bedside. Looking at the two horrible prisoners on the bed, I almost slammed the table. He will take the two men away today and go to Irian to testify to Doolin, but just before the day they are about to leave, someone actually touched the two prisoners, so did the people who contacted them say to them? Something, will they change their mouths? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing that was quite simple suddenly became so complicated. After he came out of the infirmary, he said sternly: "Check, immediately check it out, in the end is Who contacted them, said what, what identity is that person, how to get in, find out for me. The first prison is holding so many important prisoners, there are still situations we don’t know, what is your prison? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The results will not be found in a week, you can find someone to resign your letter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Four days later, at the port of Irian, Ampu was waiting for witnesses from the emperor to come over and accidentally saw an acquaintance. His forehead tingled slightly, and walked over with a smile. "Hello, Kevin, how do you choose to come to Irian this time?", he said that he looked at the empty streets around him. "This time It’s not a good season for travel, you should go to the South.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin is also a smile, “How do you know that I am traveling, not to do business? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because Du Lin?", Amp said the most unanswered answer in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the emperor, both of them tried to avoid each other in the case, not because they were afraid of each other, but rather for a limited time And energetically invest in a case that will inevitably waste time. If Kevin represented the case and met Amp as a prosecutor, the two sides would inevitably hold a case for a few months or even longer. Is there not so much time to do more than a few cases, or is it better to crack some cases? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this time, Amp did not expect that the two sides still collided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin smiled and nodded. "Mr. Doolin is a very good quality customer. Almost everyone likes his clients and is willing to be friends with him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence affirmed Amp’s question, and Anpu’s heart once again gave birth to a feeling of not being able to come up. He stared at Kevin, frowned and squinted and asked: “What are you? When did you come? Why don’t you say it in advance, I will pick you up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’ve been there for a while, I live there...”, he Pointing to the manor on the northern cliff, "Would you like to get together at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp shook his head, "How, defend this time Are you confident?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very confident in myself!", Kevin replied with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked like ordinary friends, the more they talked, the more uneasy Anp. Obviously, Kevin has been in Irian for a while, then what he has done during this time, what investigations have been done in this case, or to say... His heart is tight, Kevin seems to be very positive in the evaluation of lawyers and rich people, but in the industry of justice, Kevin's style is not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is willing to do anything for the money that may win the case, and in order to keep his high consulting fees and winning percentage, his means are not every time Glorious. Although there is no evidence and witnesses standing up to testify to Kevin so far, most prosecutors believe that Kevin is very likely to be suspected of using illegal means to change the position and testimony of witnesses and to influence the jury outside the courtroom. resolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very despicable person, but he will pack himself and protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them fell into silence for a time, no one wants to speak again, they all know that the battlefield is no longer a dock, but in court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passenger ship in the distance has gradually changed from a bean to a giant. There are not many people coming to Irian in winter. At this time, it is not far from leaving spring, at most two. After the month, Irian will re-enter the tourists. At this time, no one wants to spend the winter in this cold place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are just a few people on board, and the captain doesn’t seem to like it. When the disembarked person leaves the ramp, they immediately put away the ladder and then quickly Set sail again and leave the frozen dead place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin's assistant is two young women, saying that they are young, but they are also in their thirties. Wearing a lady's formal suit, it seems that they are not used to the temperature here. Kevin glanced at the witness wearing a hood and gave a smile to Amp and then left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the police investigation headquarters responsible for escorting prisoners also knows Kevin. In the capital, almost everyone in the industry that is related to the law knows Kevin. Brows together and asks in some irritating tone: "How is he here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp signed his own on the handover procedure The name, while replied: "What else can it be? Where can I get money? Where are these vultures?" He returned the signed documents to the inspector and went to the first witness. Untied the rope on his headgear. "Is the road going smoothly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective did not speak, and the movements in Amp’s hands suddenly stopped. What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector has no way to get a fire, can only hold his anger, whispered: "Or look at it yourself!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After then, Amp untied the first man’s hood, Bruni, his gang was a little purple, his eyes were Blue, four days later, when the hit did not seem to be so obvious, but people can still find the first time this guy was severely beating. The important witness’s physical injury is a very serious fault. Especially when the court is going to open for the first time tomorrow, Amp can't help but lengthen his face and asks: "Are you taking measures?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...", the inspector didn't know what to explain, but only to tell the truth, "He fell in the restaurant and then tied the dinner to someone else. On the head..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp is angry and laughs, "Why not give him a separate meal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few consecutive questions asked the inspector's heart is not comfortable, this is not his fault, the ghost knows how those people in the prison are arranged? He didn't sneer and laughed. He smiled and patted his trouser legs. "You have to ask a colleague in the prison, you shouldn't ask me!" He glanced at the person brought by Amp. "Okay, smooth handover, then I have to go to other places to investigate the case, I will teach you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
