			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until late at night, Du Lin arranged all the things, his villa was not too small, and everyone squeezed and squeezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha is the last one to go. Before he left, he asked Clinton a little curious, why did he let Buck join their group, knowing that Buck did not And they have experienced any ups and downs, and there is a nature of being excluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not Kira, Kina has undergone the postgraduate study of Doolin and Dufo, even for the things of the Buddha, I don’t know what Ordo is over. In the case of the situation, the two men returned to Orodo with a shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and grinned for a moment. "I said a lie, you should listen to it, he would like to thank him for at least half of his body." The blood comes from the first king." He patted the shoulders of the Buddha. "Well, don't think too much, go to sleep!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending the Buddha Du Lin returned to his bedroom, and the question of Buddha and his answer was as a lie as he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff knows a lot about him, and in a strict sense Dove and the Doolin Group are already an integral part. When he first arrived in Otis, he called Dev and urged her to come over. She had been hesitant, but she finally came. If Dove didn't want to come over at the time, Du Lin would do something that might be terrible. Fortunately, she promised, maybe she realized what she was, or for other reasons, she always came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of Buck allowed Du Lin to use Dove more widely. For example, now Dove replaced Natalie’s work, but Natalie absolutely replaced There is no difference in Dove. Buck is like Du Lin's more trust in Dove's foundation, and it is also the cornerstone of Dove's deep recognition. People often say that threatening others with their family is a very dirty and shameless trick, but this trick is the use of the horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck took the initiative to be a good person, at least not let Du Lin put it forward, but Dove questioned that young people are promising! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day the sun just rose, the neon lights in Otis gradually closed, and the people on the street were even more, because today is the first weekend after the opening of Otis, for which there are many places in Ortis. To celebrate this very special moment. The steam locomotive didn't stop there last night, and the passengers who filled it were sent here. Even the steam locomotive driver sighed, and all this changed too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such a morning, there are people who are getting more and more deserted on the street of Linders, but it is difficult to see the grand scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Todd just got up from the bed, and he walked gently into the bathroom to start washing. His current wife is still his original wife. He knows how much embarrassing humiliation and torture his wife has suffered for himself. He is jealous of her, so he has not divorced since then. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the feelings are like that, he is outside the bread to raise a mistress, his wife also has a small white face to serve, everyone has their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After washing, Todd changed a set of casual clothes into the study. Although it was a weekend, there were still many things for his mayor. He was just about to start working, even the reading glasses were worn, and the telephone bell on the table suddenly rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at it, then waited for a moment before he made the phone call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people will not call him on non-working days. This is a courtesy, unless it is a very important thing, or a private matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just getting up his brain has not started to turn, need a buffer time, find out how to deal with several problems in the heart, and then call. He is the mayor and the mayor does not allow for the possibility of powerlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Todd!", the voice is steady and powerful, and there is a trace of magnetism that doesn't sound like an old guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a young laughter in the earpiece soon, "May Todd, good morning. I am very sorry to disturb your rest time. In fact, this is a call." I shouldn't have called you, it should be that you called me. But after waiting for three days, I can't wait for your call, so I have to take the liberty to call you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd frowned, his heart flashed and blurted out. "You are Doolin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refreshing laughter makes Todd very uncomfortable, his face It’s a bit ugly, but the words and his tone can be said to be a happy person. “Is it really you? It’s so good, I actually want to contact you. The city of Otis is very unique. It is also very worth learning. I am still thinking about when I can go to your side and look at some projects that Nano Lindes can also introduce. I didn't expect you to call."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Todd, are you sure what you want to say is the same thing as you? If you only have these words to say, then I will hang up after waiting. If you still If you have something else to say, please say it, there is only one chance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd immediately realized that Du Lin might have known that he was behind the scenes, he was a little Not surprisingly, many of the leaders of Nano Lindes have now become investments in Otis. , A lot of these people who dare to own and bared teeth, but city in Otis has been meek as lambs. If they say something to Doolin, Todd will not be surprised at all. The only thing that makes him a little confused is that Du Lin has long discovered the problem and why he has waited until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little colder, "Mayor Doolin, I don’t understand what you said, maybe you made the wrong call?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s hearty laughter came again, “Okay, Mr. Todd, goodbye!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd I was a little unclear, so I looked at the earpiece in my hand and called the location of the Otis city. "Do you have any abnormalities in these days? Did he mobilize people? There are few people in the police station." Less, is there any suspected military to visit him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former secretary received a tight call from this phone, he did not have time to ask anything, he directly answered Todd, The questions he asked were all right. "Du Lin has a very regular commute every day. As for whether or not he has mobilized people... Sir, I really don't know. The city of Otis is now very large and full of people everywhere. I can't find out who is Du Lin's person, who is a passenger. As for the police station, I am currently looking at the normal police and returning. There is no obvious increase or decrease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soldier you said, I have not found it yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The news of the former secretary can be said to be a good news, but the uneasiness in Todd’s heart is still increasing. He sighed, "Continue to stare at them, tell me immediately if there is any abnormality!" He held the phone after hanging up the phone. Looking at the street with no people outside the window, he gave Harry a call and said that Du Lin and he might have misunderstood. If he needed, he hoped to ask Harry to be a middleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd didn’t know that at the other end of the phone call, the former secretary hung up the phone and held his hands on the floor, the sweat of the beans The hair of his side was dripping constantly, and his head was like being pressed into the water. His body was shaking, his fearful eyes groaned, and some tears appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a place less than ten centimeters from his back, there was a black hole in the eye of the gun, and he was holding the gun at the side while pointing at the guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Doolin, there is nothing that Du Lin doesn't know, only he doesn't want to know. Almost all investors have a relationship with him. He only needs one sentence. The waiters in all the places in the city will start to pay attention to Doolin's request. Want to play with cats and cats here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's hard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to write, before I finish eating, I want to see a list that will allow me to cross." A big mouthful of apples. If you can't do it, you don't need to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former secretary immediately fell in front of the chair, wrote Todd’s confidant information, including where they lived, what to do, How can I find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dudu finished his last bite and threw the Apple nucleus into the trash can, he asked: "Is it finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former secretary nodded, "Write it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who did the template do? Write it, including The supplier of the materials, the person who provides you with technical guidance, one can not leak!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes...Yes, I will write now." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin got the list, the head of Mr. Former Secretary’s flower has been packed into a very beautiful and precious gift box, which is being sent to the nano On the way to Lindos. Up to six hours, Mr. Todd must be able to see this before dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
