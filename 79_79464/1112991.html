			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the federal territory, in the lost urban refugee camp, one by one refugees watched the 12-meter-high sentry patrols continue to pass by, faces There is an expression that is difficult to make a name. Once upon a time, the impression left by the mighty empire in their eyes collapsed overnight, and the Federation suddenly launched a war against the empire and almost hit the imperial capital with an unstoppable momentum. The powerful empire has always turned into a weak empire, although the last empire pushed the federation to the negotiating table, despicablely using hundreds of thousands of soldiers' lives to force the federal peace talks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, even if the federal government decided to end the war very passively, the cheers on all the land in the federation resounded. A war has laid the hearts of the federal people's pride and confidence. Even a powerful empire can't resist the strength of the federation. In this world, the federation is already a top-ranking country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, they have experienced everything that the imperial people have suffered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uneasy, panic, why is the powerful and invincible federation turned into this look overnight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official propaganda, like the wall of the wall, did not persist in the week and was attacked. Those unbeaten legions also suffered heavy casualties in the first place. In the face of overwhelming coverage of artillery fire, countless civilians were killed under gunfire. Even if you survived, you live in fear as you do now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground trembled and the two sentinel patrols were bypassed from the camp. It is a 12-meter-high, huge mechanical armor with six legs. It is centered on a cabin that can accommodate a combatant, like a octopus floating in the sea. A searchlight from the abdomen of the cabin illuminates the entire camp, and four black-painted machine guns are occasionally aligned with possible commotion on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wants to challenge these seemingly stupid whistle patrols, the end is very miserable, and there is no complete place to find. These robots have a very good view, and the reaction is much more flexible than what people see, and can even make climbs and jumps. In the past, the federal people could not imagine that the military equipment of the empire had advanced to this point. In some street fighting, there were similar micro-war mechanical units, which caused the federal defense to be greatly destroyed and threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two sentinel patrols left, the glaring searchlights turned from the lampposts everywhere, and there was no privacy here. From time to time, someone will search every camp, and everything except clothes is a contraband and will be confiscated. If someone is hiding, it is whipped, but it is directly shot in public. This also makes people who live here temporarily understand the ruthlessness of the imperial people, as well as cruelty and brutality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Link is just a very ordinary federal. He is just an ordinary carpenter part-time coward. He often goes to the forest around the city to cut down some of the trees that are allowed to be felled. The trees are then processed into various woodwork products for sale. Because of his good craftsmanship and real wood, he is also a small celebrity. Many people order some woodworking products, furniture or something from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrank his head and just got ready to go back to sleep. Suddenly a team of soldiers came over here. He immediately stood up and stood with other refugees. Beside his own camp. His chest was hung with his own insurance card with a work insurance number and his own photo. The soldier came to his front and stopped. This made his heartbeat start to accelerate and his breathing became rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier glanced at the chest and asked, "Are you Mr. Link? The carpentry?"<br /><br />&nbsp Link&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke swallowed and nodded. "Yes, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier looked at him coldly again. Link's labor insurance number, silently read the side of the notebook in his hand, and then nodded. "Go with me, some things need you to cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a feeling of sympathy in the eyes of the surrounding refugees. This is definitely not a good thing. Poor Link may never return again as soon as he goes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They guessed nothing wrong, and Link never came back after he left. The space left by him was quickly arranged for other people. Every day, some ordinary people were captured on the front line and then sent to various refugee camps in the back for temporary resettlement. No one knows what happened to Link, and even soon forgot that there is such a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke uneasily and the soldiers crossed the majority of the refugee camp to the temporarily built house in the management area. He met an Imperial officer and the young officer saw It’s only 30 years old and up, it’s handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Link, I am Major Eric. Maybe this is not the most suitable occasion, but it is definitely the most suitable time!", the major officer named Eric is a good friend of Doolin. He got what he wanted, Du Lin was also, and they also became good friends. After the Freedom Front was annihilated, Eric’s eunuch who provided important information was quickly promoted to the school’s official, and his boss named him to participate in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war in peacetime is an invaluable resource, yes, a valuable resource. The advancement of the army is not only a step-by-step hybrid, but also a war. Only war can bring more benefits and faster promotion. Eric’s boss is very optimistic about him, and the Security Council also has war missions, so he came to the federation with the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he was assigned a task. The General Command and the General Staff have drawn up a plan to surprise the federal financial town of Saint-Louis. Saint-Louis has always been the economic center of the Federation and the home of the Federal Bank’s head office, where a great deal of wealth has been gathered. If you can capture the Sanluo, it is definitely a heavy blow for the federal people who are already in the doldrums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the plan is finalized, it will reach the front line, and the Security Committee will also participate in it, and of course, the military department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke is not clear about this, he just looked down and looked at the toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric has poured two glasses of wine, one is holding himself, and one is for Link. "Drink a little, so you will be more comfortable." He said Even if Link didn’t drink, he put the glass into his hand. “I heard that the wood you used to do is going to the forest to cut it yourself?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke subconsciously nodded, this is something everyone knows, and then he realizes that it is not unusual, and some nervous sip a drink. When the wine was sucked into the mouth, it seemed to be in the mouth, and then the flame turned into a fire snake and got into his stomach. Soon the flames softened, dispelling the chill, and some fear, which made He took the initiative to start talking, "Yes, sir, that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric was nodded with satisfaction, and there was a huge map in the room. He stood in front of the map and looked for a moment, then asked, "I heard that there is a road in the forest that leads to Saint-Louis, and you are familiar with this forest, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint-Louis is about two hundred and thirty kilometers away from here, and there is an almost primitive forest between the two places. The federation may be the first country to begin to claim an ecological balance. None of them, after the earliest excessive deforestation, the federal government banned excessive deforestation. Almost all the wood needed for factory production is imported from other countries and is not produced locally. This allowed the federation to keep several large virgin forests intact, and Eric said one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are maps, although there is a compass, everyone knows that marching in the virgin forest, even with compasses and maps, may not be able to find the road accurately. And the terrain in the forest is not familiar with them. There are many things like swamps, lakes, rivers, etc., and the ecological environment of the original forest is also full of dangers, such as poisonous plants and animals, including some insects or something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires a local who knows the forest very well as a guide to help them get through the route, and then the federal attacker has not responded before, the surprise attack is completely Prepared for Saint-Louis, destroying the federal financial center in one fell swoop and letting the entire economy collapse completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke didn’t know what to answer. The Eric’s question actually knew that there was a road in the forest, but that road It has been abandoned for a long time, and there is no difference between it and no. In the past, many smugglers used that way to smuggle goods. Later, after the outbreak of the Civil War, the trade rules in the federation changed dramatically. Many things were no longer afraid of being inspected. Naturally, some smuggling routes were abandoned. As for being familiar with this forest, it is absolutely certain. In order to pick the better wood to make the best furniture to sell the most expensive price, Link often goes deep into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric turned back and glanced at Link, smiling. "I will be your default, then new questions, you will help us through this." The forest, then appeared on the outskirts of Saint-Louis?”, Link kept silent, but Eric said, “Very good, I also promised you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Link immediately retorted, "No, I don't have..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric turned and waved, Stopped him from continuing and asked an irrelevant question, "Do you know why I will choose you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
