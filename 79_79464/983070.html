			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone cheers for Donald’s new policy, so someone must shake his head for his new policy. These people are without a doubt the city of Otis. "The capitalists who followed Du Lin's footsteps." They either seceded from the Chamber of Commerce or joined the official business group for the first time. No matter what they were in the past, under the call of Doolin, they firmly believed in Doolin and listened to his instructions. I have embarked on a fast lane of development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a vested interest group in the city of Otis, if there is no such accident, if Du Lin will not be responsible for the accident, they may still be as happy as before. Sitting in the room talking about some boring topics. They don't need to worry about their business. As long as Doolin is here, no one dares to violate his rules of the game, no matter who the person is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it’s not the Doolin era, it’s the post-Dulin era, and it’s Donald’s eagerness to deny some of Dulin’s important policies to achieve the former’s inferiority. The period of political purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that they can stand farther on the shoulders of giants, but who knows that the first person standing on the shoulders of giants will definitely not be How far you look, but inferiority, jealousy, anger! Because of my own small size, I need to stand on the shoulders of others, but still not as good as others, but also to make an excited expression that accepts the help of others or even the alms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that's not what Donald hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A politician who has been in the market for more than a decade can not say that he failed, can only say that his speed is a bit slow, especially a politician from a nobleman . A wealth of resources and contacts are not used, this is the biggest ridicule for the nobles who came from politicians! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of others, Donald is a rising man. From the second person in a city to the number one, it is a huge breakthrough. However, in Donald's heart, this is not what he has come through through his own efforts. This is the "head-on" in other people's political compromise transactions. He does not even have the qualifications for over-representation. He is also very clear that his term of office is only three years. After three years, he will go to a remote place as a compensation for Du Lin's mentality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he must do something big in three years, only then can he avoid the next four years or even eight years of indulgence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main merit of negating the predecessor is the first priority after the successor took office, because only in this way can he show his visionary vision and change the plan left by his predecessor in the opposite way, only to prove that he is not weaker than his predecessor. The ability to govern. This is not the experience of Donald. It is almost the habit of most politicians. If you do not devalue your predecessor, how can you highlight the importance of yourself to the city? Moreover, it is the "miracle creator" like Du Lin. How can he turn over the mountain without demeaning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mayor of the Imperial City opened up two urban light rail transits for the city. After the third mayor took office, he fiercely approved the predecessor’s stupidity and used the money. In a place where there is no meaning. What kind of light rail is needed to have a public transportation system? Then in the next seven years, the mayor not only expanded the Imperial City Circle four times, but also built another 12 light rails within the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may see the same and their own purposes are the same, but demeaning others, it is still very helpful to raise yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this kind of inferiority is not the kind of bad work done by the predecessor in public. What are the problems here? The opposite is that they will be everywhere. Maintaining the predecessor, and then dealing with some things, showing his contempt and depreciation of his predecessor. This is a very artistic political hand, and it is by no means a simple narrative that can be portrayed by Donald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big guys in the room have no smile on their faces, and they are in stark contrast to the smiling guys at the banquet outside the two streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is a bit dull, everyone is smoking or enjoying the land, no one is talking. There was a "unity" in the many policy ideas put forward by Donald after he took office. At first they didn't know what it meant, but now they know. He wants to "unity" the people who are excluded from Doolin, and then hurt their interests to make up for the interests of those who are excluded. This is simply playing with fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should we do? We should stop him!", the owner of Golden Shield Men’s Products Company asked with a grumpy face, when Du Lin used to give these businessmen classes. Providing a small idea, that is, to reform their own hand workshops, to preserve the ability to handcraft high-end garments for the service of the elite, to produce the clothes in batches, and then sell them to the empire, even Going all over the world. With Du Lin’s proposal, with the city of Otis as the core, a large number of high-profile brands began to produce low-end and mid-end products, which made people feel happy and made these businessmen more and more united around Doolin. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is able to let those outsiders share our interests today. It is possible to drive us out of here tomorrow. What do you think the business president came here to do? Donald must have an agreement with him. The ultimate unfortunate thing is definitely We!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the shareholders who came to the casino for good luck gave him a look. "There are very clear things about this, the question is how do we solve this problem?" Do you use your mouth? Are you planning to give him a flexible tongue to please him to change his mind? Of course impossible, sir and gentlemen. We need to discuss a countermeasure, at least to protect our own interests. Next, only make the smallest people concessions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people started talking about their own ideas and suggestions, but no one said who they were dissatisfied. There are even people who have come up with a ridiculous idea, that is, dual membership. As a member of the Otis Business Group and a member of the Chamber of Commerce, all things will be solved. This proposal has made many people feel at ease, especially those businessmen who were originally members of the Chamber of Commerce and later joined the Chamber of Commerce in the Otis City. They did not object to joining the Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when everyone has been unable to reach a consensus, someone suddenly asked: "Why don't you call Mr. Doolin?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was quiet in an instant, everyone looked at the honest man, and the honest man immediately realized that this call is bound to be his fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, people have always said that Du Lin’s eating is not good. This time, Du Lin finally can say that others’ food is not good. He had expected that someone would call himself for help, but he did not expect that the call would come so quickly. He knew that it was a little relieved after Donald succeeded him. During his time in the city of Otis, Donald did not show any obvious water. A very low-key person is said to have been studying the development of the city of Otis. Du Lin felt that Donald took over as the mayor and could guarantee that his policy would not be biased in the general direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But often people’s ideas are always faster than changes. In less than ten days, Donald actually wants to undermine his own rules? This made Du Lin feel a bit absurd and feel the reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why every politician in politics is respected by his friends and enemies is not because of his personality charm, but because of his power. People are afraid of Magus because Magus is the prime minister, the head of the cabinet, if he is not? Then he may be like the old man on the side of the road, no one will stop for him and greet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
