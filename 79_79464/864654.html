			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone is very embarrassed here, then there must be a Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn’t know how Mr. Xerma got his child back, but he thought it would never be too friendly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for his embarrassment is that Mr. Knox is now in Ziwei Town and is properly kept by his father Mr. Xema and Mrs. Care of. He felt that he should tell Alisa, and felt that she should not tell her now because her emotions were too excited. What if she suddenly went crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants his mother to be a madman, so Doolin thinks about setting up his own children. As he calmed Alisa, he found the handkerchief from his pocket and rubbed the tears on his face, and... those little sticky noses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, why do women have this thing when they cry? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked away from the clothes on his body. The clothes were broken and could not be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry, I will find him, I promise!", he opened the back door and put Alisa into it, but Alisa It seems that I don't want to leave Du Lin, hold him tightly and his arm. Poor is like watching the Dulin, who knows that he wants to be abandoned, and keeps shaking his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just want to find a place to live, I won't run...", Du Lin took a little effort to put Alisa's handcuffs Open and then tucked into the back seat. He stood in the distance and scolded the Duff, who called Buck. He waved his hand. Defu’s face was like a frosty buck, and he turned his face and turned it into the back seat. Lisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Doolin knows what Buck and Dove have said, maybe he will now drop Buck and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck is particularly interested in listening to the privacy of this rich man, but he was naturally complained when he was called by his sister, but he still had time to say what he was saying, Dove. The face is black. "Do you know Merlin and Alisa?" Alisa, the woman, knows, but she hasn't seen it. Merlin has never heard of it before. Judging from the relationship between Buck and them, they should know each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dove knows what his brother is, a bit vain, a bit broken, a bit like a lot of fun, but also a bit not to be motivated, to say it is a bastard without lethality. In case he said something on the train that should not be said, it is very likely that some trouble will arise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not a simple businessman, nor a simple official. For him, if this kind of trouble can be solved in time, it will be solved in time. She didn't want to suddenly lose her brother's news one day. Although she didn't like Buck's character very much, it didn't matter how much it was her brother! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what she didn’t think was that Buck not only said it, but also said something that should not be said, for example, brother-in-law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff has not had time to reprimand Buck, but Buck asked: "What is the woman? Why she and Mr. Doolin have a child, that is Mr. Dooling’s fiancee?” Although Buck sometimes swears, he still respects Doolin, respecting the money in Doolin’s pocket and his fearsome terror rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, honestly, I am very disappointed with you. Don’t you know what everyone expects from you? You should take the initiative, no matter how like a woman. Mr. Du Lin gave birth to a child. Only in this way will there be a glimmer of hope! If Dad and Mom know it, they will be very disappointed, because...", Buck felt that he was very useful and was interrupted by Dove, which made him A little annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close your mouth, if you dare to talk like this, I will send you back, who is not useful!", when necessary Dove still puts her position and posture as a sister. She also explained some places that need attention in daily life. It just happened to see Du Lin beckoning. "When I go back, I will tell you carefully, there is nothing you imagined here. Simple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting on the bus, Dove sat next to Alisa, comforting her in a low voice. After all, the child was taken away. Even if people don't happen to suffocate, they just think that they are going crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin sitting in the co-pilot position looked at Du Lin from time to time, Du Lin knew what he meant, smiled and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car is surprisingly quiet, and there is a feeling of depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Buck closed his mouth and did not send out a superfluous noise along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car was finally parked outside a small hotel not far from the city hall. This hotel is actually included in the scope of the demolition, but it is not yet Remove it here. The small hotel has four floors and a total of thirty-two rooms. Before the development of Otis, it was not a hotel, but an apartment building. The idea of ​​the developer was to create a living area around the city hall, but Failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last week came a young man who came back from Nano Lindes, bought the house from the bank with money and converted it into The hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, there were still many people who thought that this young man was crazy. What kind of hotel does Otis need? There are no outsiders at all in this ghost place. Even the workers on the construction site will only live in the sheds on the construction site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, no one will laugh at his "stupid note", one room can live for one night, if you need hot water, add fifteen points, plus Thirty-five minutes can provide two meals, lunch and dinner. Although the food is very common, most people choose more than thirty-five points. From the beginning of business, the business is very good. In just ten days, many people have become jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the car, the owner of the hotel saw Du Lin through the gap in the iron cage, and immediately opened the lock and ran out, "Mayor "Do you need to live in the store?", the boss is the young man, it seems to be only 21 years old. When he bought the building with 3,800 pieces of savings, everyone thought he was crazy, now it seems He is the smart person. He patted his chest and said: "Free, definitely free, how many rooms do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out a ten-dollar deduction. In the hands of the young man, he smiled and said: "Although I am the mayor, I don't have a hobby of cheap! Don't worry, arrange three rooms for me, hot water."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man did not push the ten dollars. This is a very smart guy. He knows that for a wealthy mayor like Doolin, ten dollars may be very expensive in his pocket. The coins are almost the same, and the push will only make the other person bored, and he will take it down safely. He ran back to the iron cage and took out three keys and handed it to Doolin. "The keys are numbered and are on the second floor. They are not too hot during the day and not too noisy at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is very blazing during the day, so the fourth and third floors will be very hot, just like Doolin's office, the second floor and the first floor will be relatively cool. But the first floor also has a shortcoming, that is, after the evening, if there is a construction vehicle passing by, or the construction site is still under construction, the vibration will spread through the earth to the room, let people laugh through the vibrating bed while listening to mechanical piling. Or the sound of the wheel pressing over the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he took out the key on the second floor. Generally speaking, the second floor will only be taken out at the end, or there will be acquaintances, otherwise they will go to other floors. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin gave the keys to three people. He lived in the office at night. Dove also lived in a residential building next to him. The house Du Lin temporarily bought it. Live in Dove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin nodded and went to a bunch of keys to take a look at Doolin’s arm. "Then I went to rest first. The train that took a few days was really some." Tired, I didn't think it was so troublesome to go out!" He said that the truth was that after the beginning of the steam locomotive, the rest was irritating, especially the joints between the rails of each section would not be welded. So flat, every 30 seconds will be awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and looked at Buck. Buck's face was a bit pleasant. He carefully selected a key named "202" in Du Lin's hand and smiled and said goodbye to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put the last key in the hands of Alisa, Alisa still looked at Du Lin, and shook her head, eyes In the blink of an eye, he began to fill the water mist again. Du Lin sighed with a headache. This is not a question of who is right or wrong, but his responsibility is bigger. He gave the key to Dove, and then let the owner of the hotel take a key. "I will wait until she falls asleep and then leave. I don't know when I will wait until I go back. Go to rest, don't go back at night. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dove hesitated and nodded. After the three men went upstairs, Doolin chose to go to the innermost room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decoration in the room was much better than he had imagined when opening the door. At least the walls were painted, some furniture was new, and there were curtains on the windows. There is a separate washroom in the room. He looked around and determined that there was no other problem and sat in a chair in the room. "You should sleep first, and wait for you to fall asleep, then I will go."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
