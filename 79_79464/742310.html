			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irian City is located in the eastern coastal area of ​​the Yaoxing Empire. The economy is very developed and is known as one of the three pearls on the East Coast. There are gathered merchants from all over the world. Every day, huge freighters sail from the Haiping line, unloading countless goods and then filling in the same innumerable goods. The pier becomes a lively city in Irian. The place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many merchants sell their goods directly here. The low price of these goods is about 30% lower than the price of goods in stores and shopping malls, so every day A large number of citizens are cheap here. Although city managers have repeatedly asked merchants to leave as soon as possible after the process has been tax-paid, they are not allowed to sell goods to destroy the economic environment of the city. However, huge profits have caused many businessmen to take risks and risk being fined here. "Factory direct sales." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elion, with its economic development, rich products and beautiful environment, has become one of the best choices for people to travel and long-term residence. The huge population makes Yili The city has seven administrative districts with a population of more than eight million! Here you can see the hottest stars, enjoy the most delicious food, use the most advanced things, and some people will not leave after coming here, shouting here is the world of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, the sea breeze blowing from the shoreline with a touch of scent, wiped the dust on the street along the street, no need to clean the staff carefully. It is difficult to see large pieces of garbage on the ground near the sea. A group of seagulls also emerged from the cracks in the rock and neatly landed on the pallets on the beach. Their little heads may not know why people are feeding them every day, but they know that they are here. You will definitely be able to eat spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of the kicking make the guy with sleepy eyes squinting immediately, he adds a little milk to the coffee that has just been filtered, and then takes it separately. A pancake was sent to the second table outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Mr. Doolin, you are still on time!", the guy with a flattering smile, the golden sunshine in the morning sprinkled on this In the streets of the East, the golden brilliance fills the streets with a sacred and holy atmosphere. The guest in front of me will come here almost every morning for half a year, drink a cup of coffee, and then have a snack at random. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bustling metropolis, the level of consumption here is not comparable to other small places. For example, this cup of coffee in front of Du Lin, if you drink in TNell, about a dollar is enough, plus half a burlap, a total of five. But here, just coffee requires two pieces plus ninety-nine points, and the burritos need a dollar, almost two to three times the level of the Terry consumer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is also the main reason why people love to go to the dock to sell bargains, because they can't afford the things in the mall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, you can’t say that you can’t afford it. The high price means higher income. The average worker’s income in a month is about 20 yuan. They are already catching up with some middle classes in the city of Tener, but here they are still poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took off his hat after nodding his head, and the suit that suits it looks like a sparkling, white striped shirt with his temperament, familiar with him. People think that he is a low-key rich, despite the fact that it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The running sound in the ear and the rushing breath made Du Lin pull out a dollar bill from his pocket, and the newsboy took off the cap and wiped it with his sleeve. The sweat on his face and head, carefully rubbing both hands on his trousers, put the latest newspaper today on the chair next to Doolin, and took a brand new piece from Du Lin with his hands. money. The newspaper actually only needs fifty, and the other fifty is the tip that Du Lin gave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to see hustle and bustle in this city. The local government’s policy is to kill everything that might affect the image of the city. The tramp, the hustle and the street are almost impossible to find, and even if there are a few, they will soon be sent to the seventh district to force work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only the sixth and seventh districts in the seven administrative districts where factories can be built and away from the main city, where industry is never the main force of the regional economy, naturally There is also no strong support from the City Hall. If it is not for the city's supporting enterprises and the integrity of the project, it may not even have a factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the intelligence network here is mainly composed of these newsboys. Each district has two or three intelligence organizations composed of newsboys. They have a bar as the core, and a complete professional system makes the information transactions here very orderly and safe. Dooling can go directly to the bar to buy intelligence, but the information he buys is never as fresh as the information owned by the newsboys who are running in the “first line”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumption of 50 yuan per day has already allowed Du Lin to get a lot of valuable news from it, so he will come here every day and will sit here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much for your generosity, I wish you a happy day!", the newsboy once again took off the cap and bowed, he liked Du Lin, because Du Lin is very gentlemanly, even in the face of his inconspicuous social bottom, it is still very polite and very polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Du Lin nodded, the newsboy smiled back a few steps and ran back to the street to start sending newspapers in order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin regained his gaze and focused on today’s newspaper. When he opened the newspaper, his eyes were condensed, his pupils shrank a little, and at the same time Take a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the front page of the newspaper, there is a guy he knows under the bold black font - "The Imperial Central Bank admits defeat, Cannes The president of the branch quits resigning. The photo sits on the left side of the mayor of Peter. The face is ugly, and Du Lin can't help but laugh a few times, then start reading the full text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after leaving Doolin, the State Police Investigation Bureau immediately dispatched a large number of agents to Tener, on the one hand, investigating the issue of gold robbery, On the one hand, the reasons for Prando's death and serious injury were investigated. Karur was secretly arrested and finally disappeared. Lewis was shot dead by three people on a steam locomotive leaving Turner. The underground forces of the entire city were greatly cleaned, and many clues were broken, and there was no progress in detecting the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp then returned to Orodo to continue to detect his serial killings, and he knew that the robbers had left on the basis of leaving no sense. . But he didn't have enough evidence to prove that Du Lin and his group were robbers, so he knew it, but he couldn't say it. He is a fair prosecutor, and his fun and pursuit is to punish those who are self-righteous in prison. He can say that Du Lin is a robber, but what if he doesn't? He knows that the three forces that exerted strength in this case are from the top, so he is even less dare to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially on the second day, he originally thought that Alisa would become the killer of the sanctions against Du Lin, and finally found that this was a useless clue when Amp I decided to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that in this empire, he will also meet Du Lin, because he and Du Lin are unwilling people, this kind of person always wants Get something out to catch your eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
