			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colt calmly looked at his capable hand and stood down against the wall, just like the one in his family who made a mistake at school. Child, a look of shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very simple task, just keep an eye on a person, whether it’s Mr. Colt or the powerful man, I think it’s really It's a trivial matter that can't be simple, but the problem lies in this little thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time this powerful man - he actually has his own name, called Ge Wen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwen thinks it’s too simple to stare at a big man, even if you are standing in a crowd, you can see at a glance that the overwhelming majority of people have a head. The guy walked around the crowd. He understood the meaning of Mr. Colt, after all, he was a powerful man of Mr. Colt. When this silly big man named Graf took the highly unique fruit wine and sold it in two days, he knew it was a gold mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Colt, that miner... No, mine owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His task is to stare at Graf, see who he wants to contact, who is his real home, and then find this height from his home The source of fruit wine, and the agent became the sole distributor of the city of Tener. This is a very important task, and Gewen believes that no one other than Mr. Colt's powerful assistant can do the job. On the first day, he followed Graf back to the station, then waited outside the station at night, and followed Graf to the station building. He spent the night at the corner outside the work house, and fell asleep in the middle of the night, so he remembered that he still had a task, and he was a good partner of Mr. Colt. He started very early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at a worker from the workshop and walked to the station, but did not see Graf. He was already cold in his heart. After nine o'clock, Graf yawned out of the workshop and stood at the door and held a lazy waist. He wiped the tears from the yawn and rubbed it with the eyelids. On his sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, he watched Graf go to the station and left the station with a small man... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't see Graf taking the wine to the bar to find his partner Mr. Colt, Gewen may not believe that the guy who is late and leave early can step on the dog, and he is favored by a supplier. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many days, Mr. Gewen had nothing to gain. Sometimes Graf did not come out for a day or two, but as long as he came out, he seemed to go to the station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is even more outrageous, he has not seen Graf out of the workshop for more than ten days, he even wants to call the police, that guy will not It was because of the contradiction between the workers and the workers, and there was a dispute. They were killed in the inside. If he didn't want to see what was happening inside the window of the work house, I am afraid he would not find that there are two doors in this work house... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you have been standing at the door of the factory for more than ten days, but you don't know that Graf has left, right?", Mr. Colt The whispering is like explaining the mistakes of Gewen. Gewen is ashamed to look up. He doesn't know that there are two doors in the building. What if he knows? Ah, what can you do? He has only one person, how can he possibly see two doors? Although I am ashamed in my heart, there is still a little bit of reluctance. Anyway, this mistake cannot be attributed to myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the plain text, Colt is almost angry, how can he be so stupid, stupid to let others feel despair? He must be so big because he is the illegitimate son of God? Otherwise, this stupidity is on the average person, and the damn is already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Mr. Colt’s cultivation is good. After all, he has been educated and has always been advertised as a civilized person, so he does not want to pick up the ashtray. Who to throw, just put it in a different place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gwen, would you drive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwen should have a voice, he will Driving, before he became Mr. Colt, he had been a driver for a while. If it wasn't for the car's steering wheel, he wouldn't lose the job, and naturally he wouldn't have the job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Colt nodded with satisfaction. "Very good, people with a skill can always be impressive. From tomorrow, you will go." Drive, it's a very important job, whether the whole bar has wine to sell, it depends on your timely transportation. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that he was about to take on such an important job, Gewen was very happy. He grinned his head and said, "I will not live up to your expectations. Sir, I will be the best driver!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment of Gewen really thinks so, until he happened not long ago, he thought so, and Mr. Colt also thought so. Isn't it the delivery of the goods in the car? What else can I do? On the street in the city of Tener, you can see a car passing in five minutes, and the traffic is quite congested! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Colt has waved his hand. "Doing a good job is the greatest support for me. You should first hand over the work!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving Gewen, Mr. Colt pulled out a pocket watch in sterling silver from his arms, and his daughter’s photo turned over after opening the lid. Inexplicable in my heart, I gently brushed my daughter's photo with my thumb, just like my daughter was around. Looking at the time, from five or fifteen minutes, Graf almost came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I can suddenly think of myself today is that a man named Ge Wen is staring at Graf, or because Graf tells him to start today. Delivery, the wine will be delivered before 5 pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of ten boxes, one hundred and twenty bottles, according to Graf's ten dollars a bottle, is one thousand two hundred. Although the payment of 1,200 pieces is more, it can also represent a lot of income. The cost of one hundred and two hundred pieces can be exchanged for at least about 800 to 900 pieces. The reason why this number is not stable is mainly because of the bartender. A good bartender puts an extra ice in the cup and pours a little less, which saves a few, and the three bottles can have two more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those honest and docile bartenders are very real... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At five o'clock five o'clock, Graf and the two boys pushed in and they put ten boxes of wine in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only so much?", looking at the ten boxes of 120 bottles of wine, Mr. Colt frowned, he certainly knows this wine How popular it was, the last time because there was no such wine, there were several stable consumers who complained, and one of the regular customers never came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf may have learned to shrug recently. He shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands. "There are only so many, because for some reasons I don't quite understand, basically every bar has so many matches every month. Goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred and twenty bottles, it looks like a lot, four bottles can be sold every day, that is, twenty cups. In fact, it can only count ten cups, because it is two kinds of wine, so each wine has only two bottles, that is, less than ten cups, counting ten cups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supply is not enough for the guests to enjoy, some guests will drink three or four cups a night, two or three guests, or even one table Guests can consume two bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wine is a favorite of the guests, and of course the honor of Mr. Colt and the Wild Rose Bar, but if it does not meet the needs of all guests, A troublesome thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr. Colt blurted out, "If I am willing to spend a little more money? Can you give me the other person?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glafton smiled and revealed two rows of slightly yellowish teeth. "If you don't mind spending a little more money, it's not impossible."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calmness of Mr. Colt’s face is back, the fare increase will increase the price, and finally this part of the money is still on the head of the guests. He smiled and said: "How much do you want to add?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without fifty boxes, twelve bottles."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than fifty boxes, no more than one hundred boxes, fifteen bottles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One hundred or more boxes, all Eighteeneen bottles!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graw every time a price is quoted, Mr. Colt’s face is black, when he hears more than one hundred boxes When you have a bottle of 18 yuan, you can't wait to take a bite on Graf. The businessman who has seen the black heart has not seen you so mad, how can you not double it? Mr. Colt immediately picked up the pen on the table and wrote and painted. Finally, if he had to enter a hundred boxes, he would need 19,960 pieces, and the average bottle would cost more than 13 pieces. Then no matter how much you buy, it is a bottle of 18 dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呸, profiteer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
