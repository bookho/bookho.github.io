			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this time does not leave here, then Du Lin will face the siege of several mobs armed with weapons. Although he came from the country, although he looked a bit straight, he is definitely not an idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the mad dog Weissen rushed over with a knife, Du Lin turned and ran. He does not think that his flesh and arms can block the greeting of sharp irons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person ran ahead, several people chased behind, chased after almost two streets, the next few people gasped and stopped, looking The fast Du Lin, who was still running, disappeared into the corner of the street, and the breath of the breath became uncomfortable. They are gang members, not athletes. It may be very good to ask them to fight and kill. But they are really not good at running such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... what is the kid?", mad enough for Weisen to support the street lamppost, like a tired Haba mouth, spit Panting with a big mouth and a big mouth. The pain in his chest was partly due to the rapid gasping that caused the mucous membranes in the trachea to become dry and tight, while the other part was qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots around him walked with his hands on his knees, and he said intermittently: "Like...called...Du Lin?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After stopping the run, Weissen got better. He slammed on the lamppost and shot a few Mars. "Let our people find him!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Durin ran a long distance and did not find that after the pursuit of the soldiers also stopped breathing, he was very uncomfortable, not because he might face gang revenge and uncomfortable, Nor is it because the running is uncomfortable because he lost an opportunity to make him successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He punched the wall on the side of the road. These damn gang members are really awful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he still has a question in his heart, what is the cost of the security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he came to the city, there wasn’t one thing going on, except for the one dollar earned on the first day. No one wants to recruit him, and there is no way to make money. Every day, he has to endure an unpleasant taste in the bridge. The food that is eaten is also the cheapest whole-grain bread. The stuff is harder than the bricks. Only a few white spots can be left with a stone. Drinking groundwater pumped by the roadside pump, this big half-month has not even eaten a hot meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hard to find an opportunity for him to fulfill his life's wishes, but it was destroyed by these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some frustration that bypassed two streets and returned to the bridge hole. He needed a good, quiet thought about the future. But when he was close to the bridge, the whole person was stunned. Because there are many wild dogs and mice near the bridge hole, he cleaned the bridge hole and made a simple door with a piece of discarded wood. When he left, he blocked the bridge hole and prevented the rats or wild dogs from slipping in to destroy him. Backpack and clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now... the door has been split and left behind, and he rushed into the bridge hole, and the whole person instantly became disheartened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things are gone, including the damn cigarette box. He hid the cigarette box behind a loose brick, and now the brick is at his feet, and the small iron box is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been one thing for almost a month, and he squatted on the floor against the wall of the bridge hole with his face stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this God's torture to me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he grew up, he went back to the country and then thought about his life for a lifetime. But very quickly, this thought was swallowed up by the mad flame, and his hands slowly put down, clenched into fists, and his eyes twitched a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I can’t just go back. This is not God’s torture to me, but the test of God for me! Rushing over, rushing past is a smooth road of light. If I fall here, I will be a countryman who is not seen by people for a lifetime! God has given me precious wealth, how can I be degraded? Nothing can stop me, isn't that something difficult? Come on, fight you and die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the four five-pound coins in his pocket and turned away from the bridge hole, now his idea is no longer how to quickly become a high The decent person of society, but how to survive in this city, and then find the way to the ideal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure?", an old man with a gray hair and a gold-colored reading glasses in his left eyelids looked up at him. The old man was very well dressed, and the decent suit and white shirt set off a very noble temperament. In the face of the elderly's inquiries, Du Lin nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the recruitment office of the steam locomotive station. The steam locomotive is something similar to the train in the Doolin dream. Both need rails, but the power source is different. The train drives steam to create a heavy wagon by burning the boiler, while the steam locomotive uses something called twins as the power source. It is only necessary to place the twin crystals in the mechanical packing port, and with some catalyst, the twin crystals can continuously release unimaginable heat and gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time with some water, steam appears. It includes cars on the road, and some large machinery in the construction site, almost as long as it is machinery, are made of twins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel City may be a bustling metropolis in the eyes of Doolin, but for the entire empire it is just a border town, except for food There is basically nothing good outside the animal skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes, there is wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Tener is only a border town, it does not prevent the "Tnell Station" from becoming an important part of the entire Empire Rail Transit. Every day there are steam locomotives passing by, unloading a lot of cargo, or loading a lot of cargo, and then leaving here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether loading or unloading, it needs to be done manually. It is said that in some of the most prosperous cities in the empire, machinery has been used to replace the work of manpower, and more than one parade has erupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in such a rural place, it is obviously cheaper to use labor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool is always the bottom of the work. But whoever has the ability to do this, who is willing to spend a lot of time and energy in this way to earn the most meager salary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Du Lin came to apply for the porter, the station manager needs to confirm it again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call me Klien. Before you work, you need to sign an agreement. You need to work at the station for at least six months. If you leave the station for any reason for six months, you must pay a penalty of fifty." Klien took a contract from the drawer and placed it on the table. The salary for each month is a piece of five. For every standard piece of goods you carry, you have a reward of two cents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides, we will provide you with a place to live. There are two meals a day. You don't need to pay anything else. If you have no other objections, you can sign it here." Turned the direction, the index finger poked at the top of the agreement, pushing forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the agreement on the table, and for a long time, it was embarrassing to say: "Sorry, I will not write my name."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krynn brows up and doesn’t show any expression of ridicule. He nodded slightly. "Don’t be sad, kids, lots of people working here. Will write his own name.", he re-transferred the agreement, signed the name of Doolin Kerma, took out a red clay box, "press a handprint here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although this may be a bit...but I think you should be young, at least learn how to read a newspaper, how to write your own name, what do you say?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stepped back two steps after pressing the handprint. He felt that he was getting better from Mr. Klein, and that it was full of extravagance from the clean red. The closer the table is, the more humble you are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People should be equal, but in this room, facing Mr. Klein, he feels that there is nothing in the same thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his head and responded. "Yes, I am going to find a school after I want to make money."<br /><br />&nbsp Mr. Klein took a look at the agreement and took it out and pushed it to the edge of the table. "Very good, learning can enhance people's literacy and cognition. I know there is a special older age." The place where the person teaches, and the price is very cheap. Of course, you should also understand that if you can learn something in a cheap place, the key lies in yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was just about to end the conversation and suddenly remembered something. "Right, after you signed the agreement, you are the worker at the station. In a few days, there may be people from the union coming to you. My suggestion is not to treat them as one. "He smiled." He smiled and put the agreement in the drawer. Then he tied his hands and fingers and placed it on the table. "Well, you can go back. Before 5 o'clock tomorrow morning, report to the station warehouse. Someone told you what you should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
