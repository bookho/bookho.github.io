			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard of your past, I am sorry about your experience." Du Lin twitched a cigarette and threw it at Dufo, the latter Quickly catching with both hands, he had not had time to point, Du Lin took out a bronze lighter from his pocket. The lighter is also something that has only risen in recent years. It is expensive and of course beautiful. Many people are very interested in this kind of small things that can show their status. Therefore, the sales of lighters are rising, and people who have a little money will buy one in their pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the increase in the market means that more hot money will enter the industry, and various cheap brands with varying quality will fill the entire lighter industry. . Up to now, there have been more than a dozen cases of burns caused by kerosene leaks. People's brand and quality requirements for lighters are also getting higher and higher. Businesses with word of mouth are getting better and better, and the prices of goods are getting higher and higher. Companies that do not establish a brand effect are miserable and face the risk of bankruptcy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lighter in Du Lin’s hands is the product of the “Bondi” industry, the largest lighter manufacturer in the empire, selling for up to 38 yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddhas look at the flames and almost forget that this time should be put together, and the smoke will be smashed. He knew the lighter, but he was not because of the price of the lighter, but because of Du Lin’s action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gang, the class and rank are very strict, and the more powerful the gang, the more obvious this boundary. There has never been a practice in the gang for a lower-level cigarette, except for a special case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin wants to hold him and let him promote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha excitedly went forward, stretched out his hands to cover the flames, pointed the cigarettes at the flames, took a breath, and immediately retreated. . The muscles on his face are shaking and changing. He doesn't know what kind of state he should show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too sudden, especially after I’ve just learned how much money Dolin has earned, he’s likely to be promoted, which is really sudden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took back the lighter and put it back in his pocket, looking at the Buddha who forced himself to calm down but failed. He smiled. "We are a collective, we It’s a brother, now, and later. I don’t think that building a class is a better way to manage it, but we can only do it without the new and superior management methods, even if it’s not my own intention.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From today, you are the leader!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, the income of private liquor sales will be 0.2% of your income. Dividend power, the rest of the brothers and sisters share a 1% dividend right. And your task is to supervise the quality of our wine and to avoid mistakes as much as possible.", Du Lin smiled and smiled again when he looked up The smile on the face is as sunny as the sun. "Of course, if someone wants to stop us from gaining a foothold in this troubled world, you are also obliged to solve them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go, tell everyone this good news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin waved his hand, and all of them excitedly and respectfully took a few steps, turned and went out and closed the room. door. The moment he closed the door, he saw Du Lin standing on the window sill looking out the window, the sun shining in from the window, and he was bathed in the sun, just like a revelation that God said in the Bible. Full of sacredness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was closed at the end of the door, and the excitement of his heart dissipated inexplicably in the last one or two seconds. Instead, it was a kind of calm, a kind of Devotion. He turned slowly, with a gentle smile on his face, and walked into another big room. There was a small group of members in it, and the Buddha was very majestic. When he walked in, the air in the room was all the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes swept over everyone’s face, and all Buddha said with a smile, “I want to announce two things.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, I am the leader now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of young people have whistled and screamed . Dufo is still very prestigious among these young people. First, his qualifications are old enough. Not only have he come out for years, but he has also been in prison. He has a certain understanding of some of the gangs in the whole of the city of Tener, and also knows a lot of gangs. Whether a person is worthy of respect in the minds of young people is based on two points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can play, or he is very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see the promotion of the Buddha as the team leader, it is no less than an encouragement for this group of young people. It is not literally the leader of the gang, or the captain. It does not mean how many people must be managed to represent this position, and is responsible for specific matters. This kind of calling is more like a group of illiterate guys who can't find the right words and need something to think of when they call them. The leader or the captain can be seen as the person responsible for "something". For example, Du Lin now needs some people to do something for him, then he will name a leader who will arrange the members according to the content of the matter. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you succeed, you will naturally have rewards. If you fail, your responsibility will fall on this team leader. Of course, the team leader is indeed different from ordinary members, with higher ranks and higher incomes, but the same responsibilities are heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dudu became the leader of the team, which means that the fellowship is not the kind of simple fellowship, which is right for the fifteen or sixteen-year-olds. The mind. As long as they work hard to contribute to the fellowship, they will become the team leader in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha raised his hand and smiled and accepted everyone’s encouragement. “There is still the second thing. From today, every month the farm will come out. One percent of the income is distributed to all of you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the promotion of the Buddha represents that they will usher in a new life, then dividends This matter is related to the interests of each of them. Especially when the girls just said the feelings when counting money, these teenagers are somewhat embarrassed. It’s such a simple matter that it can bring in tens of thousands of returns, but it’s an astronomical number! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even some people still think about how good it is to be able to share one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thought is still echoing in my mind, and all Buddha brings this good news. Everyone’s eyes are filled with enthusiasm and looking at the Buddha. Can't help but scream loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, only one percent, it seems that 99% are not theirs. But everyone knows that even a one percent share of dividends represents hundreds of pieces. The entire fellowship will add up to twenty-nine people, and each person can get at least ten dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a region of Tener. If you sell the private liquor to the entire state or even the country in the future? That one percent per month will be tens of thousands or even more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a member of the Association, there will be a monthly fee for the family, which of course can be understood as salary, and now there are more than ten dollars. Huge income will bring changes to every family, and this is precisely what they hope, through their own hands and efforts, to change the difficult situation facing the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and listened to the "Long live the fellow" and the "Long live the Dulin" from the next door. He laughed not to let these people Such support for him, but the impact of money on the human influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
