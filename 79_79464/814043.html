			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin sees very clearly that once the power of capital begins to interfere with military matters, both the New Party and the Old Party will suspend the conflict and fight for it should not exist. The signs. The more people who are in high positions, the more clear that once the army is corrupted by the power of capital and turned down to capital, it means that the civil war will break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the current capitalists are also very smart, they can spend money to let the army help them transport goods, but they will never touch the bottom line. Regardless of the capital force, or for the current high-level empire, there is no hope that the empire will have large-scale disputes, so the three parties are trying to restrain this aspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a small accident, an isolated incident that may cause some waves, but it will never spread out. At most, someone will investigate it. That's it. Therefore, Du Lin dared to do this. He did not pay for the army to raise troops, nor did he intervene in the daily training and arrangement of the army. He was just a businessman, a businessman whose interests were threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything Mengxi brought twenty people, originally thought about bringing more, but then I thought about too many people. After he went back, it would not be easy to explain. . He is not very sensitive to politics, but he also knows that some things cannot be done. There are many people, and few people are absolutely two natures. Even if there are fewer people, even if the military is to investigate, he also has an excuse to fool the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn't care about the few people. In fact, there are so many people who are more than enough. Meng Xi put on his casual clothes and walked over to him. "Mr. Du Lin, What do we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and handed a cigarette over. "You first find a place to live, I will touch the situation." After you have figured out the group and knocked the group off, you will go back. The cost in the city for the past two days is counted as me. You should find someone to remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "How interesting is that?", the smile on Mengxi's face is like the sunshine of May. He knows that as long as it is not excessive, Du Lin will give him a supplement, which makes him a little bit too. Just want to move. It’s a good opportunity to stay in the base for a long time and always want to relax and relax. He verbally thanked Doolin for his "generousness" and conveyed the news to the soldiers. The soldiers suddenly cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Mengxi was ready to take a step forward, Du Lin reiterated his opinion again, "wine, woman, buy some small gifts and bring them back, don't Polite!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mengxi nodded, this person is a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three people are all relaxed. Du Lin asked Dudu to stop a car. They don’t know what Jerez is. But I know where to buy intelligence. After getting on the bus, Buddha said "the biggest bar in the local area" and then closed his mouth. His accent also had a little southern sound. The driver looked at the three people through the rearview mirror. When he stepped on the power pedal, the car slammed. Just flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monter’s “features” are those women who are skilled, and many tourists come here to learn about the technology with women who are skilled. Women from all over the world can find it here. Whether it is the Ogdin, the provincial, the guar or the barbarians of the North, or the women of the Federation and other countries, you can find them. Didn’t you listen to Sebray? Even women from the mysterious East are here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the core city of the empire shame industry, the whole city is a huge entertainment venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using nearly fifteen minutes, the taxi stopped outside a bar called "Thriller", even though there were people waiting in line during the day, many look Men, women and women who are very fashionable are waiting outside the door, chatting and waiting for the number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People always say that money is not omnipotent, but money is indeed omnipotent. Du Lin directly crossed the door that needed to be lined up and went to another door, which can be said to be a VIP passage, but it can also be said to be a Kaizi passage. It takes money to go through this door, and it costs a lot of money. Few people will do this, but no one is leaving. The significance of the existence of this door is of course also for the wealthy to show their own unique use, the rich need to wait? No, never need it because they have money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security guard just wanted to stop Doolin, and he was pressed by Ellis on his chest, pointing a finger at him and pushing him again and again. Back. Du Lin took out a lap of money and randomly dropped six pieces on the ground. The security guard jumped and jumped. Finally, he raised his hands and said that he was not in danger. Many young people are whistling, and some girls are writhing, perhaps trying to attract the three rich guys, looking for a big thigh, or wanting to advance in this way. field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the bar door, everything became familiar, like the sales counter used to change the small window, the two hot only left The woman in the underwear looks at the window and shows the beauty that the man does not have. Du Lin took out five twenty-dollar denominations and handed them in. The two passionate waitresses were more enthusiastic. One of them may have been a recent hand injury, or a new nail polish, which is inconvenient to use. On the counter, push the box with the money on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon she ate a bit salty and licked her lips. Du Lin didn't like to eat too much, so he was not interested in this girl. I took the money box and turned directly, leaving two girls with resentful sorrows on his middle finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar is very lively, even if there are still hours away from the evening, there are passionate girls and men everywhere, and there are sweating on the stage. More than a girl, in order to cool a little, they have to take off the extra clothes. The men who held the bottles or the wine glasses under the stage shouted loudly, waving the coins and paper money in their hands, just like crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin chose a card holder that was relatively close to the side, and immediately the girl with the rabbit ears came over. "Gentlemen, what do you need?", Although her smile is very professional, it makes people feel comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took out two five-dollar bills and stuffed them into the space where the girl could hold other things. "The best wine comes Bottle, by the way, I want to ask something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s eyes lit up, and a little unconsciously sat down with Du Lin, it was like a sleepy I squinted slightly. "Mr. looks very raw. I don't know what kind of wine you want. We have a lot of 'best' wines here." She may also eat a bit salty at noon, her tongue is at The full pink lips went up the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most expensive price!", Du Lin's cold eyes let the girl move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Du Lin's look is a little indifferent, the girl sighs slightly, knowing that such a guest is definitely not looking for fun, she still keeps a smile, turned and left. After a while, she walked over with a bottle of gin, "Mr., this bottle of gin needs 98 pieces. Do you like this taste?" Du Lin nodded and the girl opened the cover. Turned away and took the cover away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a place, the lid of the bottle is money, every night they will collect the bottle cap that they collected for a day to get the bartender in exchange for the commission, like Du Lin Kai's bottle of wine, she can at least get a commission of ten dollars. Of course, this does not mean that every girl can have dozens or even hundreds of pieces of income every day. The guests like Du Lin are a minority. Many girls wearing bunny ears want to sell a bottle of wine. It’s cheaper for the guests, and it takes twenty or thirty minutes to grind a bottle of wine for thirty or forty dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a wine has a very low commission, a bottle of only one or two dollars, plus the customer may give a one or two dollars of consumption, perhaps not, Lara's average hour of income is one or two. There are indeed three or fifty dollars in this day, but these thirty or fifty dollars are not so easy to earn. If you have to buy a wine that you have to accompany the wine, the income of that day can be seen by the guests. Give more tips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, a male waiter came over. He succumbed to the ceremony and smiled and said: "Gentlemen, don't know what you want to consult." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want all the information about Jerez, including how many people they live, where they live.", Buddha picked up from the table. A money box was handed over, and there were fifty pieces of change. The male waiter took it and held it in his hand. He shook his head slightly, which made Du Lin somewhat strange. It is reasonable to say that 50 yuan of this news should be enough. If you put it in Ilyan, it will cost twenty or thirty dollars. If you are in Tener, you may only need five yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed another money box over, and the waiter’s face was filled with a sincere smile. He saluted again. "Please go here." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people walked through a small passageway from the back door of the bar under the leadership of the waiter, empty in the back door alley, after the waiter closed the door Said: "Jerez, they live in the suburb of Louis Street, the number is 71, a single-family. They have fourteen people, each with a pistol, of which Jerez has two. On his belt, there is another one behind him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is ten minutes, from when Jerez goes out every morning, the first thing he does most often when he goes out, and at night he is used to where to get a girl to go back to sleep. Said it. If Du Lin felt that a hundred pieces were a bit expensive before, then he now feels that when he establishes an intelligence network in the future, he should also learn from it here, and record everything without much detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave the waiter a tip of twenty dollars before leaving, the one hundred is organized by intelligence, he can get one or twenty Counting more, this is what Du Lin has given him. After three more thanks, the waiter watched Du Lin leave and returned to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
