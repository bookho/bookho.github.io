			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will spread the contradiction by doing this, and finally you will find that in the political arena, you have no friends!", Magus took the initiative after watching the show. I gave Du Lin a phone call. As the current prime minister, Magus is still able to grasp the political platform changes of the entire empire. Many people have already reflected to him that Du Lin’s saturation attack is no match for me. Is it a bit too hot? The so-called politics is nothing more than the party’s singularity, uniting a group of people who can become friends, have common positions and ideals, and eliminate those who suppress different opinions and different ideals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how great a person is, he can’t change the country alone. There is always someone around him. Du Lin’s doing this obviously doesn’t fit. Natural political law, he is playing with fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a reminder to Magus that Du Lin is very grateful. Of course he didn’t become a listener, but asked a question, “Bawworth is destined to become My most troublesome opponent and even the enemy, and I don't agree with the old party. So Uncle Magus, can you tell me who I can unite, and let him still unite in me after the general election? Around?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Bobos the new leader who once targeted me, or the iconic figure of Mr. Kubar’s old party?" If you don't need Magnus to answer, you can ask yourself, "No, no one can unite around me. Even those people around you will soon fall to Bowworth, or remain conservative and neutral. The position is not biased towards either party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not you, unlike you can control these people, let them reluctantly build a brand new around me. Political group. Most of these people are older and heavier than me. They are all in high positions, and they are used to obeying your orders. Suddenly let these people come to listen to my orders... that is not realistic, Uncle Magus."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They may show me some help I need on your face when necessary, but it is limited to this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Since there are no friends around me who can be united, why do I need to take care of their faces and say something to make them feel that I am not necessarily a difficult bone?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus was silent for a while, then sighed, and he knew that Du Lin was not wrong. The top-level politics is exclusive, and the heart cabinet headed by Kubar will firmly suppress some of the new party members who are on the tail. This is one of the reasons why the old party was in power after the Maggs and Kubar agreement. He has been re-elected for too long, and the new party has been in power for too long, so that some new party members take it for granted that this empire should belong to the new party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bad sign that you need to slap their arrogance and let them re-learn awe and humility. At the same time, the new leader of the new party, Bowworth, will also more or less exclude members of the aristocratic faction, which is doomed to be in the next eight years. In a state of isolation and helplessness. His opponents are not only the old party, but also a considerable part of the new party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, since the future is an enemy, why not let those people realize that he is a bad guy and a madman. In the suppression of the big environment, composing the whole will only make his opponents get in the way. So it seems that his current behavior is not at fault, but it is very correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus was silent for a while before he said, "I can’t convince you, you have your thoughts, I don’t know if this is the right path or the wrong one. The road, but worse, it is only eight years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the situation is worse than an eight-year period, after Magus retires It will cause his political influence to decline rapidly, but the problem of keeping Doolin is not big. After the eight years passed, the old treacherous politicians should almost get off work after work. The new generation began to dominate the political arena of the empire. At that time, it was Du Lin’s turn to shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Magus felt that it was a very good lesson for Du Lin to eat at a young age. No one can keep going with the wind for the rest of his life, instead of letting him When he fell off the cloud at the peak, it was better to let him fall into the mire when he just started climbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight years is enough to give him a big growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the call with Magus, Du Lin immediately let Hersman change his propaganda strategy, compared to the more common propaganda style of the past. The choice is now more radical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
