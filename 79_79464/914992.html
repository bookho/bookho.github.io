			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new City Hall has a huge conference room, and the businessmen who invested in the city of Otis were invited by Du Lin to participate in the conference. Those who have no way to catch up Come, they also sent representatives to participate. Some of them are businessmen who are justified, and more of them have never been engaged in legal activities. But these people are now wearing dog-like costumes and sitting in the conference room as a successful person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the reason why they fear Doolin. The fearful aspect does not need to be said. Du Lin itself is very legendary, and the admiration is that Du Lin gives them The benefits brought. The city of Otis and the city of Otis six months ago are completely two cities. The past was overwhelmed by the newly built high-rise buildings, and almost no old buildings were seen in the middle of the city. This is a brand new city, a city of wonders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no investment in their investment here, they have already recovered their investment and doubled the increase - land price, house price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they fear Doolin, fear the speed at which he makes money, and fear his sultry means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time pointed to two points, the entire meeting room was quiet, and Du Lin told them to have a meeting at two o'clock, but it was already two o'clock, but no See Du Lin. They didn't want to stand up and look for Du Lin's thoughts. They all closed their mouths and sat quietly. Some people who don't understand each other are serious about closing their mouths, and they can only close their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ten minutes, Du Lin just pushed in. He apologized for his late arrival and greeted everyone. Just now he picked up a phone call and arranged a little thing, so he was late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To find everyone today, because our seven casinos have been completed, and at the latest, the city will welcome countless travelers. They will leave the same amount of money here and take it with pleasure. And this is what we have to do, and we must do it well!" Du Lin looked at several investors on the right hand side. Several of the biggest gang leaders in Nam Lindes are, "First, I don't allow anything to hurt tourists in this city, including deception, kidnapping, extortion, theft... as long as you If you need to think about whether this has hurt the visitors, then you must not do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second thing, I will distribute the shares of the seven casinos according to the proportion of your investment in the city of Otis. All of you can not exceed 5 percent of the total shares, and do not limit trading, but before buying and selling. I must be notified to let me know what you are going to buy and who to sell. You will have to pay for the construction of the casino, and there will be no other expenses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Du Lin’s voice just fell out, some people have a look of remorse, and can even be said to hate. What they hate is not Du Lin but himself. If you invest a little more money in the first place, you might get the upper limit, but it is 5 percent, but it is a business without a purchase! Ghosts know that Doolin actually uses this method to distribute the power of the casino. Some people don't invest as much as others because they need to spend more money to compete for the equity of the casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they made a mistake, and Doolin did not deal with this part of the stock through auctions as before, which made their plans fall through, now they The only hope is that the amount of investment of others and the amount of their own investment will not be too much, so that they can get more shares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third thing, I want all of you, to launch all of your network and connections, and to do your best to promote the city of Otis in November. It includes everything that is owned here. We need to let the imperial people know that this is heaven, the paradise of heaven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To this end, I need you extra I took out a sum of money..." When people heard Du Lin say this, they all stunned. They thought that Du Lin would start to suck the blood. I didn’t expect Du Lin’s words, let them a bit I can't believe my knowledge of Doolin. "Because the east-west railway is being built, I need you to buy a car for free to pick up passengers near the city of Otis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Not only within the scope of this city, but also in the surrounding areas, there must be passenger cars, and the emperor also needs someone to publicize. In one sentence, I want the entire empire to know that the city of Otis has opened its doors, and Come here and see that there is almost no money."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several requests from Doolin, some people realized that they really had to make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that they have witnessed the city of Otis from scratch and know what it has, as long as the people in the pocket have come here, do not spend The money that ends up is definitely not going to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a cup of cranberry water in a teacup and continued: "The last thing, I will set up the Otis business group. If you are interested, you can add it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business group is also a countermeasure that Dulin and Maggs came up with after discussion, not to fight against capital forces, but to fight against chambers of commerce. At present, the power and power of the Imperial Chamber of Commerce is too great. This unofficial organization carries out the power that should be enforced by the government. This is a very dangerous behavior. It may be misunderstood that many people feel that some power is always held in the hands of the Chamber of Commerce is far better than the official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are strict standards of the official, although it cannot be said that there will be no smuggling of personal malpractices, but it is definitely less than the embarrassing things in the Chamber of Commerce. There are old parties and some people who want to step on others to climb up. The cost of malpractice is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s different in the Chamber of Commerce. As long as you can afford to spend money, you have enough relationships and it’s too easy to do something. The power to lack an effective monitoring mechanism does not bring hope and can only bring about destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin thought of a way to differentiate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use regional business groups to reduce the authority of the chamber of commerce, plus the coordination of the city hall and the policy tilt, as long as there is no problem with the businessman’s brain in this area, Will join the business group. The business group accepts the official guidance of the empire and is obliged to contribute a certain amount of power to the revival of the empire. It will also receive official recognition and convenience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when members of the Chamber of Commerce and members of the Chamber of Commerce compete for a certain piece of land, the members of the Chamber of Commerce can definitely get benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy tilt of this kind is especially attractive to small and medium-sized businessmen. Once these small and medium-sized businessmen are used to the atmosphere of the business group and accept the official leadership, Under the slant of policy, they can easily catch up with big businessmen who are not members of the business group. Under the chase, the chamber of commerce will soon be eaten away, and one by one will be swallowed up by the business group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Chamber of Commerce has become a past tense, it is the day when the Ministry of Commerce was established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Dolin’s request and suggestions, the meeting continued until the evening, everyone left with a satisfied, excited smile, this meeting may be They bring huge changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in the afternoon of this day, one more thing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Mark personally called, more than 70% of the presidents of the newspapers in the Imperial newspaper industry rushed to the Imperial Capital, they will gather together to discuss the establishment The matter of the newspaper industry alliance. They are also very clear that it is the best time to kill the George family, but not many people put this idea into action. The George family is not a mistake in the newspaper's "cancer", but it is also the largest "firewall" in the newspaper industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the existence of the George family, some small micro-reports can survive. These newspapers are particularly sensitive to changes in the market. Once the George family fell down and was finished, it was followed by fierce market competition. The small micro-reports were annexed by small and medium-sized newspapers, and the small and medium-sized newspapers were annexed by big newspapers. Many people will lose their newspapers and work opportunities. They are very disgusted with the George family's monopoly on the newspaper industry, but they also get the real benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no George family, they won’t get the latest news from all over the Empire and even other countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no George family, disorderly and fierce market competition will cause many people to lose their jobs and businesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no George family, there will be no rules for everyone to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in fact, the existence of the George family is a good thing for the newspapers of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Marco arrived at the scene to discuss the establishment of the newspaper union, a group of police officers and agents suddenly rushed into the venue and forcedly dispersed the venue. All participants in the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark anger went to the head of the Imperial Police Department and asked him to explain the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the George family seems to be on the decline in recent times, it is still not the police chief who can offend, the police chief had to accompany the laughter, patiently Mark explained: "Someone called the police and said that there is an explosion of explosives. Considering the safety of everyone, the Director of the Police Investigation Bureau personally ordered us to evacuate everyone in the building and clean up every inch. There may be places where explosives are present to ensure the safety of everyone's life and property."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
