			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interview press release that Du Lin accepted, in addition to the phrase "knowledge changes fate" is the most widely spread, there is a sentence that is also popular with people. That is, "Young is the power to change the times!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially young people in these societies, both men and women, when they read this sentence, can produce a kind of place that does not know where to come The power, rising from the soles of the feet, quickly spreads to the whole body, making them seem to have the power to break the terrible rules together with the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening is enough to be exciting, and more importantly, the person who said this sentence is doing his best to prove this sentence with his own actions. value! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of Dolin’s actions are clear to everyone, he is changing the world because he is young and has the power to change the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, people put these two words in their mouths, and when they chat, they don’t care about the topic that has a relationship with Doolin. A big step in the entire era, Du Lin is like a star who has a terrible supporter among the people. Some people even took a boat or train to Ambillon to watch Du Lin’s public campaign speech and left tears of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a media comment on Doolin, who thinks that he is more like a star under the spotlight created by the times. His words and deeds can always become an empire for a period of time. The most popular sentence, he leads the trend of the times, standing on the wave of the times, is also the most outstanding young people in the empire and even the world, no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of praise from all walks of life is that Du Lin’s reputation in the West has risen to the next level. Now every time he goes to make a public campaign speech, he will choose Some places are more empty, otherwise it will not be able to accommodate many people from both local and foreign places. They are like a terrible fanatic virus, so eager to see Du Lin appear, and then listen to what he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why have you been watching me?" Du Lin was lying on the sofa, very unimaged, and there was news about him on the TV. In his arms, he kept the "kitten" and looked at Du Lin with his chin in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her face full of happy smiles, Du Lin can come to a conclusion that it is definitely not a bad thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl couldn't help but move forward, straightened her neck and kissed Du Lin's lips twice. The soft lips gave Du Lin a very wonderful touch. He smiled twice and caressed. The hair on the girl's head, "Why should I kiss me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl ignores him, just looks at him like he wants to keep his appearance forever In my heart, I will never forget it all the time. She smiled sweetly, like a pizza made by Magus' wife, sweet and greasy, sweet into the heart, into the bone marrow, into the soul, just to see her pure smile, the world will become It’s beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy Duoling took time back to the emperor, and Ophelia had a two-day holiday. They hadn’t met for a while, this time can be good. Greasy together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is not a person who will miss his thoughts. He never even said the word, but he will put his thoughts in his heart and wait. It goes to ferment and gives off an intoxicating fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the girl wants to steal her mouth, Du Lin bites her lips, the girl stares at him, between the two Less than a centimeter away, after the girl expressed contempt for Doolin's behavior in vague language, Doolin held her in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicable, at this moment, he remembered another woman, not his woman, nor in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a woman who can’t describe it, maybe it’s not that his short and embarrassing life hasn’t had love, but love’s death is too early, even with him The love was also buried in the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returned to the girl, looking at the shy girl in front, Du Lin buried in her hair, greedily sniffing the taste that only she has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More mellow than wine, more charming than flowers, the moment you close your eyes, even the Sanskrit sing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl also responded to Doolin’s actions with action. She suddenly asked, “Do you have anything to say to me?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thought for a moment and nodded. In the eyes of the girl’s expectation, he said, “His Royal Highness, you are the luckiest person in the world, because you own me. "In a series of laughter, he went on," but you don't want to be proud, I am the luckiest person, because I own you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes love words do not need to use the word "love" to express, the feelings of love reveal a kind of pride, a kind of self-confidence, this is the biggest affirmation and praise for lovers, the most love! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not as serious as it is on TV!", the girl looked at Doolin. "I believe they will never know, you will actually say Such a sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said with a smile, "Look at my eyes...", the girl stared at Doolin's eyes, her face Doubt, "What did you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eye...eye?", the girl replied with some uncertainty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People often say that the eyes are the window of the soul, you can see the heart of a person through the eyes, can't you see? In my heart, live a Man, looking through my eyes!", he said that he was still stunned and pointed at his own eyes. "Look, she is saying hello to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so cold... It's strange that it makes me feel happy, isn't all the lovers like us?", she is also living in her crystal clear eyes, Du Lin also saw the man, the guy called Du Lin, who thought it was laughing, and the girl curiously asked, "Isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love It’s like syrup, you have to control the temperature, you have to keep stirring...” Listening to Doolin’s words, the girl calmed down, quietly on his chest, his ears against his chest, while listening With his words, while listening to his powerful heartbeat, some inexplicably fascinated, "Love is never a Human things, if we cooperate with each other and keep it at all times, then the syrup will be sweet until the world becomes the color of love. But if the mixing is not timely, the temperature is too high or too low, the syrup will not be sweet. Or become bitter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be able to be like us, maybe there are only two of us in the world, because you are unique, and I am unique. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked down at the girl, and the girl fell on his chest like asleep. He smiled and gently stroked the girl's hair, slowly closing his eyes, and seemed to fall into a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it does not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
