			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have already entered the auction site, and the layout is not bad, not only the cold dining table, but also many waiters with drinks waiting for guests. At least, people can't feel that it is a desolate west. There are three states in the west, originally only two, and later because of the state where Doolin is now, that is, bordering the southern and southern parts of the empire, and not far away. Eight cities think they are not Westerners, so after the referendum was held, there was one more state in the west. Despite this, they still did not take off the name of the west, but changed from the ownership of one state to the ownership of another state, but these eight cities think they have won, at least they are farther away from the real west, isn’t it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding a seat to sit down, the guide waiter sent Du Lin and Federley a number plate, and there is still a placard. Federley is also introducing some of the guests who have already arrived to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one over there...a guy in a white dress with a red tie, he is the agent of the Jindis Metal Mining Company in the West..." Deliyang raised his chin, and Du Lin followed his eyes and saw a middle-aged man who was toasting with others. He looked a bit arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jindis Metal Mining Group is the second largest non-ferrous metal mining group in the Empire. The business scope of this group company has grown from the initial metal mining industry to all walks of life. It is said that they also got a drug laboratory and intend to develop into the pharmaceutical industry. Their main economic pillars are the rich minerals in the west and the veins they are holding in their hands. There is a gossip that it is said that the veins they have won will not be developed immediately. Most of them will be stored for several decades or even decades before they start to dig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this is to effectively control the stock of non-ferrous metals on the market, to ensure the total amount of their reserves, but also to save costs. After all, mining itself requires a lot of money, and the ingots that are produced need to be transported and stored, and a lot of money is needed. It is better to put it there temporarily, and then to mine when there is a need, which will save a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their style is very overbearing, as long as they are looking at things, they will try their best to get it, no one is willing to deal with them on mineral issues. "Fedley finally commented on one sentence and looked at another woman. "The woman is the agent of the Orvili Metal Group in the west. You have to be careful with her. I use the thorny rose to describe her. I feel it." It is the biggest tout of her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling’s gaze shifted to a woman who was “praised” by Federley. The woman looked like she was only in her early thirties. She was in good shape, wearing a black and purple dress and her white skin. It formed a strong contrast with the dark clothes, making her look very white. The five senses are also very delicate and three-dimensional. It can be said to be a very beautiful woman, and has a very special temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this woman Federley is obviously much more than when introducing the Acting agent, he told Du Lin, this woman is called Sandra. Prior to this, Orvili’s agent in the west was completed because of some problems. It is said that this woman was hand-picked. Her aim is to acquire a special position and a powerful position in the Western agent. After her inauguration, Orvili expanded its power in the West by 17%, and more than six mines were cleaned and had a direct relationship with the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the west, people gave her a good nickname, called the Scarlet Kiss, which is another name for a predatory spider that is unique to the West. This type of spider is so large that it never hangs around the net and hides in the vicinity of the water source to prey on all the creatures that drink water. The most striking feature is its two blood-red teeth. This kind of spider is very toxic. Even if the adult Gobi wolf is bitten, it can live for five minutes. In the past, there were often news that human beings were poisoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People replaced her original name with such a nickname, because her style is indeed a bit horrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a beautiful woman with a beautiful appearance, but it is extremely poisonous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last person who focused on introducing Federley was the second son of Knight, Henry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nite is the most famous steel tycoon of the empire. In the annual summary report of various industries in Xie Lisi Street last year, Knight’s “Nite Steel Group” in the steel field Sales accounted for 67% of the entire industry. Although the total sales were not accurately disclosed, many evaluation organizations gave sales of no less than 100 million, which once again caused the steel tycoon to shake the entire metal industry. Some people think that the Knight Steel Group has been able to represent the empire's steel industry and is the vane of the imperial steel industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development of the empire’s economic recovery, the total market value of Knight Steel will continue to increase until it is fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is some relationship between Du Lin and Nate's second son. The only daughter of Mr. John George is married to Nate's second son... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these people, Federley also introduced some of the main characters of the Western Mining Association and some of the local rich. As time passed, people returned to their seats and the auction officially began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, auctions like today are not the main reason for these people to participate. Most people here do not expect to bring this copper mine to themselves. Under the umbrella of the auction, they just used the auction as a platform to exchange information on the latest situation and see if they can find new projects and maintain their relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main shooter is very young, and there is no nonsense. He directly introduced the taste and reserves of this copper mine, and then hanged a starting price of one million yuan. The price has started the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is a perfunctory auction, there will be some people who will join in and see from time to time that someone will hold up the brand and it looks like the auction is very lively, but all Everyone knows that there are so many people who are truly competitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the price was raised to 1.5 million, no one would placard frequently, and the interval between each placard would be longer. The three most powerful people have not yet started, they will wait for these people to stop participating, and then they will start real bidding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the auction began for about twenty minutes, the apprentice agent of Jindisi Metal Mining raised the number plate in his hand and shouted The price of two million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few people who are still struggling with this price have also given up their struggles, and the price of two million has already broken through their psychological bottom line. The mining of copper mines is much more troublesome than iron ore or aluminum mines. The aluminum ore is not complicated from bauxite to aluminum ingots. The same is true for iron ore. Those iron ore with iron content of 50% or 60% will soon become iron ingots after magnetic separation. But the copper mines are different. The copper mine taste of this auction is only 2.1%. Simply put, it is a copper ingot with more than 20 kilograms of impurities that can be extracted from one ton of copper ore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mining, smelting, and molding time is too long, which means that the speed of returning to the book will be very slow, from the return to the net profit, there will be a very long time The process, coupled with a series of reasons outside of the business, forced these people to abandon their continued bidding – sometimes something could not be sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2.2 million!", Sandra raised the number plate in her hand very elegantly, and smiled at the agent of the Kingdes, but the latter did not have any good looks. Sandra’s one shot means that he needs hundreds of thousands of dollars to get the copper mine. The headquarters will never give him any good looks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Alvini not satisfied with many mining areas in the past two years? This copper mine is not large, so let me send those who are good at The emperor is sitting in the office, how about?", the white man squeezed out the smile and Sandra said a few words and then raised the number plate in his hand, "2.3 million... I will invite you to dinner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra is very funny when she smiles, it is the kind of smile that appears first, smiles appear again, "Mr. Clivef’s invitation I will definitely go However, you have trouble with you, and I am also troubled by me. The board of directors has set a goal for me this year. If I can't finish it, I can only be driven out of the company. It is better to give this mine to me... Two hundred and five thousand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people at the auction site are holding their breath, and after the price of 2.5 million, there is basically no competitor. Even Mr. Clarence, the agent of the Jindis Metal Mining Group, closed his mouth. At the price of 2.5 million, he can actually continue to shout, but it has become meaningless to call again at this time. In addition to wasting more cash to buy a non-rich mine that will not be mined for a few years to a decade, the group's top executives will certainly consider it a failed investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes were on Sandra’s body, and it was clear that the scarlet kiss lady had taken another vein. There are envy, awkward, and hateful. In short, a lot of eyes are mixed and people can't tell, but this is the so-called high society, full of more hidden desires and impulses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin raised the number plate in his hand and issued the first voice at the auction today, "Three Millions!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment he shouted the price, everyone’s eyes converge on him, including Clarence and Sandra, and Henry’s accidental discovery The existence of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Is there something wrong?" Du Lin smiled and shrugged his shoulders. He looked at the people around him who looked at him, those The people took their eyes one by one, and at this moment they knew very well that it seemed that the forces inherent in the West had to change again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
