			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the hotel standing in the elevator, Phyllis’s slightly anesthetized head of alcohol made thinking slower, but it also made him finally in a relative In a peaceful state. A little heavy eyelids will have a flowing stun feel from the soles of the feet every time they close, and they will run into the head and turn around for a moment, disappearing without a trace at the moment of opening their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis knows that he has done a very bad job in the past few days, but this can’t really blame him. The plan at the headquarters has changed. He can only follow the trend. The change has changed. But he knows that he is not doing well enough. It is too simple to look at this trip to the west. Fortunately, I had a head with Perito tonight, and I had initially negotiated cooperation. Even if the head office knew that he had changed the plan without authorization, he should not blame him. As long as he can get enough contracts to build the imperial central bank's insurance business, he has credit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound accompanied by a slight weight loss, the elevator door slowly opened, his eyes suddenly became a lot bigger, his face changed, one step Going out, walking and asking: "What happened, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside his door, there is an assistant who is with him, Anxious back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assistant saw Phillips as if he had seen the savior and strode toward Phyllis, and said as he walked, "Du Lin didn't know where to get a few funds account is still in the acquisition contract, and the people of the Southern Commercial Bank also started to buy the contract, they are secretly snatching those contracts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A thunder blasted in the mind of Phyllis, his footsteps, the role of time seems to stop on him for a moment, his eyes also become stiff, and then he will return to the clear after a while, while Some bloodshot eyes appeared on his eyes, and his blood pressure increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great power of time finally defeated all other factors again, and it was reflected in Phyllis. He settled in one step and took a deep breath, alcohol Let him be slow, and let him not become too violent. "I will inform all the sub-branches immediately. After 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, I want them to bring the bank staff to the streets of their respective cities and let everyone know. Our central bank also started to buy contracts, and the concessions are bigger than Southcomers and Doolin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice opened the door and let the assistant enter the room. And asked him to elaborate on related matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the explanation of the assistant, Phyllis learned that from three o'clock in the afternoon, a total of 11 people in the southern commercial banks appeared in the city, they placed a door in the living quarters of each urban working class. Table and equipped with at least three employees. They printed a large slogan to inform them of their tasks here, but if they were willing to transfer the contract to the Southern Commercial Bank, they would not only be exempted from the three-phase insurance, but also had a cash back of five dollars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some preferential measures in place, which is equivalent to 15 yuan for each contract purchased. Fifteen dollars seem to be not much, but These people in the West are still very attractive. Some of the wavering people were quickly attracted to the Southern Commercial Bank and sold the contract to the Southern Commercial Bank. So far, they have won at least 40,000 contracts, and it is likely that this number will continue to grow exponentially tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice patted his cheek, and the slight tingling made him wake up a bit. He indulged for a moment and said, "By the way, let them tell them, as long as they put the contract Transferred to the central bank, we exempted them from three months of insurance, and then sent them ten dollars.", after telling these, Felice will let people do, he sighed down on the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Perito’s verbal pledge to work with him, and to arrange for people to buy contracts in the back, Felice did not care, first of all, Perito They did this before they met, and secondly, from a commercial point of view, Perito’s behavior did not have any blame. On the contrary, he himself, but there are mistakes in succession. Perhaps he is not suitable for the job at all. He has already begun to consider whether to apply for a substitution from the head office. He really can't do such a complicated thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the imperial central bank, the governor is the role of an executor. The board of directors formulates the completed plan, and then the directors are responsible for supervision and enforcement. Most of the directors are in accordance with the regulations. work. The head office will tell them every step, they only need to follow each step, and even if they encounter some changes, most of the directors can solve them well. But this time, the change side is too fast, too big, and Felice feels that her ability is insufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of struggling here and finally failing, it is better to let someone else accept the responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice’s heart breeds a desire to retreat, and successive mistakes and failures make him fearful. In order not to bear more responsibility, leave this early. The vortex is the most correct choice. Of course, before he leaves, at least some things have to be arranged, such as this huge offer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early the next morning, Du Lin ran for a while after getting up. He was in a good mood and very happy. In the past few days, a total of more than 400,000 contracts have been acquired, which has already earned him a share of about 12%, which is enough for him to gain a foothold in the next competition, with the Southern Commercial Bank and With the addition of the imperial central bank, this battlefield will attract more financiers and consortia, and they will try to absorb some of them. Whether it is as a chip or really want to try the insurance business, it is possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After these shares were eaten by everyone, when they thought they could make a career, Du Lin couldn’t wait to see their shocked expressions. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, because they are not authorized by the Doolin patent, so they only have to run the insurance business, then they have violated the patent law. Although it is indifferent to infringement on the Big Mac economy, it doesn't matter to the lawsuit, but Doolin has a way to drag them into the quagmire, so that they can't eat fish and get mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a lap back home, Dove told him that Julio had called him and hoped he could call back after he returned. For Julio's sudden call to Doolin, Bailito was attracted by Julio, and Julio was the first "victim" of the three-guarantee policy. The big strike that was going to break out was to go to Julio because he wanted to overthrow the legitimacy of the policy of negating the three guarantees. This made many insured people who paid the insurance for many years suffer from excessive scare. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he wants to contact himself, in fact, for several reasons, it’s nothing more than that Perito wants to talk to himself, absolutely not Julio Talk to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a shower and changed his clothes. As the weather became hotter and hotter, the sun in the west began to violently, and the strong sunshine all day long. People start to sweat, even if the temperature is not high at this time. Du Lin, who had changed into a cool dress, sat down on the lounge chair by the pool, let Dove get him a glass of iced juice, and then made a phone call to call the Julio office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julio is as gentle as ever, and even Du Lin can hear the "consultation" component from his voice. Du Lin is also very impressed with this. Not every mayor faces an unofficial businessman or ordinary person and can maintain an equal attitude. At the inviting invitation of Julio, Doolin agreed with his invitation, and he met with him and Perito in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
