			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the bar is very lively. After the second ban, the many unlicensed bars in Orodo are completely extinct, which gives those The bar owner of the license can wake up in the middle of the night. The huge profits generated every day give these people an illusion that they are the richest people in the city, even if they are not, and will be after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave walked over to the bar and asked for a cup of scorpion-flavored wine. Although it was wine, he drank water from this glass of wine. the taste of. He looked at the bartender with a strange look and shook his glass. "How much water did this add? Or how much wine did you add to this glass?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The bartender has not been said to be broken, this kind of thing happens often, everyone has long been accustomed to it, in the words of the bartender, love to drink, do not drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he will not behave so directly. He just looked up at Dave and continued his work. "Man, don't you know that the second ban on wine prohibits all high-alcohol wines as contraband?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you have redeemed the water?" Dave’s eyes widened and he was able to make the hypothesis so arrogant and drink the decree. He heard it for the first time. Let me drink something?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if the Bureau of Prohibitions had no good way to distinguish the alcohol content in the shortest time, they used a kind of Very popular way. When the wine can't be ignited directly, and there is no wine that burns the throat, it is not a high-alcohol, which gives the bar a lot of room for operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender took a three-ounce cup on the table and took a bottle of wine from under the counter to fill him up. "This wine Four dollars, this time is not water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave took the money and took it on the bar, took a sip from the glass, this time he was very Satisfied, at least he can't drink the taste of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this kind of wine from 20 degrees to 30 degrees is the most likely to be drunk, because there is nothing unusual when drinking, when it is already aware Drank too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already more than twelve o'clock in the middle of the night when I came out of the bar. Dave shook his head and tilted his head slightly, his eyes turned up and looked forward. It seems that turning the eyeballs is a difficult thing for him. Instead, turning his head is simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordos also has taxis at night, especially at the door of the bar. With a few bars starting to open all night, there are always some drunken people going home to become a hassle. The bar will not let the guests get drunk in the bar, even if the identity of the other party may not be ordinary, it will throw people out. This involves another problem. All recreational business places have a defined number of people. Only the people inside can come out, and only a new guest can enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these bars have expanded their business base and made appropriate fire prevention measures, they can still not solve the fact that there are too many guests. Every day at night, there will be long queues at the entrance of the bar. These are all banknotes that will move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So those who have been thrown out have become the "babies" of taxi drivers. These people don’t care if they don’t care how much it costs to take a taxi. Drivers like to line up at the bar door at night, as long as they pull a guest, they earn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get on the bus, the drunk Dave reported a place name, and the taxi slowly started, neither the driver nor the Dave in the car paid attention. By the time they passed by the nearest street, a truck that had extinguished the headlights suddenly started to follow them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guest, the street lamp in front of the road is broken, can't you walk from the road next to it?", the taxi driver asked, Dave subconsciously agreed. One sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not arrogant to understand the meaning of a sentence now, can understand it is already good. The taxi driver showed a sly smile, and this is why they dare to detour, because the passengers themselves agreed. He turned the steering wheel toward the suburbs, and when he was almost back, he was able to make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the taxi driver circled a region according to his usual habits, suddenly two bright lights blew the darkness and made him short In the state of blindness. The car accident happened, and the surrounding lights were quickly lit up. Some people used their sticks to poke their heads out of their homes. They saw a panic and did not know how good young people were rushing in the scene of a car accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who will save them? God, I am in trouble!", the young driver is sweating, and soon the people living around will work together. The driver of the taxi and the Dave in the back seat were dragged out of the deformed car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxi driver is dead and can no longer die. Although Dave still has a sigh of relief, his constant vomiting of blood also indicates that he will not live long. Soon the ambulance and police car arrived at the scene. The doctor checked the two injured people and shook his head. There was no need for any rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young driver was taken away by the police on the spot, and the two cars were also towed back to the place where the accident vehicle was parked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of traffic accident did not cause too much attention. If the city is so big, there will always be some accidents. It’s not that there was a car accident here, that is, there was a robbery there. These can only be used as talks in people’s daily life, and they will not let people study and think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until five days later, Mr. Bain told the news to Alisa, and Alisaton stood on the spot. She immediately rushed upstairs and rushed into her room, and made a phone call to dial the number of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, here is the shore cliff dulin manor." The call was made by a woman who had a good voice and was soft and young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Alisa has not taken care of so much, she asked directly: "Dulin is not here?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only five or six seconds before the silence is silenced. “I’m very sorry, Mr. Doolin went to the construction site early in the morning and will come back at night. If you have anything to do, I will be on my behalf. If you tell me, you can call again in the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa hangs up, she is angry, she is sad, she is terrified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, the bastard could not be trusted, but he promised that he would not do anything to Dave, he actually lied. In fact, Alisa had a hunch when she came back. Du Lin’s guy must be moving, but she didn’t think it would come so fast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the door of the room was ringing, Alisa came back, she opened the door, and Mr. Bain stood outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it convenient to come in?", Mr. Bain asked, and Alisa nodded and he walked into the daughter's room. Sitting in a chair and looking at the decoration in the room, this is the first time that Alisa entered the room after she came home. She was a little curious. "You shouldn’t be as flustered as going upstairs, if you fall off the stairs... ..., since you decided to give birth to this child, you should protect him as much as possible and not bring any danger to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa was sulking and silent, which made Mr. Bain think that Daryl’s death made Alisa fall into sorrow. He stood up and walked to Alisa’s side and gently grabbed her and kissed him. Her forehead, "There are always things in the world that make us powerless. Everyone needs to face this moment. No one will be an exception. I know that you may be very upset, and I am equally sad, but we always want to Continue to live, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave two steps, let go of Alisa, and looked straight into her eyes. "Believe my child, Dave has Going to heaven, he will not want you to be sad and sad in the kingdom of heaven. You are not suitable for emotional volatility now, which is not good for children.", he said with a sigh, "Hey, I have a very Stupid mouth, can't say the words that are suitable for comfort, but I hope you don't be too sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa squeezing a smile, she is not because Sad, but because of anger! The shameless and despicable bastard lied to her, and this is the second time! What makes her angry is that she actually believes in innocence, stupid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very good, father, really, you look at my eyes, no red or cry.", Alisa proves herself with her own eyes. Not sad, but this behavior makes Mr. Bain think she is holding back the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can rest assured that this case belongs to a traffic case and will be tried by me personally. I will definitely let the bastard pay the price!", Mr. Bain Suddenly, there was an imposing manner on the body, which was the momentum of the Secretary for Communications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa suddenly realized what was happening, and her face showed some confusion. "Wait, you mean you caught the driver?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain nodded for granted. "Yes, he didn't run. In fact, he can't completely blame the guy. Who can think of a taxi in the middle of the night?" In the suburbs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not a murder?", Alisa felt that her mind was a bit messy, this time she was confused too, this is Du Lin arranges people to do it, is it really just an accident in Yichang? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Bain did not understand the same thing as the whole thing repeated. There is no street lamp in the suburbs. It is very dark. Many taxi drivers like to sneak in the circle. This is not a matter of two times. It was because of the darkness, and the time was also in the middle of the night. The taxi driver and the truck driver were very tired, so neither of them realized that there would be a car at this time, so they slammed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
