			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that Otis wants to "list" is not lost, and many businessmen who have invested in Otis in the night suddenly feel like life is different. I couldn’t sleep all night like the excitement of the first night. The benefits of listing do not need to be rumored. The ultimate goal of every businessman doing business is to go public. Listing can take a lot of cash, and these cash can choose to develop the current company, or develop another company that is not listed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a great secret in the capital market, but in any case, as long as it goes public, it means wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are very excited, but some people are very depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business people in Otis established a city-centered Otis Chamber of Commerce under the formation of Doolin, which was established at the beginning of the business. A rule has been established, that is, those who join the Otis Chamber of Commerce are not allowed to join the Imperial Chamber of Commerce, and must choose between the two. At that time, Doolin did not have any move to package the city of Otis. There were no restrictions on the merchants of the non-Otis Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can invest in the city of Otis, and they can enjoy the policy inclination here. It can be said that the only difference is when the competition between the two sides is almost the same, Du Lin, Or the Otis City Hall will obviously favor the businessmen of the Otis Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, some businessmen are not very concerned. Since they dare to compete, they are not afraid of saving money, and Du Lin’s practice seriously challenges the Chamber of Commerce. majesty. The Speakers of the General Chamber of Commerce have already released their words. If their competition in Otis is behind those who have left the Chamber of Commerce and are behind the businessmen of the Otis Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce will give them some financial assistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a temperament, some people still insisted on their position and did not fall to Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now they regret it, because this capital game that represents the future has no part of them, they can’t even dun Du Lin’s head, it’s a genius. It’s still a madman, there will be such an absurd and bizarre idea of ​​packing a city into a market, but many people still believe that Doolin can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler’s villas have gathered a lot of businessmen at this time. These people are all strong supporters of the Chamber of Commerce, but their faces are not like the daytime. Not so happy when I heard this news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler sat in an easy chair with a blanket on his leg. The fire in the fireplace made him very comfortable and comfortable to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Du Lin fighting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a stupid and naive idea, the mayor who controlled the city for decades, died in the hands of Doolin. Why does he have a lot of real powers in the Chamber of Commerce and what do you want to fight with Doolin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you look stupid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still wants to live a few more years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for this group of people running around to find him to discuss the solution, he is too lazy to meet this group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Mr. Heidler, you think about it, Du Lin is not fair to us!", the person in his 30s, clothing He is wearing a white shirt and a brown vest, waving his arms and expressing his opinion with excitement. "In the construction of Otis, we also invested a lot of money to contribute to the prosperity of Otis today. "Own strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now that in the season of successful harvest, he has no power to drive us out of this circle, we should have the same rights! This is not Fair, Honourable Member!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is called Psyche, runs a ready-to-wear store, and the business is not bad... It should be quite good, at least he is in the nano Lindes earned a lot more. He is a member of the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce is still very attractive to businessmen. Apart from the fact that the internal information is always faster than the outside, there are many exchanges of business activities and experiences. The General Chamber of Commerce is like a professional business school, constantly cultivating a qualified businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only every member has become a successful person, and the Chamber of Commerce has enough capital to fight against the cabinet and refuses to be officially incorporated by the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the local level, Puxi is also a very active person. Often this member who is still in the capital-based stage is very active, but it is the real big capitalist. For example, lawmakers rarely express any opinions. It's not that they can't keep up with the times, but they know how to be awe, knowing that sometimes things can't be settled with money, and there are some things that are not fair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidele opened his eyes and glanced at Puxi. He smiled and pulled the blanket a little higher. He took the firecracker and dialed the firewood. The flame was even stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you see these firewoods?" Heidler asked if he asked, and waited for other people to react, he picked up a new one. The firewood was thrown in. "I put a new firewood, but you saw that the flame did not decay because one of the firewood did not burn. It is still burning. This is the same as our current situation, Audi. The city's own planning is very good, and it is rarely mature and excellent ideas in these years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me for an old thing and say that you are not If you like to listen, if you have more people, or if you are missing, there will be no change to this city. Under such circumstances, why should the flames be accommodated by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the reason you are here, after all, this is the most since the time I came here." Heidler put the tongs back on the side of the shelf, and he opened the blanket and stood. Get up and walk a few steps back and forth, people’s eyes are focused on him. Body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, from the beginning, we just gave up the city of Otis..." Heidler said this when the people around him took a breath. Cool, the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce was placed in the city of Otis, they thought that the Chamber of Commerce attached great importance to the city and even gave them the promise of financial assistance. It was only in this second that they knew that the General Chamber of Commerce had given up the city of Otis. As for why the club did not move away from it, mainly for the sake of face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, there were still some people in the Chamber of Commerce who thought they could be with Du Lin’s wrists. They might not have much in politics. Power does not use fear to gain obedience like gangs. But they have money. Sometimes money can change the opinions and positions of some people. It is precisely what they are best at. They initially intended to use the means of strikes to force Duolin to make compromises—the means of the workers’ unions and the capitalists. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a large number of workers went on strike, the city’s economy stopped, and if Dolin didn’t want to look at his city, he would make a compromise. However, it is unthinkable that Du Lin first expelled the workers' union, then completely replaced the manufacturing industry with the service industry, and used his own people in some pillar industries. This makes the Chamber of Commerce very difficult. If they let their members strike, then they will only lose themselves, which will not affect the operation of the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with the subsequent outbreak of the Nam Lindes attack, those people gradually extinguished the desire to fight with Doolin, and it was terrible to launch a commercial war with such a person who couldn’t move the table. The aristocracy’s past slaughter of merchants because of a decree has not yet become history, and that is what happened decades ago. So they cautiously chose to give up the interests of Otis, but in order to take care of their faces, they did not move the club out of here, they need an opportunity, an excuse to let themselves decent leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puxi asked with some disappointment: "Then there is no way?", he was a little defeated, in the face of such a rare opportunity, they even scored one point. The benefits of money can't be obtained, and that feeling doesn't feel too much. The disappointment on his face is getting stronger and stronger. "If we go to protest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler just smiled and didn't talk, he saw Du Lin's powerful After that, I asked about what happened after Doolin left Turner. Some of the merchants from Irian said something interesting. For example, Du Lin’s workers in Irian’s employment of only the Guarts caused a great dislike of the local provincial sages, and he planned to force Du Lin to nod by means of a parade. As a result, on the eve of the parade, all the leaders returned to God. Husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case was taken out from the beginning and finally committed suicide in the police station, but Heidler thinks this is absolutely related to Doolin. At the time of Tnel, Du Lin dared to challenge Wood and win the game. The guy not only has a keen sense of smell, but also has the guts of madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a big deal to get into trouble with this guy. If you want to die, it’s right to find Du Lin’s trouble, compared to suicide. It is obviously easier to get rid of Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler’s pity with the care of the mentally handicapped makes Psyche a little uncomfortable, he knows that he may have said something stupid, and remembered what happened not long ago. "Unrest", and finally closed his mouth sensibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler went to the bar to open a bottle of wine for himself. "Gentlemen, have you made more money here than before?" They all nodded. In just over two months, they earned more money than they had earned in the past six months. Heidele took a sip of the wine glass. "So what are you not satisfied with? We are businessmen." We only earn the money we can earn, and why should we use ourselves to make money for ourselves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
