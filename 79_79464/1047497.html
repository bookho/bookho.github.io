			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman is dead and the trouble is big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubles are not directed at Doolin, but for the police station and the investigation bureau of the city of Villi, and also let the military and some senior executives feel it. Tricky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former feel trouble because their boss died, as the mayor of Vanlier, actually died at a conference, still in hundreds of people The gaze was killed by the gunmen, and this shocking effect was enough to shake the entire society of Villier. If the Venier Regional Police Department and the Verrier Police Investigation Bureau cannot solve the case in a short time, it is conceivable that these two extremely powerful bureaus will become what people think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter's trouble lies in the letter that has been sent to the black on the way to the emperor. The black post of the bloody dawn has a terrible magic for the nobility. As long as someone receives this thing, it basically does not live for three days. In the era when the traffic was underdeveloped and the city and the city were deserted, it was not easy to escape from their own territory. It was necessary to ride a horse or ride a carriage, which gave the bloody Li Min an ambush on the way. opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that hiding will definitely kill, leaving the territory will also die, so at that time, the posting of two days and three days does not matter. However, from the point of view of the assassination of the Mennon, the bloody dawn has obviously changed the process of the past post and then assassination, and turned to the style of assassination and then staying black. This makes many big people start to get a headache, the doormen can provoke the bloody dawn, can they also bring out the bloody dawn? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may have inadvertently provoked the bloody dawn but I don’t know, when the killer appeared, I knew what I needed to face, which was even more terrifying than in the past. At least in the past, the bloody dawn will be the first to post a black post, no matter whether it is the last one to be the first to escape from the black post, at least one can prepare for this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the only "welfare" of Scarlet Dawn is not there, it really makes people feel some fear, no one can do life all day, no one . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s not all bad news. The analysis team of the Strategic Intelligence Bureau under the Military Intelligence Division has presented a new perspective to the cabinet. They think this time. The person who assassinated the doorman is actually not the hand of the bloody dawn. Because no matter from the black post to the assassination, this assassin is almost completely different from the style of the bloody dawn in the previous archives. It can even be said that there are two different styles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible thing that the bloody dawn of the year made the aristocrats self-defeating was that the bloody dawn occupied the initiative everywhere, but it was not discovered. Whether it is the fear of the nobility when they received the black post, or the assassins who did not circumvent all the guards and only carried out the target assassination, or they disappeared immediately after the assassination, they all showed that the bloody dawn is the purest and most professional assassin. . From the very beginning, they have developed a very perfect assassination plan. In the report of the Royal Special Intelligence Section in the archives of the past, they guessed that the people with bloody dawns might mix them into the guards by disguising themselves or In the servant around the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They plan every step, how to enter the building, how to lead the guard or bypass the guard, how to leave immediately after the assassination, every line seems to pass Repeated arguments, and finally selected the most appropriate program to execute the assassination plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this assassination is better than murder, no bloody dawn, the grace and calmness of dancing on the tip of the knife, if the bloody dawn Every assassination is a performance by a master of art. Then the murder is purely an axe to the head, without any artistic sense. It’s just that the killer chose a suitable opportunity, made the most appropriate move, and then made himself a thing of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the military intelligence department thinks that it is very likely that other people have taken advantage of the opportunity of the relationship between the doorman and the bloody dawn, and hired a dead man to complete the doorman The murder plan, then blame the bloody dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument was quickly recognized by some nobles. Indeed, like this murder, there is no such thing as "murder". Many people have killed the doorman, the artistic sense? The perfect plan? God does not know the assassination? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first time, all the suspicious elements who might have created this murder were interviewed by the Bureau of Investigation, the Security Committee and the military. Doolin is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he built the city’s infrastructure with the state’s enclosure in the first settlement, the military’s people found him and asked to talk to him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I wait a few minutes, I need to arrange the next thing." At this time, Doolin is wearing a helmet and standing at a construction site. on. Water, as the source of life, is a guarantee for the survival of all living things, so in the construction of these infrastructures, the water plant was ranked first by Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west looks very desolate, there are no people everywhere, and there are many Gobi. In fact, the water resources in the west are not scarce. It is not far from the west coast. The layers of the underground rivers have become fresh water. Groundwater resources. Just find a hole in the right place and you'll get plenty of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several construction machinery replaced the working arm, was drilling holes, the ground tremors and noise filled every corner of the construction site, naturally including Doolin’s side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Du Lin finished speaking, a young sergeant walked a few steps forward and approached Doolin’s side. Shouting at him, "Mr. Doolin, this is not a request, it is an order! You can not cooperate, but I promise you will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What will I do?” Du Lin looked at him calmly. There were more than 30 people around him. These people’s hands were not in their arms, they were behind them, as if Du Lin said a word or did an action. These people will take terrible things from a hidden place to kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most special thing is that the officer who is close to Doolin, his eyes are uncontrollably twitching, and a pistol is already at his head. Let him not even have the chance to say the last few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin raised his hand and shook his finger, and all the pistols were collected, which made the moment of suffocating moments suddenly eased a lot. Du Lin took a step forward and was very close to the sergeant. He looked at the young sergeant who had closed his mouth and said with a smile. "You see, here is the construction site, even if I kill you all, find a mixer." Going in, I believe no one will know that I killed you. Now the West is so chaotic, if I say that you are a disguised soldier, even if someone knows that you are killing me, it will not cause any trouble to me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter who makes you do this, it proves two things, the people who make you do this are stupid, and you are stupid." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and turned and looked at the foreman who stood on the side and looked like an ordinary worker. The foreman came over and Du Lin took it. The work that came down was arranged. After all, the investment in the water plant was brought by him, and the cabinet also gave him the contract. Governor power to build, then he must take his job well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, is it necessary to dig a hole?", as the honesty farmer's foreman asked without a head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is also a bit strange, asks, "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreman The three soldiers standing behind Du Lin’s mouth replied, “Buy them...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin slaps on the guy’s head The foreman was not angry at all, but he was smirking. "Do you have a fight in your mind? This is the next plan, I will stare at it. Before I come back, if you don't do your job well. You can dig a hole to bury yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I understand, rest assured!", the foreman took the drawings and saw a few eyes turned Give a young man and tell Du Lin to tell him what the young man is listening to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a picture of the dust on his body and said with a smile, "Yes, let's go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, the sky is not too early, Du Lin also needs to go back to the city, and come back tomorrow. He told the man to sit in his car and follow the military vehicle to sail to Fanlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the military vehicle, the officer who was humiliated by Doolin was indignant and whispered while driving. "Sir, this person is too arrogant, why not? Arrest him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sergeant, a lieutenant looked at him indifferently, let him put all the rest of the words in the scorpion and said no. . After a few minutes, the lieutenant said "stupid", and then it seems that these two words can not reflect their disappointment, added, "Use your dog's brain to think about it, why should I arrest Du Lin?" The sergeant was just preparing to say that Du Lin threatened them and held the guns. The second lieu continued, "Do you think they have guns? I don't know? Do you think he threatens us? I can't feel it? It's useless!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dulin is currently the largest gang leader in the empire, and even more troubling is that so far no one has seized any of his handles, and he and the navy The relationship is very close. Even if we arrest him now, for a long time, the navy will have to make trouble, and even launch wartime missions to meet people. I hate these criminals as well, but I also know that it is far from now. When these people are working."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
