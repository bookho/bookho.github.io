			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on the “dock” is not an easy task. A lot of goods need to be unloaded or loaded every day, almost from the beginning of the day until the night. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary of this job is very low and the intensity is very high, so it is difficult to recruit enough people, which is less than half a year for the agreement. Failed to pay 50 pieces of default provisions. As for why it is half a year instead of two years or more, there is a reason. This kind of high-intensity work may only give people a feeling of exhaustion at an early stage, but as the working hours increase, the physical aspect is no longer exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of nutritional supplements, no comfortable rest environment, there will be steam locomotives passing by at night, over time, the transplanters will appear more or less Some physical problems, such as "occupational diseases" such as skeletal deformities. According to the idea of ​​the capitalists, these sick workers have been unable to continue to take on the heavy porters' work. It is a loss to spend money to raise them and give them food and drink. The only way for these workers is to be kicked. Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that things can't be so smooth, because there are unions. The trade union is a kind of thing that makes all capitalists feel nausea and nausea and wants to vomit. They hate the union and can't do without the union. They can only hold their noses and make themselves as good as possible. In the dual law of imperial law and theocracy Take care of certain rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, occupational diseases are work-related injuries, or the station pays a large sum of money to send workers to leave, or they raise them until they are 45 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is on, let alone support them, even if you pay five cents more, for the capitalists, it is a kind of meat-cutting behavior that makes them feel pain, so The agreement for the station is signed for six months. After the expiration of the agreement, the station will open a note to the workers who requested renewal. After the medical examination confirmed that there is no illness or bone deformity, the agreement can continue. As for those workers who have physical problems, they are directly swearing. After the completion of the contract, whether or not these workers are overworked, whether they are sick because they are engaged in heavy physical work at the station, they have nothing to do with the station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, the union had no power to use the excuse and the station to lick each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Du Lin will not know this. In the eyes of Mr. Klein, this is a fool from the country. After six months, he will be thrown out and let himself die! what? Learn? That is the school run by his daughter. Why not introduce the workers to learn a little bit of knowledge and grow a little knowledge and education? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Du Lin came to the station early in the morning, and there was a hint of autumn coolness in the early summer and early autumn. He rubbed his arms with his hands and brought some warmth to his body. Standing on the side of the platform with oil lamps, there are already many workers around, ready to meet the first steam locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Newcomer?", a guy in his thirties, who is as strong as a bear, wears only a vest, and he licks his mouth. With a cigarette, I took another one and handed it to Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the country, a few of their brothers sometimes steal Mr. Xerma’s cigarettes, and each person takes a sip. Being addicted is purely a joyous pastime. In the face of the cigarettes handed by a stranger, he hesitated to come over, or received it, and thanked him. "Thank you for your cigarette, I am Doolin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The man bear took out a match and rubbed it on Du Lin’s collar, and suddenly a strong white smoke was made. Both of them leaned their heads to avoid the white smoke that was said to be poisonous, and then they smashed the burning match and lit the cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy fell on the floor after licking the match, stepped on a few feet, grinded it, took a deep breath and spit on the smoke, saying: "The station is banned from smoking. It is said that there have been disasters in other places where the smoke was burned at the station." He reached out and grinned. "My name is Graf, I am very happy to be you." "Coworkers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin reached out and grabbed Graf, and suddenly felt a lot closer. The charm of socializing is here, simple conversations, and perhaps not a share of gifts, can quickly bring the relationship between two strangers closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very honored, sir." Du Lin was very polite. He took a sip of his cigarette and coughed up. Graf laughed loudly. He patted Du Lin’s back and said with a smile: “Don’t use the word of Mr., that’s the big man in the upper class.” Just call me a name. Also, is it enough?" He took off the cigarette in his mouth and put two fingers in front of Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coughing for a while, Du Lin just came through. He didn't dare to smoke this cigarette anymore. He coughed his face a little pale. "What is it inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Graf seems very happy and proud, "In addition to a small portion of the tobacco leaves, there are straw, cane dried and cut into silk, right, there are some blood orange skin and a little bit of grinding The same pepper skin as the flour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You let the kid go, Graf, who can stand your thing?", it has long been noticed In this situation, immediately workers laughed and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf didn’t care at all. He re-sucked the cigarette on his mouth and gave them a squint. "This guy can stand it!", he used his arm Arched Du Lin, almost lost the balance of Doolin arch, fell to the ground, "Do you say it is good, so smoke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, workers pumping Most of the cigarettes are cigarettes that have added something to them because they are not enough to make them eligible to consume cigarettes. They usually pick up some cigarette heads left in the station and leave the tobacco leaves and collect them. If these tobacco leaves are simply rolled into cigarettes, they may only be able to roll out two or three cigarettes a day. If you add a little material, you can roll out a package more or less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper class has the luxury of the upper class, and the bottom society also has the survival wisdom of the bottom society. After trying a lot of things, most people have approved dried cane and dried orange peel. As for Graf's increased straw and paprika... that's his personal hobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at Graf’s sincere eyes and the hope of the eyes. The kind-hearted country boy could only take a sip and take a sip. His face changed quickly. White, "Yes, yes!", coughing a few times after the words, let Graf laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin can see that Graf is not playing with him, he is really happy laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the steam locomotive in the distance began to whistle, and the workers began to pack up their tools and stood on the side of the platform waiting for unloading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the steam locomotive arrived at the station, Du Lin discovered that the so-called "standard goods" is not a package, a sack or a box, but a lot of . According to some of the knowledge he learned in his dreams, there are almost four cubes. In fact, if you think about it, you can give two cents if you just ran back and forth. I am afraid that the station does not need to recruit workers at all, and it has already been smashed by workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf handed two ropes tied together at two ends to Doolin, then helped him to pass his arm over his shoulder and form an X shape on the back. "If you only use brute force, you can run five or six at most." With this rope, the two corners of the box can be stretched, and the strength of the whole body can be used. It is relatively easy and does not hurt the body.", he said that he had a hammer on Du Lin’s shoulder. "What you have to learn." There are still many, brothers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work in the morning is relatively easy. There are not many steam locomotives in the night. It is only in the afternoon that Du Lin realizes the real exhausted. With steam locomotives entering the station, Mr. Klien also walked out of the office, yelling at the workers and scheduling, almost from a little busy until 7 pm, only to take a breather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arms have already begun to tremble, Du Lin, who can’t even punch his fists, sat at the table, holding a piece of bread with a trembling hand, bowing his head and drinking Broth on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, according to the workers, he earned twelve points. If you continue to follow this progress, he can earn five ones this month, which is a good result for the novice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf is now holding a bowl full of broth and holding a few breads. He is sitting on the edge of Doolin, a big mouth. The big mouth bites the bread, and the stuffing of the stuff is unclear. "Don't take a shower at night, sleep when you take off your clothes, don't do anything else, or you can't do anything tomorrow."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin always believes what the experienced person said, and Graf did not say anything that made him feel ridiculous, just let him not take a bath. Do not need to think too long, Du Lin is determined to believe in Graf's suggestion, and he also raised a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Krien told me that people in the union will look for me in a few days, let me not join the union, should I participate?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf’s face immediately showed a contemptuous look. He looked back at the window with the light on the second floor and sneered. "Don’t listen to the liar, if If you don't join the trade union, who can guarantee the rights of our bottom-level workers? He just wants to get cheap from you. Besides, is the fifty-fifty membership fee expensive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Dooling nodded, and finished the broth in the bowl, and actually ate a piece of meat with a small fingernail cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
