			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roel and the pen with a trace of anxiety, he chose to leave now because he learned that the doorman was restricted to freedom, this is a Opportunity, a very rare opportunity. He must leave the doorman and leave when he can't help him. Otherwise, with the character of the guy, he will definitely find a way to kill himself. He doesn't even want to take back the money, he has to kill himself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon soon Mr. Roel came back, he quickly filled out his bank account on this money order and signed his own Name - a pseudonym. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the guy who faked the check and the signature of someone else was caught all day, the major banks of the empire began to rectify the work, for example, the account does not go out of the state. policy. To put it simply, the account opened by the customer in the north and the extended service such as check cannot be used in the south. You must apply for a temporary signature right to use the account at the specified time. This greatly reduced the bank's bad debts and inexplicable fake checks at the end of the year, reducing the bank's losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the bank will remind customers to update the signature of the file at regular intervals. If you find your abnormal consumption record, you need to go to it immediately. The bank registers and reports, which is why the bank now sends a breakdown to each household that opens an account in the bank every week. In this way, they pass on their losses to the user's head. If the customer does not register and report the alarm during the time of the cheque fraud, this is even more than the loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the anonymous account is not under monitoring, and according to the policies and regulations jointly issued by the Imperial Bank and the Imperial Ministry of Finance, the loss of the anonymous account without real name registration is the responsibility of the customer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the results are minimal, because most anonymous accounts are accessed in a token-pairing manner, where the customer leaves a block-like part in the bank. I have a part in my hand that can be accessed by piece together to be a whole. Or use a special lacquer seal, the bank keeps one, the customer keeps one, reconciles the lacquer pattern and so on. In short, banks and customers have the means to ensure the safety of their property without using real-name registration. The Ministry of Finance does not work at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roel filled out his remittance slip, he pulled the necklace out of the neckline and had a very delicate necklace at the bottom of the necklace. Five days ago, he had applied for a large amount of foreign exchange operations and temporary signing rights, so his tokens left in the west had been transferred to this designated bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very beautiful dolphins." The bank's staff couldn't help but praise, Mr. Roel's token is a... jumping? The dolphins are like a semicircle. The texture of pure gold allows any woman to immediately like it when she sees the gadget that weighs 75 grams. Roel smiled and kept silent. The bank staff put the money order and the dolphin in his hand and stood up. "I need to check with your manager for your tokens, you can join me, or Sit here and wait." She pointed to the all-glass studio in the middle of the bank lobby, which is the manager's office, allowing him to monitor the work of the entire bank staff anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roel glanced and shook his head, entering the room was too conspicuous, all he needed now was to keep a low profile. And sitting here, he can see everything that happened in that room, he is not worried that the bank will lie to himself. The credibility of the imperial central bank is still guaranteed, otherwise it will not become the biggest economic monster in the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff smiled again and then walked into the pure glass transparent office with a money order. She also pointed to her desk, the working manager. I looked back and smiled at Roel and nodded, only to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure this account is the account we are monitoring?", the bank's day shift manager took out a document and compared it to the remittance slip. The remittance account was queried, and soon he discovered that it was indeed an overnight surveillance account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of similar accounts are generated every year and are monitored by banks. These accounts are basically anonymous accounts, they involve black money for gang transactions, or some unclear Not a good fund. When the two major departments of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Finance work together and stand behind Magus, the Imperial Central Bank must obey this requirement that does not involve principles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It looks like this is the case, you first stabilize him, I want to inform the Bureau of Investigation." The bank manager spoke quietly from the drawer. I took out a small locked box, and then he opened the small box with a key, and there was another dolphins made of pure gold. When he put the heads and tails of the two dolphins together, it was obvious that the occlusion was smooth after a block of obstacles, which indicates that the tokens are on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He signed and said: "I read his application record and told him that the temporary signing power is less than one week and cannot be cross-border remittance, then you Think of it, it’s enough to drag it for ten minutes.” After returning the money order in his own hands and Mr. Roel’s little dolphins, he gave it to the staff and looked up at him. “Take him, from You can raise your salary by two dollars starting this month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s face immediately showed a sweet smile. “Look, I can let him stay here for half an hour!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the girl is from the office After coming out, I went back to my desk and the smile on my face became a little troublesome. After she sat down, she smiled a little embarrassedly and said: "Sir, your application for signature is only five days, is it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roel stunned and nodded. "Yes, I applied for signing with your branch five days ago. What's wrong?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl immediately explained, "It’s such a gentleman, according to the regulations of the imperial central bank and the three major federal banks, all cross-border inter-bank remittances need to be one week ahead of time. Reporting, although your procedure has been verified, the manager told me that the application must be postponed for two days. Two days later, you will bring your token again to be able to transfer the money to your designated federal account. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roel never thought of Such a thing would happen, he has booked a night ferry, this time tomorrow he had almost floating in the sea, he did not have so much time spent in here. This is not as simple as rebooking. He does not use fake passports and names. He uses real materials. This means that the information he wants to leave has been included in the information of Imperial Customs. Once the people of Mennon discover the news, it is very likely that he will be sent to the door in major ports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is playing a time difference. He only booked the ticket before he came. After the remittance was over, he left the boat immediately, even if the Mennonese knew it. The news that he wants to leave the country is probably too late to catch him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't you think of a way?", Roel took off the wide-brimmed sunglasses and revealed his entire face. "I will sit in the afternoon." The boat went to the Federation, the itinerary was planned, I couldn't stay here for too long. Is there any way to compromise?", said one of his hands pressed on the girl's hand, the girl just prepared to be polite When I took back my hand, I felt a little uncomfortable with what was on my back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been working in the bank for so long, she may not be familiar with anything else, but she dares to say that she is very familiar with the taste of money and the texture of money. Understanding. Pressed between the back of her hand and the palm of this man is money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good opportunity, I am not going to charge some bribes, I just want to hold him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
