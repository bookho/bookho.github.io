			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of Wood’s hurried departure, Colt looked down at the two dark stains on his chest, and he used his fingers to learn the look of Wood. Dipped, licked, sniffed, and then came to a conclusion - the Guartes are really dirty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly won’t understand that these two stains are actually some blood that has dried up and oxidized, and I don’t understand why Wood’s rapid departure is because he I took a look at these new faces of Graf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether a person has hurt, or is more serious, whether a person has killed or not, his mentality is completely different. Before we have harmed or even killed the same kind, we can call these people ordinary people, ordinary people with universal values ​​and morality. They are like the people hidden in the textbooks, using their morality and ethics to tie their hands together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When faced with danger, the first thing they think of is how to resolve the disputes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when a person hurts someone else or even kills someone, the mentality will be completely different. At this point, Wood himself was deeply touched. Before he killed the three tramps who tried to drag him into the alley to warm his body, he was just a fanatic. But when he killed someone, he didn't like fantasy, because he felt that it could be realized, and he also realized his dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not difficult to cross the limits of morality and ethics, just take a small step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this time is in danger, they will not think about how to solve the problem like ordinary people, but take out weapons and solve the trouble thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood always thought that these people were just ordinary people. When they didn’t see the world’s hairy boy, they found themselves wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not sheep, they are lions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not blame him for this kind of opinion. Of course, rich experience sometimes makes people lose the most basic judgment. The other party did not greet the inherent old forces before they sold the private liquor, nor did they entrust others to inform them that new players would enter. Without any buffering, one headed into this market, indicating that the other party is simply a "newbie", and does not understand in this world, no matter which line has its own rules and rules. It’s not impossible to chaos, but you must be prepared to be punished. Sometimes you lose money, sometimes you lose your life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two drops of blood made Wood suddenly realize that he might not be able to use a pair of scissors like a gardener to easily cut off a branch that affects the whole gardening. What he had to face was war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War is a terrible word, whether it is a war between the state and the country, a war between the gang and the gang, or a war between the forces and the forces. The result of the war is that one party destroys the other, and the so-called armistice and reconciliation are just the passage of time that will result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood wants to be able to kick this new face that has disrupted the market from the city of Tener and retake the market that belongs to him, but he does not want to use war. the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he chose the wrong opponent and used the wrong strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decade of unparalleled career has made him somewhat inflated, so that he made the wrong decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dark crossroads, the autumn wind blew from the other side of the street with a hint of chill, Wood didn’t know where to go, Like his life at the crossroads at the same time, full of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troika is going faster when it comes back. After removing a hundred boxes of wine, the horses pulling the carts look happy. Quite a lot. In the carriage, Graf opened a dark space and put the cash box in. This secret is what Du Lin asked to do. The purpose is not to hide money, but to hide some contraband before the inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage of the carriage, the two bodies at the feet have become cold, stiff, bloody and full of the carriage, lingering at the tip of the nose, lingering . He glanced at the bodies of the two policemen and did not think of any good ideas. After all, this is the body of the police. No matter where it is thrown, it is definitely a huge trouble. From the current situation, it is better to bring back to the farm. Just find a place to dig a pit and bury it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage drove for about ten minutes and left the bustling city centre of the city of Tener, and the streets became deserted again. Even if one or two people can be seen walking on the road, they are also looking down and rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still easy, and with the bumps of the carriage, Graf fell asleep unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Wood didn't know which way Graf was going, Graf didn't know that Du Lin had arranged for the Buddha to follow him behind in order to avoid accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Buddha looked at five or six guys with a felt hat and a trench coat to follow behind the carriage. He considered it for a while and decided not to do it for the time being. . It’s not that he is afraid of anything. On the one hand, there are too many people living in the city. Who knows which corner is like before, it will bring out a tramp. If you are witnessed a fight, it is likely to be a bad thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, from the point of view of the speed and vigilance of the other side, they do not seem to want to cut off the carriage, but instead maintain a relatively safe distance. Hanging behind. Therefore, all Buddhas feel that instead of causing unnecessary troubles in the city, it is better to smash their wishes and wait until after the suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel City is not big, leaving the city center for about forty minutes, the surrounding buildings have become low and worn out, the last one At the intersection, the street lights disappeared. Only the faint moonlight in the night shrouds the quiet earth. The lights of the carriage have also become brighter, like the light of the wild fishing, attracting the "fish" to bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were only ten minutes away from the farm, they all started. When they started running, they apparently alerted the people behind them. The people were very alert and immediately dispersed, and rushed into the grass of the nearby half-man. All the Buddhas took the initiative and immediately divided them into two batches. They stared at two people and he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sluggish Graf of sleep will be shaken by the bumpy carriage from time to time to lose the horizontal screen. He suddenly wakes up from the confused and raises his hand. When I wiped the saliva from my mouth, I faintly heard someone shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parking!", Graf knocked on the plank between the carriage and the driver's seat. The troika stopped before and after, and he jumped from the carriage. The cool autumn wind made him stun, and the wind brought coolness and brought the voice of the Buddha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch one, don't let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a word, Let Graf have no sleep, the muscles on his cheeks shook, and immediately patted the carriage of the carriage, and lifted the oil lamp from the carriage. "Quick, go see what happened!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
