			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Du Lin, you are so very difficult to do." The president glanced at the lawyers around him, and the lawyers pushed away a distance. Turning around and looking at the workers' representatives standing behind them... They were still standing there stupidly, and there was no point in giving them some whispers. Looking at the representatives of these workers, the president coughed a little. "I want to talk to Du Lin first about the inconvenience of what you listen to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to normal people The idea is that most of the workers’ representatives who work and live in other places will apologize very apologetically that they have not noticed and then leave a distance. But here is the western part, the different western part. A man in his forties who has a beard with a certain cowhide hat has rounded his eyes. "If you have something to talk, sneak a thief like a thief...", fortunately he There was a slightly normal person around him, pulling him away for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the president’s face is laughing, but the smile is very stubborn, these silly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his chair forward and moved forward, his arms pressed against the table, letting this dilapidated wooden table emit a twitching oppression of zhiyaya, "Du Mr. Lin, I hope that you can understand, in fact, I am under a lot of pressure now. I always think that I have not done what I should do during the time in the west, if I can’t create something that is eye-catching. Results, it is very likely that they will transfer me away. And I think we have got along well in understanding, looking at the feelings of each other as friends, can you let me cross?", this bastard stayed in the West for so long, Helping Du Lin to pull people around for the whole day to make money for himself, the headquarters also knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the workers’ unions in the west can’t develop, and they can’t hold the guns on these people’s heads to force them to enlarge the unions and pay for them. The way of doing things is to close one eye and let them kill themselves. With the inexplicable expansion of the Western Workers’ Union, the headquarters also began to pay attention to the huge employment market in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic recovery is a very good thing, but at the same time the rising labor costs have made some large and medium-sized enterprises feel a little hard. Take a large-scale light industrial enterprise with 10,000 workers as an example. According to the current economic level, they must issue at least a salary of no less than 42 yuan per employee per month, and 10,000 workers are four. 120,000 wages. In the normal business situation, there will be no problems, but if the order is reduced due to commercial competition, it only takes three to five months to pay the workers only, which will drag the cash flow of this large enterprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more people are turning to industry, which makes the market competition more intense. Behind the myth of wealth is the concentration of more wealth graves. Compared with the high labor costs in the South and East Coast, the cheap labor force in the west is more attractive to large-scale light industrial enterprises, and has higher risk resistance in the process of operation. Therefore, many manufacturers intend to or have begun to move to the west. In the next five to ten years, the labor market in the west will multiply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A market with great potential will attract all eyes. In a certain period of time, more workers will come here to seek new jobs and even It is a new life. Then before this happens, the workers’ union must operate. The workers’ union that has experienced a huge crisis is now very crisis-conscious. If the pulse of the times cannot be grasped, the workers’ union can only be eliminated by this era and become a long river of history. Gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the west is the most important thing. The Federation of Trade Unions has given notice here. It is necessary to establish a good image of the workers’ union in the west and help the workers. The class solves most of the problems in work and life, and also gives high praise and support to the literacy classes and calculation classes proposed by the club. But still that sentence, doing well is what you should do. If you don't do well, then it is your fault. In fact, the real situation is that the General Union has seen the development of the west and wants to transfer from the top to the local. It’s as simple as being a land emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple things for the upper-level characters are a big thing for the lower-level people. If someone wants to come to the west as the branch president, then you must first find one. Reason to take off the current branch president. Since the high-level reform of the Workers’ Union, it has never been a statement of the president and the vice president. Now the high-level union has been divided into several small groups, and fighting each other is very powerful. It is precisely because of this that some people do not want to fight in the General Union every day, and they have the heart to go to the Western Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then this requires a series of compromises and transactions, and finally find a way to find a reason to dismiss the Western president, and it is a logical succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's your business, not my business, every time I pay you enough money, this is a deal, we are the two sides of the sale You can't confuse it with friendship." When Du Lin finished, the president of the trade union was already desperate. If he couldn't take the big job of Doolin, the trade union would definitely think that he didn't have the ability to serve as the president of the West. At that time, whether it is a ruling or a withdrawal is a sentence of the above person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more troublesome is that he can't make an agreement on Du Lin's agreement, and the General Union has specially written a letter on the opinion letter to ensure the independence and customary position of the workers' union in the west. To favor anyone, abide by the rules and regulations of the trade unions, and ensure that the good image of the workers' union will not be defiled. Now he knows how much his situation is very subtle. If he is not careful, he will be sent to other places where the birds are not squatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are ambitious, no one is an exception, even the most devout believers in the church want to serve the gods and gain eternal life. What about ordinary humans? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, Lord President, I have a slightly better suggestion than you are not interesting. Maybe you can solve what you are now. The trouble is right." Looking at the chairman of the poor workers' union, Du Lin was finally moved. Of course, this has something to do with Du Lin’s consistent kindness. He always sees others suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of the union suddenly overjoyed and looked forward to watching Du Lin. "If you can avoid some foreseeable troubles, Mr. Doolin, what will happen in the future? I need a phone call, I will do it for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled a little perfunctorily, he asked with a slight slap in his legs, "Since You don't want to lose your current status. Why don't you leave the workers' union alone?", waiting for him to say something, Du Lin continued to say, "Hey, when you came to the west, there was nothing in the west, and they didn't give you any support." Here, you have a lot of momentum from nothing to nothing, they have done nothing, all of which is your merits. With or without them, it is not a necessary factor for your success or failure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, why not leave these people to continue doing it yourself?", he smiled at this moment, "or, work for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West is Doolin A place often valued, where a special social environment can help him cut out a long incubation period, so that he may have more rapid rise. Dooling had a big heart. He played a big game of chess. He even had a hint of smugness in his heart, because even Marcus did not see through his real plans. Of course, the more you need this time, the more you need to hide your minions and not give anyone a chance to destroy all his plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why he gave up his political career and began to concentrate on doing business. Only then will others gradually relax their vigilance and then sleep in this group. At the time, they wake them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
