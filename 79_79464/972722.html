			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin left. When the executives of the emperor read the final resolution of the cabinet, Du Lin said on the spot that he was willing to accept the cabinet’s resolution and did not mention anything. Responding to the lawsuit, the light car left the city of Otis. When the news of Doolin’s departure spread, many people could not believe that this was actually true. He left without such trouble. Then I left a lot of wealth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a trap, a trap, and maybe Doolin is still hidden in a corner of the city... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin really has gone. Three days later he has stood in the first city bordering the wild west and central part of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the West, most people’s impressions of the West come from some film and television works, and there are grasses and yellows that are being pushed by the wind. Sand, as well as robbers and sheriffs who may be riding horses with guns whenever and wherever possible, of course, people who are most impressed by the West are actually gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold rush and gold digger have always been in the west and have the hottest topic in the west. A medium-sized mineral deposit can form a number of 100,000 The ecological circle between 200,000 can be said that gold in the west of the empire is everything, and everything is centered around gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good, bad, and not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The air here is very dry...", Buddha looked at the place a bit uncomfortable...the city, it should be the city, but there are no other places here. The road of cement tarmac, the dust of the ground makes the city look like it is about to be abandoned. Wooden houses are everywhere, and they are not very tall. The tallest house is only three stories high. To say that this is a city, it is better to say that it is a ruin that is about to be drowned by sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood at the station with the box. He contacted the Guar people here before he came. Someone will pick them up. He is also looking at this one. city. To be honest, it is very old and backward, but it is obvious that it is actually a tourist city. Yes, the tourist city, this is the only tourist city in the western part of the empire. There are always some people who have seen the western movie and want to go to the western experience of the empire. A wild life. But in fact, those wild lives are not only not fun, but also very dangerous. Survival in the wild in the west requires two of the most terrible things. The first thing is the animals that are used to eating meat, the Gobi wolves, the black lions, and the countless hyenas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of these animals are good to deal with. The reason why the Gobi wolves are not called coyotes is because these wolves living in the Gobi are absolutely different from the coyotes common in other places. The Gobi wolves are yellow-brown, and it is difficult to find these top predators in the West when they are on the Gobi. They are more slender and have more developed limbs. The most terrible thing is that their number and predation are more cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gobi Wolf may create a hunting plan for several days in order to capture a prey, until the prey of the prey is still slaughtered by them. Some biologists believe that Gobi wolves are a wise creature, otherwise they can't make some hunting plans, let alone the ability to work together so that only smart creatures have the ability to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second black lion is rare in the Gobi, but there are many of the corrupted rock. The black lions are hunting at night, they can Clearly see at least one hundred and fifty meters in the night, and have excellent hearing. Many of the mines can see the traces left by them. For these night-time hunters, the place where humans gather is equal to their canteens. Some simple places will explode every few days. news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one is not terrible for individuals. They are very small, but the number that can be compared with the other two predators is the quantity. If you haven't seen dozens of schnauzers hunting at the same time, you can't imagine this kind of small thing that can be killed by a punch. You can have such a terrible hunting ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only the first point. The second thing is more dangerous than the first one, that is, human beings appearing in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may look like passing caravans or pedestrians on the Gobi. When you think they are not dangerous, they tend to sneak You put a shot. Then take away your belongings, horses, and sometimes it will be hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are always more dangerous than animals, because when you see those predators, you will be mentally prepared to know that these things will bring harm and danger, and I came up with measures to deal with. But when you see people, the first thought is definitely not the idea of ​​"killing him before he kills me," so the wild man is the most dangerous creature in the west! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid those fans and casual eggs, the guys in the wild in the west have not experienced the fun of the wild and become the food in the belly of the animals. At the same time, it is also for economic construction, so there is a city. Everything is built according to the pictures in the movie. In addition to winter, many people will come here to travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for almost ten minutes, a... a wooden cart used to pull things or pull grass in the country appeared in the sight of the two. The two humming horses shivered in the cold wind, and the hair was about to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, I am very sorry to be late, the road ahead is temporarily closed, so I can only go around a little." The position jumped down. After a little explanation, he pressed two thick drapes in the bucket against the Hummer, which seemed to be wearing clothes for the two hummers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded and then rolled over and climbed into the bucket with Dudu. "You don't have a car?"<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Car?", the driver smiled. "The mayor does not allow any modern things to appear here, especially during the tourist season. All the citizens here must wear those for more than 100 years. The clothes of the previous style are said to maintain the original taste of the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha couldn’t help but laugh out, "Life does not seem to be a piece here." Easy things, can't you have modern things in your home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coachman returned to the carriage and pulled the reins and shook. "Of course not, you I don't know how curious those tourists are about our lives. They can break into your home anytime, anywhere, and then ask for a night out to experience life. All modern things will destroy their experience, I feel like we are primitive people. The same. The only thing that is gratifying is that we don't need to work. The City Hall will provide us with free necessities and necessary supplies for free, and then pay us an income of 10 yuan per person plus 20 yuan of silver coins per month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Coin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver took out a silver coin that looked like a silver coin from his pocket. He handed it to Doolin, Doolin. Take a few flips in your hand. There is a front print... with feathers and branches on the head, a very different kind of chieftain, a cross with an axe and a spear, and a shell at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the explanation of the coachman, Du Lin gradually understood the meaning of this thing. Simply put, this is a local currency, worth about fifteen points. These silver coins can be used as settlement items when trading in the city, and have similar purposes to the tokens on Doolin. However, these silver coins are not open to tourists. They are purely a kind of props that can only be applied to local people, and they cannot buy valuables and can only buy food and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
