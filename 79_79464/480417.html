			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world’s entertainment is relatively monotonous. Except for those entertainment venues, there is no such thing as a TV set. The entertainment of ordinary people is not only newspapers. In addition, you can only find yourself some fun. Most of the farmers will have as many children as they can when they are still able to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the most real thought in his heart is the opposite, but the problem is that he doesn’t know how to avoid it when he is doing that kind of thing. Little life came to the world one after another. He doesn't like the slimy coat with animal viscera, so he gave birth to a lot of children, and he will lie - more children can support the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin slept very early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf They came back at 10 o'clock in the evening, and Du Lin had been lying in a warm bed and fell into a sweet sleep. I have to say that although the Huon family has been destitute, their homes are still good, especially these quilts and beds. The padding and quilt on the bed also had a hint of aroma, which should be their lovely little daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of little girls, should they still dive now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Doolin dreamed of a mess and was deeply involved, the knock on the door shocked him. He was alert and turned over and pulled out the sharp knife under the bed and held it in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?", his voice was calm, not flustered or nervous, he quietly came down from the bed and put on a dress. Standing outside the door of the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a familiar voice coming out of the door. "I am, have you slept?", Graf's voice is very characteristic. The sound is a bit duller than everyone else. I don't know if it's almost like a big voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin put the sharp knife on the waistband behind him, opened the door, and looked at Graf who had not had time to change his clothes outside the door. He looked up and down a Graf and asked: "Don't go to sleep to find me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf doesn't know how to open, scratching his head, good After a while, he said with a sigh of relief: "There were two policemen killed on the road, and some people who followed us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dooling's drowsiness was washed away in the words of Graf. He turned and went to change clothes and walked out. The two walked toward the outside, and Graf said everything from this afternoon to the evening. For Graf's decision and choice, Du Lin felt that there was nothing wrong with it. Indulging those police officers, it does not matter if they lose a batch of wine, but they can only cultivate their growing greed and eventually become a bottomless pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as no one sees, there is no evidence, no weapons, no bodies, it is difficult to judge who is guilty in the trial with the technology of the present era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dressed and walked with Graf towards the house. After Graf finished the process of trading at night, Du Lin immediately realized Their wines took only a few days, and they were alarmed by the forces in the city of Tener. In fact, it is normal to think about it. Highly private wine may be the only income for gangs or forces in this small city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that someone has moved their income, it is equivalent to putting a knife on their neck. They either choose to beg for mercy or choose to fight hard. The thoughts were already standing in the mouth, and there were three dejected guys outside the door. Their hands were tied behind them and tied with their feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a footstep, and the three looked up, and everyone had a miserful expression in their eyes. Before they came, there was a simple guess. What kind of people dare not to say hello, the strong things that should not appear on the market, sold to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe a gloomy old man with an eagle hook nose, looking at someone else is like hoping to eat someone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe a glamorous middle-aged man, like most tycoons who are engaged in illegal activities, dressed in decent clothes, have a high society elite to do send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the only thing that can't be such a person, one looks like only sixteen A seven-year-old boy. Why does he have the courage to fight against the three giants? Where did he get these private liquors sold? One problem after another appeared in their minds, but when they looked around, they couldn’t help but stumble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen young people around them. These people are like the teenager in front of them. They are half-sized boys, and some black fluff remains on some lips! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is you coming?" Du Lin lost a cigarette to Dudu. His mission was not bad. The most important thing is He will think, this is good and important. Whether it is a gang or a force or a company, people who need to think will do things. People who think will be talents, and all businesses need talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Buddha reached out and took the cigarette, took a two-step walk to Doolin, took out a match in the pants, and slammed a white phosphorus Accumulated enough heat in the short friction and burned up. Suddenly the fire illuminates the side of Doolin, simple, ordinary, but there is also a taste that can't be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a strong and awkward white smoke rose, Du Lin took two breaths and spit out a faint smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people on the ground look at me, I see you, they are silent, they do not believe how these young people will treat them. Before carrying out this task, the captain told them that their opponent was a group of newly-launched chickens, and the danger was not great. After seeing the "boss" and his main "backbone" members, they even more believe what the captain said, these people are not dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may not even kill people, they may only threaten and then have to let them go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are more important reasons, that is, they dare not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodwood's sects are almost universally known in the gangs of the city of Tener, a person who goes crazy without a word. Under normal circumstances, he behaved like a gentle gentleman. Even if he did something a little unsatisfactory, he would only say a few words of encouragement on his face, even if it passed. But when someone or something really angers him, he will break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a mental illness, crazy, bloody, cruel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, betrayal is one of the conditions that triggers him to go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence, Du Lin is not surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't have his own name in this city, not as famous as the big guys, people don't fear him. The right hand slowly touched the sharp knife inserted behind him. He planned to teach these people what is called fear with blood and pain. At this time, Graf's muscular brain was once again back to normal - before he said that he had killed the policeman who almost found out that they were transporting private liquor, Du Lin thought he was a bit abnormal. Because he has become a bit smarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he is normal again. He took the pistol out of his pocket. "With this, this is very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firearm is a tube product in the Yaoxing Empire, in Yaoxing The empire accumulated a lot of grievances in the process of conquering other kingdoms and races. Therefore, the upper class of the Ogdin people do not want to see other races and are free to buy weapons, so the Empire has control over firearms weapons. Of course, like many laws that have been used as backdoors, this kind of control has become a dead letter, but in the small part of the city of Tener, firearms are still relatively rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no great use in the past. There is no huge interest in this. It is necessary to use guns and other things to snatch and conquer. Secondly, the order in the city of Tener was not bad. After a small chaos after the war, the new order was drafted. Everyone silently obeyed the rules and did not need to use such things as firearms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Graf took out the gun, the lives of the three people who were squatting had already come to an end in advance, and Doolin would not let them Live it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because... Graf and others, killed two policemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the news of the police’s disappearance spread, the three saw a pistol, and the guy who had not revealed any unexpected expression at this time would think of Du Lin’s hands. The pistol is not a problem. No need to do anything else, they just told the police to the police, Du Lin they can only choose to give up everything and immediately flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s mouth was pumping, but he didn’t intend to kill these people in the last second. What he wants is to make money, to rise, not to kill! He is willing to join the game in a more peaceful way and become a member of the game field. To do this, someone must pass the message to the people behind. But now, it is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
