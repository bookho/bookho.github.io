			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many young people who are moved to the ground, and they are able to stand here, and they are already prepared for danger. Poor lives, heavy family burdens, and the pressure of these teenagers, only teenagers can’t breathe. Even so, they still have the illusions of tomorrow and the future, so they came here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can choose, no one will take the initiative to join any gang and live a life of dancing on the edge of the cliff. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they have no choice, or they become the lowest-level workers in the society, earning a small salary that is barely enough for their families in heavy physical labor all day long. . Then at the right age, there is no culture at the same time, and the same work in the eyes of the big man belongs to the "defective" business, living in a dark and simple shack, spending some gray in some trivial matters and quarrels. lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either, take your life to fight and fight for a brilliant future. Even if there is a possibility of falling on this road, it is possible to stay in place forever, at least they have tried. Try to use your own hands to extravagantly embrace the future and ideals you want, even if they may die in the end, but at least they embraced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a moment, they won’t regret it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to light up the light of the moment than to spend it in your life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy breathing sound reflects the inner agitation of each teenager. They want to be jealous and want to cheer. They never thought of their dreams from their own, but they are really only one step away. They have embraced the future and their ideals in their arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a dream, it’s not a deception, but it’s real enough to make them feel the sun is bright and the sun is warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s promise completely broke their last hesitation. If life can be bought and sold, sell it to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of silence, Du Lin looked at the Buddha. "Take the gun and go to Graf’s bastard. I hope he went to Maixiang Garden. But if he is not there, he will come back immediately." Then he pointed to one of the young people who had had several exchanges with him, the same blood-stained young man, "I remember you called... Alice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy named Ellis stood out from the crowd, and many of his eyes focused on him. He was the first group of teenagers to join the fellowship. His father was sacrificed in the Great Patriotic War. The empire issued a pension of 86 yuan. There is a four-month bailout for each month. But there are two younger brothers and one younger sister in his family. The mother is still sick. There is also a grandmother and a grandfather. The burden and pressure of life is very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before joining the fellowship, Ellis worked as a helper in a hotel, only four cents an hour, working 11 hours a day, but Calculated only for six hours - there is a law in the Imperial Law that states that child laborers under the age of 16 cannot work more than four hours a day, and child laborers under the age of 18 cannot work more than six hours a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t dare to resist, because he knew very well that if he lost the job, the family’s life would have no dependencies and counts. With such a meager salary, he can't afford the cruel reality of not working for a few days or ten days. So even if he is extremely reluctant, he must be numb to deal with everything until his friend finds him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aellis is a little stronger than other teenagers, but it’s a bit short, maybe because it’s too small to do physical work, plus Long-term lack of necessary nutrition, so I am a little shorter than others. He stood in front of Doolin with excitement, his heartbeat was like a drum, and the ringing of the madness, even the pain of his wounds was ignored by him at this moment, as if it did not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Du Lin raising his hand, pointing at him and opening his mouth. "From today, you are promoted to the team leader!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to tremble slightly, which meant that his family, his family and their dark future had been completely changed. He walked up to Doolin with excitement, holding Du Lin's hand in his hands, his lips licking and kissing on Doolin's back. He kept saying thank you, and he continued to thank Du Lin for his promotion, and the tears in his eyes poured out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows what he has encountered in the past seven years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes he feels that he may be a little more comfortable when he dies, at least not living in despair every day, walking in a grey world. If you are not worried about the future of your younger siblings, if you are not worried that your mother will collapse after losing yourself, he has long chosen to be comfortable forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, all this has changed because of one eye and one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know how to thank Du Lin, don’t know how to be grateful, how to make the other person feel grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he kissed Doolin’s back like a bishop when he went to church for a pilgrimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most important thing he has found out from the few etiquettes he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You bring a few people, find Wood, don't do it, if you may be in danger, leave immediately." Du Lin looked excited and cried out. The boy, inexplicably also has some sentimentality, he patted Alice's shoulder. "This is what you deserve. Among all the people here, you have the most wounds, so this is what you deserve, kid!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice looked hard at his head, rubbed his tears and bit his lip. "Reassured, I will definitely find Wood, even if he hides in it." In the sewer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a cigarette and threw it over and ordered him. Ellis does not smoke. Poverty makes him buy no money. He only takes a sip and coughs up. The surrounding teenagers have made a kind of laughter and relieved some subtle emotions. Du Lin laughed at the lighter and patted him on the shoulder again. "What are you waiting for? Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dufo and Airlis After leaving the boy who thought it was good, there were only six teenagers and four girls in the room. The teenagers are left to cope with unexpected situations, while the girls need to clean up the place that has just been decorated and smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin arranged their work, went back to the office, sat in the boss's chair and looked out the window, and felt a little unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, angered him by assassinating Wood's confidant, let him lose his sense of proportion, and then let him take the initiative. Dooling thinks Wood won't kill Graf's mother and his brother, because doing so can only make others feel that he is weak. This view is especially fatal for Wood. Even if he had such an idea, as long as he has a calm person, he will persuade him to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
