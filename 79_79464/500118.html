			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After successive assassinations, Wood was caught in an extremely passive situation. Du Lin slaps his eyes and shoots Venus, if not Robben suddenly I remembered that my key was left at home and went down from his damn carriage. Perhaps he has now been burnt into a pile of white ash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Wood’s decision to grab Graf’s mother and his brother, he considered Doolin’s counterattack against him, but he never Considering a young man who has never heard of before, and a group of teenagers, can be so ferocious and decisive! In one day, in addition to Jim and Jiji, three captains fell under the assassination. The speed of public opinion is much faster than people think. It took less than an hour. Some people in the whole city of Tener already know that Wood's current situation is very bad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More trouble is another thing, Jim’s wife was peeled off and hung outside the open-air balcony on the third floor of Jim’s house, in Guart In the human tradition, the most severe punishment for traitors is skinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who know the insider are shocked by the sultry means of the boy, and at the same time let them have a feeling of not being able to spread, it seems that this guar teenager Unlike other guarts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Doolin began to spread wildly within the Guar community, and even began to spread around the city of Tener, and some even said that he was a guar The inheritor of the will of the kingdom regards him as the future hope of the Guar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of cruel means finally woke up to Wood from his wonderful plan, especially when he saw an unsigned signature on his office desk. After the envelope, it was even more shocking and sweaty, and the body trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, go check, give me a check, who brought the damn envelope in, and put it on my desk." "When Wood is violent, it hides the fear in the heart with anger. Today, Du Lin's people can put this envelope with a bullet on his desk. Does it mean that when he gets up tomorrow morning, he may be greeted?" Isn't his wife's good morning kiss, but a bullet that is out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Guars in Wood's home and company were retired, and the suspected Guarts were also illegally detained and beaten, but the truth is Nothing has surfaced. Wood knows that if he can't beat this slap in the fastest and shortest time, he is likely to become a laughing stock, and more likely to become a stone - a stepping stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Du Lin’s face could not see the slightest triumph and joy. He sat quietly in the court’s third court and watched the “match” between Kevin and Camille. In fact, from the beginning, Kevin set up a trap. He needed to make Camille think that this was a premeditated murder, and that the "victim" Nasha was one of the masterminds. So for this he left enough doubts for Camille to discover one by one, to expose, to seek explanations, and to let this guy fall into his trap step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the trial, Kevin proposed a new point that no one had ever considered before, that is, the murderer may not know Nasha. To put it simply, in Camille’s point of view, the case is composed of two parties, one is Morris, the other is Nasha and the unknown mysterious person, and only in this way can explain why there are many suspicious doubts on the spot. And evidence. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Kevin’s “Tripartism” argument was put forward, and with Camille’s speculation on some key evidence, it was built on numerous speculations. After a set of inferences that were more in line with the situation, he not only impressed the people who listened, but also impressed the jury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furly, he also gave enough evidence—the clothes of a bloody adult male and the testimony of two hotel staff, and finally Even the judge is convinced that there are certain possibilities for his argument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My opinion is that the case from start to finish, my agent Ms. Nasha is the first victim. First we need to be sure, Ms. Nasha As a believer, she will not violate pre-marital sex before she marries. According to the hospital’s inspection report, on the day of the incident, Ms. Nasha’s ****mo was torn and the wounds will not take longer. Six hours, in line with what happened to Ms. Nasha at the time of the incident!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin distributed the materials he prepared to the jury and the judge, too Give a copy of Camille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the incident, the coroner dissected Mr. Morris's body. In the results of the appraisal, we can clearly see Mr. Morris. Before I died, I didn’t have any kind of sexual behavior. From my point of view, after Mr. Morris entered the room with the unconscious Ms. Nasha, Mr. Morris was taking a bath from the house. In the room where Mr. Morris was disturbed by water when he was bathing, he could not hear the sound and entered the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Mr. Morris came out of the bathroom and was ready to put on his clothes to leave... if you believe." When Kevin said this sentence, the serious courtroom immediately issued a series of laughter, even the judge. The mouth of the adult can't help but tilt it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel City is not a bustling metropolis, there are no countless permanent residents, this is a small city, what happened to the small city The other person can quickly know the extent. "Leather pants" Morris is not an unnamed person. Most of his bad deeds are well known, so many people will smile at Kevin's little joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha, Morris will let a girl who has been stripped of him in bed, ready to leave after showering? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be kidding, how is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille’s face stood up in a gloomy manner. “Judge, I protest. The defense counsel’s ridicule for Mr. Morris, the main victim of the case, is a kind of swearing. The behavior!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge adults tightened their faces, knocked on the raft and looked at Kevin, although his expression was serious, but his eyes were in his eyes. There is a smile in it. "The protest is effective. Please ask the defense lawyer to respect the deceased."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin showed an apologetic expression, "Okay, I am for me." Apologize for the act just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third person who sneaked into the room met Mr. Morris and happened when Mr. Morris was indeed ready to leave. In the process of dispute, Mr. Morris was killed. In order to cover up the truth of the matter, the mysterious man forced a relationship with the unconscious Ms. Nasha and forged the scene, resulting in Ms. Nasha. In the process of being raped, because of the illusion that the rebellion will kill Mr. Morris." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the testimony provided by the doorman on duty that day, he had seen a young man in a hurry to leave the hotel during the time of the incident, and When I left, I had a physical collision with a hotel staff member. In an alley outside the hotel, we found a blood-stained coat and a handkerchief with blood. The blood type of the coroner passed. In comparison, the blood type on the clothes is consistent with the blood type of Mr. Morris, so I think there is a third party in the case that we don't know now, and this person not only kills Mr. Morris, but also Forced to have a relationship with Ms. Nasha in the sleepy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
