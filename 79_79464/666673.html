			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "Mr. Mayor, I have to say that your account is doing very well!", the investigator from the State Taxation Bureau put down the books in his hands. He took off his glasses and closed his eyes. There are already a pile of accounts piled up around him, all of which he has already read. He spent three days reviewing all the books in a rough way. He had to say that the tax account book of the city of Tener was "completely" and was made by the veteran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening any account with a few cents and a few dollars, and occasionally one or two large tax returns, ultimately not Proved to be "micro-profit", it is proved to be "charity." In the imperial tax system, in both cases, no taxes are levied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meager profit means that the profit is meager. In the business activities stipulated by the empire, most of the meager profit trade refers to trade related to people's livelihood, such as Mai Ren, Essential materials for life such as beef. The official has set the wholesale price and retail price of the unified standard, which is not affected by the fluctuations caused by the market supply and demand relationship. In addition to the existence of the “food security zone” and the “grazing reserve zone”, the empire has exempted the taxation of these small profits trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for charity tax exemption, it is normal. You must know that the charity dinner just ended has raised more than 40,000 donations. This money can be directly sent to need help. Poor citizens, but in order to avoid problems such as corruption and corruption, the empire has stipulated that all funds for charity cannot be directly distributed in cash to those in need, but in the form of materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, use money to buy food, buy fabrics, and buy a variety of things to distribute, so as to avoid as much money as possible to cause people to greedy It is also possible to prevent the money from being taken away from poor citizens by various gangs or groups in various ways. The materials purchased with good money are used for charity, so there is no need to file tax returns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this explains why there is almost a charitable donation every month on the old party’s territory, and they use this method to hide it legally and legally. Tax issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor sitting on the side smiled, not sure if he affirmed the investigator’s statement, or dismissed his statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigator smiled and shook his head. He took a handkerchief from his pocket, wiped the lens, and put the glasses back into his pocket. Then I looked at Peter. "Mr. Mayor, there is nothing in the world that can be foolproof. Nothing can be perfect." He shook his account and shook hands. "These numbers may be arranged relative. Reasonable, but I believe there must be some loopholes in it. I am a state tax official. I have contacted the account book Bit Nair for more than one hundred years, and only need to find a mistake. All accounts will naturally collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the books back on the table and took a sip of the already cool coffee. "Maybe you don't know, a new law will be announced in this mid-term election. The tax reform plan has been passed in the Imperial Parliament. It will be implemented in the entire empire. Your little tricks can last for up to two years. After the new laws and regulations are introduced two years later, the new tax will be compared with the current tax. No matter how good the fraud, it will look like nothing. Meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the fakes you make are more real, the more you fall, the more painful you will fall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Peter’s brow jumped, and he really didn’t know that the tax system reform had actually passed. He had heard of such a plan before turning the tax return into a passive tax return. The current tax return method is that the store sells the same thing, and then the owner records some information such as the price and type of the item on the book. At the end of the month, the book is sent to the tax bureau for registration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inland Revenue Department will conduct statistics on each sales record indicated on this account, and finally draw a total amount of tax to be paid, which will be carried out in the first half of next month. Call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the current tax collection method relies entirely on business people, but can business people really have such a high level of awareness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many merchants sell only three or five items and only register one item, in this way to save taxes. For example, a bakery in the city can sell more than twenty or thirty pieces a day, but less than a dozen pieces of bread, but they only sell two or three dollars of bread a day. Coupled with the initiation and phase of the commercial tax, the tax that needs to be paid every day is only five cents, and when it is more, it is also very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This counts, it costs three dollars a month! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the tax reform, everything will be different. To put it simply, it is semi-mandatory taxation. The taxation method of each trading company is based on the nature of the operation. Mandatory taxation is based on the number of employees employed. To give an example, let's take the damn bakery as an example. First, define the bakery as “food processing retail” and set a taxation standard, for example, three yuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every employee hired by the bakery, the monthly tax will be three dollars more. If the bakery employs seven people together with the chef and the buddy, Plus the boss himself is eight, the tax that needs to be paid every month is twenty-four dollars. The tax bureau will not control how much bread you can sell and how much profit you earn. In short, it is taxed. If you feel that you are not good at business and it is difficult to make a profit, you can not hire employees, and the boss is involved in the business. Two chefs and the boss, as long as nine dollars a month, will not come down at once? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each business site must strictly register the number of employees and the nature of the business, and no leakage is allowed. This file will be kept by the tax bureau, and it is also prepared for convenient spot checks in the future. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are also some problems in this, for example, the boss only hires two chefs, then the boss’s wife, children and even parents to sell, each Only nine yuan is taxed in the month. No problem, you can do this, but the Inland Revenue Department will conduct random inspections and unannounced visits. Once you find such illegal operations, you will be taxed at a monthly tax of 30 yuan per person. The span of the tax payment is one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One hundred and twenty times the penalty, it is very likely that some small and medium-sized enterprises will declare bankruptcy for one-off punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the law. When the purpose of law enforcement is to protect the law's own wallet, there is no human feeling to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a great problem in the imperial parliament that such a rough taxation method may exist. Some small businesses with poor management may be due to this law. It went bankrupt directly, but compared to the money bag of the entire empire, the bankruptcy of some small businesses was not in the eyes of these big men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter didn’t say anything, just kept a smile, but his eyes were a scorn. Perhaps the New Party can only think of such a rude way to increase the country's income, and this just proves that the New Party is extremely inferior in the matter of governing the country. Even if the tax in the city of Tener has indeed improved, it has nothing to do with him. It is the fault of the regional tax officials. It is the fault of those treacherous businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up with his legs and sighed. "Then you continue to work, I hope you can find what you said from these accounts as soon as possible." The 'key point', I am also wishing you a success here. I still have something to deal with, first leave, goodbye!", he stepped forward and shook hands with the investigating officer, nodded and turned to take the coat And the hat turned and left. For these accounts, he does not worry at all, spending so much money every year to hire the most professional people to do this, is not to avoid problems? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor apparently did not look as relaxed in the room as before, and his face became a bit gloomy, and the local tax officer followed him. By the side, "Take him the attention of me. If anything goes out, I must inform me at the first time. If things are too serious...", he stopped and looked back at the local tax officer behind him, his cold eyes. Let the local tax officer involuntarily stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
