			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called approximate place is not in the military base of the military, nor in any of the acts of Vanlier, the military sent this time Looking for an open-air cafe, he asked the cafe to clear the scene immediately after presenting his ID. Although the owner of the cafe was somewhat unhappy, he still obeyed the request of the ensign. After all, this is the military's order. If he does not cooperate, maybe the other party will arrest himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military’s reputation has always been very strange. To put it simply, no one can say that the military is a good person, except for the military families whose children are serving. Vanlier, who just finished military control, is even less likely to stand up and say that the military is a good person. The military is so good that it violates the conscience. Some kinds of free requisitions some time ago have already made the citizens of Villier resentful to the military. This time the military asked the clearance to let the cafe owner suddenly make a fortune, and it would inevitably be very hateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of fragrant alcohol and a nucleus burritos...", Du Lin ordered fifty pieces on the table, "This is what you are suffering from." Compensation for loss, although I don't like these people, but I need to talk to them now, but that doesn't mean I am like them, this is what you deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The boss who looked at the dead man's expression suddenly became a bit overwhelmed. He looked at the money on the corner of the table with some gaze, and some of them retreated. "Mr. Doolin, you don't need to do this." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that the owner of the cafe knows Du Lin. Many people in the entire empire know Du Lin. In the overwhelming reports of the previous period, there is not only the name Du Lin. There is also a photo of Doolin. He always appeared in the report in a positive image, and even if some people poured dirty water on him, they quickly fell to the bottom of the mainstream wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Du Lin’s mild gaze, the cafe owner a little embarrassed and nodded. “Well, thank you very much for your generosity, Mr. Doolin. Your kindness and generosity are as warm as the people know as well!", the owner of the cafe also has a very rhyming sentence, perhaps from the opera or poetry. In the eyes of many people, there seems to be a kind of literary atmosphere in the cafes. In fact, there are not many such things. Most of the cafe owners are very ordinary businessmen, and they are not so cultural. Statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also bent over and then turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no expression on the face of the ensign, and my heart is actually very tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Doolin, where are you this morning?" The second lieutenant adjusted his mind slightly and began to talk about some of the possible murders of the Mennon. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morning?", Du Lin took out a cigarette and leaned back on the chair. He didn't seem to care about the officer in front of him. He spit. The smoke said, "I have been at the construction site these days. As you have seen before, I need to be responsible for the infrastructure of the resettlement site. I need to supervise them. This is responsible for them and is responsible for all investors." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know that the Mayor of Mennon was murdered in the morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know, someone Tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Du Lin for a while, he asked, "Are you not shocked?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shocked?", Du Lin laughed happily. "Why should I be shocked? Because the doorman's bastard is dead? I have to say that this is a very pleasant thing. If it’s not too early, I might want a little wine to celebrate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Law frowning and asking, “Why? According to me I don’t think there is any holiday between you and the mayor of Mennon?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the owner of the cafe and sent him his sweet coffee. And Naba burritos, said a thank you, took a burrit and took a bite, chewed, and said the reason. In fact, it is very impolite to do so, but Doolin doesn't care. These people are enough to make him have to be serious, and the attitude of the other party is problematic. Appropriate humiliation can let them know that the west is not the western part of the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told the Shaolin about the doormen’s prevention of buying their own mines, including how the doormen are constantly perfunctory and procrastinating in the certification process. In the description of Dooling, the Mennon is a very stupid villain. His stupidity is that Dolin doesn't know what he thinks he is doing, but Du Lin not only knows that he probably knows more than he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very consistent with Doolin’s suspicion because he and the Mennon have a hatred, but from Du Lin’s tone, expression and attitude, Du Lin The suspicion is not very big. Most criminals will get rid of any connection with criminal behavior as much as possible during the incubation period after the crime. But Du Lin said this bluntly, giving a suggestion that Doolin would not be a criminal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more questions asked, the smaller the suspicion of Doolin. The inquiry lasted for about twenty minutes. When the younger question was just raised, Du Lin suddenly stood up. His actions made the ensignment somewhat inexplicably closed. Mouth, looking at Du Lin seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at the ensign, lifted his wrist and glanced at it. He drank the last bit of coffee in the cup and put the quilt back on the table. "Oh, I think you have learned enough. Your question has begun to deviate from your current theme. I should answer the answer. It is just that I have something to do. I will leave." After Du Lin clicked, he took the car and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the team disappeared into the traffic, the ensigns regained their gaze and looked at the books in their hands. There was a very absurd idea for a time. He felt that Doolin was not the murderer because Du Lin was "candid." Whether it involves privacy issues or privacy issues that are not involved, as long as he asks about the relationship with the doorkeeper being killed, Du Lin does not mind answering. These answers are true. He has such a feeling that Du Lin did not deceive him and did not fabricate a lie to perfuse a certain problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Du Lin’s frankness, Lieutenant felt that Du Lin did not lie and did not send people to kill the farmers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in the cafe for about three minutes to five minutes, and two passengers who looked like tourists were walking into the cafe yard. When the boss just got ready to go and told them that they were temporarily out of business, the two men went straight to the side of the second lieutenant and sat down. They took the book from the hands of the younger, looked at the contents carefully, and nodded from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two individuals are a new investigation team composed of several members from the Security Committee and the Military Intelligence Division. Their task is to stare at Du Lin and find When he made a mistake, he collected evidence of his crime. They didn't assign them aggressive tasks. They didn't need to arrest Duolin personally. What they needed was to collect as much information and evidence as possible about Doolin, so that they could directly kill Doolin in the future. In court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the two are not very good-looking. They have been staring at Du Lin for more than ten days. The whereabouts of his time and his sayings are not different. It is also a place where they feel discouraged. Ming knows that Du Lin is a jerk, a scum and a criminal, but they can't find Du Lin even a little bit of a connection with crime, let alone evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Mennon died, he died in Vanlier. The two guys, including the investigation team, felt that Doolin might have mixed hands, but the problem was... Du Lin really didn't do anything. Even Du Lin made a phone call during the first few days of running, and they also traced it. When the phone was on the phone, Du Lin dialed to Ziwei Town, and he gave it to his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two left after the transcript was confirmed, and the second lieutenant left the cafe with the sergeant. If Du Lin did not do it, then he could only concentrate. On someone else's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just half an hour after they left, a very ordinary Guar was wearing very common clothes and walked into the house without any eyesight. The cafe, he left after a moment, did not drink coffee, did not eat snacks, did nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to push for fifteen minutes, Du Lin put down the phone, "Hey, I know, I always feel that someone is staring at me, but there is no I found these people, I thought I was too sensitive, but not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no doubt that someone is watching us and it is near us." But I let you find a circle around and there is nothing to discover. These people should be military people, they have more experience, more advanced instruments, even now, they are looking at me somewhere. Walking around in my house!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the farthest window of the villa without the curtains as far as possible, as if there were Who is hiding behind the window is looking at everything inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there is a seven-story house about a kilometer away from the villa of Doolin, which is responsible for monitoring the daily life of Du Lin. The guy suddenly stunned. At this distance, it is impossible to observe specific targets with the naked eye. For this reason, the military has deployed several long-range military electronic observers for them. This kind of equipment is often used for military observations at a distance of five kilometers. Through a screen, the appearance of people five kilometers away can be seen quite clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from Doolin’s villa is only one kilometer, which is enough to make the villa of Doolin more clear. But the one that Du Lin suddenly turned his head seemed to be able to penetrate the limits of human eyesight, even through the walls and curtains of the house, and saw the observer who was sitting outside the monitor and watching Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
