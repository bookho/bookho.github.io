			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guartes were not the intrinsic ethnic group of the Yaoxing Empire. A war took place more than 60 years ago, and the Guar’s country was The Yaoxing Empire was wiped out, and the Guartes and the places where they lived were all incorporated into the territory of the Yaoxing Empire and became part of the Yaoxing Empire. It is undeniable that the Guarts showed their willingness to fight back and die in the war of the Patriotic War, and they did not want to take a step back. This caused great trouble for the Yaoxing Empire at that time. After the empire in order to avoid the group of defeated Guar people finally came up with the incident, a big man at that time thought of a move, that is, the Guarts were scattered and sent to all parts of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guar who was suddenly rushed away is hard to succeed even if they want to hold the group. In addition, after the Yaoxing Empire frequently rubbed against neighboring countries on the border, a third world war broke out called the Battle of the Golden Cup. A large number of Guart youths were forced to enlist in the army and died on the battlefield. Let the Guar people face a very harsh living environment. In addition to the large number of gualts that have been recruited in the war that ended not long ago, the Guarites have been devastated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Guar people lost their family labor and pillars, everyone thought more than one thing, and gradually let the Guartes It has become no different from ordinary people, and even more afraid of causing trouble. In this ever-changing society, the Guarts have become synonymous with "honest man" and "shoulder bag". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 2,000 families of gults in the city of Tener, under the age of 40, and fewer than 300 men over the age of 16. The rest of the war became the cannon fodder of the empire in the war that ended not long ago. On the balance of the war, it added a lot of chips to the empire and won a terrible victory. It is a tragic victory. In fact, for the main ethnic group of the empire, the Ording people, they are not a terrible victory, but a big victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They replaced the Ordings with a minority population to fight and successfully consumed the development of these growing ethnic minorities within the empire. Potential and future, not only won the war, but also purified the proportion of the population race, it is a two-shot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, Du Lin put forward the concept of "the fellowship". After Graf’s propaganda, he immediately got a lot of people’s response, especially The response of children who have just reached the age of sixteen and a little smaller. It is precisely because of the malicious feelings from the empire and the social malice that these children are more eager to improve the Guar and the environment in which they live through their own hands and efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that Du Lin is willing to provide a fairly good salary for these children who do not have access to social status, so that they can support themselves and their families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at a group of fourteen- and six-and-a-half-year-old teenagers, Du Lin looked at Graf with a look of inexplicable look. There are three more girls. If it weren't for the children's eyes that harbored expectations and vitality for the future, Du Lin might have negated these teenagers. At this time, he himself forgot, he is also a person of this age, no more than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pulled Graf into the corner of the side, looked back at twenty or thirty guys and three little girls, whispered: "No Adults? Twenties?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grawf smiled a little embarrassedly, and the Imperial Army put ten in the recruitment of Tnel Adults over the age of six and under 40 years old are forced to recruit into the army. Apart from those who have not seen the opportunity to hide in the wild early, there are no men who are young and strong. As for those who ran away, they were even more reluctant to join fellow associations with obvious gang intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These timid people and those who only want to live safely and steadily, the invitation to Graf was straightforwardly rejected. This made Graff feel that he was losing face and hated it in his heart. Usually, when those people asked him for help, he never said no, but now he has retreated when he is fighting for his rights. It’s not like a guar at all, not even a little bit of courage and discouragement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he was only able to recruit those children who were dissatisfied with reality and who were also aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Graf’s inconspicuous explanation, Du Lin also felt a burst of speechlessness. It’s just that the matter is coming, and Du Lin needs people, only to hold his nose and recognize it. Although minors lack some experience and lessons than adults, he can only pay more attention to these guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two returned to the crowd, many people apparently showed a nervous look, their eyes stayed on Doolin’s body, eager to Get a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, when some people showed disappointment in their eyes, Du Lin nodded. "The fellow villagers will welcome you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Graf directly glared at Doolin's hand, and in the horror of Doolin, he cut his knife in the palm of his hand and cut it for two days. The blood suddenly came out and faced the blood. The boys, including the girls, did not reveal the slightest fear, but they were so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Graf’s operation, the boys and the girls lined up, took the dagger from Graf’s hand, and opened his own palm, and Du Lin's palms were tightly held together. Unlike the last time, these boys and girls also kissed the back of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last etiquette was a ceremony of cooperation, a ritual that never was forsaken between friends, and this time, this is a ritual of allegiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unique minority culture of the Guart people, kissing the back of the hand is a very important etiquette and ritual performed by the family members to the parents, first from Gual. In the family of the nobles. During the holidays, the nobles will line up to kiss the back of the king's hand to show respect and obedience to the king. This kind of ritual has long been a ritual in daily life, and almost every guar knows a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the teenagers living in the city, because of the social environment, they are more admired and yearn for everything in the Kingdom of Guart, remembering the past Motivating yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last of the last three girls kissed Du Lin’s already numb hand, Du Lin glanced at the bloody floor under his feet, and his mouth was pumping . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the palm is not aware of it, the arm is a little numb, will it be amputated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, even crying at this time, but also crying and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded hard with a slap in the face. "From today, we are all family, we share each other and share glory!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf's face is a bit red, he snarls his chest and screams, "Sharing each other, sharing glory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Looking at the hysterical teenagers, Du Lin was surprised at the consequences of a ceremony and a sentence, and the heartbeat was a little faster. He squinted slightly, and there was a feeling of ecstasy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the township association in the city of Tener is just a small drop of water drops falling into the lake, and even the ability to pick up the shackles can not be done. Even if some people have learned about it through certain channels, they don't care too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of fellowships a group of half-children set up, like playing things, can also be a subterranean world that has not changed in the city of Tener for several years. Does the pattern cause an impact? Don't be kidding, don't say that the gangs who can only occupy one or two streets are not counted, how many of the real big gangs are provoked? Not only are there more professional team of fighters, but also the power of handcuffs and heat that are forbidden by civilians! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big killer, a hot energy is enough to sweep the 20th and 30th people in one breath, so everyone treats the fellowship as a play for the children. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people don’t care about the establishment of the township association, but some people care about the establishment of the township association. In the city of Tener, there is a big man in the upper class, the vice president of the Imperial Chamber of Commerce, and the guar, Heidler. He is very concerned about the initiation and establishment of the fellowship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a legendary guart and a guart that is discriminated against by the Guarts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a bit of a circumstance. In fact, before the demise of the guart kingdom, some of the gults had already surrendered earlier and became " One of the good people standing on the side of justice, one of them is the father of Heidler. At that time, in order to shorten the war as soon as possible and reduce the Ogdin people who died in the war, the Yaoxing Empire gave these surviving Guarts great benefits and high treatment, hoping to "probate" Guar in this way. The rebellious power of the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, these people have played a big role, but after the destruction of the kingdom of Gual, their situation is very embarrassing. The Ogdin people are not willing to give these good people more benefits, but also use a variety of excuses to recover some of the privileges. Heidler’s father was also greatly affected, and the family was once on the verge of bankruptcy. Heidler’s father died of a cerebral infarction and handed over his precarious family to Heidler, who was only twenty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler relied on his superb means and personal abilities to rise and fall, and finally established his position in the Yaoxing Empire Chamber of Commerce and became a person. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
