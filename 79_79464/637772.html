			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin walks into the office and picks up a bottle of packaging on the table The very fine wine was swaying, and all of them smiled and looked out the street. After Du Lin licked a stinky boy, he unscrewed the bottle cap and took a small cup with an inch of diameter and poured a half cup. He sniffed and tasted a bit sweet. Then I took a sip, and there was a trace of coldness in the sweet and sour. The familiar taste was the snow elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this new on the farm?" He went to his desk and sat down to drink the wine from the cup." It tastes good, it tastes a little better than the Snow Elves, and the packaging is beautiful. Which smart kid is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talent is always unsatisfiable If the market needs, if someone really has such ability, simply putting it in the front line is a disrespect for talents and a responsibility for their own career. Dooling decided to upgrade the guy who improved the taste and packaging of the snow fairy to the head of the trading company's drinking department, giving him enough power and money to continue upgrading the product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous reform and innovation is the guarantee of the vitality of a product. After all, people are creatures that like new things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what the Buddha said below, let Du Lin laugh out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not our product!", then he succeeded in making up a knife, "but is robbing us of our market!", and then played Nirvana, "The most important thing is that I found that their raw materials come from the products we sell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Products, this is Doolin asking everyone to replace private wine call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, this kind of private wine called "Crystal Dream" is spreading to Tener, which is more in line with the tastes of young people, and the packaging is more colorful and colorful. It has higher quality and character. Coupled with the familiar taste, many people think this is a new product that Du Lin uses to compete with Ernst and Karur. Many bars have sent people to contact the Buddha, hoping to buy this new crystal dream from him directly in large quantities and stop the snow elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem is that this stuff is not produced on the farm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensitive changes in taste indicate that the producers of the blending crystal dreams may be very professional and have fairly sophisticated testing equipment. They carried out the second processing of the snow elves they bought, in order to better taste the higher-end packaging and sell higher money. They didn't do anything, just blended some condiments and then changed a package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group is talent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked up at the Buddha, "Can you find them?", not waiting for the Buddha to answer, Du Lin continued: "I think so. If this The raw materials are from the snow elves, which means that they want to expand the market, they must buy a lot of snow elves. But we can not help but guard against another possibility, the other party has mastered how to blend snow elves. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Du Lin thinks for a moment, holding the chin for a moment, "first take out the order list for the last four weeks and see which bar is sold." There is a clear increase. I will send people to various bars to check it out. Do you have any very gracious guests, take away a few bottles of snow elves in one go. Look for it and see if you can touch the clues of these people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can find each other, don't hurt, take control and bring it back.", Du Lin slammed the two desktops with his knuckles. "Go and do it now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha is slightly bent At the waist, and then quickly leave Turin on the table looking at the attractive packaging bootleg liquor, smiled and shook his head, this is to show off their technology, or in challenging the Turin ah? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two days, calm delivery, calm collection, almost no waves, until Du Lin ordered people to take his new clothes come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler has invited him to meet him many times and wants to discuss with him about the future development of the fellowship. To be honest, Du Lin doesn't want to have too much to do with the tycoon, but he now needs a "special character" who can convey high-level information, avoiding the top of the city of Tener or someone in the state of Cannes. He came to "interest" and wanted to do something to him. He didn't know anything about himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This element of information is an important part of both development and war. Once the information lags, it means that it will bear a series of passive situations. . How long it took for Heidler to use the fellowship, before he could still use Dulin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting on Duma's hand-stitched clothes, Du Lin did not feel that he had become a noble superior. He felt that this dress was not comfortable to wear. A slight sense of restraint made him a little uncomfortable, with a desire to break free. But he knows that these hundreds of sets of clothes are not used to give him a break-up game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, I got on the same car. This time, no one taught Du Lin what to do, what should not be done, and only silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got to the place, Du Lin got off the car and looked at the guy named Ramas. He turned and left in the deep expression of the other person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a vengeful person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a child, my neighbor’s dog not only ate his cockroaches but also bitten his ass when he excreted his body waste, so he prepared for it. For a month, I made a small trap. Farmers living in the country tend to face the beasts, so making traps is almost everyone's skill. Du Lin dug a very common spike trap and then used the special taste to bring the dog over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the dog panicked into the trap, listening to it screaming with all his strength, he stood on the edge of the trap for a long time, saw The dog was so swallowed that he screamed and ran home, telling Mr. Kesma about the things here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening they ate a very delicious and special dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a vengeful person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time when he saw Heidler, the arrogance in Heideler’s bones has been reduced by three points. It may be that he is only one of his careers. A place to stay for a short time, and then leave after the end of the term. But here, now, the teenager in front of him used the facts to teach him how the word miracle is spelled - to fight "Du Lin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler personally poured a glass of wine for Du Lin, then sat across from him, shaking the glass and making a slight toast, "respecting the omnipotent money." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the truth, I agree!", Doolin also toasted, and tasted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
