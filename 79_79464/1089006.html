			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya sat sideways and looked up at her husband. "Why? Are you worried about your business?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter stunned, then walked around the sofa and sat down. "You know, my business is just getting started. Now I have some customers and friends, it is expanding business. It’s a good time. And we invested so much money in the early stage, it’s a pity to end it now.” He said that when he said these lies, he was a bit arrogant, yes, these are lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no business at all, no company, he deceived his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lie was born in the upscale villa area where their family moved from the city to the Upper Town. The house here is very expensive, with a cost of tens of thousands or even 100,000. The house is so expensive to sell, there are still many people to buy. On the one hand, the environment here is indeed very good, much better than other living areas, and the security environment is also very good. Every day at the beginning of the evening, security patrols patrol the entire living area without interruption. They even have dedicated vehicles and prepare two 24-hour doctors to ensure the safety of any household. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, another reason for the price to rise here is that the whole richest, most powerful, almost lived it's here. This is a very good channel. It is very helpful to broaden the network of contacts and improve the grades of the people. In addition, Natiya is a senior partner of South Commercial Bank. Moving here can also increase myself and the bank. The image, so in the end Natiya gritted her teeth and bought the house here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, the people living here are not rich and expensive, no longer the ordinary high-end community in the city, all of which are large enterprises. When the family or government officials start to move around, Walter will inevitably encounter some embarrassing questions, such as "Which line do you want to do?" or "Do you have a business card? I want to visit you." Of course, there is no truth in the case of such a guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this society, an invisible invisible big net has lived for everyone, no one can easily break free, and if you want to be detached, you must Ability, execution ability and sufficient connections. The formation of the network is constantly formed in the process of accommodating the relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Walter opened his mouth and said that he was just an ordinary full-time family husband, when he was fine, he was playing with flowers and plants at home, picking up his daughter to go to school, cooking vegetables for his family, etc. He is afraid that others will laugh at him. The fragile and sensitive self-esteem made him unable to bear the strange eyes of others, so when he came to visit for the second time, he lied. He said that he is running a small company and doing trade circulation. It is still insignificant at the beginning. In addition, if you find some more polite and courteous words and plugged others into further temptations, he can easily get rid of this embarrassing situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day, a visitor came to visit and invited him to play two. He thought about going to enjoy. Anyway, he has nothing at home. There are many familiar neighbors and friends in the place where he used to live. You can still have nothing to kill together. After he came here, he didn't know anyone. His wife also told him that it is a good choice to expand his relationship properly. Since then, he has gotten into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first he didn’t play much, winning or losing was around tens of dollars, and Natiya gave him 300 yuan of pocket money every month. In addition to purchasing ingredients, the rest are owned by him. At that time, although I was a little obsessed with gambling, but playing small, the number of times is small, the money is enough for him to spend. But as he played more and more, the frequency became higher and higher, and finally he found that his money was not enough. So he lied, why not turn the lies he said into truth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told his wife that he wanted to be a small business, that is, the trade circulation company he said. He used to know some friends and recently met a lot. New friends should be able to make money. Natiya did not suspect that her husband would deceive herself. After listening carefully to Mr. Walter's analysis, she felt why she was not allowed to try. Even if he fails and loses, this is also a precious attempt, indicating that he has the courage to take a crucial step. In addition to some of the things that Natiyah had in her mind about the things she had done in the past, she took out 10,000 yuan from the bank’s deposits and asked him to take a trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This money quickly became a victim of the gaming table. Of course, Mr. Walter also registered a trading company and rented an office in the business district. I took a tour with Natiya once. He may have had the idea of ​​running a good business, but the money eventually disappeared at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next big gap and the increasingly uncontrollable gambling desires have made him take money from Natiya over and over again with various excuses. Various reasons, various excuses, although Natiya had doubts and asked some things, he was subtly perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until these months, he began to infrequently take money from himself, Nadia’s suspicion finally disappeared, she thought that Walt’s company was on the right track. It is also very happy to start generating profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every woman even if she doesn’t say anything, even if the feminist movement outside is in full swing, they all hope that a successful and strong man behind him can rely on it. In fact, where did she know that Walter did not ask her for money so often, not that his "company" began to make a profit, but that the group of people had already entered another stage and directly borrowed money from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Walter resists moving because he knows very well that once they have to leave this place, those people will definitely go to the door to ask for his debt before he leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Natiya himself forgot, Angelo said that Walter owes gambling debts. First, Natiya did not think about her husband’s ability. I owe a "huge gambling debt", and on the other hand, I was forgotten by a series of changes like drama. I forgot about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattiya continued to pack up the things on the table and said, "It’s okay, this time I went to work instead of the South Commercial Bank. There are a lot of rules and regulations, and... the business environment there is more primitive than this, and there are more opportunities. As long as you are willing to continue doing business, I can give you more help.", this is not said. Wrong, the South Business Bank, including the Imperial Bank, has its own rules, or guidelines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff working in the bank can not act for their family members for any reason, and every step must follow the rules and regulations, which eliminates some people who are cheaper in the bank. . For example, Natiya can't get some low-interest unsecured loans for Walter through the relationship, nor can it directly introduce the bank's customers to Walter, which violates the rules of the bank. But it was not the same when she arrived at Du Lin. She believed that Du Lin was a young man who spoke better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it doesn't violate the "Duolin's Law," nothing can't be done - she has collected more information about Doolin's details in the past few days. So she knows the semi-official vocabulary unique to the city of Otis - "The Law of Doolin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watt wrinkled his brows even more irritated and even violent, if Natiya let him know that he has been cheating on her what will happen? He was so hard to establish a new family image that would be ruined. He didn't want to, and he didn't want the group to pick him up with a handwritten “bill” to make him embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and pressed his heart to the emotions, said with patience, "Listen to me, dear, stay here, you are all Envious work, senior partner of South Commercial Bank, hey, how style, why go to the backward place in the north?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My work has been handed over I am no longer a senior partner of the South Commercial Bank.", Natiya has lost her status as a senior partner since she left the job, and she is sensitive to realize that her husband is so disgusted to leave here. There must be other reasons. Suddenly, a little flash of light flashed in my mind. She stopped her hand and stopped. She turned to look at her husband. Walter had a little hair and asked, "Mr. Angelo told me that you owe me. A gambling debt, is this the case, how much do you owe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
