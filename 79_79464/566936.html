			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it taken by Doolin?" Prando rolled his eyes. "Do you think I am a fool?", Godol There was no buzz, which made Prando more dissatisfied with this guy. I finally pushed the responsibility to you, which means letting you go back to the pot. Now you push the responsibility to Doolin, not to mention whether he can afford this pot, and the responsibility is kicked to kick the first ugly. Definitely not Codor, nor Dulin, but his Prando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very obvious thing. The big man gives responsibility to you not to make it difficult for you, and Mrs. Vivian’s intention is also true. She and Prando can be said to be two worlds, and she does not have to go to a small regional police chief to reflect her honorable status. She just arranged this thing for the most suitable person, nothing more, no more other ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Prando pushed responsibility to Codor, Mrs. Vivian knew that there would be no mood swings, she could understand Prang More practice, can not let a police chief to go to the streets to find someone? She entrusted this to the most suitable candidate, and this candidate gave her the most direct person as she did. Then the transfer between responsibilities should stop here and cannot be passed on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Cadord intends to push responsibility to Doolin, it means another thing - everyone is shirking responsibility, which makes it clear It is the perfunctory of Mrs. Vivian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't finish the task, because you are an idiot, you don't have the ability and ability to finish my 嘱咐 I can't blame you, just like people can't blame cock Can't lay eggs like that. But perfunctory is another matter. What does perfunctory represent? Representing disrespect, representing scorn and dissatisfaction, to whom? Mrs. Vivienne may think that it is the police chief of this area who complained about himself, so he shirked his responsibility, did not care, and did not give himself the respect he deserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what will she do after Mrs. Vivienne has such an idea? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will vent her emotions on Prando, either take off his police cap or teach him a meal. But no matter how it is handled, it is not what Prandto is happy to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Gedor kicked on the iron board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence for a moment, just as his gaze saw the music box placed on the table, and when he was distracted and prepared to take out a few mouthfuls, he unexpectedly found that he was a few fewer than the previous days. The sly eyes quickly became violent, and he pressed the box hard. He couldn’t make the rough move in the drawer in the face of Codor, but he swear, must Give Xiun a lesson, an awkward lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, the person who can steal the things in the office of the director in the bright and honest, there will be no second person except Xiuen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something unpleasant, and with the grace of Zion, his Pangdu’s temper was even worse. He grabbed a handful of files at hand and went to Godol and lost it. Godor did not dare to escape, and he was born. The file file that fluttered everywhere was full of land. Prando stood up and walked a few steps behind the table. He pointed to the nose of Gotoer and said, "Stupid, stupid. I don't know if it is that idiot." Give you the idea, but you think it is stupid to be able to avoid danger in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to understand that this is Wei Mrs. Wei’an’s account has not been made public. Once you have not succeeded in constructing Doolin, have you considered the result?”, Prando smirked. “Yes, I may be punished, but you, song. Mr. Dole, the future tycoon, you will never have any good end. Do you think that only you know any tycoon, do you know the big guys?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prang Many fingers have been poked on the chest of Codor with his pace, and he poked hard. Gothol's eyes were pumped, but there was no evasive action, just looking directly at Prando, the police chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prando is not alarmist, and Du Lin can use Kevin to catch up with him, which means he can catch other lines. The city of Tener is not a certain city of Tener. The city belongs to a small group of people, a small group of people who are far-sighted and different. And now the vice president of the Tener City Chamber of Commerce is also a guart. He used to come out and remove Graf from the prison. It is said that this real tycoon and Du Lin have no relationship, he is the first Do not believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is a relationship, does it mean that there are more people who have a relationship with Doolin, but he does not know it? He felt that this is very possible. The broad handwriting and even his life could not produce a sense of resistance. Those big men might be more satisfied with his sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
