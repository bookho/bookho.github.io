			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry was chatting with a young woman about the art when she received a call from Durin, although Henry may not have outstanding personal abilities in the business world. But can't just deny his achievements in other areas. In any case, he also has a father who is known as a steel tycoon. The education he has received from childhood is enough to make him more educated than most ordinary people in society, including the classification of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a young girl’s slender palm in his hand. The delicate touch of the skin made him sigh at the cruelty of his time. He smiled and said, “I am When I was in school, I mainly studied the art of Flore Kiel. Do you know Flore Kiel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman sitting next to him is very decisive. Nod, "I also read some art books about this aspect when I was in school. The masters of Rome and Kiel think that there are many kinds of beauty in the world, but the most beautiful is the human body. In his book "The Beauty of the Girl", the works are detailed. Introduced the pursuit of art by the masters of the Romans Kiel." Henry looked at the girl with some surprises. "I didn't expect you to know about Flore Kiel and his." Art, it seems that we have the same hobby. Do you have any personal understanding of his artistic connotation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took a moment to say," Of course, I always think that he is very right, the beauty of the human body is more than the nature. I like art and I will integrate art into my life. Do you want to see my understanding of beauty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are we waiting for?", Henry said that he would stand up. This girl was known at a cocktail party. It was only a year since she debuted. She only took a small-cost movie and played the No. 3 actress. This is a more subtle and decent statement. To put it bluntly, it is a less important supporting actress. After all, everyone is a decent person, and they must always maintain their own face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl at the reception knew Henry’s identity and became enthusiastic. In fact, this is normal. The film circles in recent years have been raging, Irian After the establishment of the new city, it became a holy place for imperial filmmakers. Holy places have always been sacred. In ancient times, people sacrificed their gods with the most precious things in exchange for divine blessings. Now, actors also need to sacrifice money or power to get better performance opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two years, Kinsale has ruled the film of the big production. Just after debuting, he has been winning a series of large-scale productions, and the pay is quite high. Some people like Kinsale, because her presence raises the upper limit of the female star's pay, and now the same grade of women can get half the salary of the male star or a little more, in the past women's pay after the male star three One to one fifth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some people don’t like Kinsale, and her appearance is about 30% to 100% per year, in addition to stealing the limelight that belongs to others. The forty-five big productions were taken away by her. There are not many resources, and her eating is so ugly. Even if everyone is a good friend, she will always feel that she is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Kinsale’s sudden popularity has given many young girls more powerful motivation. Outsiders have little knowledge of Kinsale, her identity. It’s no secret to the insiders. It’s just that Du Lin’s sister is enough to explain why she is popular. As long as someone is willing to support, there is no chance that they will become a new superstar. As for someone behind you, there is something else that is another matter. The fame and fortune in the process of chasing fame and fortune always have to give up something, and the purpose of giving up is to harvest, this is normal, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the girl shared her anger and mourning with Henry, or chatted with something, she was not as enthusiastic as she was, and she was in a state of ignorance. This is also her clever place. Henry has promised that she will shoot a movie with a production cost of no less than one million, and she will act as the heroine. With such a guarantee, she can give Henry a bite of meat. She knew that she would be bitten by a dog, but before being bitten by a dog, she always had a bit of gain before she could afford the courage to sacrifice herself for art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the girl’s shyness and taking off her coat, Henry’s head began to congest like a head. He rubbed his hands and palms a few times and got up and walked to the bar. Take out two glasses and a bottle of wine. When you appreciate the art of discussion, you need something to set off the atmosphere. Drinking a little drink at this time is obviously a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone ring that suddenly sounded made him frown. He didn’t want to answer the phone. The girl had taken off her shirt and reflected the shiny skin on the fiber optic cable. There is an unparalleled texture, even if you just look at it, you can imagine the beauty of the touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone bell is still ringing. He picked up the phone with some trouble. He asked poorly. "I am Henry. I usually don't work at night. Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did me bother you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar voice in the handset made Henry’s unpleasant expression on his face soothing and turned into a smile. "Oh, no. No, I said to play, is there anything?" For Henry, Henry likes him very much and believes in the friendship between them. I don't know why he always feels that he sometimes is a little afraid of Doolin. This made him a bit confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin laughed twice. "I am not in the West now, tell me what happened recently, about the workers."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Doolin has a lot of people in the West. Why didn't he ask these people? In fact, it is said that the level is different, the angle is different, and the state and difference of things are seen. It’s like a person standing on the ground watching a mountain. I think this mountain is very tall and there is no way to pass it. If you look down from the sky, you will feel that this mountain is very tall and may not be conquered. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the little man and the eyes of the big man are completely different. The little person will completely hang around on the surface. The big man can see the essence of the problem, which is related to personal ability. It doesn't matter, it's a matter of angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Henry’s description, the workers’ union is now very strong. They applied to the headquarters for a lawyer’s team to fight the lawsuit and The pretext of "security rights" launched a peaceful movement to the working class of the entire empire, allowing the working class of each city to sign the petition and demanding that the court severely sentence the immigrants who killed the workers, justice and justice. This move is much more powerful than what it used to strike in the past. It can be said that killing people does not see blood. It not only shows the attitude of the working class and its enormous influence, but also does not affect normal production. The new trade union leadership is still a bit of a skill. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration is relatively weak at the moment, but it is not really weak. It is said that many people have contacted the embassy or ambassador of the empire in an attempt to pass diplomatic pressure. Reduce the crimes of those immigrants, or even let them be acquitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two groups are clamoring for a trick, no wonder the City Hall and the state government are so anxious and eager to resolve the dispute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Hall and the State Government want Du Lin to be able to work on these issues to solve this problem. There are two reasons for this idea. The first reason is that Doolin has a large number of farms and pastures in the west, including six mining areas that have been discontinued but still in operation, as well as some processing plants. There are over a million Western families working directly or indirectly for Du Lin. They rely on Du Lin’s salary to live. Du Lin’s influence on them is far higher than the government’s influence on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
