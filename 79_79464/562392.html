			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a brightly lit manor in the estate of Codor, and from time to time someone enters and exits, and all the people belonging to Gothol in the whole city of Tener are moving. Although they don't know much about the order of Codor, they don't hinder them from executing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn Cod at all costs - this is the task that the editor gave to them, and for many years no one or thing has allowed Cedore to say The word "at any cost", now he said, also let all gang members understand the seriousness of the matter. In the place where I saw it, in the invisible place, the people of Gothol were in action. They even went to open the rubbish bin and searched it again to see if Cody got the wind and hid it. In the trash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also opened the lid of the sewer and arranged for dozens of people to carefully inspect the pipes. These people searched almost every corner of the city, but Did not find the shadow of Cod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the woman who was screaming in front of herself, a woman with a look of fright, and don’t have the slightest sympathy. He is a male, at least he thinks so. He is willing to use mercy on small animals and not on people. Small animals will bite you at most when you are not paying attention, but people will take your life. He squinted his face and lowered his head. The fire of the cigarette suddenly brightened as he took a deep breath, and the face that was sitting outside the light was slightly reddish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bounced the ash, the ash rolled to the ground, touched the ground, shattered, and spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did Cod go?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman in front of her eyes is Cod’s “good old man”, she is not a girl of Cod, not a wife of Cod, she is just a woman with technology. . She has become the most frequent woman of Cod by virtue of her excellent technology or other similar feelings. Sometimes Cod will even live in her house. Many people think that sooner or later, a little two will really Live together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ced sometimes has some personal matters to be given to this woman called "Amy". She knows a lot of things, so she can't find the section. In the case of Germany, she was the first to be brought here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy’s lips trembled, his mouth trembled, and even the muscles on his face twitched and trembled. The tears stayed behind her eyes, and the makeup that was painted at night was washed out of a ditch. The inferior cosmetics mixed with the tears turned into a black torrent, and rushed in this small ditch. She wants to cry, but she doesn't dare to cry. She knows more about the horror of Gothor than others, so she dare not cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I don't know!", the scorpion trembled and trembled, like the heart of her disappointing heart was jumping fast, she quickly squatted, her forehead slammed into the ground, ignoring the fire The pain and short dizziness, she added, "I really don't know where he is. He hasn't come to me for a few days. Please, let me go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon indifferently stuffed the cigarette mouth between his fingers into his mouth, took a sip and spit out a part, like a column of smoke. In the darkness, he tilted his head slightly. "But I heard that you were still with him three days ago. Did I be deceived? Or do you think I might not know anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy couldn’t stand the tremendous pressure and cried a little, she straightened up straight, and the hair that should have been well-dressed covered most of her face because of the need I raised my eyes and there were two shallow wrinkles on my forehead. "God testified that I really didn't see him in the past few days. He really was with me three days ago, but I have to go to work at night, just one person. I left... yes, he said that he would come to him and they would go out and have some fun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear, I really don't know where he is going Where... God, I want to go home!", when she said this sentence, at least four people rushed out of the room, could not find Cod, then went to find Ken. Ken is also a member of the gang, and Cod is a key member. They usually have a good relationship and often have fun together. Some people have gone to Ken's home to find Ken, but they are not at home. If you don't want to delay your time, you will not go deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it’s not hard to find out from Amy’s words, maybe Ken and Cod are together. They have already found all the places where Cod may exist and cannot exist. Then change the way, will they be in a certain place in Ken's network? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon slapped the cigarette butt in his hand and walked over to Amy and squatted down. He took a handkerchief from his pocket and rubbed her. The makeup on my face caused by tears. Amy was trembling, and she didn't dare to move. She let the man gently rub the tears on her face, but she couldn't feel the warmth of a little bit, but it was cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn’t you just say it?", Gotoer rubbed his face for her, and whispered in a whisper: "My time is not More, understand? Even for a minute, a second.", talking about the handcuffs falling slowly, Amy's eyes rolled down wildly, his eyes filled with an extreme despair. In the next second, Codor's hand fell on her neck and her face became awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
