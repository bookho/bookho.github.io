			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the entire campaign team's research, Du Lin finally focused on the state of Abiloo, which belongs to the western part of the west and encompasses the almost complete West Coast. It is also why Du Lin put the focus of his campaign here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awareness of international consciousness means that international exchanges will become more frequent and have the West Coast. Even if the West Coast is very backward, it is equivalent to mastering the world. The key, and there are more than half of the Yagur Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of Yagur Mountain has been stagnant. From the bauxite mines and copper mines discovered before, the political situation in the west has been turbulent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall of the doormen, the demise of the Western Mining Association, the looting of the Freedom Front until today, the election is just around the corner, no one will focus on this cross On the huge mountains of the two states. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has also led to the current situation in the Yagur Mountains becoming very chaotic, remote, backward and a large number of forces and gold diggers gathered here, almost An impossible place, several shocking cases can occur every day. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, all this cannot hide the fact that the Yagur Mountains contain enormous wealth, just the two huge deposits of unprecedented stocks that have been initially explored. It is enough to provide funds for the development of the state of Abiloo in the next 50 years. For most politicians, this is one aspect that attracts them, but on the other hand they are stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a chaotic situation. These incompetent people are definitely one of the huge cancers of the Yagur Mountains. In order to successfully develop the resources of Yagur Mountain, it is necessary to clean up local security issues first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 350,000 gold diggers and criminals are gathered here, it would be difficult to clean up this cancer without launching a war. But if it is just to clean up the civilians who have not yet committed extreme crimes, the empire will not support it, which becomes a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But these troubles are not a problem for Du Lin, but his most arduous job - to stop the crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds ridiculous, but it is the case, and this is the most vivid performance in the city of Tener. The presence of gangs in the city is not the inaction of the city leaders, but the use of these gangs to deter possible criminal behavior. Once a problem is implicated in the ruler, these gangs will be thrown into the garbage like a butt paper. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only in the city of Tener, but also in other cities, such as the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang of the emperor has evolved into an organization that is different from the gang situation in other places. They care more about the security issues in their own territory than the director of the local police station. They are also more binding on the average criminals than the official. It seems that they are the true guardians of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why this phenomenon occurs, it is very simple, the police or the detectives, more or less will take care of their own identity and not dare to abuse the private OK, especially the one that is easily crippled and killed. Can you see this in the gang? It’s not a problem at all, not willing to cooperate? It’s okay to kill, there’s no need to think about other things, and it’s amazing to give a “glory kill”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer has a face, the deceased also has a face, and finally everyone will give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is another topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With numerous references, Doolin began to increase publicity in the state of Abiloo, which is not much different from other states and elsewhere. The main social issues are concentrated in four places – education, health care, law and order, and employment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be new social security issues in the near future, but so far only these four issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very backward area of ​​Abilio, it seems that time is still five to ten years ago, and there will be an embarrassing thing on the streets here. The illusion is like crossing the time, especially in some small towns far from the city, still retaining most of the pure wood buildings, just like a few decades ago, or more than a hundred years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the region with the highest level of acceptance and acceptance of individual heroism in all regions of the entire empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents living here have been facing many problems for many years, from robbers and robbers, or from some bully gangs, or even From the local sheriff who colluded with the folk forces. Faced with all kinds of troubles and dangers, people will not have a second way to go besides raising a gun to give a fatal counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many famous Western plot plots often come from some folklore and real people in Ambilo, such as three women who like and have technology A mixed musketeer, or a grandmother who can pull out two pistols from anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Doolin appeared in the state capital of Abilio and was the busiest downtown square in the state, the cheers of people almost shattered the clouds in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s personal style fits well with the social environment in the West and people’s understanding of “heroes”, especially on TV shows without hesitation last night. In the middle of the dry, understatement of the two smashed politicians, which made the Westerners' approval of Doolin a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people even say to people in other areas, "Hey, this is the real western cowboy, not the kind that will only use the mouth to lick someone else's eggs. The mother gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Du Lin is not a Westerner, although most of these people do not know what the TV is written in the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just stepped into the square and people boiled up. Hellman’s bodyguards were just about to block some of the people who came in, and they were pushed away by Doolin. "I don't need any protection here, they will eventually become my family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's right, cowboy!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good, this is the man of our west!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps clap with the cowboys, even It took more than ten minutes to walk to the center of the square, watching a group of people under pressure. He waved his hand and patted the microphone. The square suddenly calmed down. One by one wearing calfskin boots with rolling needles, pressing a felt hat, and the cowboys who washed the white scarf looked at Du Lin, they were curious in their eyes, and there was an expectation that they could not feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin and everyone kept silent. After 12:34,567, and seven seconds, he said, "I am coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An inexplicable "I came" did not cause anyone to respond, of course, this does not need any response, this is just a simple opening remark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly raised his finger against the sky, and the voice became very hot. "Yes, the cowboys in the west, I came, brought change. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not the kind of official who sat in the office all day and counted down from the first second of work. I am not here for mixed employment, not I enjoy the title of “Governor Governor” before I call it “Du Lin”. I will not only change Ambilo, but I will also change the entire empire.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But the first step is to start here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us talk about the issues we care about, starting with ... education!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I read a piece of information before I came here to stand in front of you. There are two universities, seven high schools and eleven primary schools throughout Anbilo. More than 90% of the students who graduated from the two universities left Ambiou to go to a more developed city, perhaps to those Westerners who did not admit that they were Westerners, perhaps the South. "He said that he couldn't help but laugh, and the people in the square laughed, and they were full of disdain for those who deceive themselves." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few laughs, Du Lin raised his hand and continued, "The high-end knowledge talents have become the current education and social issues in Ambiou. The biggest black hole in the middle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't believe my eyes, I have seen what I have seen, why is the lack of educational resources here? I may need to call what the guys they call 'the first few' are doing here? Do you know how to excrete except eating and drinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are these due diligence officials leaving me with such a big problem, and I still have to solve it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I am coming, I want To solve this problem, I must not only deepen the educational resources of Ambiro, but also improve many social problems. Of course, we are talking about education only."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The whole square is silent, Hellsman is sitting in the car and listening to the sound through the amplifier Some distorted sound, he has to admit, Turin's speech is not complicated nor so many skills, but he said the content, just the most able to seize people's hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incompetent attack on the incompetence of the predecessor is undoubtedly a very effective means. Everyone knows that no politician can do anything in a certain position. To perfection, find loopholes and tear open these loopholes, you can turn a predecessor, who may not be too disqualified, into a mixed ball and improve his reputation among the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, denying the predecessor’s merits can have the same effect, as long as the successor can do better in this respect than the predecessor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
