			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the main newspapers of the empire reported this news, with the picture that Du Lin took Ophelia out of their engagement ring. Also incidentally reported the surprises in the engagement ceremony, people have to marvel that Doolin's romance is built on money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an evening entertainment show, the host also used this topic to analyze the engagement ceremony that is known as the most romantic love. How much does it cost to be romantic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a professional accountant’s offer, people finally got a frightening number of at least 300,000, just an engagement ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the invited people are the upper class figures of the society, the food and drinks on the cold meal before the engagement ceremony will take almost ten Million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then are the very famous "sounds", at least 5,000 pieces of appearance fees, more than 20,000 may be more, such as the Empire A baritone. Coupled with other messy things, 300,000 is only the lowest expenditure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host did not forget to tease in the show, the word romance may start from today, and it is necessary to equate with wealth. Without money, there is no romance that makes everyone stunned, and it is even less likely to have a prince who is out of the dream, unless the prince is Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm of this engagement ceremony has even spread to foreign countries. Most people have positive comments on this, but there are always a few people who think this is an extravagance. Waste is to show off wealth, but fortunately such arguments are always only a few. After all, this is a world where rich people dominate society. People’s respect and fear of wealth is more universal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donlin doesn’t care about these arguments. It’s impossible for one person to take care of everyone’s emotions when doing anything, and want to take care of everyone. The emotions, then simply do nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you do nothing, you will be dissatisfied, because they are still working hard, but you are lazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Du Lin went to find his uncle, "Uncle Magus". As for why it was afternoon, there is actually a legitimate reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the engagement, Du Lin finally synchronized with Ophelia at the psychic frequency, sometimes the frequency will be slightly faster, and sometimes it will be slower. The first time in life, Ophelia, who has the same frequency as other people's minds, has not fully adapted and needs someone to take care of her. So in the morning, Du Lin is taking care of this woman who will become her wife. It will not be a little until the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to see Magus because he felt that the empire had many unsolved mysteries that plagued him, including things he had been guessing, such as Is it really a matter of fire between Magus and Bowworth? Why is Bowworth still a party whip, but Harry is out, these are very important things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that there are still more than three months a year, Magus has retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you aware of it?", if Magus had no official duties in the afternoon, he would read a book in the study and read the documents. This is an old man who fears knowledge. Perhaps this is why he is the prime minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the butler to send a pot of clear tea. The two sat down and closed the door. Magus took the teacup but did not drink a bite. Thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he sighed and decided to talk to Du Lin about something deeper. "I told you last time that this is not the best." Do you remember?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin nodded. "Yes, I remember this, you let me go to the next general election." "He said, paused and asked, "Is it because you want to retire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is part because of this, but another part ......", he was a little hesitant, I don't know if it should be said to Du Lin, but think carefully about it, it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean much, and Du Lin is also a man, and now he doesn't say that he is hiding. After he was known, he would inevitably feel that he did not trust him enough and destroyed the subtle relationship between them, so let's talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed again, "I am after the retirement of Barr... Kubar will become the Prime Minister of the Empire...", this is definitely a huge bomb, library Barr is the leader of the old party. If this election, Kubar, comes to power, it means that the old party will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the old party has been rubbed on the ground by the new party for more than 20 years, and the sphere of influence of the old party is constantly shrinking. Some even think that the old party is finally Will withdraw from the historical stage. But now Du Lin clearly heard that Marquez told him that the old party was in power, and his first thought was absurd. This is a false news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old party’s votes have been crushed by the new party’s death and death. The reduction of the sphere of influence means that there will be fewer votes, so what can the old party rule? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but soon he realized that this is not a fake, because this is what Marggs told him, these people must have any way to control the votes, even May be a means of cheating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes Doolin feel a bit of a pain. If there is fraud in this kind of thing, then in the future when he wants to run for the prime minister, is it possible to meet? For such a situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Du Lin’s face and changing color, Magus is a little small, this little bastard is like being born, everything understands the same, This made him feel a little shocked, but now look at his incomprehensible look, Magus is still very relieved, at least this is a normal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sip of the tea in the cup, he laughed twice, he knew what Du Lin was going to ask, so he didn’t wait for Du Lin’s question, he said The answer is made, and this is the tacit understanding and synchronization between the wise and the wise at the level of wisdom. People like Henry will never realize this kind of pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I retired, Bowworth will become the leader of the new party, the chairman of the new party committee will remain unchanged, and the vice chairman of Dolly will assume the position of the party whip, so I told you, it's best to wait, but you have your thoughts.", Magus was a little gloating and glanced at Du Lin, and Du Lin's eyes became a little deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really not the best time, or even the worst! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old party is in power, and the main resources of the whole society must be in the hands of the old party members. If you want to do well in your position, you want to rely on the cabinet policy. Tilting and resource allocation are absolutely impossible, and you can only rely on your own efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More troublesome is that Bobos, who represents the "civilian faction", will come to power. This person has attacked Du Lin more than once and has targeted him. No matter what purpose he used to do before, it will become unimportant after he takes office. What happened in the past will become a signal, a trouble signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowworth doesn't like Doolin, naturally there will be a large number of followers of Bowworth who will be difficult for Doolin when necessary to ensure the correct political line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Bovos does not have any prejudice against Doolin, he will not take back the things and opinions he has done. The position of a party leader cannot be wavered. Even if he is doing something wrong, he must be hard to maintain himself. The authority within the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old party, as well as the issue of the civilians, the next eight years is indeed a troublesome time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has been meditating, and Magus did not bother him, quietly got up and walked to the desk, put on reading glasses, and looked at it with a book. . Some things have said that the promotion of Doolin is far from the improvement that Du Lin himself wants to understand, and there are some things in these changes that point to the core of politics. This requires Doolin to understand himself. After about forty minutes, Du Lin suddenly took the cup and took a sip of tea. He shook his head and sat on the sofa looking at the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus lowered his head and glanced at Du Lin through the gap between the eyeglass frame and his forehead, then put the book down. "I want to understand?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Linyi nodded, "I want to understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mag Sihaha smiled twice. "Talk about it, see what you think is right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin smiled and sighed, "contradictory, tune "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two words, but it is enough to make a great change in the eyes of Magus. He really wants to understand, maybe this is what he always likes. For Du Lin’s reasons, this young man’s sensitivity to politics is terrible. Many people may not understand what is happening inside, but this young man can find the core of the problem in less than an hour. Intuition is simply a feeling of fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past two decades, the empire has ruled the empire for aristocratic groups, although the new party has given civilians under your leadership. More rising channels and opportunities, you can be the representative of the great aristocracy. For nearly three decades, people have been talking about the new era of new society, but so far there has not been a leader of the civilian class."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The civilians within the New Party have already given up a lot of grievances. I heard that they have a saying that they are expatriates who are excluded from the core group. These grievances are in three Ten years of precipitation has always been erupted, and it is also necessary to meet more common public awareness and recognition of 'new', so Bowworth must go on stage."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
