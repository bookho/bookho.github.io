			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the most luxurious hotel in the Upper Town of Kingstown, Tallin is sitting with Kevin and chatting most of the time. He is listening, Kevin is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We use a slight amount..." When Kevin stopped talking about the word, he smiled and rubbed his eyes twice and continued: " We divide criminal behavior roughly into two types, one that causes malignant consequences and one that has no serious consequences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Generally, there is no serious Most of the consequences of the crime will be cracked, every Saturday from 9 am to 3 pm, in the city court, the judge directly decides the way of handling and the standard of sentencing, most of which are months of labor, no more than Eighteen months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And those that have had a vicious consequence, have a huge impact on society and have caused serious injuries and deaths, or some individuals And if the enterprise, or even the government, suffers huge losses, the lawyers of both parties will select a date and then conduct a trial. The final guilty is to be handed over to the civic jury to decide, and the judge can only be responsible for the standard of sentencing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If the losing party refuses to accept the judgment of the city court, it can appeal to the higher-level state court... Sorry, you call the state a province, you can understand it as a high court in a certain province.", in the kingdom of Guart They refer to the state as the province, and the courts are also arranged from the Grand Court (City), the High Court (at the provincial level), and the Supreme Court (the national level). In the Yaoxing Empire and the Freedom Federation, they used the state at the administrative level of the province. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the guarants who love to remember the past, they still call the state a province. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin said that he did not care about this small problem, and let Du Lin continue to say it, he also poured a glass of water for Kevin. As the most luxurious hotel in the city of Tener, don't say that it is a high-altitude wine. What do you want? However, Kevin said that he never drinks alcohol because drinking is easy to make his brain slow. For a lawyer, a slow brain is equal to the countdown to his career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a sip of water, Kevin continued, "The state court will refer to the advice of both lawyers for at least three trials, and finally a citizen of at least 20 The jury decides whether the final charge can be established. If the case itself does not have a special meaning, the trial result of the state court will be implemented as the final result. If the case raises social concerns or triggers a series of other problems, Then the case will be referred to the Supreme Court of the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A small defense was too bad, and it was still a notorious gang who died. Even the state courts are reluctant to be harassed by such cases. Even if someone complains, it is only possible to be dismissed.", Kevin's It’s all a smile in my eyes, and it’s so easy to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not taking into account that his mother’s body has been bad, and he hasn’t earned enough money to buy a house in a big city, he left the special two years ago. Nair City. As he turned over the case for teachers who had sexually abused underage female students, he already had his own status and prestige in the legal profession. He was constantly invited to participate in litigation and defense in some cases, which earned him a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, from the first time he stood in court and did not feel any tension, a few words at random let the lawyers of the other party speak out Until now, no profit from any employment has exceeded that of Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole thousand, even if the victim’s family said “he has sold the soul to the devil”? If a person is kind and positive, he will never choose to be a lawyer. When a person decides to become a lawyer, he is destined to have lost his holy heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Heaven": The third volume, suffering, the nineteenth sentence: He played with his tongue, and called the night lie into a day, every single sentence, sin Just one more weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a cup and take a sip of water, Kevin suddenly curiously asked: "Mr. Doolin, have you read legal books? Or theocracy? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question has been hidden in Kevin's heart for three days, when Du Lin said "self-sufficiency", "minor" such a special judicial nature In the vocabulary, Kevin had a feeling that Du Lin absolutely did not say what he said, not as simple as he showed. If you haven't read the legal materials, it's hard to say such a very important prefix vocabulary when discussing a murder case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of the law of the empire was copied directly from the theocracy law. Of course, all lawyers are very clear. After the imperial royal family overthrew the theocracy, a group of aristocrats who did not have judicial knowledge became the main personnel in the judiciary. In the face of a blank piece of white paper, they racked their brains and did not know how to write a set of laws applicable to the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know which big man has a whimsy, so they opened the theocracy and borrowed a lot of explanations from the theocracy, and quite a few have been using it. to date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the explanation for the fact that non-adult crimes should be lightly affected comes from the theocracy law, "Children are still obscured, God has not given them wisdom, even if they are wrong, they are wrong in God." Those nobles may feel so It’s not appropriate to plagiarize directly, and I can’t think of a perfect sentence, so they wrote on the first line of the thirteenth page, “The crime of juveniles should be taken lightly, and education warns them of the right way to treat others, and Slightly disciplinary"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin’s slightly inquiring eyes did not make Doolin’s slightest volatility, he shook his head with the glass in his hand, “although very I don't want to admit that I didn't know how to write about fifty words until a few days ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin was shocked, he spent most of the time these days With Du Lin to discuss the next thing to do, he always thought that Du Lin had a very good education, after all, the etiquette and demeanor that Du Lin showed, is definitely not a normal Guart can show. It was not until this time that he realized what Du Lin said, that is, he was still an "illiterate" a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin can't believe what he heard, illiterate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I finally believe that the gods are saying that God is omnipotent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the face of Kevin's long sigh, Du Lin could only shrug his shoulders. He could not say that he had dreamed of dreaming of another world. He watched a baby in a falling field step by step into a big man, and died in a turn, and was taken away by a bullet. So at this time, he can only remain silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, someone knocked at the door rhythmically, and both Doolin and Kevin were at the same time. In front of the glass window, look at a car that has just stopped outside the hotel door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris supported Nasha, who passed one hand from Nasha’s armpit and pressed Nasha’s weight to himself. The reason why the Golden Code is classic is that it is high enough, and many young people who drink high-alcohol for the first time can easily drink more and drink unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need my help?", Nasha's "male classmate" drunk and came over, this guy is still very fond of Morris. If it wasn’t for him, then the girl named Nasha might have refused to drink. It was because of his persuasion and personal tasting by his two other female companions that Nasha had a curiosity to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the degree of wine, the initial stage of drinking the belly will not feel any drunkenness. When Morris opened a bottle of gold, the girl Nasha apparently drank a little more. It may be that she feels that her companions will take care of her, and for the first time, she encountered a high-grade wine such as Jindian, so it is inevitable that she will compete with herself and be convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also led to the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already opened the room, I wish you a happy evening." Morris patted the boy's arm to reveal a smile. Then, with Nasha, I walked into the hotel one step at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a regular customer here, a standard room as long as three nine, is not worth much for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris had a strange plot. When he went to bed with his favorite girl, he thought it was a very sacred thing. He never finds a place where no one is like a young boy or girl to solve the problem of hormonal flooding. Going to bed is like a ritual. Only by completing every step of the ritual can he feel the happiness from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who was drunk and unconscious was in the room she had booked. He turned on all the lights, put the girl on the bed, and then gently and carefully took off Remove all the clothes from the girl and cover her with a cup. He also kindly put a glass of water on the bedside table, in case the girl suddenly woke up because of excessive drinking and dry mouth and need to drink water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took off his clothes and put them on the hangers neatly in the closet. He put on his bathrobe and walked into the bathroom, took off his bathrobe and hung it on the clothes rack in the bathroom. He faced a mirror, his hands clasped a triangular pendant on his chest, silently praying. It is the emblem of the Catholic Church, and there is one eye in the triangle, which is mysterious and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he walked under the shower and began to clean every place on his body. Perhaps there was a lot of wine before, and he was a little smoked. The moment he closed his eyes when he blinked, it seemed that the whole world was spinning. He likes this feeling and likes the feeling that he is the center of the world. The whole world revolves around his own feeling of rotation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, he was a little bit refreshed, put on a bathrobe, and walked out of the bathroom. Glanced at the bedroom, he picked up the bottle of water on the table and poured a cup for himself, taking a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
