			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things that are very old-fashioned about the mineral resources market. It can be said that the West Mine will play the rest, but after the processing of the Mennon, and some The processing of economic architects makes the whole theory sound very tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One third of these miners in the West belong to people with a certain level of culture, they can understand what the Mennon is advocating, these people The face is not showing the tired and boring look, it is a deep ridicule. Two-thirds of the people actually don’t understand what the Mennon is saying, what the macroeconomic structure, the empire and the international ore regulation are like scriptures or cult scriptures. It gives people a feeling that sounds great, but seriously thinks and feels that their brains are not enough. Anyway, they are confused and believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference has been going on for almost twenty minutes, Carter suddenly bent up and stood up, carrying a suitcase to the toilet next to him, told him according to Ellis The process, which will soon be in the example stage, is one of the reasons why the Mennon will set up the venue in the opera house because he needs a larger projection screen to play some of his simple graphic data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of projection, it’s not much different from the movie player. The Opera House also has this set of equipment, most of which is used for some night scenes. Program. Minimize the light, then put on the projection of the starry sky. As the time in the opera passes from night to dawn, the light will gradually light up, which will give the ladies and gentlemen who appreciate the pattern a better sense of immersion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the background of Carter’s departure, Raul snorted, and he said to the guy with a mad face on his face, “He actually carried The suitcase left, I know, this means that he doesn't trust us and treats us as a thief! If he trusts us, he won't take the suitcase with him and go to the bathroom. This person's character has a problem!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter doesn’t know that he’s starting to prepare for the assassination, but he’ll never mind if he’s sitting next to him when he’s killing the doorman. Get rid of it. After checking that there were no people in several compartments of the toilet, he entered the innermost one. While lifting your foot, gently press the handle of the water tank, let the water in the water tank continuously flow out, and put the box on the raised leg. The pistol and magazine were removed from the two books, and the insurance was opened after checking the pistol again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pistol was inserted into his arms, and he took the bottle out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not wine in the bottle. The faint amber liquid is actually kerosene with some booster and thickener added. He did not intend to leave here alive. In fact, Ellis did not know that Du Lin had arranged an escape route for Carter, but he refused. His current situation is very bad, and the pain has been afflicting him, which makes him nervous and weak. When people are vulnerable, they always think of something that makes them regret or sad, and punish their present with their past mistakes, which can produce a distorted pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter always recalls his wife and daughter. Whenever he is half-sleeping due to pain and fatigue, he will recall that he was Lost on the side of the road like a broken doll like a daughter, and the wife who was killed by the old Fules in front of her face. He missed them very much, and the thick thoughts surrounded him like water. He was the one who dive into the water. He longed to blend in with his thoughts, eager to embrace his wife and daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the time has come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he escapes, he will continue to suffer from the death of life every day, and he will slowly squat in his thoughts, but he will not leave today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fuels were prepared for himself, and even if the police found their own bodies, they could not distinguish themselves. Then there was a black post, and when he was ready, he left the toilet with a suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to his seat, Mennon looked at him, but there was no indication that these mine owners were satisfied with him, and it was impossible. Don't let these people not go to the toilet during the conference? He made a gesture at hand. "I have a legend here. I can more intuitively let you know the trend of large-scale trading and bulk trading in mineral resources trading in recent years. From here, you can more clearly discover the overall business. The advantage brought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and waved, all the lights began to darken, appearing on the white screen behind him. A graph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The red line represents the bulk trade, and the green line represents the block trade. It can be seen from this graph over the past ten years. During the period, the transaction volume of the two different trades was mainly dominated by bulk transactions, which gradually evolved into a large-scale overall transaction. The recovery of the imperial economy has made metal and mineral resources more in more places. For example, our railway tycoons have not yet When he was lying in bed, he directly placed a super order for the Empire's largest steel company more than two years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“At that time, the steel companies themselves had insufficient mineral resources, so they also placed an order for the Western Mining Development Committee, which is full of two million tons of iron ore! I think most of you here are also involved. In that transaction, led by the Western Mining Development Council, the excess resources in your hands will be pooled and then sold to the steel group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the bulk cargo The market share of the transaction has been shrinking continuously, and the overall trade with the bulk has opened a great distance. More and more enterprises are increasingly demanding metal and mineral resources, and they need more convenient Trading mode, instead of sending buyers to the west, picking up dozens of tons of pick-ups here, and buying hundreds of tons there. In addition to wasting more money, it will greatly extend the time to complete the contract, in Xie Lisi There is a saying in the street, 'Time is money'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we established this trading market, we took the market management committee as the middle Whenever there is a large trade order, the order will be split into your hands according to the total number of mineral resources owned by you and your credibility, and finally transferred to the demand side..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is what the West Mine will do at the time, but this time the Mennon changed its name for its project, called the mineral resource trading market, for the benefit of itself. The department changed its name to the market management committee. In fact, the overall structure is still the set of the West Mine, but he has a little packaging and turned into something that looks very fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attention of the miners is gradually attracted to the narration of the peasants, and these things must be accepted regardless of whether they are willing to accept them. Since there is no second way to go, why not try to understand it in more detail? At least these things will represent the future interests of everyone. In the case of interest, no one is willing to lag behind. Even Raul’s words closed his mouth and listened carefully to the introduction of the Mennon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the doorman walked and said, gradually walking to the edge of the stage near the edge, Carter knew that his chances came. He didn't hesitate, didn't even stand up like some assassins in the movie, yelled to death, and then said some seemingly funny lines to trigger the trigger of the pistol. He put his hand directly into his arms in a sitting position. This action is not dangerous at all. Maybe he just wants to take a cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he pulled out the pistol, people didn’t realize that a terrible assassination was about to appear in front of them, only the doorman faintly felt a little uncomfortable. The gun that screamed at the moment of looking for this uncomfortable feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mennon stepped back a few steps. He looked down at his chest and his chest hurt. It was just a little pain. The pain didn't even make him feel unbearable. Immediately after the people around him began to flee, Carter poured kerosene on himself and walked toward the Mennon with a gun. At this point there is less than eight meters between the two. He continually pulled the trigger, and the bullet whizzed and shot from the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman is like an obedient puppet that has been manipulated, constantly reversing and constantly shaking. The white shirt on his chest has been dyed with blood. At this time, he still supports his two legs that have been stiff, the muscles that are controlled by the survival instinct, and the tight muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding guards have reacted. When they took out their guns and pointed at Carter, Carter threw the black posts on the stage. The lighter he had already held in his hand was hit by him, and he turned and rushed to the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshot sounded behind him. He felt that a lot of people were pushing himself, slammed into the toilet half-slipped, and closed the goalkeeper broom and The mop arrived behind the door. The blazing flame continued to devour his life, and at this moment he did not feel any discomfort except for the pain that was not weaker than the headache. He squatted open the door of a compartment, turned and sat on the toilet, clasped his hands together and held it on his chest, bowed his head and began to meditate on the Apocalypse chapter in the Guart scriptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gods see the earth and suffer, want to spread the gods to the earth, they find the king, bless him, so that he has powerful power, smart Wisdom, will not be confused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods said to the first king, you must let everyone out of the hard life, you want people to eat Full, let people wear clothes and not fear the cold, so that people have their homes without being attacked by beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must conquer the enemy and cut off the enemy's head so that They are afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must love others, even if others offend you, you have to ask the reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the detectives of the Van Liar Investigation Bureau appeared on the scene, there was nothing more than a burst of scalp numbness can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
