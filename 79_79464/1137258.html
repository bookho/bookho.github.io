			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the top layer, there is not only such a single room being gambling, there are more rooms, and the people playing here are either socially famous. The big capitalists have great social influence, either from the political system. After all, it is only an hour or so away from the emperor - after the upgrade of the steam locomotive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck casinos are not difficult to get out of the Doolin system, the resistance is not small, it requires a lot of people to cooperate, not just the shareholders in the casino, Otis The big bookmaker also includes many people from other parts of the society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Chamber of Commerce, such as some influential capitalists and officials, only these people work together, good luck casinos can be from the whole city of Otis Going out independently and becoming an independent individual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these cards are indeed normal spinach behavior, but some are bribes with spinach games. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Empire’s Anti-Official Crimes Act and the birth of the Bureau of Investigation of Official Crimes mean that the cost of duty crimes is constantly increasing and the risks are coming The bigger it is, the more it has stopped certain types of duty crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but at the same time, it also makes the very common types of job crimes begin to become less common, more confusing and secretive. A gamble like this is organized by casino shareholders to bribe some people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only need to let a fixed person keep winning. The law of the empire clearly requires officials with positions to be unable to capitalize. The forces traded money, but did not stipulate that they could not gamble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe before this, but gambling in the city of Otis after the establishment of the SAR is a legal act, as for legal income in the course of legal acts, it is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about two o'clock in the evening, Chap personally went to each room to shake hands with these important guests before the end of the game. In short, he performed very well. Also make some people very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is moving in a better direction, getting closer and closer to what Chap hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigorous tax reform was first implemented on the site of the New Party. This is also inevitable. In the world of Doolin’s dream, there is such a saying, There is still a need for self-hardness. Although there is no such concise expression in this world, there are similar sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you need someone to surrender to you, you must have a reason to surrender them!", it seems to be a very special sentence, Magus does the same. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first conducted a tax reform and taxation survey in the New Party’s jurisdiction, and whether or not there was any problem, the next investigation was conducted against the enterprises within the old party, and When it comes to those big aristocrats and big consortia, others can't find some reasons to smash Magagues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now the most important thing in the empire, and the city of Otis, the nearest money bag from the emperor, has clearly become the first "victim". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After determining the next steps, Du Lin will leave first, and he will have a new round of propaganda and speech for the end of the poll, but his attention Force, still stay in the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation team from the Imperial Taxation Administration entered the city of Otis on October 11th and began to investigate the tax situation of Otis City and gave Out of the reform opinion from the Imperial Cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, the empire’s tax process was carried out by taxpayers or companies or forces that need to pay taxes, and annual accounting statements, as well as accounting firms with national qualifications. List the tax registration form, go to the local tax office for tax registration, and pay the full amount of tax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this kind of taxation has many drawbacks. First of all, how much a company’s annual sales is the company’s own accounts, every Individuals are very clear that this book is written by people. As long as it is a person and has normal thinking ability, there will be a tendency to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under some coercion or other factors, not every accountant will strictly abide by his or her professional ethics as they promised to the empire. Fill in each number rigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this aspect of tax reform, there is such a case. In addition to the company’s own accounting, the Imperial Taxation Bureau will set up a brand new auditing unit, and the auditing unit will send accounting among various enterprises. Circulation, double auditing of the company's business operations, to ensure that the tax losses caused by account fraud are minimized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, with the cooperation of the Imperial Ministry of Finance and the Imperial Central Bank, a new public account and corresponding system will be established to ensure the expenditure of each money and There are traces of income, and if there is a problem with any money, you can find out the reason for the problem and how the money went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some other changes in details, it can be said that the Cabinet’s determination to reform the taxation is unprecedented and decisive, especially in terms of punishment. The intensity is unprecedented, and it is even possible to directly let a company go bankrupt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Du Lin left, he and Webster had an account, because the problem involved almost all the casino shareholders, Webster may not be able to fight them, It would be better to let Webster follow the Imperial Tax Office and directly kill these people on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stop of the tax investigation team is the seven major casinos. Their clear purpose is to make the casino a little scared, but under the comfort of Chap, everyone’s emotions are still More stable. After all, they did not move any rumors on the books, and the taxes paid were paid, and they were not afraid of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than ten days of inspection, under the full efforts of Chap, the investigation team did not have a small problem in the investigation department, you can say that the seven major casinos There is no tax evasion at all. This made many people relieved, including the investigation team itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the size of the seven big casinos is so large, and it’s a local one. If you think about big problems, it’s a huge hidden danger to their safety. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that there are more than one tax officer who has been assassinated for checking problems in these years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, Chap took a restaurant and banqueted all the members of the investigation team. They were delicious and good, and each time they gave a small gift. gift. The unspoken rules of giving gifts are the first to be established for journalists by Du Lin, and soon spread to all walks of life, and have become a social "basic law." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, when the investigation team was preparing to report the results of the investigation to the cabinet, the door of the room was ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team leader of the investigation team is re-examining the results of the investigation during this time. The information will eventually be handed over to the Directorate and the Cabinet. Others will watch it and he must guarantee The rigor and accuracy of the findings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time he made a move and looked up at the door. Not only was he alone, but also several members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down his work and raised his head. Two young team members stood up and one of them was inserted into his pocket. The fact that the tax official legally wears guns and has the right to decide on the right to fire is also one of the core of the tax reform. This is to ensure the personal safety of the tax official during the investigation. In the past, many investigators died inexplicably in the work, so The cabinet allows them to equip their guns to keep their lives safe from threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is there?", the young team member asked, there was no sound outside the room, just knocking at the door was like an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companion behind him had already taken out the pistol and turned off the insurance. He slowly opened the door and there was no one outside. He opened the door and looked around his head. The corridor of the hotel was empty, and only the wall lamp that was always on was still shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was squatting the word "strange" to close the door, the corner of his eye saw a portfolio on the floor for the documents. He knelt down and took the portfolio in his hand, and ordered a little weight, which seemed to contain a lot of material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched the outline and pushed a few times, unlike what dangerous goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told his team leader about his findings. After the team leader checked the portfolio again, he asked the assistant to take the camera. He felt that there might be some inside. Special circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
