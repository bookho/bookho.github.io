			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Royal College, it is not necessarily the Emperor, many people just send their children to school here, they still have their own work to do, it is impossible to indefinitely Stay in the capital. Most families who can afford 100,000 children to come in have a career of their own, and these parents will be very busy. This is true of any class in the Royal Academy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maduor let these children stand up and let the students who think they can settle their parents to call their parents and wait Was flat. Except for a few people, everyone else stood silently. Even if they call their parents, they are very likely to have a calm attitude. After all, the emperor is so far away from their home, it is not as long as it is, it is better to apologize to end this matter, but also to give their children a long time. A lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can young people get this kind of real "social etiquette", they are willing to beat and not to be humiliated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are about to get into a deadlock, the flashing lights and sirens in the distance make these students feel more intimate than ever before. Some passersby gave the police, and the police came very quickly. Two police cars drove directly to the sidewalk, and six policemen got out of the car and saw that the scene was also awkward. One of the police officers came over and he knew Madur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madul is still in the face of the Imperial Capital. As the chairman of the company of Celine, it is also a celebrity. In a city like the Imperial Capital, there are bound to be many people who ordinary people can't afford. Reciting the "hero list" is obviously a pass that every police must pass after entering the ranks. If you accidentally offend some of the big guys who are unlucky, it is very likely that the police chief will be black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Madur, you are...", the police officer tempted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madur smiled and handed a cigarette. "Nothing, we are having fun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Someone in the student immediately wanted to say something, but was pulled by the people around him, and then fell into silence. In fact, the student who pulled him did not say anything too powerful, only told him one thing - they are all students of the Imperial College. If today’s incident is in the police station, it is very likely that it will go to the newspaper. When it is early tomorrow morning, everyone will know that the students of Royal Royal College not only went to the bar to drink, but also happened to another group of people. Fighting events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Academy, which has been in existence for hundreds of years, has always maintained strict standards and requirements in some respects. If the matter is on the newspaper and is known to the school, they are likely to face the end of being retired. It’s really going to happen, they must be unlucky, and may even affect their future status and equity distribution in the family business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of rich people will not only have one child, which is related to their future destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence of the students reflects that Madur did not lie. In fact, the police are also very clear that the facts may not be the case, but the victims will not say anything, if they are hard-top Madur brought everyone back to the police station, and the last one was unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman looked at the silent students for ten or twenty seconds before laughing and taking the cigarette from Madur’s hand," Since it is a noisy game, then we will go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madul smiled with satisfaction, "Go back and help me to tell the Secretary, I see you. The police car has been very long. I will donate ten police cars to your police station next week!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police did not think that there was still an unexpected surprise, of course, used by police cars. The vehicles can't be any luxury cars, they are all custom-made bargains, and one is eight or nine hundred. But the mosquito is small and the meat is not it. Bringing back this good news may even be a familiar face in front of the Secretary. It is a good thing for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you for your generosity, then let's go back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the police car disappeared on the street, the students became more desperate, and a student’s father asked Madur to answer the phone. He was slightly surprised. But still walked into the phone booth. After about two minutes, he walked out and said to the student standing on the side: "Good, your father is scaring me, you can leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no surprise expression on the student's face, because on the phone he and his father asked to release all the classmates, but he can only be here when he can leave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he didn't finish his words, he was interrupted by Madur. He put out a finger and poked the student's brain. "I will say it again, you can leave. Otherwise, your father will not use it." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of this student is a member of a city, a businessman, Madur can not sell face, how can he have such an official status? Also have to give a three-point face. The new party, what is called the party, is an organization composed of a group of people who are unclear about the interests of each other. It is not allowed to know this big member and the big party in the new party, in order to avoid unnecessary trouble as much as possible, so he Raise your hand a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student was really scared by Madur. He hesitated and looked back at the classmates, and finally bit his teeth and left. If he doesn't leave, he doesn't know what kind of situation he will face next. What if he is injured? What if I am known by the school? At this time, I can see the dormitory administrator when I go back. There is a testimony from the other party. At the very least, he will not be retired by the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were five students who were gradually released by Madur, and several of their parents were scared of Madur and stayed with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wants to make a phone call, he asks: "I can understand your thoughts at the time. Anyway, I have money, just spend money." I can do all the things I want to do, even if it is difficult for others or to break the rules." He shook his fingers. "This idea is dangerous because you are not a great person. If you have made such a stupid move without resisting the risk, then naturally you have to taste the consequences of impulsiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that you Is it a student at the Royal Academy? This is good. I will call your school director to come back to you personally. This is the lesson I have given you!" After learning that these young people are students, Madur thought Well, the countermeasures, with the fear of being expelled from the end, find someone to stand up and sin for everyone. In this case, although I don’t know why Freya, who is going to the Royal College, can only sign a brokerage contract, only Then these students will have A way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished this sentence, the students trembled, fearing what the result came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when they thought they were completely finished, Madur looked very surprised and shouted out, "Hey, is that Ms. Freina?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freena, standing behind the crowd, nodded and walked out. "It's me, Mr. Madur."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madulhaha laughed: "I didn't expect to be able to foresee Ms. Freina here, you and they are classmates?", Freena nodded and admitted, and Madur’s face suddenly showed a distressed expression. "I always like you very much in Irian. The performance in the holiday, but unfortunately you didn't seem to pick up a new job?", after getting the confirmation of Freina again, Madur sighed. "Since you and they are..., then, I give A compromise approach. I hope they can accept a deeper lesson, and you are obviously not suitable here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like It was the time when the prisoner had been placed on the first platform, and whenever he could be sent back to the embrace of God by the sickle, he suddenly saw the excitement from the emperor. They looked at Madur and hoped that the big man could let them go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a fan of yours, I also have a dream that belongs to fans, that is, invite you to make a movie. I will give you two choices, sign in Our company, ten movies, or six years. As long as you nod, I have not only done it today, but also give you some compensation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, this small strategy is very simple, but it is enough to deal with these students and this situation. In the case of absolute initiative, these people have no room for rebellion, and this method actually has another layer of intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After signing Freena, she can bid farewell to the college. She will not be the savior in the eyes of these young people, but because she has resisted all Responsibility makes these young people feel that they have betrayed their friends, resulting in a hateful mentality. He knows the ideas of these young people very much. When they see Freena, they feel that they have lost their faces and no face. The presence of Freina will make them feel uncomfortable. At that time, they will try their best to make Fu. Lena can't read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as one person has this kind of thinking, it will soon become a collective commonality, and when Freina will play a movie for him. His coveted plan finally has a stage for implementation. Now the company has signed many different kinds of clients, including directors, screenwriters, and actors. After a group of actors trained by many production companies matured, the actor union soon They have been severely suppressed. They can only switch careers without signing a brokerage company. This is the price they have faced against paper companies in previous years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
