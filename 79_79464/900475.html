			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dinglinglangdang, a delicate token fell on the table and then stopped on the table after a few turns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a token that has not been circulated outside, with a denomination of 100,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin called it the Otis currency, as the name suggests, this thing has the same value as the currency in the city of Otis, and the purpose of doing this is to constrain the Audi Those investors in the city and the capitalists who gradually settled in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of capital is endless, as long as there is still profit, even if it is a meager profit, there will be capitalists who want to plunder these profits and fight for you. When Doolin is here, he may be able to suppress these investors and the current capitalists, but as the city continues to improve, it will become a huge golden cave. After the empire's massive money flows into this area, those capital predators I will also stare at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power they possess is not comparable to those of ordinary capitalists. They can influence the position of politicians to a certain extent, distorting the content of policies, even for huge benefits. They do not hesitate to reveal the long-lost minions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will become the destroyers of the rules, as Doolin did before, undermining the rules of the game that the managers worked so hard to build, so Doolin needs the same Something can constrain the forces that can't cause harm to him, while at the same time resisting the capital forces that can hurt him to enter the city of Otis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Token is the best option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current token system is only in trial operation. When the city's various supporting facilities are more perfect, Du Lin will launch more content. When there are foreigners coming to the city of Otis, when they get off at the station, they can choose to exchange tokens as popular in the city of Otis by spending here. Du Lin even intends to force some capital forces in the city to only allow the use of tokens for commercial settlement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then wait until the settlement date to use the tokens to settle in the City Hall, and get the equivalent star from the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the neck of the settlement, once someone wants to turn their face and wants to challenge Dulin’s rules, then first he will lose all the income of a settlement cycle – There are still some other details of the problem, such as private transactions. When he thinks it is appropriate, he will completely introduce the token system, and now it is only trial operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supporting token system Du Lin will also issue some new trial laws, such as the rejection of “sole proprietorship” in the city of Otis. When a company exceeds one million in size, it must be included in the “joint venture” field. Less than 35 percent of the equity is financed in the market, avoiding the formation of “purified” capital. Once these companies have multiple shareholders, when they face huge losses, not all shareholders are willing to go black with the founders, which gives Doolin a chance to dismember them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, this is a rather complicated process. For this reason, Doolin also asked Edward to consult some economically prestigious experts and professors, although in the end these people received Doolin’s consulting fee did not give much valuable advice, but Doolin still benefited a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once his ideas can be implemented and there are no major loopholes, this will become an important means of clamping the rapid expansion of capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the issue of token issuance, Du Lin has already registered a company, the token will be issued by this company, and the guarantee is not false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a family-owned company planning to come in during this time. Their appetite is also great. I hope to get a full-service casino license. They offer one thousand. Five million, and promised to continue to invest.", Natalie combed her hair while watching the 100,000 tokens on the table. She knows that Doolin is not very interested in the topic of love and love, so she always finds some work things to say at the time that these things can make Du Lin interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Family?", Du Lin snorted, the word family may be very lethal to city managers in many places, but for him That's the same thing. Now he represents a city, an accredited mayor, who has enough enthusiasm to "figh" these families. Those who fight against the final winner will never be those families unless they want to destroy the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire can kill a Prince Komoz, naturally killing the second and third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lazily supported a lazy waist, wrapped in a bath towel into the bathroom, the sound of rustling water could not cover his voice, "don't care They, if they contact you privately, let them come to me, I will give them a lesson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Natalie’s disdainful gaze Lin's reason, because he will resist his shoulders at any time, regardless of anything. This made her very enjoy the sense of security that could not be described in words. She is a woman who lacks security. She is almost thirty, and she can still be crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, after Natalie prepared breakfast for Du Lin, she went to the city hall first. Du Lin went out after reading a newspaper and went out slowly. When he left, he felt someone was watching himself. He followed the feeling and saw a man standing on the corner of the street, looking at himself with a look that was full of...like a sly look. He was a bit confused and it was not clear what happened. The man did not make a dangerous move. Du Lin quickly ignored him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he hadn’t done anything in the office, the phone bell on his desk rang and there weren’t too many people calling so early. Changes in status and status have also caused some changes in the people Du Lin knows, at least they will not harass Doolin during non-working hours, even if there is something to say, it will also be during working hours. When he picked up the phone, the sound in the receiver was very familiar. Who is not Kira? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just call me when I took office, is it troublesome?" Du Lin ridiculed that Keene’s combat power is not in doubt, whether it is a hand-to-hand combat. Still using firearms, Du Lin has not found one that can match him so far, but he is not enough in other things. For example, the world of humanity, the world here and the world in Ziwei Town are completely different, with an insurmountable gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no intrigue in Zizhen Town. Apart from discussing where the boundary stone is and playing it, everyone is very simple and very enthusiastic. In that place, you can pick up the dishes from this house, and then go to the house to get some food, everyone will not say you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But outside, there must be communication, appeal, negotiation, and compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin thinks he may be unfair to others, but he guessed it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They found someone tracking you, then grabbed the guy, would you like to check it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Track me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin immediately remembered the guy in the morning, and he responded and immediately stood up and left the office. This is definitely a small matter. Du Lin’s security issue has already been put on the agenda. More and more people with various purposes come to the city. There are always people who can’t satisfy them. Then there is disagreement. The simplest means of resolving differences is conflict, so he will now have some people hiding in the dark to protect his safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just out of the office, I met Natalie who had a cup of coffee for him. "You want to go out?" Natalie had some accidents. Du Lin had no schedule this morning. Most of these days, he would be in the office. Write something and rarely go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin took a sip of coffee and nodded and said, "I am going out to handle something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need me to go?", Natalie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin refused her good intention to leave alone. After all, some things are not convenient for the "outsiders" to see and know. For him, Natalie is still an outsider. , does not yet have the qualification to enter his core circle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came to the security company’s warehouse in the construction site and saw the guy in the mouth of Kinna who followed him, he found that this person was the one in the morning. Look at his people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is lying on the ground, and Kea has not interrogated him. Sometimes he will be too careful. This will not be what Du Lin will say. He will understand after a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I follow me?", Kina brought a chair for Doolin, and he took a cigarette. "Who sent you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looks like he is in his early thirties, his hair is a little greasy, his neckline is a bit dirty, and he looks a bit lonely. The scorpion on his chin is already half a centimeter long and it seems that he has not taken care of it for several days. However, this guy is still a little handsome, especially his eyebrows and nose, giving a very positive temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just looked up and looked at Du Lin with a blank eye, and turned his head to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our friends are not very cooperative!", Du Lin took out a lighter and lit a cigarette. After taking a sip, he caught it and he waved his hand. "Let him experience our enthusiasm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that Kea would use something or slap that person, didn't expect this guy to walk behind the person , grab his wrist directly, then pick a finger and force it. After a squeaky scream, the man suddenly screamed loudly, and Kira paused for about a dozen seconds. When the guy’s screams were a little weaker, he cut off the guy. Root finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
