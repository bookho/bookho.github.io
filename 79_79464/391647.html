			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grav?", Mr. Klein’s busy sweat, a wagon and a wagon of goods waiting to be carried, but the main force of the porter, one person Graf, who was able to top five people, was once again successfully missing, leaving Mr. Graf annoyed. Railways and steam locomotives are not the public property of the empire, but the consortiums are built according to their own needs. In other words, the station is a company, and Mr. Krien is the owner of this company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All capitalists are not good people, and this history has proved its correctness. The capitalist’s friendliness to workers is nothing but a performance. Their purpose is to hope that workers can withstand more exploitation. In the eyes of these capitalists, every worker has an accurate number to indicate their role in the production of physical strength and the value that can be exploited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graf is not a good worker, but he is a good target of exploitation, so even though he has a lot of minor problems, Mr. Klien will not be too Too embarrassing him. The value he creates is far more than the troubles and losses caused by his problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all has a premise that Graf needs to be exploited by him. If it can't be built under such a precondition, Graf has no value at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would anyone see where the guy went?" Mr. Klein ripped open his neck and snarled, and the last station had informed him, in a After a few hours, there will be a steam locomotive coming here for transshipment, and a lot of things need to be unloaded and loaded. The work of high physical strength has already caused several workers to get tired, and with Graff absent, the efficiency is less than 10%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roared and looked around at the station, but unfortunately he could not find Graf. So in the search for no fruit, Mr. Klien shouted in the face of many people, to punish Graf according to the content of the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is a deduction, and there may be a fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time-sensitive work is often more rigorous in terms of the content of the contract, in order to restrain the workers and not let them be lazy or absent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, Graf has violated the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But does Graf mind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to being a cow at the station, it is clear that privately selling high-fruit wines can make more money, faster, and make more money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't do it alone, we need a mature team to help us do these things." Du Lin is teaching his thoughts to Graf, he Speaking with a strong heart: "After all, our business is not legal, we need to disguise, we need to protect our ability to retreat when exposed, and the ability to cope with risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During these two days, Du Lin was thinking about how to make this career bigger and stronger almost every moment. After the failure of entrepreneurship, he became more careful and understood all the readings he experienced in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who wants to develop, wants to succeed, and relies on himself alone is absolutely impossible to succeed. At any time, in any society, the competitiveness is huge. In this environment, only by gathering more vested interests can you protect your core interests. It’s like washing a car. If there were people like Graf around him, and there were three or five, would the guy named Mad Dog Weisen dare to pack him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't dare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of such a thing that has a personal interest in it, Du Lin has a clearer direction for the future development direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My registered trading company can import some low-alcohol wines as a cover, while low-alcohol is also very popular, if we can find a way to purify low-alcohol This is also a huge source of money. At the same time, we also need people, about ten to twenty people, to have the motivation and courage to pursue their dreams. Maybe we will have to face some people's challenges soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graff immediately after listening to the chest, that is more than a woman to play chest muscles one by one, "Who? Who is going to do it for us?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin has a brainache, who is it? Of course, those high-ranking wine dealers and wineries whose interests have been destroyed are like a bucket of water filled with water. If you throw an iron ball into it, there will be some water overflowing. The high-alcohol wine that never appeared before opened the market and won the favor of those who loved drinking, and let them give up their previous choices. This is tantamount to robbing their share of others from their hands. This is not a legitimate business. After having this idea, Du Lin has already realized that this is a partial business and a business that cannot be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cruel market competitions like the business that can't be seen. Ordinary business can be used to complete the market rules of the inferior market through commercial means, then how can these unsuccessful businesses complete the market competition and compete for the winners? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s nothing more than force, and there are all kinds of disgracefulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you have married someone else’s job, don’t think that others are pleasing to you, and you still have to rely on your fist to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After explaining for a long time, Graf slammed his head and issued a pia, a look of disgust. "Do you directly say that you want to build a gang?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a gang? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin was silent. When he left the country, Mr. Xerma hoped that he would become a useful person to society. His mother hoped he could become a Successful people, his brothers and sisters hope that he can become an example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one wants him to be a gang and a gang leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did it start, his great dream of making a fortune was distorted as a gang that violated his original wish? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin glanced at Graf, considering the physical gap between the two sides, may be God's will? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not speak, Graf was excited, he even laughed, "I have long wanted to build a gang belonging to the Guar. We are all heroic warriors..." When it comes to this, Graf looks at his eyes with Du Lin, and also looks at Du Lin. "Of course there are some..., huh! Once we The gang is set up, and those damn Oging people will not dare to bully us. This is a good idea, I support you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Yaoxing Empire In a minority race, the living environment of the Guarts is not so good. In the war, the authorities used a large number of ethnic groups to expropriate the Guar people in the war, and caused a large number of deaths and injuries in the young and middle-aged people of the Guarte group. In the absence of sufficient youth, the Guars have also become vulnerable races, often being bullied by Ogildinians. In the city of Tener, the vast majority of gangs are made up of Ogildinians, such as the mad dog Weissen, who is a typical Ogdin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
