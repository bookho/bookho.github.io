			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mike is obviously not the person with the protagonist's fate. Under the temptation of death and the temptation of money, he has chosen a path that can live alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that the little person is very sad, and the fact is true. In front of the big man, the little person is a sad "species", but can't ignore another thing. . That is the small people, although sad, but they still have the opportunity to choose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opportunity is more valuable than the majesty of the big man at some point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that all the people who can choose are small people. The big men never choose, not because they have grown up and refused to make multiple choice questions, but they simply There is no power to make choices, let alone opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small people, big men, who is more suitable for this society, who is more suitable for long-term survival in society is really not a very clear thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mike is like a person who is very skilled in his work and passionate about his career, as Dulin said, writing several pieces of information on the document and then Take out the official seal and sign it again. The license will be completed in less than five minutes. With this license, Du Lin can be a large-scale mining project, not to say that without the license, mining can not be done, but there are many things you can do in violation of the rules, but also be prepared to bear the corresponding results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small person secret mining was discovered by the state government, and may be a penalty at most, and then reprimanded it even if it ended. But if the big man secretly mined and found it, it would be like dropping a drop of blood in the sea, and all the sharks dozens of kilometers away began to swim rapidly towards this place. Many of the magnificent buildings we have seen are often cracked from a negligible place and then collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not give anyone the opportunity to find their own troubles from the rules. This is Du Lin’s attitude. Because the more straightforward, simple and clear methods, the more impeccable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing business and walking the road is different! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the license, Mr. Mike also very happy to explain to Du Lin who is behind him, this person is indeed like Du Lin As expected at the beginning, it was the doorman. He was not surprised. The Mennon used the West as his own base camp. He wanted to become the governor here and then find a way to climb the throne of the highest power of the empire, so he would not allow another one to live in his own base camp. A potential opponent of the threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, if Du Lin is now in the position of the doorman, maybe he will do more extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of the return of the permit, Du Lin let people contact the snake head, at least need to buy no less than 500 slave miners, and still hire about fifty One hundred and fifty empire miners. The mix of miners is a very common practice in the western mining areas, and most mining areas are implementing this management approach. In fact, there is no such thing as a savvy place. The establishment of the class within the miners is the struggle. The miners in two different classes will hate each other. This is one of the ways to ensure the “stable” of the mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the purpose of Doolin is to let the slaves go through a psychological process, let them suffer, and then let them "find" to the future. road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Du Lin also found out from the slave miners in the Andorra mining area that ten miners working very hard and in the presence All the slaves told them that the ten people had a strong sense of responsibility because they loved their current work, so they gained freedom in advance. Not only can you leave here anytime, anywhere, but you can continue to work here, and you can move to the staff area and enjoy the same salary as the local miners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, all the slaves’ eyes have produced terrible changes. Before that, Du Lin also made a lot of guarantees for them, some of which have been fulfilled. It is. For example, improving diet and living conditions, and issuing a salary slightly lower than that of local miners, are fulfilled. But these slaves did not perform too positively, and only a very small number of people performed differently from others. The slaves who came here for a longer time became indifferent after the initial excitement, because they thought it might be a lie of Duolin's weaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how much salary they have saved during their work here, how about what Du Lin promised three years later is still very far behind. If they were killed before they were free, even after they were freed, they were killed? Did everything they owned returned to Du Lin’s hands? What is the meaning of that Doolin's promise? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the people who are selected are all obvious to them. They are all new slaves, so they are more eager to regain their freedom. Excessive deception and injury become numb, and they give everyone a lesson in life – people should keep moving forward with their dreams and hopes for the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten young people were also very excited. They were free, and they received one hundred of the rewards from Doolin. They can leave the mining area to nearby cities anytime and anywhere, or even leave the empire to return to their hometown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not deceive them. When the open door was close at hand, no one could stabilize the fluctuations of their inner undulations, one by one. Tilting, it seems to be slow with the trembling legs, but almost all of them run out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of their free running outside the gate reflected in the blind and muddy eyes of the slaves in the slave area, their eyes became clear and thorough. Some people are excited to cry out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no mine protection teams with guns outside the gates. They don’t have the traps they imagined. They saw those people running far and wide until they could not see At the time, the mood was a little more peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is over here, then it’s obviously too small to see Doolin, the next day, the third day, the fourth day, on the fourth day At the time, ten people are back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They changed their clothes, and the spirits looked completely different from before they left. At least they didn’t seem to have been persecuted. Everyone’s face was There is an inexplicable confidence and expectation. Yes, these ten people are back, and many of them started thinking about leaving the terrible country and leaving this western like hell. But when they took out their money to buy a ticket to go to the West Coast, they couldn't help but froze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, all the animals that love face, this is the same in the world, or the other world is the unspeakable truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it meaningful to go back with a physical wound and inner heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can they be deceived into the empire to be sold as a slave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not hoping to change myself and change the situation of my family through my own hands? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were indeed deceived once, but they were lucky enough to meet Du Lin, not being deceived for the second time, they began to hesitate, began to hesitate and began to think . If Du Lin promises that it can be fulfilled, then they are now working as free people. Isn't it possible to get the same salary as a local miner and enjoy the same treatment? Then why should we leave, return to the backward hometown, or even the hometown of the war? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not stay here? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not here, to find the future that they have longed for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they came back, it seems that this is only a trivial matter, but it is a big deal for the slaves in the mining area. Many slaves looked at them through the high walls twisted by barbed wire and steel bars, asking if they had anyone who had encountered Du Lin outside, and were caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they talked about the outside world with their heads high, talking about the purpose of their return, all the slaves in the slave area were the real sensation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge cheers seem to have placed the entire mine camp in a grand festival celebration, and these slaves vent their fears that are suppressed in their hearts. There was also a smile on their faces, and their eyes were full of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes, as long as you work hard to mine, you will not only be able to obtain long-lost freedom, but also be treated equally, and you can return with a decent amount of money. At home, accept the baptism of the eyes of my family's envious neighbors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your method is terrible!" Dove stood next to Doolin and looked at the boiling slave area, the slaves hysterically shook the barbed wire and On the high wall, Du Lin did not stop them except to stare at them not to make more excessive moves. They need something to stimulate their numb nerves and give them more motivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin shrugged his shoulders. These are small things. "Let the ten people come up, I still have things to do. These people stay in It’s a waste of digging stones here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice turned and left, and soon took ten young people who had been renewed to the mining office. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These young people respected Du Lin very much, and they all bent down and honored "Lord Du Lin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very good that you can come back. Let me see something different from your personality, morality and soul. It is also destined to be with you. Most people are different." Du Lin stood up with a smile, and he pushed open the window and stood by the window and turned to look at these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
