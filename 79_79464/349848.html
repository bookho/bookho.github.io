			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tnel City is located in the southern part of the empire, and compared to the magnificent scenery on the southeast coast, the city of Tener is somewhat less prosperous. But for people living in the city of Tener, it is a paradise here compared to other countryside full of earthy smells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the streets with a curious look, even though he had seen a more prosperous city in this dream, but it was just a dream, now It is real. He licked his backpack with a patch on his shoulder, excitedly looking around the street, and also calculating, what should he do now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning culture is inevitable. He does not know a word on the street, which will limit his future development. Secondly, he needs to find a job that can support himself for a short period of time, does not require much salary, has no new water, as long as he can have a simple residence, and two meals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the streets of this strange city, there is a hint of fear in the heart, and more is the yearning for the future. He feels that the sky of the city is more than the country. More blue, even the air is comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..., the kid over there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin looked at the sound One is a bit funny to him, but next to the car that is the latest in the world, a man with a dome felt hat hooked his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir, is there anything?" Du Lin immediately walked over, he was not very clear that the decent person who looked very rich He has something to do with him, but he is not very concerned about such a call for being fresh about setting up anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked up and down Du Lin, slightly biased. There are a few boxes in the back of the car, which should look heavy. "Help me move them to Room 411 on the fourth floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doolin, But soon his face was full of smiles. He carried his backpack back and walked to the side of the box and moved hard. The box was heavy, and the bracket was covered with wooden strips outside the box, and some liquid seemed to be shaking during the lifting process. The man seemed to be surprised. He pointed to a small building with five floors on the side of the road, indicating that he would hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin moved to the fourth floor with a heavy box. He was already one of the main laborers in the country when he was in the country. Heavy manual labor. Although these things are heavy, they have not been put in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went upstairs and found 411 according to the number learned from the coin. It should be this room. He kicked the door twice with his feet. After a while, the door opened a slit. A gloomy person looked at him behind the door and his eyes were a bit gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a gentleman downstairs asking me to bring these boxes up." Du Lin explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened slightly larger, the guy looked out and looked around, the long corridor was quiet, and no one could see anyone. The man opened the door at this time. Du Lin noticed a detail. The guy opened the door and his right hand was behind him and pulled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the three boxes held in Du Lin’s arms, and his face had some surprised expressions, “You are not too small!”, said to let go of the position Let Du Lin go in, "Put it behind the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he put the things down according to his instructions, the guy rudely pushed Doolin into the room, and Peng slammed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the closed wooden door, Du Lin squatted for a while, then shrugged and went downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman downstairs did not leave. He did not say anything after seeing Du Lin. He took out a dollar bill from the pocket and stuffed him into him. Hands. Not waiting for Du Lin to thank, the guy left the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the car that disappeared at the end of the street, Du Lin blew a whistle. It seems that making money in the city is not as difficult as it might be. Hey, this is only an hour, and I earned a dollar, and the average person’s income for three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are always filled with some kind of proud feelings for the first time of anything, even if it is a stupid thing. While thinking about the first time in my life that I earned a piece of my own labor, I was looking for a place to live next on the roadside. In fact, what he hopes most is to find a place where custom leather utensils can be found. The cobbler profession will never be hungry. This sentence is heard from a drunkard who bought wolf skin from Noji Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wolf skin worth a lot of money - There are always two or three coyotes outside the wilderness town. These coyotes are mostly livestock in the town. The animals attracted by the animals have become the most hated thing for the country. The people in the town will kill these coyotes with traps, then peel them off completely and sell them to leather traders who come once a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mouth of the leather trader, these can only sell very expensive wolf skin, carefully crafted by the cobblers, able to sell more than a dozen pieces or even Tens of dollars in price! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin feels that if you want to change the level of your life as soon as possible, becoming a cobbler apprentice is obviously the most direct and fastest way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he does not know that other industries are just as good as they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city, he almost stunned his head. He has never seen such a big city, so many people, so many The road and so many houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are cars on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no such thing as a good thing before, as for the cobbler... I didn’t find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the water taken from the roadside pump and the whole wheat bread as hard as a stone, Doolin completed the first step in his life. Stay overnight in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, for the first time, he also felt something called loneliness. In a bridge hole, he curled up his body and gradually fell asleep in the whistling wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole city of Turner was transferred over the past few days and found three leather goods stores, but the owner did not plan to recruit people. Doolin put his hopes on other jobs, such as tailoring, carpenters, or anything else that looks decent. I don't know if he is bad luck or for other reasons, and no one is willing to recruit him. This also made him understand that there is always a gap between ideals and reality that cannot be crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two weeks, he finally found a way to make money from countless failures - car wash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
