			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone, in the face of the option of death, will struggle, this has nothing to do with humanity and faith, purely human fear of death has broken the upper limit Whether or not you voluntarily accept the fact that death is about to come, there will be fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a death notice, Mr. Roel’s courage, which was not so much, suddenly disappeared. The other party told him the truth, even if he was tortured here. He was accidentally killed, and the Security Council has the strength to suppress this matter. If you pick it up, you will not assume any responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he died long ago, he was killed a few days ago, maybe he is still frozen in the ice bank of a certain area. The body. This made him feel like he was ridiculous. He was still alive, but he might have died. This made him have no choice. He must prove to the Security Council and the world that he is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to know?", he sighed heavily and gave up the resistance completely, no matter what the other person asked, he would answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain was very satisfied with Mr. Roel’s cooperation. He placed the notice of death on the table, sat opposite Mr. Roel and picked up A notebook began to record the next testimony, "Mr. Roel, your mine has collapsed. According to the news we got and reasonable speculation, we think this is a man-made accident, is it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roel nodded. "Yes, I arranged this mine disaster. The purpose is to solve my financial difficulties. I spent a lot of money before." I bought the right to operate this mine, but I encountered commercial fraud. The output and stock of this mine is far lower than the figures shown in the exploration report. I am facing huge financial pressure, so I have to solve this trouble. Just as Mr. Mennon’s three-guarantee policy made me discover an opportunity, I created this mine disaster with the help of the mine protection team.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper writing After reading it, I gave it to Mr. Roel. After Mr. Roel sure no mistake, he is not only similar to this transcript true and correct words handwritten in the margin side, and also the names, according to the time, place and keywords on the fingerprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cooperation made the captain’s tone a lot better, and the upper continuation asked, “The body that was found in the mine during the subsequent rescue process. Is it the body of a local or the body of an illegal smuggler?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the body of the slaves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time Mr. Roel confessed to the crimes he committed, until the captain proposed a new The problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a sudden attack when you launched a miner’s family parade, and you were hit with a shot. Who do you think is this? Attack? What should his purpose be?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Roel’s pupil narrowed slightly, and he looked down at his shoelaces and whispered "I don't know, and I also want to know who attacked me and those innocent people. I am sorry about this issue because I can't give you any accurate answers."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can admit anything, but he will not admit that the attack was done by himself, because he knows very well how many slaves he killed in the mine accident... The official saying is illegal illegal immigrants. Or how much money he cheated from the Mennon, these crimes will not let him suffer serious consequences. The former died of "illegal smugglers". The existence of these people is unreasonable and illegal. Their death can only be said that they are unlucky, and the empire will help him cover up the facts at home and abroad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international public opinion now begins to focus on the empire. The slaves who were "killed" this time came from more than a dozen countries. Everyone wants to know what happened here. Why the Imperial Army would go to slaughter unarmed slaves, and even use it as a merit to brag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, if you can reduce a little negative impact, then it is definitely the best choice, and the Freedom Front is annihilated. Before the nature is determined, no one can guarantee What will happen to this last thing? But if at this time it continues to explode someone to obtain wealth by killing innocent slaves, it is easy to reminiscent of the fact that the Freedom Front has been annihilated. Since the people of the empire can exchange the life of slaves for wealth, why can't they use these people's deaths in exchange for military exploits? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the latter, Mr. Roel recently read the newspaper, and he believes that the troubles of the doorman appearing on himself are more important than the two million in his hand. Much more, and the money was not cheated from the city hall or the state government. Even if Mr. Mennon sue him, he can only come out after three or five years of prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Roel knows very well that even if he kills more slaves, it’s not a problem, at least for the time being, he doesn’t kill any slaves, he’s dead. They are all Imperial miners, and this thing has no relationship with those slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the attack was different. The attack caused the death and injury of many imperial citizens. If this incident finally falls on his head, even if he does not need to be hanged, he will slowly go to prison. Waiting for the time to come to the stranger to give him the last knife. He didn't want to make his remaining life worthless and meaningless, so he chose the one that was most beneficial to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain picked up another file bag from the desktop and opened it. There were two photos in it. He picked it up and showed it to Mr. Roel. I put it back and properly collected it. "We have photographed you and the gunman who fired at you before the attack. How do you explain this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Honoring that the photo taken by the captain just now, Roel didn’t see it too clearly, but the captain’s words made him start sweating. As the Mennon speculated, the initiator of this attack was his biggest victim. When the first farmer told him that he had to wait until the investigation team had figured out all the details of the mine disaster before considering the payment of insurance money. At first, Mr. Roel did not intend to be too radical, but the problem was in the investigation of too detailed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enormous pressure caused by the collapse of the mine has made almost the vast majority of the victims unrecognizable, but there are always some things in the world that are not so good. There is a guy whose body is relatively intact and the face is not so easy to identify, but there is a problem here - the miner corresponding to the sign hanging on the neck of the guy should be a dwarf, but now the body is a High, one after the other, the difference is about 20 cm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t pay attention to this thing in peacetime, a dead person, at this time the dead person involved more than two million in compensation, investigation The group of people think this will be a breakthrough. If it can be proved that a miner’s body has been falsified, it can prove that the bodies of other miners are also likely to be fraudulent. Once the compensation is delayed, after the mine is cleaned up, people can find that there is nothing in the mine that can be found to be valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under compensation, Mr. Roel will go bankrupt and lose everything he has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, he decided to take risks and buy the miners’ families and nearby neighbors who were found to have problems. On the other hand, he bought a doorman’s side. The secretary who did not receive much attention, and then let his own mine protection team staged an attacking drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
