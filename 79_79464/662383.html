			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is my pleasure!", when Du Lin needed the most help and was still thinking about how to deepen contact with the union, a 3,000 The check of the block solved all his troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money is really omnipotent, anytime, any occasion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olavin is very happy, this is good news for him, for the trade union of Tenell. Relying on the membership is very reluctant to support the operation of the union, often a litigation will use one-sixth or even a quarter of the annual membership fee. Therefore, from the Workers’ Union of the Capital to the local workers’ union branch, they are trying their best to get more benefits. They are indeed protecting the interests of workers while also creating their own values ​​and benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there is no shortage of smart people in this world. Some people have proposed a plan to increase the income of the unions more than ten years ago. After several twists and turns. Got it. For the first time in this program, the workers' union not only needs to safeguard the interests and legitimate rights and interests of the workers, but also proposes that the workers' unions also need to provide a certain degree of service to the "capitalists" when necessary. The content of its essence is not complicated. For any businessman, "skilled workers" will always be the workers they most desire, because skilled workers can create more profits in a shorter time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers’ union has a wealth of information and resources in this regard. As long as the capitalists pay some service remuneration and fill in some information, the workers’ union will assign skilled workers to join New work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program was not approved at the time of the first discussion. Some people think that this is the benefit of the working class, but it is discussed in the second and third discussions. After that, it passed. This program has indeed solved the embarrassing situation of low union income, and deepened the substantive work of the workers' union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this solution solves the problem of the labor union’s funds, no one will think that money is a bad thing. When Doolin took out the check, Olevan had already made such a decision. Since Du Lin might have used the workers' union, why not just pull him in directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What day-to-day meeting is a shit, this is his temporary compilation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real purpose of this conversation with Doolin is to bring the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin became the main supporting role of this charity dinner, so the statement is not difficult to understand, because there will be no news of Doolin in the newspaper tomorrow. Some of them are just kindly donated by the members of the parliament and the mayor. They will not mention Du Lin at all. All he is only a supporting role, a major supporting role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to come up with so much money to please the authorities, why not be able to donate a small amount of money to donate the union? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olevan came here with such an idea and successfully completed his purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking for a little while, the bishop of the city of Tener came over wearing awesome clothing. The black robe and the white rim of the silver side make the bishop who is already in his 40s look younger. Olevan nodded and turned away, leaving enough space for the bishop and Doolin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is the practice of charity evenings. Once a special "generous" bidder appears, the heads of these groups will be at the subsequent dinner. Church clergy will take turns to fight the autumn wind. But to be sure that nothing can be obtained, but if you come over, you might be able to get some benefits, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your support of the charity of the city of Tener!", the bishop is not fast, the voice is very mellow, and the words are listened to. All felt pleasing to the ear, he smiled and pressed his hand on the back of Doolin's hand. "May God's eyes look at you forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin is also very god The stick returned a sentence, "God bless the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop’s eyes suddenly rounded up, and he looked at Doolin for three or five seconds before using it slightly. Gao Yang’s tone asked: “Are you also a God’s people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin pulled a check from his pocket and stuffed it into the hands of the bishop. "No, but I hope it is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money that was recently earned was saved in the bank, and all other money was spent this evening. . A total of more than 20,000, have become the contents of others' pockets. This kind of squandering of money is not enough to make Du Lin feel distressed, but also feels a bit of a pain. The money is gone, but they are worth more than they are the value of money, and the things that the money brings will become a defense system, and Dulin will be firmly protected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the Tyllell Theatre, Doolin's gang had some pain, laughing for a whole night to make his face stiff. He patted his cheek, spit a sigh of relief, walked out of the main entrance of the Grand Theatre, and walked to his car. Just as he stood by the door and pulled out the key to open the door, faintly reflected through the window glass, he saw a group of people appear behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was four months ago, he might look back and see who is standing behind him and ask them what to look for. After experiencing the lessons of fighting and death, Du Lin has already possessed certain social qualities. He did not turn around, nor did he turn back. He ran straight. In fact, there is a pistol in the storage compartment of the car, just because the charity dinner at night is relatively high, and someone has done a special security check, so he did not bring it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has time to open the door and then get in, then take out the pistol and push the insurance and then calmly shoot. But he didn't dare to gamble. He didn't dare to gamble that he was really able to complete all the steps so smoothly, so he decided to leave first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a night of mad dog Wissen almost didn’t smack the whistle-blower until he saw the goal of the mission in the bored Du Lin, all the talents "wake up". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four months ago, Wissen was broken by Du Lin. Is it not normal to say that the nose is broken? More serious consequences, the broken nose is like the toilet is drained and found only half a sheet of paper, this situation may be worse, but it is better than half a sheet of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as a result, Wissen was laughed at by other companions and other gangsters for a while, and Wissen always said when and for what reason. One person defeated dozens of hundreds of enemies. At the beginning, everyone really believed, but the more outrageous it was, the more it turned from believing to questioning. This time is even more outrageous. Four people were broken by a little guy and the guy ran away. Wissen, who often brags, became the protagonist in the joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what someone asked him this morning and asked him that another person defeated tens of thousands of people last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culprit of all this is the kid, so when the car washer told him to see the kid, he led the gang to neutralize himself for the first time. A nice person came over to surround Du Lin. He gnashed his teeth and waved his stick in his hand, ignoring the fact that Dooling came out of the Grand Theatre, when he had only revenge in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin, who was rushing in front of him, wanted to thank Mr. Xerma at this time, because he was often assigned heavy labor to give him a good body, at least not to worry about being caught up by the people behind him in a short time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city during the day is full of the rule of law, but under the cover of night, it is a paradise for crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along the way, Du Lin also encountered two patrols, but from the other side's dodging gaze and the body shape of the retreat, Du Lin knew that there was no rescue. meaningful. As he ran, he took off his expensive windbreaker, took off his expensive suit, ripped the button on his shirt, and even took off the expensive shoes. The mad dog Wissen group is catching up more and more slowly, and Doolin maintains the initial speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not urgent to have a bad breath, maybe the mad dog Wissen has stopped, but now he is still chasing until the corner of a street . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning around the corner of the street, the whistling sound of a shrill sound as the broken bellows was pulled from the mouth of Weissen’s mouth, he held the wall and looked at the empty hole The street is full of blue veins. After chasing for so long, he was chased again, which made him angry. Randomly waving the sticks and shattering the glass in the roadside security window, just as he turned around, Du Lin appeared again in his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... dare to come out?", Mad Dog Wissen took a deep breath and took a breath, suppressing the constantly undulating chest and waving the stick to Doolin. He shouted: "Slaughter him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that it is very imposing to shout it out, and a dozen of his friends have gone so far and are hot. The heart was bored and moved, and immediately waved the weapon in his hand and rushed to Doolin. Soon they found out that there were two people beside Du Lin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mad dog Weisen walked forward while holding the wall, looking pale, panting and saying: "Don’t think that two people can be like, I have to say You have harmed your friends!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides those who are left behind, there are almost 13 or four fierce gang members here, to defeat the three young people. It’s not a problem. The kind of thing that happened to be an enemy has only happened to him, and in the legend, he firmly believes that even if there are more than a few people in the other side, they are all looking for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stood there without any movement, facing a gang of rushing gangs, he showed a scornful smile. The more he laughs, the stronger his inner anger is. The Graf who has left this should be most touched. He raised his chin slightly and looked at Wissen behind him. "Leave that, and everything else is done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
