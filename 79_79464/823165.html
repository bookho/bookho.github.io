			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does anyone have any objections?" Du Lin walked between Sofia and Batu and looked at everyone, and he nodded for a moment. "Good, gentlemen, ladies, it seems that we have reached an agreement at this point, which makes me very happy, at least my contribution is worth it." When he looks at Jose, Jose will A pure white white hand was handed to him, and he shook the white, revealing a silver sword that reflected the sun and was particularly dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the gorgeous dagger in his left hand, the sword in his right hand, and then pulled the little sword out of his hand. Blood dripped down the gap in his fist, and Jose pushed a car full of white chalk to wait for Doolin's side. Du Lin handed Xiaojian to Sofia, and Sophia smiled and stood up. Whenever and wherever, her smile is always as peaceful as a spring breeze, not as vicious as the black widows in the population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also cut her right hand palm, clasped with Doolin’s hand, and kissed Doolin’s forehead and back. Jose handed a white donkey to Sofia. She wrapped her right hand palm twice and re-sit back into her seat. The little sword continued to pass on, and people continued to walk to exercise the ancient tradition, blessing Doolin, and respecting him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Xiaojian turned into the hands of Batu, he smiled boldly. "Mr. Doolin, you are a convincing person. I have never questioned this point. What you said is very reasonable. Every nation must have its own beliefs and have its own sustenance. We didn’t have it before, but now, if there is anything I need to do, tell me "When he opened his palm, the blood in his mouth was spurting out. He didn't care to hold Duolin's hand tightly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From today, from this moment, Du Lin is their leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very smooth meeting, at least Du Lin thinks so. He made the rules, not to restrain anyone, but even less. Who, he hopes that he is not just a private wine dealer, a tycoon in the eyes of the people, there are many things he needs and must do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staggered this day, the agents who came to the meeting all left, even Buddy’s somewhat awkward son, looking at Du Lin’s eyes was full Fear. He never thought that he was a timid person, but when he saw Du Lin did not hesitate to shoot a "leader" who was similar to his father, and still got respect from others, he knew that he would always chase Can't catch up with this guy who is a few years older than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when he bowed his head and faced something he couldn’t resist, bowing was not a sign of weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people were sent away, and the manor became a bit deserted again, and everything went on in an orderly manner. Locally in Irian, Doolin has established five free schools for the Guars, including the middle school, and he also opened three cheap hospitals in the fifth district, and of course for the Guarts. To this end, the mayor also took the initiative to cut the ribbon for the largest hospital and commended Doolin for his efforts in the construction of the Irian area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that when a person’s importance to a certain area exceeds a certain limit, some minor problems, even larger ones, are already Not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the mid-term elections are close at hand, in order to ensure local stability, the City Hall will not make any excessive moves, let alone Du Lin to Yili Is the benefit of Ann far greater than harm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulin’s goal of requiring all agents to build schools, build hospitals, and provide more convenient conditions for the tribes is also derived from this. For the whole society, the Guarts are still the bottom people, and any contribution to the bottom of society is a very positive behavior. It is like building a completely free school in a slum, and building such a school in the rich area of ​​the Imperial City. The possible goals and consequences are the same, but the social response is quite different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now every place has to canvass for the mid-term elections. At this time, the weight of the agent will be much heavier than usual, and the politicians will also have to Many ballot agents give some policies. These policies will inevitably not cause too much influence in the short term. With the fermentation of time, many insignificant policies will form a ladder and raise the status of the Guartes slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year of the election and the mid-term election year will be a step forward, allowing the entire nation to embark on a new class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day after Doolin sent away these agents, Scott represented the mayor and wanted to talk to Du Doolin. This is a very rare opportunity. In the past, only Du Lin went to see the mayor, when did the mayor take the initiative to meet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power that is displayed after a combination of factors such as status, wealth, and prestige! A force that even the ruling class must respect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two met at the beach, and the mayor changed a common one with a hat. The average person saw that he really couldn’t guess that this person was the most powerful person of Irian. He waved his hand after seeing Doolin, and they found a bench and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you were there for the first two days!", the mayor said, he laughed, and more than thirty yachts parked in Erie. On the sea, Anli has raised a lot of face in the local area. Many tourists are talking about whether there are any rich groups to travel to Ilyan, which has promoted the positive image of the city. The more wealthy people come here, the more the superiority of the Irian area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this, but also to find a very happy topic for both sides to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin also laughed. "Just to find the agent to talk about how to start the work in the second half of the year, I did not expect to alarm you!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing to be alarmed, so many yachts are crowded together, and people will always see it." The mayor said that the topic was transferred. Elsewhere, “Du Lin, you have invested in so many projects in Irian, established schools and hospitals, and participated actively in charitable activities in the community. Have you ever thought about taking a step forward?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin scratched his eyebrows, "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s empty finger The direction of the emperor, perhaps he does not mean this, but Du Lin thinks that, "the New Party has always encouraged businessmen to drive the regional economy through the establishment of factories, etc. Many businessmen do well, and some businessmen with strong social responsibility choose Have you been interested in this aspect of politics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;The mayor said that this thing is also for a certain reason. Originally, he thought that Du Lin really wanted to cooperate with the George family, which would mean that Du Lin also had enough political influence. The mayor of the mayor in the New Party told him that if it was, then he would be friends with Doolin, and the help that Du Lin could provide when necessary was a great help for his campaign for the governor. But I didn't think that this guy wouldn't do it after a sham shot, and the mayor of the city would put this out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the first half of the year, Doolin provided a large amount of tax to Irian, so that he had a very good face between his peers, and once thoughts came to his mind again. Businessmen are politically motivated. It is not impossible in this era. In particular, the New Party has a very open-minded attitude towards businessmen in politics and is very welcome. The reason is very simple. A businessman has money and can do a lot of things that others can't do if he has money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build a region, whether it is good or not, whether there is any political achievements is not to listen to the local residents to respect the city hall, but to see how much the economic construction achievements of a place have increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing a pure politician to a backward place, maybe he can’t do anything in his life, but throw a wealthy businessman into one The place to go, maybe three to five years will be able to see results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the politicians are very loyal to the use of money to "change" status in order to gain higher party status and power. First of all, this is not a sale, but a donation of political contributions within the party. In order for the new party to gain more advantages in competition with the old party, donating such things is allowed and default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running a party is actually very expensive, especially in the election year. Millions of tens of millions of such astronomical figures can be said to be consumed silently. Therefore, the party’s top management also hopes that someone can share some for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the mayor will compete for the position of governor in the next election year, and his mentor and friends can give him some political help, but In terms of funds, he needs to raise himself. This is the basis for him and Du Lin to talk about this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He introduced Doolin to the new party, as a guide for Doolin, and of course he can get Duin’s return, which is a hidden rule similar to the “Convention”. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Du Lin intently, and Du Lin was really a bit surprised this time. He had thought that the mayor had asked him to come out and talk about it. It was for the sake of reincarnation. He wanted to pick up something from his pocket. He didn't expect to have a hat for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about electricity and analyzed the benefits and disadvantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage, of course, is that the influence will be expanded after the political situation, and it will be more dominant in a region. As long as he can manage well, it is possible to climb to the end. Close to the highest position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The downside is that his business may become a means for some people to attack him in the future. If he wants to climb to a certain height, he will separate the current business. It is an inevitable result, and this is what he is not so willing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
