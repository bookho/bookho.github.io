			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madouer made three consecutive calls, which made him very sad. These people did not care about his feelings at all, and even took the initiative to let him compromise. As for Help him out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think about it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s bad reputation is obvious to all. Especially after he killed Todd, everyone knows that this is an unruly bastard. Someone has already spoken. To resist the continued expansion of Doolin, this young man who never considers the consequences, once he has mastered too much power and strength, no one knows what he will do next. This is a huge hidden danger and threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the incident of Felica, the northern aristocrats seem to have unified this idea to some extent, but it is still a little troublesome to implement. Most of Doolin’s industry is in the south, and the power of the northern aristocracy in the south can only be said to be general. It is not powerful, because the inferior aristocrats who have always looked down on it have risen rapidly after the New Party came to power, forming what people say. The "new force". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southern aristocracy, once regarded as the inferior aristocrat of the nobility, is equally repulsive to the northern aristocracy, and is more cautious about the capital forces of the North, plus Du Lin’s In fact, the capital of the South has a good reputation. The capitalists of these new forces also think that Doolin is a cancer, but they will only laugh when they grow up on others. Moreover, Du Lin is very disciplined in the South. So far, he has not done much destructive things except for the means of occupying the private liquor market and private liquor through the means of profiteering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the Great Patriotic War and the relationship with the Confederation, the southerners’ ideas are more open, far more open than the backward North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to people with the ability to eat two steaks? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he deserves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madur did not get any help, and returned to the bar very frustrated. He thought about running away and finally dismissed the idea. He has realized that what he has done before and what Du Lin is doing to him now is no different. No, there is a difference, the difference is that he has changed from the applicator to the victim. When I think of my own efforts in the past few years, I have to be someone else's, and my heart is bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlight Agency is his ladder to pursue his dreams. For this reason, he has almost all the profits rolled into the company's development. He always believes that in the future, entertainment will be widespread and civilian. This can be seen from the layout of the entertainment industry that has fallen from the George family. They spent a lot of money to build a theater that covered the entire empire, and they are now transforming into tape entertainment. They are telling everyone that this big family that once monopolized an industry is very optimistic about the entertainment industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the economic recovery of the empire will continue to accelerate in all aspects of society, and the future of the entertainment industry is a bright future, but now he Can't grasp this future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Madur, do you have any good news to bring back?", Du Lin is chatting with Freyna, for the performance of Freena In recognition of this, perhaps this is the best solution in this case, although in essence Du Lin thinks she is too "weak". If she can be tougher, Madur may not be able to push her to the side of the coffee table to sign, and have her own backing, can put the facts in front of Madur to let him choose, not to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Du Lin sent her to study. She is now difficult to support a company, a business. In this ever-changing era, no aggressiveness and aggressiveness means that it will remain in a defensive position during the rolling of the times, so the company will not develop, and the company that has never responded negatively to external attacks can quickly Development, on the contrary, is not very reasonable, and companies that have a strong desire to attack aggression have achieved very good development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mauld shook his head and sat on the edge of the sofa, grabbed his hands into his hair, and groaned, it seemed that only pain could make him feel There is no such pain in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin stretched out a finger and pushed the contract on the coffee table to Madur’s face, raising his chin, “signed him, things tonight. It didn't happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madul looked at Du Lin, and took the pen decisively and signed his name on the contract. He didn't have nothing. He was able to create this company eight years ago, so that he has a certain network of contacts and capital, he can certainly create a miracle again. At that time, he will definitely compete with Du Lin in the mall, telling the young man by fact that he is not weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he signed, he only felt painful and stood up. Du Lin raised his hand to stop him. He pointed to the sofa again, and Madur’s defeated ass sat back. Du Lin smiled and took the two contracts together and looked at them, and then gave one of them to Madur. "Mr. Madur, you may not have seen the contract carefully?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suddenly made Madur feel a cold sweat, he really did not see it, in his opinion, there is no new change in the situation, but Du Lin’s words Let his soul begin to tremble, and this young man gave himself another set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a contract that Du Lin handed over, he grabbed it and widened his eyes and looked at it. There were seven pages of paper. After reading it, His expression is extraordinarily weird, because the contract is not as decisive as he imagined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Du Lin took 100,000 shares in Starlight Brokerage, and holds 53% of the shares, and another 37% All of Madur's, 10% as incentive shares are awarded to employees who have made outstanding contributions to the company. And there is another employment contract in the contract, Madur will continue to serve in Starlight, the time limit is ten years, the liquidated damages up to 10 million, which is exactly the same as his breach of contract with Freina. Not only that, but there is also a clause in the appendix. If Madur leaves with a huge liquidated damages, or Starlight brokerage fails due to poor management, Then Madur will not be allowed to engage in any work related to the entertainment industry for the next 20 years. After that, a lot of related industries are listed. In the end, if you get to that step, he can almost change careers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only lost the company’s power, but also was tied to the Starlight brokerage company, Madur’s mixed feelings, and I don’t know if I should cry now or laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter, because the ladder of dreams is still there, his design for the future, the efforts of operating the company over the years, all the efforts are not completely lost, he is the most Valuable things are still there. And with the addition of Doolin, he believes that Starlight Economics will definitely be more dominant in the future than he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry, because this ladder of dreams is no longer the ladder of his way to heaven, and one person is stepping on the ladder with one foot, one Just stepping on his shoulder makes him have a complex emotion. Five points in the hard work that I made in the future were made for others, and only three points were made for myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
