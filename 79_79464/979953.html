			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin did not wait outside the villa for a long time, Andorra dressed neatly and his son appeared in the door of the villa, neither of them took any arms. Andorra understands that Du Lin can stand here and talk to him and let him out, which means that his men are already finished. If he continues to resist and does not cooperate, it is estimated that it will be difficult to see and die. It is better to go out in a big way, maybe even find a chance to live? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Du Lin, what is going on here?" Du Lin hasn’t spoken yet. Andorra actually spoke first, pointing straight to Du Lin. The night of this night, he seems to be completely shocked by this night attack, and I don't know what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Dooling did not think that Andorra could shamelessly want to reverse black and white in such a scene, but he appreciated the fact that Andorra is facing Failure and danger are desperately trying to reverse the courage of the situation, and his little wisdom. The reason why he said that his wisdom is not much is because he should understand that it is not a wise thing to provoke a better opponent than himself, even if Du Lin did not prove himself in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Averyston was a little annoyed, and he stepped out from behind Du Lin to prepare to "explore" Andorra’s despicable things for him, Du Lin’s Raise your hand and stop Ellis from speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ellis said, telling what happened to him, I am afraid that Andorra can also find some refusal to go back and even pretend to A very innocent look. If it is in other places, at other times, Doolin will not stop Ellis, but the situation is slightly more subtle. Once Andorra retorted, no matter what his reasons were untenable, those employees, those slaves might stand in Andorra's position to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin will not kill these people, he is not the kind of irrational butcher, he will not do anything to those who have no connection. Maybe he has done some things. In addition to the parties, he has also angered the family members of the parties. There is one point that needs to be explained. No matter how many family members he returned to the embrace of God, he would not have the slightest embarrassment from the bottom of his heart, because he did not involve innocent people because of his hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who fight, conflict, kill, and if they win, they and their families will be the first beneficiaries. There is no such thing as a harvest without risk in the world. They win, their families will enjoy the fruits of victory from the body of Doolin, then they fail, and their families must bear the consequences - -death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employees and slaves here are different. If Andorra’s plan is successful, he gets the wealth of Doolin, and he cannot assign these wealth to these employees or even slaves. He will continue to exploit him, and he may continue to exploit it to stabilize his unquestionable authority. These people will not be the beneficiaries of this "war". They have nothing to do with the nature of war, so they are innocent people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who is angered by innocence is not Du Lin’s style! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Airlis’s words were refuted by Andorra, these people may reveal what happened this evening, and people would think that Du Lin’s loss is because Andorra’s words are very reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Du Lin didn’t let Ellis say anything, since the facts of the fait accompli will not change whether he is told or not, but there is a certain The odds make people think that Du Lin is a hypocrite, a small person, it is better to do things directly. Let people be afraid of his fierce name, rather than hate the "hypocrisy" that hates him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is somewhat unclear, so he took a step back, as Dudu often said, the brainstorming thing Doolin did, the hands-on thing they did To do it, Ellis trusts Doolin unconditionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin kicked the stone on the ground and then looked up at Andorra, who was "righteous" and said with a smile: "I am here, that is To find your property, now you have two choices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unconditionally transfer all your property and property to me, or I can't see Put your insignificant property and send you a family to reunite, please choose, Mr. Andorra."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the employees and the slaves watching the original Some smiles of gloating and sorrow suddenly became a bit of awe-inspiring. They didn't even dare to touch Du Lin, and they looked at other places. They thought that Andorra was already vicious and hot enough. I didn't expect that there would be a more powerful one. This kind of person might be the kind of moodiness, and if they did, they would suffer a big loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andorra is in the same place, he has no chance to say it when he has a stomach. If Ellis had just refuted him, he could immediately point out all the "wrong" places. He did not abuse and hurt Ellis and others, and provided them with everything they could enjoy here. Even "imprisonment" can be said to be too late to be afraid of accidents on the road, and they were left with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Du Lin’s words not only blocked his mouth, but even his thoughts were a bit stiff – it’s the same thing as a horse. The purpose of this bastard here is to seize my property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentary change in thinking between the hunter and the prey gives Andorra a very funny, absurd feeling, like he has torn off a girl’s skirt But I saw a huge behemoth, and then I was filled with grievances and anger as I was pressed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his fist and his eyes changed. "You are a crime, the empire will sanction you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sanctions me?", Du Lin couldn't help but laugh. He laughed and walked to Andorra. He could see that Andorra's anger had been exhausted and it was no longer dangerous. The first king and the gods can sanction me, who else can sanction me? Law? Judge? Moral ethics or the will of the people?" Du Lin threw a series of questions and shook his head. "Oh yes, this. There is another thing in the world that can sanction me, that is justice!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And me, it means justice!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was standing in front of Andorra at this time, suddenly picking up his fist and squatting on the gang of Andorra, his head slammed, and the whole man slammed backwards. Two steps, he was helped by his son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin greeted the eyes of the father and son, without any slight avoidance and shaking, his voice became a little cold, "You know this stupid thing." How many people have we died tonight? Seven people, tell you, are seven people! Because your stupidity has made me lose seven brothers, I am now changing my mind, I don't want any wealth of you, I only want your life! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been staring at Andorra in horror, his right hand reaching behind him, his palms up. The Buddha, who had been quietly following him, put the pistol inserted in his waist in the hands of Doolin. Du Lin picked up the pistol and pointed it directly at the son who had been holding Andorra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood soaked Andorra’s face, and his pupils contracted like a needle in a flame and light. Losing the power of support, he leaned back on the ground, leaning his head on the eldest son with a small black hole on his head, his heart cut like a knife, and made a scream of screaming - no! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you reject my goodwill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin went to Andorra On the side of his hand, one foot on the back of his hand, the muzzle in his hand is also facing Andorra. "Now do you understand what happened?", waiting for Andorra to answer, Du Lin suddenly put away the pistol, he shakes Turning around and leaving, while walking, he said, "When the sun rises in the morning, hang him on the whistle tower next to the gate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the morning, there was no extra quietness in the mining area without the mine protection team. No matter whether it was the living area of ​​the staff or the living area of ​​the slave, there was no sound. But the people here are already up. They are all looking at the whistle tower on the left side of the gate. When the first rays of sunlight pierce the cold wind and the darkness, the entire mine area is like alive. People watched a few figures walk to the whistle tower, and then they got a rope and squatted on one's head, pushing him out in the many exclamations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two delivery coaches looked back and took a look back. They were a little uncomfortable at first, and they were all swaying around the wind. If you can come more, you will get used to it, and many slave mines in the west are basically bad. The slaves are not worth the money. Some of the dead will not feel the pain of the miners, but these dead slaves can alert the slaves who are still alive. If they do something wrong, it is their turn to wake up. other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the two coachmen didn’t look carefully at the guy who was constantly twisting his body and screaming and struggling. When their things were neatly arranged, they drove away from the staff living area by car and some new faces. Just as they passed through them and rushed back to the town, one of the coaches looked back at the whistle tower, and he snorted and strangled the reins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another coachman also held the reins and let the carriage stop. "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The man... seems to be Mr. Andorra?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of both of them surrendered to the guy who was no longer struggling under the whistle tower, he was wearing a decent Clothes, the fingers of both hands are embedded between the noose and the neck, and the pale and blue face seems to be quite familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant sun rises completely from the horizon and cuts the entire space into two worlds, light and dark. The light line slowly descends, little by little. Cover all the faces of Andorra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
