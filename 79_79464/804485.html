			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new day is coming, the sun is as bright as yesterday, but I don’t know why Juan always feels a rotten smell in the air. He was locked in this room with only about five square meters. It was the fourth day. Except for the first day, someone asked him if he wanted to explain it through a small window with only a big palm. No one has come to this day. Said a word with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going crazy, licking his hair and letting the pain tell him that he is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the window for food under the iron gate suddenly came to the side, and a bumpy dish contained something like a food for the dog that was lost by someone outside. Come in. Juan immediately rushed to the ground and squatted on the floor. Looking through the small window, he saw a pair of cheap leather shoes, a pair of trousers for no more than ten dollars, and most of his personal shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say something, please, say something!", Juan pleaded, he desperately wanted to talk to whom he once thought When you are older, you will be embarrassed and annoying. But until today he realized how pleasant it was to have someone in his ear. One of the pair of shoes was lifted up, and he sat up decisively, then stared at the window and was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was almost kicked yesterday, so he no longer dared to try the attitude of the people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the food on the ground that made him sick, sighed with a closed eyes, numbly put the plate up, then put his right hand in Wipe the less clean pants, insert them into the slimy wheat paste, and grab a finger-sized potato and stuff it into the mouth. At the beginning, he chose to look up and proud to face the martyrdom that may have been tortured for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly lost his stomach and started eating. He is not a man of great courage and perseverance. He can't guarantee that if he is on a hunger strike, people outside will ignore himself. The taste of these wheat kernel pastes is like a brushed pot of water, with a thick paste, it is difficult to swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished eating, he poured the remaining things on the plate into the toilet in the corner. The first time he ate the junk food, he only ate two. Courage continues to eat, and the second time they directly put the new things in the residual food, so do not overestimate the attitude and quality of these people, this is the experience that Juan summed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently licked the water on the plate and put the plate back under the window. He didn't do it before. He thought that people outside would come in and take away the plate. He also planned to talk to the supervisor about himself. thing. It was not until the second, third or fourth time that the other party gave him food. He realized that he should return the plate to the outside. At the same time, it is also through this incident that he clearly understands that the hunger strike is meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the plate on, and then began to memorize some operas that are not clear enough. He must make his mind normal and not be tortured into a neuropathy. He wants to leave here alive and then find someone to take revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has money, he believes that the judiciary will prove that he is innocent, and after he thaws the money, he will let the people here know when they are angry After a rich man, what kind of ending will they have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if his prayers worked, the iron door suddenly opened, and he stood up fiercely, two young men in formal attire stood at the door Outside, look at him indifferently, "Mr. Juan, please go with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan sorted out some of his dirty clothes and stood tall Going out. Under the "protection" of the two young people, he was sent to a room where a camera was working in the four corners of the room, the tape tray slowly turned, and the red video light was on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit!", the room has a square table with two long tables, and a young man sits on the other side of the square table. It seems that everyone here is very young. He pointed to the only chair opposite, and said the word in a tone with a similar command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huan grinned and sat in the chair, his eyes fixed on the face of the young man, he wanted to take this The face is firmly in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such concern for Juan’s aggressive performance. Amp has seen many people who are more aggressive than Juan, and they have no way to How about yourself, let alone a small rich man in other places? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Amp!", Amp introduced his name in the first sentence, he is not afraid of whether Juan wants to retaliate his own ideas. "Maybe you think you are embarrassed. Of course, after I read all the relevant documents, I also think that you may be embarrassed. But this is meaningless to our current situation. Next I ask, you answer. If your Attitude, your answer makes me unsatisfied, you have to go back to that place and continue to live for a while. Maybe after this case is broken, I will remember that someone is still being there."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp's words made Juan's eyes softer. He did not continue to stare at Amp, and he could say such words without any worries in front of the camera, indicating that Amp was much more powerful than he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first question, do you know Mr. Hoodock?", Amp’s eyes stayed on Juan’s face, he looked at Juan’s memories. After a while, shaking his head and saying no, then asked the second question, "How did you and Mr. Luke know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He came Look for me, deal with Du Lin with me, then I agree with this request, Doolin is his enemy, but also my enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp in The name Du Lin was written on the book, and Juan looked at it. "Is it so spelled?", Juan nodded and said, Amp retracted the book and continued to ask: "You know Mr. Luke is involved in other Does the company's investment behavior? Or did he say that he has a listed company or a similar person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogation work lasted for more than an hour. After the end, Amp sent people back to the cell, and he arranged the transcripts in his hand. Side slowly shook his head. There is no doubt that Juan’s suspicion is not big. He has appeared in front of Amp at a glance from the history of his family’s history. This is a kind of person who is a little bit guilty, at least when he was young. All his life trajectories stayed in Irian, and it was impossible to be strong enough to Hodock and other capital forces. He might have been framed by the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp, who is thinking about the case, did not notice that Clark had come in. He stood by the wall waiting for Amp to finally come back to discover him. I went to the chair where Juan sat down and sat down. "How is this person suspected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp shook his head, "He was implicated The problem should still be in Luke's body, and I think Luke is unlikely to be a participant. He is used as well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark Wrinkle Frowning, "Do you mean that the two people we brought back from Irian are useless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amp smiled, "No, Luke Very useful. I think Luke has seen the participants in this fraud case, even the mastermind, so he will be dragged down by that person. He and the person absolutely have contradictions or differences, from the confession that Juan just confessed, I think this person called Doolin has certain suspicions, but the only trouble is that until now, we have not had any straight Or indirect evidence can accuse the person. Without evidence, there is no way to summon him, unless we can get even indirect evidence, we better not to alarm him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
