			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city, a city of 8 million people, will never lack those who are full of ambition and unwillingness, who are dreaming of dreams Desire, the pursuit of ideals, resolutely chose to start a business. No money? It doesn't matter, the imperial central bank provides loan services. As long as you have something to gain, even if it is a table, the bank will value these things and give a fair price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the many collaterals, except for a handful of antiques, most things are real estate. Entrepreneurship requires money and requires a lot of money. There seems to be nothing to raise more mortgages than the property. If the auction does not involve the industry of Juan, the auction will be auctioned on the dock in the spring of next year. At that time, people from all over the city could participate. It was not how close the banks were, but their bids were only of interest to ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this time there is an industry in Juan, it is possible to bring so many rich people together with the reputation of Juan, which is equivalent to giving the bank a chance to Those cheap things have a chance to sell a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first auction item is an old-fashioned pendulum clock, which was appraised by experts and was the decoration of a small aristocratic family during the imperial period. Although it is not worth any money, it still has a little bit of value behind it, for example, this thing is a noble thing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say how abominable the aristocrats are, how rotten the nobility is, but people are incomparably longing for the nobility, and the rule of the monarchy for thousands of years has made the nobles "It has been engraved in the bones of people, not easily erased." In Irian, it’s a little better. In the northern cities, the rich have a special liking for the things that the nobility used. Even the castles where the nobles live can often sell sky-high prices. Even when they have money, they may not be able to buy them. To the point of arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks often hold auctions, so knowing the proper heat field can be a good stimulus for the next auction process. Such a clock that was estimated by experts to be 6,000 pieces, and finally sold for 122,000 pieces, can not say how much the price, can only say that the bidder bought a satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all kinds of things coming along, of course, the bank will also have the option to add something, those who can’t attract the attention of the rich. None of the things were taken out, and those were the auctions after the Spring Festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen or so small plots of land were quickly taken out. For the city of Irian, everyone agreed that there is great potential. With the groundbreaking of the eighth district, once completed, Irian will have a huge The soaring. Land price is a barometer of urban economic development. This year's transaction price has increased by 20% compared with last year, which is enough to explain the problem. In addition, the land is not like an antique, it may not be sold. The land is better than anything. This is an investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction time is not long, it has come to an end in more than two hours, the host standing on the auction stage is excited and the people come out An auction, a manor outside the outer ring of the second district, the original owner is Juan. This manor is well managed. After all, he sometimes goes there to rest, so bidders can stay directly without having to invest a penny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of people interested in this estate, but everyone is obsessed with Juan’s face, not very embarrassed to the first placard, which makes people think it is A move to fall down the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin didn’t have that much concern. He lifted his hand and refused to look back at Juan, who was looking at him. He stabbed him. You won't blame me? In fact, even if I don't buy it, there will be other people to buy it. I saw it last time, the environment is good, there are some harmless animals around, you can go hunting nearby in the fall, than me. That's a lot better." He smiled back and turned around, no matter how much Juan couldn't wait to eat him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Du Lin as an example, everyone soon began to placard, and Juan realized at this time that his prestige was far less powerful than he had imagined. . He has gone bankrupt, he is finished, then these people do not need to take care of his face under the leadership of Doolin, which makes him feel very uncomfortable, but he must stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last manor was taken by Bill, and he did not forget to thank other rich people. Most of the rich people present have their own estates, but Bill does not. He is engaged in the entertainment industry. His majesty has three bars and a few places where he is often prone to sweating and afraid of heat. His foundation is shallower than the ones present. However, this guy's mouth is very sweet, he can talk very much, and everyone has nothing to look down on his thoughts. Anyway, as long as he can fill his pockets with money, who will take care of where your money comes from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the manor, and it was the result of everyone’s intention to give up. There is a man’s lazy shot, no manor and no plan to live in someone else’s house. Juan has a hatred, except for Du Lin is Bill. The wine at Bill Bar was originally from the workshop of Juan. The relationship between the two was quite good. Later, because of a small thing - the problem of the money was a conflict, Bill took the wine from other people, and Juan has nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave it to him this time, and he happened to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Juan’s villas, homes, shops, luxury cars and many luxury items were auctioned one by one, and many people got what they wanted. Things are precisely the behavior of their eager bidding, and the more stinging of Juan’s heart. He has such a moment of confusion, is he really so unpopular in Irian? Why are you falling, do these people hate not to score their own industry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are almost the same, and finally came to the focus of this auction, which is Juan’s bar and brewery workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Lin’s first placard, he had the idea of ​​running an intelligence network, and there is no doubt that the bar is the most suitable place. The place with the most intelligence transactions in the entire empire is in the bar. There are many people here, and sometimes people who have secrets in their hearts need to release their pressure. If they say they can drink too much, then they will comfort the "goodwill" of the bartender. I said what I should not say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of this bar in Juan is very good, just at the intersection of Dawn Avenue and the beach, it is arguably the best place, no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people who bid for the bar, Alexander also inserted, and Bill. He used to be a bar business. He has been hot on Juan's bar for a long time. Now, how can he not force the money into it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original as long as 150,000 bars, was smashed by a few people to 730,000, of which Juan also cited several brands, but unfortunately people did not He was merciless to him, and he was cold-faced and did not raise any cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Du Lincai’s atmosphere is a bit rough, and he took the bar at 73. It’s a bit of a loss, but it’s not a good one. It can be solved, so the money spent is a little more, in essence, it is earned, and the loss will lose some money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next big thing is, Juan’s brewing workshop, when the auctioneer didn’t even finish the last sentence, Du Lin raised the brand in his hand. Calmly shouted out the price of a whole auction site that could not return to God for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One Million!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound in the auction hall, everyone knows that selling wine can Making money, Juan is also an example. Can you shout a million when you come up? Is it too much? Some people want to placard, but when they think of Juan's request with grief, they still have not raised their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
